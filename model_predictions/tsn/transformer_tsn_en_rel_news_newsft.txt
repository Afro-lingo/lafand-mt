The Democratic Alliance (DA) has explained an unacceptable and understanding law that deprives South Africans of their citizenship.
Following a complaint from residents living in London, when they try to subdue their South African citizenship, they realize that they are no longer citizens of South Africa because they have asked for citizenship.
This is because, under the Edict of citizenship in South Africa of this time, he has to apply to the Home Department to obtain permission for the citizenship of another country.
In any case, DA Adrian Roos says the party is against the Law, and it will fight it at the highest court in place of thousands of South Africans who lost their citizenship outside their knowledge.
DA is challenging this in court.
It is not a comprehensive rule as the Department of Civilization once argued that it was not against the citizenship of two countries.
But it is your law, do not say you support the citizenship of two countries.
When you look at the temporary Constitution, you say that no resident will live outside the support of the law, but this has been changed in the Constitution.
They have dismissed the words without saying that this right should not be implemented to prevent you from being rejected by your citizenship.
So the DA contest is that no matter what it is, you have to have a chance to leave your citizenship before it is lost, says Roos.
Below, the final diplomatic discussions of DA Adrian Roos.

He said the heroes of military personnel from former rehabilitation parties struggled to clarify their identity.
You must also try to groom ourselves, we do not want these groups among you because we do not understand why you are fighting.

This is not good for the nation.

The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is led by Nquthu’s municipal municipality in Nquthu region North of KwaZulu-Natal to deliver the provincial Department to court because it is under administration.
The resolution was made by MEC of COGTA, Sipho hlomuka on Thursday.
He quoted current joint statements and the rulings of a high court that the inappropriate appointment of other executives of the flesh was inaccurate.
Nquthu council said that MEC has no authority to place municipality under the administration.
The decision to challenge Hlomuka’s footprints was taken during the Thursday Commission, the day after the province of the Constitutional Department announced the municipality of the municipality.
In February, the provincial government placed the municipality under the administration.
But the decision was reversed by National Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
He said there was no valid reason for putting the municipality under the administration.
I think this is not true, but it is MEC strategy because in March of March Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma contradicts the COGTA decision in the provincial provincial provincial process.
Dlamini- Zuma, so you have reminded that the provincial government is linked to Part 139A, which means they can monitor, direct, and help the municipality.
But the COGTA of KZN did not do so.
Yes, we have found the profits of the butterflies, just the reasons for that, the previous managements, if they left with valuable information and which was needed for the construction processes, said Lindokuhle Shabalala.

The Interim Provincial Congress Chairperson, Thamsan Ntuli said the ANC wanted to move Nquthu’s municipal Municipal Municipality despite the loss of elections in the area.
All of us know that IFP and the ANC are doing well in Johannesburg City alone in KZN is a different matter.
That is why he sees a list that is opposed to all our municipalities in the province of KZN.
We are concerned about the conduct of COGTA and COGTA Chief Executive who allows Nquthu’s ANC councillors to direct COGTA’s actions, which is very disappointing.
The IFP has also been disappointed by the ANC after giving the name of one of the regional institutions in the province to the north, the name of the host, late Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.
Once, this action will postpone forgiveness negotiations between the two parties that were stored by the leaders of both parties to the primacy.
President David Mabuza has confirmed to the military heroes that the government does not have money in his hand to hand only the government has money to care for their social needs and health needs.
He says the problem was the Security Department and Sesole Gangers, lacking a system to deal with their problems.
When he stood up to the military heroes, Mabuza said things would begin to go well because the office of the director of the Department has been appointed.
We still continue with provincial discussions and Sesole heroes.
Today we are in Limpopo on the plain of Rakabi the Poloky and we are welcomed by the prime minister, Stanley Mathabatha.
He has asked the military heroes to form a single champion rather than fight with them.
We are still going to repair the Army Department.
I can tell you that the director of the Commissioner [Irene Mpoiwenið in the department has already been appointed.
You are going to start work on the 7th of June.
Now things will start to unify.

You are a society that continues to be small.
You are a growing society.
So why should adults see it ?
MKVA and the military council, you have to go and resolve your problems immediately.
This is unsuitable for the nation, adds Mabuza.
SABC speaks to Limpo Lulamile Jack.
In KwaZulu-Natal Centre and Culture Department has directed the Inkosi Langalibalele Cadre Deployment Speaker to investigate the charges of the attack against the councillor.

I have a case to answer.
I am going to get out of my situation now.
People will respect this and I think the ANC should let this and encourage this to happen.
Not only with Mkhize, all its members face serious charges because this is the only way to cleanse the party’s name and restore citizens’s honesty when they appear to live up to this rule.

Act of 108 Parliament of 1996.
It’s the highest law in the world.
So every other law that is not in harmony with the Constitution is not at work unless it is prepared to pass the evaluation of the Constitutional Constitutional Examination.
The Bill of Rights in Chapter 2 is still the basis for democracy as it has been warned in the Constitution.
It is a region that makes it necessary to protect personal dignity, the right of life, freedom of speech, balance, secrecy, religious freedom, freedom of faith and thought.
Other freedoms include political rights, business liberation, jobs and educators.
However, all rights are based on standards
Adjusting most of the Bill requires most of the two-thirds.
One example requires two-thirds to be a legal statement of property, a statement below 25 of the Constitutional Constitution.
It’s underline that Part 25 has been dedicated where allotments and property have been donated.
Of course, the legal statement is developed by the temporary committee to renovate Part 25 of the Constitutional Constitution to let the world’s exclusion unpaid.
Part 25 Development is currently being carried out under the institution of the 18th Inquiry Constitution.
This means that it is the 18th amendment of South Africa that is being renovated.

Report on lando Nomoyi.
Palement celebrated the 25th year of the constitutional constitution.
The last constitution has been adopted in December 1996 and has been applied in January 1997.
Palement held a meeting today to remind himself of its customs and regulations.
It is praised as a fine constitution of the world and is stronger to the human rights and dignity that follow the years of college discrimination and discrimination, the South African generation of Apex comes with a variety of answers.
Twenty-five cases since the constitutional recognition of South Africa’s constitutional law, the lawyers of the country still disagree with its quality.
While most political parties have described the success of their achievements, some consider it to be a source of oppression and possessions.
Two Parliaments held the contest to commemorate 25 years of legal recognition.
In 1996, South Africa’s Parliament held a meeting of the General Assembly to receive its new constitution.
At the stage recommended, the former president of the country has been able to deliver a lecture by the official official official document.
Two and a half years, most South Africans are afraid of this generation, which they call the living structure of their hopes and desires.
Rescue agency.
In the argument, the minister of international relations and cooperation Naledi Pandor, glorifies those who have taken part in writing the constitutional constitution.
He has praised the leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) movement; such as the late Zola Skweyiya and Kader Asmal for the important role they played.
Pandor says party leaders; such as King Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Democratic Alliance James Selfe (DA), Kenneth Meshoe of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) have also played a useful role.
Pandor, who took part in a joint debate, says the party is connecting the people in the country in a way that another legal circle will not connect them.
Those who have created our constitution may be millions.
Not just those who attended a constitutional meeting.
It is not for just a few.
It is our freedom to honor Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou Toure.
We in parliament and government, have a key role in honoring men and women and millions of others.
We have to continue to make sure that the positions of public service are respectable to say Pandor.
Looking back at the 25 years of constitutional constitutionality, South African political parties are infected.
Some of the self-appointed inquisitors in the country were still young when the constitution was consented.
And it looks they hold it up.
One of DA Natasha Mazzone’s mainstays says those who want to defy this generation are ignored.
He said it was the duty of all members of parliament who once swore to the Constitution.
So it is very important that when the governing party is despised, we should view it as a strategy to overthrow the government.
We cannot have high-ranking politicians to make statements that the Constitution is being discriminated or not going to be considered, or more. What is more troubling is
We must have the same pressure in these languages and have the power to take them to their right place in prison to speak Mazzone
Although Buthelezi has entrusted the leadership of the IFP party to the new leaders, the young remains to be seen by most of his members as a politician whose reminders are respected.
He says although he did not enjoy some of the charms of the Constitutional Constitution , he rejoices over the party’s role in his essay.
EFF marks the Constitutional Constitutional
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says the South African Constitution has done nothing to reverse black oppression.
The movement says it’s true that they have protected those who have stolen from oppression, while millions of blacks are still living under a deep need.
EFF Chairperson Ntombovuyo Mente says the party will not rest until the Constitution is revised to let the land be deposited without payment.
It lists similar values between the demands of many lives that have been deprived of their shares and the interests of a small number of those who are getting away.
It reflects on the world and on you, those who have been persecuted live in peace with their persecutors, without seeing and justice and accepting past wrongs.
It refers to recognizing past injustices and also protecting those who have committed these injustices and their children, says Mente.
How have governments and South Africa maintained the values of the Constitutional Constitution ?
The address of a united security committee has called the minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to appear before her to answer the charges of corruption.

The U Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Homisa has issued allegations to the committee, saying someone has given him information.
Mapisa-Nqakula wrote to the committee to refute allegations.
However, the coordinator of the committee Elleck Nchabeleng says they need to get more information from the minister who gave the news.
We first start by working and finding time to communicate with the minister so that we can get his answers.
But then we might ask questions.
We need information, such as a statement or affidavit, to know that someone wrote something about us.
We need something visible from this person.
Holomisa refers to minister Mapisa-Nqakula on five million cases of disgrace.
In April, Democratic Alliance (DA) called President Cyril Ramaphosa to form an urgent investigation on the charges that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula had destroyed millions of taxpayers by paying airplanes and luxuries.
The Society says; he must be suspended without payment, there is still a probability of investigations.
DA National Security Minister Kobus Marais says the evidence has been handed over to a combination of security committees and produces a fraction of five factors that can no doubt be viewed in Map-Nqakula.

The charges of an irregular contract between the Department of Health and Digital Vibes.
Political analyst of the irregular Tessa Dooms has raised questions about the truth of Mkhize after denying participation in a multimillion-dollar contract for her department.
Tahera Mather, former Mkhize and assistant of the past Naadhira Mitha, are reported to control the Digital Vibes Foundation, although both see it on the list as guests.
Doom says it is difficult to believe Mkhize, since she contradicted herself in the media.
It is hard to believe him if he has contradicted himself at a press conference.
He said he did not know until the time came to know that he had taken part when he was planning a meeting to do a job that was paid, so he realized at one point.
But then, it would be a higher guarantee that the position of the work should be done in his office and not have any light on it.

Isolation and neutrality
Because of a statement made in court, lawyer Mpofu told the office that Zuma believes that Spokesperson Downer needs to be independent and reasonable.
There are reasons and circumstances that give me a lot of hearing that Downer was acting independently and neutral, which is important in the law process.
Downer has failed to support the circumstances needed to protect the regime so that my trial will be corrected according to the Constitution.
Downer has made himself a pack to me when he filled thefidafiti with the support of democracy, a request to examine and prod the NPA decision to end my trial.
Curlewis says judge Piet Koen will be put in position to listen to a special request for accountability to the charge and trial as a judge, saying it falls on the proceedings of the trial.
No, that is not possible.

If a special appeal is to show a goal, it is the only time that the accused can be expected to render official account for the charge, and then it will be called by the form of a request that is guilty or not.
In this regard, he doesn " t feel guilty.
There are no complications in a special request,
Basically 1 H, where they want to get out of the country’s park to cross-examine.

Curlewis describes the service that follows after judge Koen handed the sentence to one another, perhaps not
If the protection is right with their application for responsibility, and the office supports it, I repeat, according to what I have seen in our journalist and athetics and the authorities in the matter will not succeed, but let us think they are going to succeed by continuing to look at a matter in the court where they are connected and then they are chargeded with a letter.
Ask 1 HE, I say Freely, I’m hobby, I’m honoured, I’m going to be in charge, the court has to issue its climax after a request
