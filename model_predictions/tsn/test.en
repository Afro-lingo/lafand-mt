Despite the many challenges they face, some, like Lazarious Ramolotja have beaten the odds and succeeded to establish their own companies.
Ramolotja is one of over more than two million deaf people in the country.
He says deaf people struggle daily to meaningfully participate in the economy.
The 43-year-old father of three runs a welding business.
He shares his story with us, with the help of a professional interpreter, Sebone Kgethe.
My name is Lazarious Ramolotja.
I stay in a village called Seweding in Mahikeng.
I am a father of three.
I started welding many years ago.
I now have my own company.
With his skills clearly outweighing his disability, Ramolotja has found a way to communicate with his clients.
He says there’s no communication barrier.
Deaf people around here don’t have businesses.
So, I thought to myself that I should have my own business.
It does not matter.
If there is a communication barrier, there is a pen and paper.
It doesn’t mean I need an interpreter all the time.
People know that I am deaf and can see that I am deaf, and they can also see that I am a skilled person.
I want to see deaf people having their own businesses, he says.
According to the World Health Organisation, over 5% of the world’s population has disabling hearing loss.
Access to education and job opportunities remain key challenges for the deaf community.
COVID-19 has also proven a big barrier for the deaf community.
Interpreting coronavirus messaging has become an uphill battle.
Ramolotja says he still doesn’t understand much about the virus.
COVID-19, I felt the pinch of it. I suffered a lot
As a deaf person, I do not know much about this coronavirus.
The hearing people can hear for themselves but for deaf people, it is a challenge.
We suffer, he says.
Sebone Kgethe parents are deaf.
She is also a professional sign language interpreter.
She agrees that deaf people face socioeconomic barriers daily.
The deaf community is urging government to speed up the process of making sign language an official language.
Messages of congratulations continue to pour in for South African Netflix documentary, My Octopus Teacher, which has won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature at the 93rd Academy Awards Ceremony in Los Angeles.
Industry professionals have lauded the team for winning the highest accolade in international film.
The film has bagged a host of other international film awards, and has won over hearts and minds worldwide.
Award-winning film producer, Anant Singh, explains why this award is great for the industry.
It’s great for the industry because you’ve got a little film which is a documentary that competes in the best and the highest platform of world cinema and that wins in the best Oscar in the documentary category
You know filmmakers are making documentaries from little films on their iphones and this gives them huge inspiration to continue and be passionate about story-telling.
Craig has been a passionate story-teller of documentaries and such a wonderful person who does great work and we are very fortunate to have worked with him 8 or 10 years ago.
The documentary is a collaboration driven by the Sea Change Project, an NGO which raises awareness of the beauty and ecological importance of South Africa’s kelp forest.
The team is proud of the global recognition.
It’s such a great platform for the work that were doing at the sea change project we’ve really focussed on the great African sea forest.
Our mission is to continue telling stories about this wonderful ecosystem so it can inspire and create awe in other people to want to protect nature, to want to relate to nature to want to immerse themselves in nature this is what we hope for people to remember that you are wild, that you are nature that this beautiful planet is your home that is really what we were trying to say in the film how wild places and wild animals are precious and that we all belong here, says Swati Thiyagarajan from the sea Change Project.
In an earlier interview with SABC News, the star of the film Foster said the Octopus taught him that nature and human beings are woven from the same cloth and thread.
And that each needs the other in order to survive on planet Earth.
President Cyril Ramaphosa says the film has opened a window into the natural beauty and diversity of South Africa’s oceans and marine ecosystems.
Congratulations once again to the production team of MyOctopusTeacher for winning Best Documentary Feature at the Oscars.
Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has also congratulated the team.
South African film producer, Anant Singh, has hailed Oscar winning documentary, My Octopus Teacher, as a passionate ode to conservation by filmmaker, Craig Foster.
Foster’s film won Best Documentary at the 93rd Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles.
The Netflix original documents his experiences with a young octopus that he keeps track of for a year.
The two eventually form a bond, allowing Foster to see the animal’s underwater world through her eyes.
Singh says Foster’s win has inspired a new generation of film makers.
Filmmakers are making documentaries from their iPhone’s and this gives them huge inspiration to continue and be passionate about storytelling.
Craig has been a passionate storyteller of documentaries and such a wonderful person who does great work.
We were very fortunate to work with him on a film about 8 or 10 years ago, he adds.
Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, has congratulated the winners of the South Africa Netflix documentary for bagging the award.
Winde says the country is proud of the achievement.
I would really like to say on behalf of our government in the Western Cape, to everyone involved in the making of the film, My Octopus Teacher, congratulations.
You make us so proud.
It really was an amazing feat in winning that Oscar.
Craig Foster says he is deeply honoured to receive this accolade.
The 2020 Netflix original by Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed documents a year spent by filmmaker Craig Foster forging a relationship with a wild, common octopus in a South African kelp forest in False Bay near Cape Town.
Filmmakers James Reed and Pippa Ehrlich accepted the honour.
I know there are many South Africans who are awake in the middle of the night to watch this ceremony and in many ways, this really is a tiny personal story that played out in a sea forest at the very tip of Africa.
But on a more universal level, I hope that it provided a glimpse of different types of relationships between human beings and the natural world.
Reed has called the win an honour and thanked the Academy and family for their support.
He also made special mention of the subject of the film, South African Craig Foster, who formed an underwater bond with the Octopus.
The documentary has already scooped a number of awards in 2020 including two wins at the Critics’ Choice Documentary Awards for Best Science/Nature Documentary and Best Cinematography.
It also scooped the Grand Teton Award at the Jackson Wild Media Awards where it received 8 nominations.
It also won the Best Feature Film Award at the EarthX film festival.
In the video below, My Octopus Teacher nominated for Oscar award:
Hollywood stars started arriving for the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday on what could be a historic night packed with surprises, not just around the winners but the event itself.
Sound of Metal first-time nominee Paul Raci was among the first to walk a scaled-down red carpet outside the Mission Revival-style Union Station in Los Angeles, which is being used for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Raci, who plays a mentor to a deaf drummer, used sign language on Sunday as he spoke to reporters and said he hoped the film had called attention to the deaf community.
Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom actor Colman Domingo sported ane on pink suit, while songwriter Diane Warren chose a white pantsuit with a sparkling turtleneck.
I’m here at the Oscars, Warren said.
A more subdued Oscars but were still at the Oscars.
Social distancing and travel restrictions forced a complete rethink of the ceremony, which will be attended by just a few hundred nominees and presenters, including Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford, and held both outdoors and indoors at the Art Deco Union Station in Los Angeles.
Other nominees will join by satellite from international venues.
After strict testing and quarantine protocols, most celebrities were not wearing masks on the first major live red carpet after months of award shows on Zoom.
We just want the whole thing, right out of the gate, to announce itself as being different, Steven Soderbergh, one of a trio of producers, said ahead of Sundays show.
Hollywood’s drive for diversity over the past five years could lead to all four acting prizes, as well as the best director trophy, going to people of color for the first time in the 93-year history of the highest honors in the movie business.
If Zhao, 39, wins best director, she will be only the second woman and the first Asian woman to clinch the Academy Award in that field.
The Trial of the Chicago 7, which is set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War protests, is seen as the strongest challenger to Nomadland for best picture, awards experts say.
It is probably the most traditional Oscar movie.
It’s got a lot of big colourful performances and historical relevance, said Alison Willmore, film critic at New York magazine.
The other best picture nominees are 1930s Hollywood drama Mank, which led with 10 nominations; revenge tale Promising Young Woman, Korean immigrant family story Minari, civil rights biopic Judas and the Black Messiah, dementia tale The Father and Sound of Metal about a deaf drummer.
The winners are chosen in a secret ballot by the 9,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The race for lead actress is wide open, with Frances McDormand (Nomadland), Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman), Viola Davis (Ma Raineys Black Bottom), Vanessa Kirby (Pieces of a Woman) and Andra Day (The United States vs. Billie Holiday) competing for the prize.
The best actress race is fascinating.
We’ve had a different winner in every televised awards show, said Pete Hammond, awards columnist at Deadline Hollywood.
The late Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman, 43, appears to be in line for his first Oscar, for his final film role in Ma Raineys Black Bottom.
But Britain’s Anthony Hopkins, who plays a man struggling with dementia in The Father, could be rewarded, while Riz Ahmeds deaf punk drummer in Sound of Metal is seen as another possible best actor winner.
For the first time since the pandemic struck, not one, but two movies brought in notable ticket sales at the domestic box office.
It’s the clearest indication yet that people appear ready to return to the movies after nearly a year of staying home to stream.
Mortal Kombat, a martial arts-inspired adaptation of the popular video game, led US box office charts, taking in a robust $22.5 million from 3 073 North American venues.
The Warner Bros. movie is already available to watch at home, on the streaming service HBO Max, for a month a strategy the studio is deploying for its entire 2021 slate.
Though the R-rated Mortal Kombat easily cinched first place, it had more competition than it may have expected heading into the weekend.
In a not-so-distant second, Demon Slayer
Mugen Train earned a solid $15.9 million from 1 598 locations.
South Africa’s COVID-19 cases amid the third wave has broken the 13 000 mark.
The Health Department says 13 246 cases were reported overnight, which represents a 21.7% positivity rate.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, this is the highest number of daily cases and positivity rate since January.
Health activist Dr Kgosi Letlape reacts to rising COVID-19 numbers: The country now has 1 774 312 coronavirus cases since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020.
Hundred and 36 new fatalities were reported overnight, taking the total national death toll to 58 223.
The NICD is urging South Africans to remain vigilant and follow prevention measures as diligent as possible to help stop the spread.
It is also calling on young South Africans to assist the elderly register for vaccinations.
So far, 1 965 812 South Africans have received their COVID-19 shots.
Nigeria is expecting a second shipment of nearly 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines by early august, and plans to resume giving out first doses, which had been halted to save its supply for second doses.
Africa’s most populous nation has so far given the first dose to only around 2 million of its 200 million people.
Nigeria has been rationing 3.92 million doses it received through the COVAX global vaccine sharing programme in March, with its future supplies put in doubt by an export ban from India.
Nigeria now expects the second shipment of 3.92million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine by the end of July or early August.
Vaccination centres will be reopened to adults over the age of 18 seeking first doses, he said.
We have been inundated with requests by Nigerians to be vaccinated, Shuaib said at a media briefing in Abuja.
He did not specify where the new doses would come from but pointed to a commitment last week by G7 leaders to deliver at least 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the world over the next year.
Vaccine hesitancy rooted in misinformation is also a problem.
The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) says it feels disappointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on Tuesday regarding governments response to the increase of coronavirus infections in the country.
Denosa says it had hoped the President would announce stricter regulations to curb the spread of the virus.
Denosa’s acting general-secretary, Cassim Lekhoathi, says nurses are overwhelmed by the workload in hospitals because of the increased number of COVID-19 patients, and that more nurses are dying from the virus.
Patients are increasing and the number of staff are decreasing because there is no replacement as we bury, like this weekend I am going to bury three of our nurses, they are not going to be replaced.
And I am not just talking about those that I am going to bury this weekend, I am talking about those who are already infected who are in isolation, and the few that have to remain behind in the wards, they have to carry on with the load.
Many healthcare workers have received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
South Africa moves to lockdown alert level 3:
A total of 339 healthcare workers died of COVID-19 related illness in South Africa between March and November last year, with most deaths occurring in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng
President Cyril Ramaphosa says despite the setbacks with the COVID-19 vaccine roll out in the country, the pace is picking up with up to 85 000 people now being vaccinated daily.
Government has also received an indication from Johnson and Johnson that the 2 million doses that had to be destroyed at Aspens plant in Gqeberhawill be replaced by the end of the month.
Ramaphosa says a statistic that provides hope is that only 64 healthcare workers have been infected in the last seven days compared to 640 at a similar point in the second wave.
South Africa moves to lockdown alert level 3: Meanwhile, DA leader John Steenhuisen has criticised the pace of the country’s vaccination programme, saying governments plans to innoculate a large percentage of the nation are not yet clear.
The president said while the vaccination programme was gaining momentum, South Africa was far from reaching population immunity.
Steenhuisen has raised questions over governments pace in procuring vaccines.
I think government has a lot to answer for.
The president is very good at throwing out big numbers but never explaining how we are going to get there.
There is clearly a problem with governments procurement of the vaccine that has left many South Africans at great risk of contracting the virus.
It would not have been if we had a successful vaccination programme.
Some people will pay for governments failure with their lives.
The Health Departments Director General, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, says the health sector is better-prepared for further hospital admissions amid the third wave of the coronavirus.
President Cyril Ramaphosa made the announcement on Tuesday night that the country had moved to lockdown level 3.
He has raised concerns over several provinces reporting a consistent rise in COVID-19 infections with Gauteng being the worst hit.
Buthelezi says the health sector has taken lessons from the first and second wave of the coronavirus on ways to treat patients:
I think we have learned quite a lot from the 1st and 2nd waves.
Certain provinces are taking strain such as Gauteng.
South Africa has recorded 8 436new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of infections to 1 761 066.
Two hundred and eight COVID-19-related deaths were also reported in the last 24-hour cycle, pushing the national death toll to 58 087.
The President briefed the nation on Tuesday night after a meeting with various stakeholders, including the National Coronavirus Command Council.
The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) has dispatched a task team to the area of KwaHlathi near Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal to conduct a proper inspection of a site where stones believed to be diamonds have been found.
The task team includes geological and mineral experts.
News of the purported discovery of diamonds spread across the country on Friday and people are still flocking to the area to dig for the stones.
The team from DMRE is expected to be on site from Tuesday and that will include the Departments Enforcement and Compliance unit to conduct an inspection of the site.
The team also includes experts from the Council for Mineral Technology (Mintek) and the Council for Geoscience who can give an opinion about the mineral composition of rocks, and can provide an analysis of an areas potential for mineral resources, respectively.
After the analysis, a formal technical report will be issued in due course.
The traditional communities, local and district municipalities, have been asked to restore calm to the area.
The community of KwaHlathi say if it is realdiamonds, Black people must get first preference in terms of economic opportunities.
The residents add that the discovery of the stones goes to show the value of a field of study like Geology.
So, they must start now to study these studies (sic), says community member, Thabani Mbatha.
Another resident, Vuma Makhwasa, says: The status of the area is likely to change socially and economically if it is real gold.
But the government must make sure that Black people are not only employees, but they have equal shares, as a means of economic empowerment.
People are literally picking up diamonds from the ground in KZN, Ladysmith, KwaHlathi.
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has released the latest coronavirus data which shows that Gauteng accounts for more than two-thirds of the new cases.
Gauteng has registered over 3 700 new coronavirus cases of the national figure of over 5 500.
South Africa entered the third wave of the pandemic just over a week ago.
Unpacking increasing COVID-19 cases in Gauteng with Prof. Bruce Mellado:
The South African pharmaceutical manufacturer, Aspen, says it is taking steps to mitigate the loss of the Johnson and Johnson vaccines stored at its Gqeberha plant in the Eastern Cape.
The manufacturer says Johnson and Johnson will, within days, provide 300 000 doses of the vaccine for South African teachers.
Aspen adds that within a week it expects to release Johnson and Johnson vaccines manufactured from ingredients that are not impacted by the contamination of vaccines in the US.
The company says it is also busy producing more doses of the vaccine that are set to be available in July.
The vaccines were affected by contamination issues at a US vaccine plant in Baltimore.
On Sunday, government and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) assured South Africans that the contaminated doses will not be released in the country.
Sahpra CEO, Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela speaking about contaminated J&J vaccines:
The company’s move follows reports that some batches waiting to be distributed from the Gqeberha Aspen plant had been contaminated.
The two main hospitals treating people with COVID-19 in Afghanistan have had to close their doors to new patients because of a lack of beds, a senior health official and doctors said on Monday.
Afghanistan is grappling with a third wave of the pandemic, with a record number of infections and deaths being reported amid a surge in violence as US-led international forces withdraw and Taliban insurgents go on the offensive.
Both Afghan Japan and Ali Jinnah hospitals had to close their doors because they had no more beds or resources, the health official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.
The official said the two hospitals, both in the capital Kabul, were facing persistent shortages of oxygen and other medical supplies.
Mirwais Alizay, deputy health ministry spokesperson, said hospitals had close sometimes due to higher patient numbers
Masi Noori, a doctor at Afghan Japan hospital, said it had been closed to new patients for several days because it had run out of beds.
Eid Wali, head of Ali Jinnah hospital, said it had to stop taking new patients when its COVID-19 beds were full.
We only have 50 beds for COVID cases, that’s the main problem, Wali told Reuters.
Afghanistan reported on Monday 1 804 new COVID-19 cases and 71 deaths from the disease.
Human rights group Amnesty International said last week the government needed to immediately procure more oxygen and vaccines.
Afghanistan’s COVID-19 case numbers have been steadily increasing, said Zaman Sultani, the groups South Asia researcher.
Last week, Afghanistan received 700 000 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine made by Chinas Sinopharm.
Health experts say the shortages of vaccine doses in South Africa pose a big challenge in terms of the roll-out programme.
Epidemiologist Professor Salim Abdool Karim says the Johnson and Johnson batches that have been disposed off is a major blow to the country’s efforts to increase the number of vaccinations per day.
Sahpra CEO Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela is pleading with South Africans not to panic as there are emergency plans in place.
Sahpra confirmed that 300 000 doses that have been approved by the US Food & Drug Administration will be released for shipment to SA.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will now be stored for four-and-half months instead of three months at a temperature of 2.8 degrees Celsius.
Retired geologist from Durban, Manqoba Msimango, says he cannot rule out the authenticity of the recent discovery of what some believe to be diamonds in the KwaHlathi area outside Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal.
Msimang says only a team of geologists can confirm if these are indeed diamonds.
The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) as well as the Acting Minister of Health Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane have assured South Africans that the contaminated COVID-19 vaccine doses will not be released in South Africa.
This after it emerged that some batches waiting to be distributed from the Gqeberha Aspen plant in the Eastern Cape had been contaminated.
Based on what has been announced by the FDA we are affected in terms of those batches there at Gqeberha site and what we have there on site is 2 million.
I think South African citizens should not panic and what we will receive and use, would be approved.
The US Food and Drug Authority (FDA) halted the release of all J&J vaccines from the plant pending an investigation.
Countries should avoid giving the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to people over 60, the head of the EU drug regulators COVID-19 task force was quoted on Sunday as saying, amid fears over rare blood clotting and as more vaccines become available.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) considers the AstraZeneca shot safe for all age groups.
The Italian government said on Friday it would restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting.
Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations in March over concerns about the rare blood clotting problems.
South Africa and India, backed by many emerging nations, want a temporary waiver of IP rights on vaccines and other treatments to allow local manufacturers to produce shots.
US President Joe Biden has said he backs a temporary waiver.
Okonjo-lweala said the debate had moved ahead with the agreement to start the negotiations.
WTO members are due to discuss next week the format of negotiations with a view to producing a report by July 21-22.
The G7 leaders, holding a summit in south west England, agreed on Friday to donate 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries, something the United Nations and campaign groups said fell short of what is needed.
Separately, Okonjo-Iweala said she was hoping for a significant advance in talks on fishery subsidies by July even if we dont get to a conclusion which is quite possible.
She is due to host a meeting of WTO member countries on July15 to try to cut fisheries subsidies after 20 years of talks.
The month of June is no ordinary month in South Africa, especially for its youth.
It is a reminder of the Heroes and Heroines of 1976, who made history during this month.
The 16th of June 1976 South Africa saw an uprising where thousands of students in Soweto started a march against the Bantu Education System, which compelled Black student to learn in Afrikaans.
On the fateful day of June, students were to have a peaceful march to Orlando Stadium as a sign of resistance against the new language policy.
However, events did not turn out as expected and these particular events made the month of June what it is in SA today.
Although it is a month where we commemorate the bravery and victory of the 1976 youth, South Africa's youth is still faced with challenges.
I venerate the youth of 1976 for their relentless vaulor and guidance for which they left for generations thereafter.
Challenges facing South-African youth today span from a number of elements dealt with domestically varying from the corruption scourge to the youth having little or no faith in governance (Patel; Graham: 2019).
In February, SA youth aged 15-24 years recorded a high unemployment rate of 63.2% while the unemployment rate of those aged 25-34 years was 41.2% in the Q4 2020 unemployment rates by Statistics South Africa.
Saul says the party should persevere in its quest to rid itself of corrupt leaders.
He has called on Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to present himself to the ANC integrity commission.
Pressure is mounting on Mkhize to resign after he admitted that his department’s awarding of a R150 million tender to communications company Digital Vibes was irregular.
Mkhize made the admission on Wednesday following the outcome of an internal investigation into the tender awarded to his former private assistant, Tahera Mathera, and former spokesperson, Naardhira Mitha.
The tender was for services related to the National Health Insurance programme and governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Saul says Mkhize should appear before the Commission as a matter of principle.
Instead of us focusing fighting that pandemic, we get distracted by allegations of corruption from us who are supposed to be leading.
There are serious allegations of corruption against an NEC member which is comrade Zweli Mkhize, who is currently deployed as minister of health.
If there are such allegations, in terms of the guidelines that were adopted by the NEC, expectation is that he should basically go to the Integrity Commission for the Integrity Commission to handle the matter and make recommendations to the NEC.
Minister Mkhize must step down following tender investigation.
The re-elected ANC chairperson in the Northern Cape, Zamani Saul, says the party needs to be ruthless in rooting out corruption in it’s ranks.
He has called on the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, to present himself to the ANC Integrity Commission and explain following allegations of corruption.
Mkhize is under fire over irregular contracts valued at more than 150 million in relation to National Health Insurance (NHI) and COVID-19 awarded to his close associates.
Instead of us focusing fighting that pandemic we get distracted by allegations of corruption from us who are supposed to be leading.
There are serious allegations of corruption against an NEC member which is comrade Zweli Mkhize who is currently deployed as minister of health.
If there are such allegations in terms of the guidelines that were adopted by the NEC, expectation is that he should basically go to the Integrity Commission for the Integrity Commission to handle the matter and make recommendations to the NEC, says Saul.
The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is investigating the matter.
President Ramaphosa awaits SIU report on Digital Vibes irregular tender allegations.
Saul also weighed in on ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s decision to take the party to court in a bid to have his suspension set aside.
The Northern Cape ANC Chairperson has described Magashule’s move as embarrassing.
Saul says Magashule thinks he is above the ANC constitution.
He says in the history of the movement they have never experienced such ill-disciplined Secretary General
There is no renewal that will take place in an organisation which does not have capacity to instil discipline among its members.
Step-aside is but one measure to ensure that we are going to put our organisation on a renewal trajectory.
The issue of the Secretary-General is, there is none of us, there is no self-respect in the member of the ANC who won’t be disappointed by Secretary-General who takes the ANC to court, and I get a sense that he is doing that because he’s got quite a distorted logic about his own role as the Secretary-General.
Saul was speaking on the side-line of the ANC Northern Cape elective conference held in Springbok
He says the party will recover from its current challenges
Zamani criticises Magashule for taking the party to court: Cyril Ramaphosa also addressed the conference.
He called on members to work harder to restore unity within the governing party, while also urging them to be selfless in serving their communities.
In his address Ramaphosa said there’s no room within the ANC for ill-disciplined members.
Ramaphosa reiterated that those who deviate from the ANC’s core values should be reprimanded.
We are determined to execute the mandate given to us by the Nasrec conference because delegates at that conference were clear that and said all NEC members of the ANC to branch members should work harder together to unite and rebuild this glorious movement of ours.
When we speak of unity, we are referring to principled unity and now you have coined it beautifully in the Northern Cape, organic unity.
It is unity that must arise to the basic of the African National Congress, he said.
The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has called on the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs to intervene after private security personnel entered the Nquthu Municipalitys Council Chambers and removed ANC councillors from the sitting.
The incident, which was captured on video and circulated widely on social media, took place earlier this week.
The video shows security guards manhandling an unidentified councillor
Councillors can be heard shouting and asking what Zikode has done.
The security officers, clad in heavy body armour, are seen grabbing two councillors and attempting to drag them from the chamber
The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has accused the IFP of orchestrating the attack on their councillors.
The IFP could not engage on the rational points they were raising.
They decided to bring in those thugs whom they hired to take out our councillors.
These are not security employed by the municipality these are private thugs, says ANC KZN Spokesperson, Nhlakanipho Ntombela.
But the IFP has dismissed the allegations.
The party says it was the ANC councillors who were unruly.
The ANC councillors did not want to see the council meeting continuing.
They really wanted to halt the council.
They did not want to see anything that had to be discussed of service delivery.
Whenever there are members who are disrupting the council you have to find ways and means to do that.
Even the one who was recording you can see that it was well planned, well-orchestrated, says IFP Provincial Chairperson, Thami Ntuli.
The ANC believes that the election of the IFP’s current mayor Lindokuhle Shabalala was unlawful.
The party is citing the fact that the council meeting in which Shabalala was elected was held while the country was in level 5 lockdown as reason for its assertions.
The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs says it is aware of the dispute and will investigate further.
Report by Bongani Gema
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says the COVID-19 pandemic is the governing party’s first real test since its establishment.
Ramaphosa says the ANC cannot point fingers and has to navigate the country through the storm.
He was speaking virtually at the ANC Northern Cape provincial conference, being held at Springbok.
Apart from its effects on the health of people, COVID-19 has also devastated economies and lives.
The COVID-19 pandemic saw South Africa’s economy depress even further, millions more became unemployed.
With a third wave fast approaching, Ramaphosa says the ANC needs to play its part to stop the rise in numbers, this includes encouraging people to register for vaccinations.
He says more than 100 countries have joined the call for pharmaceutical companies to waive intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines.
ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the Northern Cape elective conference.
ANC Provincial Chairperson Zamani Saul has been a staunch critic of suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashule, calling him deeply compromised.
Apart from COVID-19, the movement is also going through its own challenges such as ill-discipline.
Ever since Nasrec we have been trying to forge unity.
Call that comrade to order.
That is unity, says Ramaphosa.
Ramaphosa also called for the strengthening of policies and deployees to local government.
With local government elections in October, the ANC says it wants a resounding victory at the polls.
NC ANC Chairperson Zamani Saul reacts to Ramaphosa’s address on provincial elective conference.
Political analyst Dr Luvuyo Dondolo says the African National Congress (ANC) needs a long term solution if it is to renew the movement.
He says the ANC may regain a bit of trust following current interventions but going forward, they will have to put in more work.
This after the ANC in the Eastern Cape announced tapping into the wisdom of those who led before by involving the former president Thabo Mbeki in a three-day Provincial Executive Committee meeting currently under way in East London.
Dondolo says this is a short term strategy.
The involvement of former leaders such as Thabo Mbeki, leaders who are perceived to have the moral compass as a way of this renewal of the ANC is short term.
It is the strategy that the ANC is using to win the hearts of the voters, however the ANC needs a permanent and long term solution, says Dondolo.
ANC Northern Cape chairperson Zamani Saul says the party needs to restore its damaged image.
He says with this short term solution, the ANC might win the elections in some of the municipalities but there are certain metros where they will be strongly contested by other political organisations.
Mbeki is set to contribute to how to reassert the ANC as a movement rooted among the people.
ANC PEC Spokesperson, Loyiso Magqashela, says the meeting will also draw on the legacy of the founders of the party for the benefit of the current generation.
To strengthen the issue of the organisational renewal and unity we have then to tap from the wisdom of those who led before so that at least our renewal trajectory gets to be guided and guided properly.
You would have nowadays understood how the ANC is pressured from left right and centre now the renewal project then becomes key and also we want to assert the authority and the leadership of the ANC amongst the society, says Magqashela.
As ANC EC kickstarts its 3-day Extended PEC meeting at EL ICC, Dr W.B Rubusana Region this morning, it’s expected to be joined by the former ANC President Cde Thabo Mbeki.
ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, says placing the economy on a renewal path is one of the party’s core responsibilities this year.
Ramaphosa was addressing party members virtually at the Northern Cape’s elective conference in Springbok.
He added that party members should elect capable individuals to lead at local government level, and avoid past mistakes of appointing incapable officials who have collapsed municipalities across the country.
SABC News Ulrich Hendricks reports on the Northern Capes elective conference.
On behalf of the National Executive Committee, we want to thank and appreciate the Mlangeni and Ledwaba family for coming forward to work in partnership with the ANC in celebrating the legacy of Mlangeni under the theme: Morality, ethics, and renewal.
It actually fits well in this period of 2021 where we have our national team of unity, renewal, and rebuilding in the year of Charlotte Maxeke.
What is most important is that here lies a person who has been very selfless and protective of the ANC, who passed on being concerned about the state of the organisation, and in his memory, we do believe that as the NEC we owe it to people like him in ensuring that we bring the NEC together and we self-correct, says NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane.
June and Andrew Mlangeni Foundation Chairperson, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize says they are delighted.
We were committed to taking forward his last struggle of dealing with moral issues and especially within his own organisation and also ethical issues and we thought, look we are all in it now, he’s gone, let’s talk openly about these things and difficult topics.
And so we are really grateful that Ntate Mlangeni set a tone.
Mkhize says Mlangeni was against corruption and how it is costing the poor:
The University of South Africa hosted an Inaugural Memorial Lecture for the freedom fighter.
It was delivered by Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has expressed its condolences to the family and international congregants of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations (Scoan) on the passing of Nigerian televangelist TB Joshua.
Joshua died on Saturday night in a Lagos hospital at the age of 57 years.
His self-proclaimed healing powers attracted many high-profile South Africans to his church in Lagos, including EFF leader Julius Malema, former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters and the late former Springbok player Wium Basson.
The EFF says millions of people around the world, will remember him for his selfless commitment to the Word of God.
In the video below, SABC News Foreign Editor Sophie Mokoena gives an update on TB Joshua.
Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s challenge against Parliament’s impeachment rules will be heard in the Western Cape High Court on Monday.
The matter, expected to be heard by 3 judges, has been set down until Friday.
Last month, Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe withdrew from the case after the Democratic Alliance requested his recusal.
Hlophe was recently found guilty of gross misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Tribunal.
The motion to impeach Mkhwebane was brought by the DA.
Meanwhile, the Judicial Services Commission will decide at the end of next month whether Hlophe is guilty of gross misconduct and should face impeachment.
The Economic Freedom Fighters was among the parties that did not support the establishment of the committee.
The party’s Member of Parliament Natasha Ntlangwini said the rules were deliberately crafted with the Public Protector in mind.
We are opposed to the recommendations by the panel.
This House never had rules on the removal of Chapter 9 leaders.
These rules were made with the Public Protector in mind, a water-tight method to remove the Public Protector and no one else.
Former President Kgalema Motlanthe has described the late Struggle icon Andrew Mlangeni as a dependable and honest person who welcomed all in his midst and in the African National Congress (ANC).
The ANC is paying tribute to the late Mlangeni at a wreath laying ceremony at his grave, alongside his wife June at the Roodepoort Cemetery.
Wreath-laying ceremony in commemoration of Mama June Mlangeni and Isithwalandwe / Seaparankwe Ntate Andrew Mlangeni at the Roodepoort Cemetery.
Motlanthe says he is glad to have worked with the late Mlangeni, for he learnt a lot from the family.
The Mlangeni family attended the ceremony.
ANC NEC members Lindiwe Sisulu and Nomvula Mokonyane also attended.
Wreathe-laying ceremony for June and Andrew Mlangeni.
Delivering the keynote address, Motlanthe said: Comrade Andrew Mlangeni was a leader of our struggle who embodied the very core of what the struggle was about.
He was an elder on who’s council one could rely on.
He was truthful, earnest, and dependable.
He generously gave us his knowledge and skills.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has described as irrational and obscure a law that strips South Africans of their citizenship.
This follows complaints from citizens based in London who tried to renew their South African citizenship, only to discover that they are no longer South African citizens because they have claimed additional citizenship.
This is because, under the current Citizenship Act in South Africa, you have to first apply to the Department of Home Affairs for permission to get another citizenship.
However, DA MP Adrian Roos says the party is opposed to this law and will fight it in the High Court on behalf of thousands of South Africans who have lost their citizenship without their knowledge.
The DA is challenging this law in court.
It is not a particularly rational law seeing as the Department of Home Affairs has previously stated that it has nothing against dual citizenship.
But if that’s your policy, then you must not say you support dual citizenship.
If you look at the interim Constitution, it spoke about the fact that no citizen shall be without justification, and this was changed in the final Constitution.
They removed the words without justification to say this right should obsolete that you shouldn’t be deprived of your citizenship.
So the argument of the DA is that if anything, you should have to legitimately and actively renounce your citizenship before you can lose it, says Roos.
Below is the full interview with DA MP Adrian Roos.
Deputy President David Mabuza has weighed in regarding the R150 million Digital Vibes scandal allegedly linked to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize.
He was addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo on Saturday.
The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) is probing allegations that the minister benefited from the money paid to Digital Vibes to do public relations work for the department.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) is among those calling for the resignation of Mkhize.
Mabuza says people should wait for the outcome of the investigation.
Of course if there are allegations they will always disrupt the thinking of government
But I think we should take from what the President has said that this is being attended to.
Earlier the Special Investigation Units Kaizer Kganyago says they’re still investigating and plan to conclude the probe soon.
Deputy President David Mabuza says about R654 million meant to assist military veterans is lying idle in the Department of Defence and is not being used because the department has not been working properly.
Mabuza was addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo on Saturday.
He has urged military veterans to form one single group instead of fighting one another.
Well, the money has not been used, it lies in the department because there is a number of problems, but the military veterans are complaining.
The biggest problem that we are facing is the verification program which affects the no statutory forces.
Mabuza says he hopes that now that a Director-General of the department has been appointed, military veterans will get the assistance they want.
He has urged military veterans across all the political spectrum to organise themselves and to enable the government to adequately support them.
Military veterans often complain about a lack of decent housing, health services, and jobs.
Disunity among veterans.
Mabuza says disunity and groupings among military veterans and ex-combatants are undermining the government’s efforts to address their challenges.
He says military veterans from former liberations parties are also battling with verification of struggle credentials.
You must try and organise yourselves, we don’t want these groupings amongst yourselves because we don’t understand why you are fighting amongst yourselves.
You are a community that is getting smaller and smaller, you are a community that is aging so why would old people fight among themselves, MKVA, and the military council you must go and solve your issues with immediate effect.
It’s not good for this community.
Mabuza interacts with veterans from the South African Defence Force, Mkhonto we Sizwe, Azanian People’s Liberation Army, and the Venda Defence Force in Polokwane, Limpopo.
Deputy President David Mabuza engaged with veterans from the South African Defence Force, Mkhonto we Sizwe, Azanian People’s Liberation Army and the Venda Defence Force.
Although they are still disgruntled, veterans believe there is now a glimmer of hope.
I am from Azania MVA, hopefully, our problems will be attended to once the partnership can be forged between us and the national government.
MK National Councils Emmanuel Maake says, We have had all the sorts of problems including health, housing, pensions & school fees for children, we are basically struggling.
Some military veterans were not happy that they were denied entry to the venue where Mabuza was addressing them.
They were not on the list of those who were expected to enter the rugby stadium.
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) led by Nquthu Municipality in northern KwaZulu-Natal is taking the provincial Cooperative Governance Department to court for placing it under administration.
The decision was announced by COGTA MEC, Sipho Hlomuka on Thursday.
He cited a recent audit outcome and a high court ruling that the appointment of certain acting senior managers was irregular.
The Nquthu council has argued that the MEC has no basis to place the municipality under administration.
The decision to challenge Hlomuka’s action was taken during a council meeting on Thursday, a day after the provincial Cooperative Governance Department announced that it is placing the municipality under administration.
In February, the provincial government placed the municipality under administration.
But the decision was overturned by the National Minister of Co-operative Governance Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
She argued that there was no substantial reason to place the municipality under administration.
I think this intervention is not genuine, but a political ploy by MEC because in March Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma turned down an earlier decision by COGTA in the province to place the municipality under administration.
Dlamini- Zuma instead recommended that the provincial government intervene with Section 139 1A which means they could monitor, guide, and assist the municipality.
But Cogta in KZN did not do that.
Yes, we did get a disclaimer audit outcome, but the reasons for that, the previous senior managers, when they left they deliberately took with them crucial information which was required for auditing purposes, says Mayor Lindokuhle Shabalala.
Nquthu municipality threatens to take COGTA to court
The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal has accused Hlomuka of helping the African National Congress (ANC) to run the municipality through the back door by placing it under administration.
Provincial party chairperson, Thamsanqa Ntuli says the ANC is hell-bent on running the Nquthu Municipality even though they lost elections in the area.
We are all quite aware that the IFP and the ANC are working well in the City of Johannesburg but here in KZN it’s a different story.
Hence you see the agenda against all our municipalities in the province of KZN.
We are quite very concerned with the behaviour of COGTA and MEC for COGTA who actually is allowing the narrow agenda of ANC councillors in Nquthu to be guiding the activities of COGTA, it’s quite very unfortunate.
The IFP is also unhappy with the ANC after it named one of its regional structures in the far north of the province after its late freedom fighter, Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.
It also says the move would regress reconciliatory talks between the two parties spearheaded by leaders of both parties at the national level.
Deputy President David Mabuza has assured military veterans that government does not have hard cash to give to military veterans but has money to take care of their social and health needs.
He says the problem was with the Department of Defence and Military Veterans which lacked direction to attend to their plight.
Addressing a group of military veterans, Mabuza says things will start to work out properly because a director-general of the department has been appointed.
We proceed with Provincial interactions with Military Veterans.
Today we are in Limpopo at the Polokwane Rugby Stadium and warmly welcomed by Premier Stanley Mathabatha.
He also urged military veterans to form one group instead of fighting one another.
We are still going to fix the Department of Military Veterans.
I can tell you that the Director-General [Irene Mpolweni] in the department has been appointed.
She is going to start to work on the 7th of June.
So things will start to converge.
Secondly, the Presidency has requested the offices of the Premiers to collaborate in this work, says Mabuza.
Deputy President speak to the media about the discussion held with the military veterans.
Deputy President David Mabuza has urged military veterans across the political divide, to organise themselves in one group for government to adequately support them.
Military veterans often complain that they are not getting housing, health services and other things from government equally.
In the video below the SABC speaks to a member of the then Venda Defence Force:
Addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo from the old South African Defence Force (SADF), Venda Defence Force (VDF).
Mabuza says the government is worried that military veterans fight amongst themselves.
He says military veterans from former liberations parties are still battling with verifications to check who was in the trenches whereas the situation of others from the SADF and VDF is better.
You are a community that is getting smaller and smaller.
You are a community that is ageing.
So why would old people fight among themselves?
MKVA and military council you must go and solve your issues with immediate effect.
It is not good for this community, adds Mabuza.
The SABC speaks to the MKVA’s Limpopo Secretary Lulamile Jack.
The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) has directed the Speaker of the Inkosi Langalibalele Local Municipality to investigate allegations of assault that have been levelled against a councillor.
It’s alleged that an IFP councillor assaulted two women ANC councillors.
KZN COGTA spokesperson Senzo Mzila says, The KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka has expressed his concern at the allegation that have risen in the Inkosi Langalibalele Local Municipality.
The allegations are that one of the councillors was assaulted by another councillor.
MEC Hlomuka has called upon the Speaker of the municipality to investigate the circumstances surrounding this incident and to provide him with a comprehensive report on this matter, adds Mzila.
Deputy President David Mabuza in his capacity as the chairperson of the Presidential Task Team on Military Veterans is expected to interact with military veterans at Polokwane in Limpopo.
He is to assess progress achieved by the provincial government in addressing challenges faced by military veterans.
For years, military veterans from both former liberation political parties and the then Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC states), have been complaining that government is not doing enough to take care of their livelihood.
Amongst other things the task team led by Deputy President Mabuza identified, is the need for social distress relief, providing educational assistance, decent housing and land for military veterans.
In a statement from the Presidency, the Task Team continues to receive reports on progress achieved by different departments, to come up with a legislative framework to help military veterans.
Speculation is mounting that President Cyril Ramaphosa is looking for a new Health Minister amid reports that Zweli Mkhize may be preparing to resign.
Mkhize has been accused of conflict of interest regarding a R150 million tender that his department awarded to communications company Digital Vibes.
The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) is probing the irregular tender that was for work related to the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme and governments response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mkhize failed to appear before Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Health on Friday following legal advice.
Chairperson of the Committee Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo says, I had a telephonic discussion with Dr Mkhize last night (Thursday).
I got to hear that he had been given a legal opinion.
It is not advisable just for now for him to join the Portfolio Committee because of allegations that actually put his name into the picture.
So, then it is fair legally for him not to come in to explain.
Mkhize not appearing before Committee puts more clouds over his head
Meanwhile, political analyst Dr Dale McKinley says Mkhize not appearing before the Health Portfolio Committee just puts more clouds over his head and that more people are going to ask questions around his involvement in the Digital Vibes tender.
McKinley says the ANC must encourage Mkhize to resign as a matter of principle.
Dr Dale McKinely speaks on Mkhize not appearing before the Committee.
The Gauteng Health Department says the corruption allegations against Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize are a huge blow to the country’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
The allegations related to his departments awarding of a R150-million contract to communications company Digital Vibes.
Mkhize’s former aides control the company which got the contract to do work related to the National Health Insurance scheme and governments response to the pandemic.
The Special Investigative Unit is probing the matter.
Last month Mkhize admitted that the deal was irregular and said disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible.
To have a Health Minister who is leading our pandemic response, somebody whose word is not believed, who cannot engage with the media, having to duck and dive accountability.
We have a Health Minister that cant answer basic questions about whats happening in his department, says Chief Director at the Gauteng Health Department, Meisie Lerutle.
Mkhize not appearing before Health Committee puts more clouds over his head:
Meanwhile, political Analyst Dr Dale McKinley says Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize not appearing before the Health Portfolio Committee just puts more clouds over his head and more people are going to ask questions around his involvement in the Digital Vibes tender.
The analyst says, Opposition parties are going to make hay of this and generally speaking he is going to come under more pressure.
He should say look, there’s clearly something wrong here.
I have a case to answer.
I’m going to step out of my role right now.
People would respect that and I think the ANC must allow that and encourage that to happen.
Not just with Mkhize, but with the whole range of their members who are dealing with serious allegations because the only way they are going to clean the name of the party and are going to regain the trust of the population, is if they are seen to act.
Not simply when and being charged formally, but when there is clear evidence that there’s been wrongdoing.
And I think that’s fundamentally important for the President to consider.

Mkhize failed to appear before Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Health, on advice by his lawyers.
Dr Zweli Mkhize advised not to appear before Parliaments Health Portfolio Committee.
Chairperson of the committee, Sibongiseni Dhlomo, says it is fair legally for Mkhize not to appear before the committee
I had a telephonic discussion with Dr Mkhize last night.
Opposition parties in the Portfolio Committee on Health have expressed their discontent with Mkhize’s non-appearance.
Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo on Health Minister Mkhize not appearing before the Parliament Committee:
Opposition parties’ discontent with Mkhize.
They also disagreed with the ANC’s position that the matter is sub-judice after the DA opened a case at Cape Town Police Station against Mkhize and his Director General Sandile Buthelezi.
DA lays criminal charge against Dr Zweli Mkhize.
EEF MPs, Dr Suzan Thembekwayo and Naledi Chirwa say the ANCs position on this matter is an indication that the committee will not be able to hold the minister to account.
This was a clear indication that we as the committee cannot be able to speak in one voice to bring the national department and the minister to account, says Thembekwayo.
So we cannot talk about this matter because a case has been opened against the minister, what happens when the NPA bring the matter to the court?
Are we going to be held at ransom and wait until it is finished?
ANC stalwart, Mama Ivy Gcina, has been laid to rest in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape.
Her funeral service was held at Feather Market Hall.
The 84-year-old died on Thursday last week after a long illness.
She was granted a category two special provincial official funeral by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The funeral service of ANC stalwart Mama Ivy Gcina is currently underway at Feather Market Centre in Gqeberha.
The 84 year old Gcina died on Thursday last week after a long illness.
She was an ANC MP from 1994 until 2004.
Gcina served as an ANC MP in Parliament from 1994 until her retirement in 2004.
She also served on various structures of different women’s organisations during the apartheid era.
She served in the Women’s Committee of the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation and was also the first chairperson of the Port Elizabeth Womens Organisation.
She was also the leader of the United Democratic Front in the region.
During her time of resistance, she was detained and tortured on numerous occasions.
Her family remembered her as a wise and courageous woman.
Her grandchild, Lerato Gcina, says they have learned so much from her.
It actually hurts our feelings that we couldn’t spend more time with you during your weakest moments.
We will miss you makhulu, your spirit and your strength live on in each of us and in the lives that you touched with your love, wisdom, strength and the beauty of your soul.
Siyauthanda makhulu, you truly were a special woman.
We thank you for your sacrifices and everything you have done for us.
Mama Gcina lost her three sons in the struggle while they were serving as soldiers of uMkhonto weSizwe while her daughter died of natural causes.
ANC Stalwart an icon Ivy Gcina who fought against the apartheid system a leader of PEWO, she stood for our people whilst she was tortured, beaten, suffocated, detained by the Security Branch.
She lost her own children in front line of our liberation struggle.
It is so sad.

He called the current ANC members to emulate these values.
We are looking at someone who actually is a special kind, is a member that we want to see in the African National Congress.
A person of integrity, a person of discipline, a very dedicated member, a very committed member of the African National Congress.
We should all emulate this generation, it’s a generation that knew very well that it’s not about them, but its about the future of this country.
Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula praised Mama Gcina as an unsung heroine and stalwart of the freedom struggle.
She says there are many heavy hearts bidding farewell to somebody who sacrificed her whole life to the struggle.
She was forever at the forefront as she fought against the heinous apartheid policy of the national party.
She was never deterred by the brutality of the security forces of the racist regime.
She never wilted, even when more stringent security regulations were enacted by the regime in the dark days of apartheid.
Mama Gcina leaves behind her two siblings and her six grandchildren.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused both Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and the department’s Director-General (DG) Sandile Buthelezi of undermining the role of parliament.
The Minister was expected to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Health on Friday.
The Minister told the Portfolio Committee on Health that hes been legally advised not to appear before the Committee to discuss the awarding of the R150 million Digital Vibes contract, while his DG said he’s been advised to refrain from commenting on the contract.
This is after DA Member of Parliament, Siviwe Gwarube, opened a case against the two at the Cape Town Police Station.
Gwarube’s colleague, Evelyn Wilson, rejected the African National Congress (ANC) position that the matter is subjudice, demanding answers.
It is not subject to subjudice, it is not before the court.
The matter is not being heard in court and the DG agreed to come to this meeting.
We must remember one thing here, we are not accountable to the Minister or his DG, they are accountable to us, says Wilson.
Digital Vibes contract: DA lays criminal charge against Dr Zweli Mkhize.
Siviwe Gwarube says ANC defends Mkhize.
The ANC has accused the DA of jumping the gun by opening a case against Mkhize and Buthelezi regarding the awarding of Digital Vibes tender.
ANC MP Kenneth Jacobs puts the blame on Gwarube that the committee was unable to deliberate on the matter.
I want to reiterate that the member had jumped the gun to go and lay criminal charges, therefore, the DG and the Minister have the right to do what they are doing to make certain that they don’t infringe their rights according to the Constitution, says Jacobs.
Corruption allegations: Alleged irregular contract between the health department & Digital Vibes
The late Ivy Gcina has been praised as an unsung heroine and stalwart of the freedom struggle.

Mapisa-Nqakula says there are many heavy hearts bidding farewell to somebody who sacrificed her whole life to the struggle.
She was forever at the forefront as she fought against the hideous apartheid policy of the national party.
Gcina, 84, served on many structures during her time fighting the apartheid regime including the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO).
She was also the first Chairperson of the Port Elizabeth Women’s Organisation (PEWO).
She joined the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in the 1950s and served in parliament as an African National Congress Member of Parliament from 1994 until 2004 when she retired.

Gcina has been granted a Special Official Provincial Funeral Category 2 by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Political analyst Ivor Sarakinsky says President Cyril Ramaphosa should have taken a decisive decision against Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize as he is facing serious allegations of corruption.
Sarakinsky says the president is not dealing with the matter appropriately.
Allegations have surfaced that Mkhize personally benefited from the irregular R150 million tender to communications company Digital Vibes.
Sarakinsky says Ramaphosa finds himself in a difficult position as Mkhize is a medical doctor who knows what needs to be done in terms of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister Mkhize made it very hard for President Ramaphosa because in many other democracies a scandal like this would result in the minister resigning falling on his sword and in that way protecting the president from having to take disciplinary action.
So that is the practice that should be in place.
But in SA if that was the case we would have ongoing changes in the cabinet with all the scandals that are emerging through media investigations and the Zondo Commission.
Ramaphosa dealing with allegations.
On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he’s dealing with allegations around Mkhize and the irregular R150 million Digital Vibes contract.
There has been mounting pressure from the DA and other parties for Mkhize to step down or be removed by Ramaphosa.
The President said the allegations are serious and need to be investigated thoroughly by law enforcement agencies and that due process will be followed once the investigations are finalised.

She has also laid charges of contravening the Public Finance Management Act against Health Department Director-General Dr Sandile Buthelezi.
DA lays criminal charge against Dr Zweli Mkhize.
The African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee in the Free State has warned that it will take action against members who are facing criminal charges and don’t step aside.
The committee held a media briefing in Bloemfontein about the outcome of its first meeting that was held earlier this week.
Deputy convener Paseka Nompondo says there are three members that have been affected.
At the current moment, I can say that those that are affected are three and then we already have been in touch with them this morning, We are dealing with that matter so the state officials that have appeared in court this morning, the state must act within the framework of the law.
But on our side, as the ANC, those who occupy our positions shall step aside today, failing which the ANC will act appropriately.
ANC provincial convener, Mxolisi Dukwana, says members who don’t follow party policies will no longer be welcome in the party.
We would like to be given space to ensure that we work with the members of the ANC.
We indicated that there is no one who is the hero; members of the ANC do not belong to anyone, there is no one who is the supporter of any leader.
These are members of the ANC and we need to ensure that such finds expression and that members of the ANC will always follow the organisation and not follow individuals.
Mxolisi Dukwana appointed as convenor of the ANC Free State Interim Provincial Committee:

National Assembly House Committee Chairperson and Chair of Committee Chairpersons Cedrick Frolick has confirmed to the SABC that Mkhize will appear before the committee.
Pressure has been mounting that President Cyril Ramaphosa should act against Mkhize following his latest admission that the awarding of a R150-million tender to communications company, Digital Vibes was irregular.
The tender was for services related to the National Health Insurance scheme and governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
DA lays criminal charges against Mkhize
Meanwhile,Democratic Alliance (DA)shadow Minister of Health, Siviwe Gwarube, has laid criminal charges against Mkhize at the Cape Town Central Police Station.
She has also laid charges of contravening the Public Finance Management Act against Health Department Director-General Doctor Sandile Buthelezi.
This after revelations that Mkhize’s family may have benefited from proceeds of a R150 million tender that his department awarded to communications company Digital Vibes.
The company employed Mkhize’s former spokesperson and alleged family friend, Tahera Mather, and the Ministers former assistant, Naadhira Mitha.

Ramaphosa dealing with allegations
On Wednesday, President Cyri lRamaphosa said he’s dealing with allegations around Zweli Mkhize and the irregular R150 million Digital Vibes contract.
There are serious allegations which need to be investigated by the SIU and any other appropriate authority and be finalised without delay.
President Cyril Ramaphosa says hes dealing with allegations against Dr Zweli Mkhize:
The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling for the immediate suspension of embattled Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize.
The DA shadow minister for Health Siviwe Gwarube laid charges against Mkhize on Thursday at the Cape Town police station under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Allegations have surfaced regarding Mkhize and a tender of about R150 million for communications company Digital Vibes.
The DA has also laid charges against the Director-General in the department, Dr Sandile Buthelezi for the alleged flouting the Public Finance Management Act.
Gwarube says, We are laying charges here against Minister Mkhize, allegations are mounting in the past few weeks that suggest that the minister might have improperly signed off a contract to Digital Vibes, a company that is run by a close associates to the tune of 150 million rands.
It is our contention that this could be in contravention of the combating and prevention of corruption act.
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) is investigating the matter, telling Scopa that they hope to wrap up investigations by the end of the month.
President Cyril Ramamaphosa announced that he’s also dealing with the matter, saying Mkhize is co-operating fully.
However, Gwarube says Mkhize should have long been suspended, We are of the view that the President failed yesterday to take any form of leadership by suspending Dr Mkhize, pending the conclusion of the SIU investigation.
We think this is improper, we think that actually potentially from undue influence if the minister is his post while hes being investigated.
Mkhize is alleged to have signed off on the contract whose alleged directors are his friends, Tahera Mather and Naadira Mitha, for government communications services.
But the money allegedly ended up benefitting Mkhize, his family and the families of the two directors.
In another case, the Public Protector says she’s opened a case of contempt with the Brooklyn police.
This is after Mkhize failed on three occasions to honour her subpoenas.
The subpoenas were sent between February and the 1st of this month.
President Cyril Ramaphosa engages with the media on various issues, following his reply to the debate on his Presidency Budget Vote for 2021/2022.
The Public Protectors office says it will initiate contempt proceedings against Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, following his failure to honour a subpoena to give evidence and produce documents.
This is in relation to an investigation into allegations of undue delay and/or failure by his department to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Clinical Associate National Task Team in 2017.

This after revelations that Mkhizes; family may have benefited from proceeds of a R150 million tender that his department awarded to communications company Digital Vibes.
The contract was for work related to the National Health Insurance programme and governments response to the coronavirus pandemic.
On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said hes dealing with allegations around Zweli Mkhize and the irregular R150 million Digital Vibes contract.
There has been mounting pressure from the DA and other parties for Mkhize to step down or be removed by Ramaphosa.

The National Assembly has granted the Ad Hoc Committee on the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution a 30-day extension to complete its work.
The Committee, tasked with coming up with legislation to enable amendments that will allow for land expropriation, made the request for the extension earlier this week.
Its lifespan ended at midnight on Monday.
The Chairpersons in the National Assembly, Cedrick Frolick, says this doesn’t change the Committees mandate.
The mandate of the Committee will remain the same.
The Committee will be re-established and asked to report back end of August although they requested a 30-day extension, we are mindful that the House going into recess and even if they complete it in 30 days, the report would be there and wait for us when we return in August.
Parliament held public oral hearings into the proposal to amend Section 25 of the Constitution.
This follows a request by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to allow oral submissions on the proposed constitutional amendment.
The Ad Hoc Committee handling the matter has received over 200 000 written submissions.
It is currently processing the proposal to amend the Constitution to give effect to land expropriation without compensation.
There is currently a huge debate on the feasibility of the amendment.
However, labour federation Cosatu says it supports the Amendment and Expropriation Bill.
The highest law in the land
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa is Act
No 108 of Parliament of 1996.
It is the highest law in the land.
And therefore any law that is not in line with the Constitution becomes invalid unless and until it is rectified to pass constitutional muster.
The Bill of Rights in Chapter 2 remains the cornerstone of democracy as outlined in the Constitution.
It is a chapter that makes provision for the protection of human dignity, the right to life, freedom of expression, equality, privacy, freedom of religion, freedom of belief and opinion.
Other freedoms include political rights, freedom of trade, occupation and profession.
However, all these rights are subject to limitations.
To change most of the Bill of Rights requires a two-thirds majority vote.
One example that requires a two-thirds vote is the property clause under Section 25 of the Constitution.
It is under Section 25 where the expropriation of land and property is provided for.
However, this clause is currently being amended by the Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow the Expropriation of Land Without Compensation.
The Section 25 amendment is currently being done through the Constitution’s 18th Amendment Bill.
This means it is the 18th time that the South African Constitution is being amended.

The newly-elected African National Congress (ANC) Free State Interim Provincial Committee (IPC)is expected to outline its plan of action on Thursday.
The structure, which was elected in May, is set to address the media later on Thursday morning.
The partys Tshidiso Nkgwedi says the outcome of the first IPC meeting held recently will be the focus.
The structure, which saw suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashules opponent who is the former Economic Development MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana, being appointed as the Convener and Premier Sisi Ntombela, as his deputy, is set to see the province to an elective conference.
The structure was established after disgruntled party members won a Supreme Court of Appeal bid which saw the Provincial Executive Committee being declared illegitimate and unconstitutional.
Aggrieved Free State ANC members welcome SCA judgment.
Several ANC branches in Mahikeng pledge support for Magashule.
ANC members from 35 branches of the Mahikeng sub-region in the North West have condemned the immediate temporary suspension of Secretary-General Ace Magashule from the party.
His suspension was effective from 3 May.
Magashule is currently out on bail charged with corruption, fraud, and money laundering related to the Free State asbestos tender that was issued during his tenure as the provinces premier.
ANC members in the Mahikeng sub-region converged just after the news that Magashule had been suspended.
Members have vowed to support Magashule through thick and thin.
A youth league leader in the Ngaka Modiri Molema region, Koketso Moiloa, has blamed the ANC President for Magashules suspension.
Herman Mashabas political party, ActionSA has accused the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) of soliciting donations for political parties through the Multi-Party Democracy Fund.
The Fund was established in terms of the Political Party Funding Act, which came into effect in April this year.
Its aimed at raising and distributing funds donated from the private sector to represented political parties.
Just two months after its implementation, the Multi-Party Democracy Fund is under scrutiny.
ActionSA claims that the IEC is in violation of its Constitutional obligations with regards to the fund.
It accuses the commission of actively raising funds for the fourteen political parties in the National Assembly and excluding political parties like ActionSA, that can only be represented after the 2024 national elections.
ActionSA has written to the IEC CEO Sy Mamabolo and Deputy CEO Masego Sheburi to demand that the IECs fundraising for the multi-party democracy fund be ceased immediately.
The IEC made the startling confession that it has been actively soliciting funds for the 14 political parties that are represented in the National Assembly, who already received billions in public funding every year from taxpayers.
It is intolerable that the IEC activities perpetuate the status quo in politics especially when South Africans are being failed so fundamentally, says ActionSA spokesperson Lerato Ngobeni.
Herman Mashabas ActionSA accuses IEC of soliciting donations for political parties
Earlier this year, the IEC indicated that it was taking measures to promote the Fund.
The Fund is critical to combat corruption, by requiring political parties and donors to be transparent.
Democracy is expensive and the fiscus alone cannot provide complete financial support to political parties especially under the current severe fiscal constraints.
To ensure we continue to enjoy a vibrant, thriving and robust multiparty democracy we hope that this Fund will provide an easy and Hands off channel through which corporate entities, individuals and other organisations can contribute funds to parties without having to engage directly with them or needing to declare these separately, says IEC vice-chairperson Janet Love.
The party has since written to the commissions CEO and Deputy CEO, demanding that the fund ceases with immediate effect and that money deposited be returned to the donors.
ActionSA has given the IEC until this Friday to respond to their demands or else they will take the matter to court.
Meanwhile, the commission is mum on the matter and says it will comment at a later stage.
President Cyril Ramaphosa says hes dealing with allegations around Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize and the irregular R150 million Digital Vibes contract.

He says the allegations are serious and need to be investigated thoroughly by law enforcement agencies.
President Ramaphosa says due process will be followed once the investigations are finalised.
Claims of tender irregularities at Health Department serious test for combating corruption
The Executive Secretary at the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, Lawson Naidoo says the claims of tender irregularities in the Health Department pose a serious test of the states commitment to combating corruption.
Naidoo says the matter is a very strong signal to the South African public.
This is a very strong signal to the South African public that this is a serious matter.
The issue of the integrity of the state, how serious they are about fighting corruption.
We are going to get a report from the Deputy Chief Justice in three months time outlining how we deal with state capture.
And we are only dealing with issues when they are staring at us like this.
Is there any hope that the recommendations of the Zondo Commission will actually be before the court of law?
Pressure from DA
Pressure is mounting from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and others for Mkhize to step down or be removed by President Ramaphosa.
Mkhize has said that an investigation into allegations over irregular multi-million rand contracts by his department has found that its dealings with communications company, Digital Vibes, were irregular.
Mkhize denies any involvement
Mkhize has denied any involvement in the awarding of an irregular multi-million-rand contract by his department.
This after a Special Investigating Unit probe found that the Health Departments dealings with communications company, Digital Vibes, were irregular.
It follows newspaper reports that the Department had paid Digital Vibes R150-million for services related to the National Health Insurance and the governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The much-awaited case of the ANCs suspended Secretary-General, Ace Magashule is expected to be heard before the end of June.
A full bench of the High Court is expected to hear the matter.
Magashule was suspended after he refused to step aside in accordance with his party’s resolutions.
In conversation with suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule:
The National Executive Committee had ordered him to publicly apologise to ANC branches after he wrote a suspension letter to party President Cyril Ramaphosa, but he refused and instead took the matter to court.
ANC National Working Committee to discuss suspended Ace Magashule’s defiance.
Magashule has sought the services of Senior Council, Advocate Dali Mpofu.
He wants his suspension to be nullified.
Magashules behaviour unprecedented
Last week, Ramaphosa described Magashules conduct as both shocking and unprecedented.
ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the constitution of the party has been put to the test.
The party is certainly not in crisis.
Unfortunately, the constitution of the ANC has been taken on trial.
The party has already issued a statement stating that it will be opposing the application by the Secretary-General.
But when courts are then approached in the manner that they have been approached, the ANC ought to act to protect and defend its own constitution and also to protect and defend its own decisions.
Pule Mabe speaks on Magashules court action and conduct of some ANC senior members at Zuma’s trial:
Mpofu has a right to discharge his professional duties
Meanwhile, some have questioned Mpofus decision to represent both Magashule and former President Jacob Zuma in his corruption case.
EFF leader Julius Malema says Mpofu has a right to discharge his professional duties, without fear and the party will not interfere in his private responsibilities.
Any doctor of the EFF can treat Jacob Zuma when hes sick; they have taken a professional oath and we should allow that.
We cant say to a doctor, when Zuma is sick, you cant treat him; they will be contravening their legal oath.
The same applies to legal counsel.
We must allow them to do their work without any political interference; we must respect their professional responsibilities.
We cant say a charted accountant of the EFF cant audit the books of the ANC; that would be encroaching them in their personal and professional space.
We are going to end up telling people who to date and who not to date.
Let people conduct their professional jobs.
When it comes to politics, Dali conducts his work without fear; when it comes to his profession, he doesnt consult us.
EFF says it has no say in who Adv.
Dali Mpofu represents in court.
President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently presenting the budget allocation for his office.
His budget vote takes place amid mounting pressure on him to fire Health Minister Zweli Mkhize as more allegations surface about the Digital Vibes tender.
On Tuesday, some opposition political parties accused the African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament of asking soft questions to the executive and also raised concerns about the Disaster Management Act.
They say Parliament has no say on lockdown regulations.
Others questioned the role that Parliament is playing in holding Mkhize to account for the Digital Vibes tender.
Political parties will debate the Presidencys budget vote and he will respond on Thursday.

President Ramaphosa awaits SIU report on Digital Vibes irregular tender allegations
President Cyril Ramaphosa is this afternoon presenting the budget allocation for his office in Parliament.
Below are the proceedings in Parliament.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) questioned the role of Parliament in holding Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to account for allegations of irregularly awarding a contract to communications company Digital Vibes.
Opposition parties have accused the African National Congress (ANC) members of Parliament of shielding the executive, this was revealed during the debate on the budget vote of Parliament.
The opposition parties say ANC MPs ask soft questions to ministers and their deputies, while some dont answer written questions.
They have also raised concern about the Disaster Management Act saying Parliament has no say on lockdown regulations.
DA MP Jacques Julius says, If only ANC members can also do their part in holding the executive to account.
We can do our work with this budget a good starting point for them will be to ask more uncomfortable questions whether written or oral and stop sweetheart questions.
Alleged irregular contract between the health department & Digital Vibes:
Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire Mkhize, as more allegations surface against the minister.
Digital Vibes, a company which was awarded a contract to carry out work related to the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme and governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic reportedly paid for maintenance at a property that Mkhizes family Trust owns.
The company is also alleged to have transferred R300 000 to All Out Trading, an entity in which Mkhizes son is the director.

National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has reiterated that Pan African Parliament, based in Midrand, Johannesburg, is an organ of the African Union and therefore the rules of the organisation must be applied.
The Pan African Parliament has been suspended after MPs again plunged the house into a third consecutive day of chaos.
The members clashed over the electoral system with the Southern Caucus pushing for the change to rotational leadership similar to the African Union process, while the Eastern and Western caucuses are against it.
Chaos at PAP today.
Modise was delivering the budget vote of the National Assembly.
She says South Africa is expecting PAP to follow rotational rules.
We host the PAP as a country we have our members delegated to that house as members of that house we do and do need to take proper interest in the functioning of the PAP, specifically whatever goes wrong on the PAP floor.
SA gets the beating whether we are responsible or not and the truth is we have not played our role properly as a host and we are correcting that.
ANC MP condemns chaos.
ANC MP, Bhekizizwe Radebe has condemned the chaos and disruptions
South Africa is the host of the PAP and it has representatives who are members of its Parliament.
Radebe says the scenes from Midrand might result in the continent not being taken seriously.
What has happened there in the PAP was really disgusting and it must be condemned that such despicable behaviour can be shown throughout the whole world.
How are the other regions in the world going to take us seriously if we can do this thing to each other?
Malema calls for AU intervention.
Economics Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the African Union needs to intervene in recent issues raised by the Pan African Parliament (PAP) at Midrand in Johannesburg.
Malema, who was at the session, has described the chaotic scenes as disappointing.
The debate is robust.
People have different views.
We have suspended the house to go and consult further on these matters.
We hope there will be a solution and our proposed solution is to let someone from the AU come and intervene and facilitate the elections.
There are two letters from the AU which our colleagues are refusing to adhere to and the dispute is with regard to those letters from the AU.
So if someone from the AU can come and give us direction, we all can comply.
The African National Congress Womens League (ANCWL) says it is appalled by the incident of gender-based violence, which occurred at the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) on Monday.
Djibril War of Senegal was caught on camera kicking ANC MP, Pemmy Majodina, during a disagreement.
In a statement, ANCWL says, Cde Pemmy, has publicly provided a comprehensive account of the occurrence and that she was intervening to stop a physical fight which broke out between two male leaders, only to find herself assaulted and her dignity undermined in public.
As the ANCWL we strongly condemn Djibrils actions and we are highly disappointed that a leader of his social standing could grossly violate a woman.
ANCWL members will be picketing outside Pan-African Parliament over Majodinas assault.
They are calling for PAP to suspend War.
Majodina had initially intended to open a case against the Senegalese delegate.
She, however, had a change of heart after War apologised.
Senegalese PAP member apologises to Majodina.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) says, so far, 50 000 people have signed its petition against the proposed Firearms Control Amendment Bill.
The draft bill would if it were to become law prohibit the awarding of firearm licenses for self- defence purposes.
It would also restrict the number of firearms individuals can own for sport and hunting.
The DA says it strongly opposes the Bill and has called for more people to sign its petition.
DA Spokesperson on Police, Andrew Whitfield, says a legal handgun is the last line of defence for millions of South Africans.
The DA believes that the firearms control amendment bill is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation that weve seen in a very long time.
Specifically the bill intends to remove self-defence as a reason to own a firearm.
The DA believes that in such a violent society like South Africa, this is completely irrational and unreasonable.
The DA is also concerned about the impact on the sport shooting fraternities as well as private security and the limitations of the bill will impose on them, explains Whitfield.
The Congress of the People (COPE) is also against the Bill and says it will mobilise other opposition parties against it.
Party Spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, says all South Africans have the right to defend themselves.
This amendment is disgraceful and completely madness.
The bill does not make any sense to say that no firearm license may be issued for self-defence suppose.
It is very clear that this government is not taking the lives of its citizens serious.
Criminals with illegal firearms will terrorise law abiding citizens more than ever before, explains Bloem.
Government says the proposed law will help reduce crime.
Former African National Congress (ANC) President, Thabo Mbeki, says the party needs to guard against members who join the party to advance their selfish interests.
He was speaking at the ANCs Provincial Executive Council (PEC) meeting in the Eastern Cape.
The three-day ANC PEC meeting focused on the renewal of the party.
Mbeki says careerism has destroyed the ANC and disconnected it from its core responsibility of improving the livelihoods of the underprivileged.
Because we have not addressed this matter raised by [former president] Nelson Mandela in 1997, about careerist, we have failed to address that matter.
When we say renewal, can you renew ANC with those careerists and the answer was it wouldnt make sense, explains Mbeki.
Former ANC President Cde Thabo Mbeki earlier arriving at the 3 day Extended PEC meeting that kickstarted today.
Former Public Enterprises Minister, Malusi Gigaba, has denied at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that he received bags of cash from the Gupta family.
Gigaba continued to give testimony after being accused by several witnesses, including his estranged wife, Nomachule, of being close to the controversial family.
He claims that his estranged wife is trying to implicate him in wrongdoing amid their separation.
If she was there and saw me being given money, it was illicit and implicates her in an illegality.
So, when she was being coached about her affidavit, it would say you didnt see the bag or this money being given to him, you only saw it in the boot and you can only infer that it came from the Guptas, says the former Minister.
I wouldnt be able to tell the chairperson exactly her motives.
The reason she never saw the money being given to me or carried by me to the car and tries to implicate the protectors is because there was no such money, explains Gigaba.
Commission hears Gupta-related evidence
Gigaba has continued to dispute all allegations levelled against him by his estranged wife.
The former Minister also rejected Nomachules claim at the commission regarding then South African Airways (SAA) Chairperson, Dudu Myeni, giving him instructions from former President Jacob Zuma.
Gigaba also rejected his estranged wifes evidence that Myeni threatened at one stage that he would be sent back to being Home Affairs Minister, a less senior post, if he did not follow instructions.
The hearings will resume on Tuesday.
It will hear Prasa-related evidence from two employees of the the rail agency, including its Head of the Legal Division, Martha Ngoye.
Former Transnet Chief Financial Officer, Gary Pita, will also take the stand to give evidence related to the company.
Proceedings will start at 3pm.
Former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba has continued to dispute all allegations levelled against him at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg by his estranged wife, Noma.
Gigaba also rejected her claim at the commission regarding then SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni giving him instructions from Former President Jacob Zuma.
It would have been ridiculous of me to say I didnt understand why Ms Myeni was appointed because I was the Minister when she was appointed.
We requested Cabinet to appoint a new board and approve her appointment as chair as one of the people who served in the previous board appointed by Minister Hogan.
Last week, Gigaba disputed allegations made by his estranged wife that he had business dealings with the Gupta brothers.
Gigaba recalled going several times to the Gupta-owned Sahara Computers offices in Johannesburg to pick up invitations.
He insisted that he only had social and cultural interactions with the Guptas and not business dealings.
Gigaba told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he continued interacting with the Guptas even after he was appointed minister.
Building strong relationships with political parties, the media and other stakeholders are the hallmarks of success for the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Western Cape.
This is according to Reverend Courtney Sampson who served as provincial chairperson for the IEC for 22 years.
Sampson retired at the beginning of this month.
He cast his first vote at the age of 38.
Five years later, he was appointed Chairperson of the institution tasked with overseeing elections in the country.
Meanwhile, former ANC President, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to make presentations on the unity and renewal of the party.
He will contribute to how to reassert the ANC as a movement rooted among the people.
ANC PEC spokesperson, Loyiso Magqashela, says the meeting will also draw on the legacy of the founders of the party for the benefit of the current generation.
To strengthen the issue of the organisational renewal and unity, we have then to tap from the wisdom of those who led before so that at least our renewal trajectory gets to be guided and guided properly.
You would have nowadays understood how the ANC is pressured from left, right and centre
Now the renewal project then becomes key.
We want to assert the authority and the leadership of the ANC amongst the society, says Magqashela.
Magqashela says on Monday the organisation will engage various community stakeholders to listen to their concerns.
May 29, 2021. Political analyst Dr Luvuyo Dondolo says the ANC needs a long term solution if it is to renew the movement.
He says the party may regain a bit of trust following current interventions but going forward, they will have to put in more work
This after the ANC in the Eastern Cape announced tapping into the wisdom of those who led before by involving Mbeki in its three-day Provincial Executive Committee meeting currently under way in East London.
The involvement of former leaders such as President Thabo Mbeki, leaders who are perceived to have the moral campus as a way of this renewal of the ANC its a short term, it is the strategy that the ANC is using to win the hearts of the voters however the ANC needs permanent and long term solution, through this short term solution they might win the elections in some of the municipalities but there are certain metros where they will get strong contestation from other political organisations, he adds.
The African National Congress (ANC) has convened a three-day extended Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting at the East London International Convention Centre in the Eastern Cape.
Former ANC President, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to make presentations on the unity and renewal of the party.
We shall be bringing all those stakeholders under one roof because what is important is for us to then say here are the people, what is it that concerns them in the presence of the leadership so that at least when they present, the former President gets an opportunity to speak to those people and try and respond to whatever issues they would raise.
African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte, says contrary to misconceptions, the aim of the step aside resolution is not to target one person.
Her statement comes after suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, approached the High Court in Johannesburg to request it to declare the resolution unconstitutional and set aside his suspension.
He was suspended after he refused to step down.
Magashule faces several charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the alleged irregular awarding of more than R250 million in the Free State asbestos roofing audit contract.
Magashule was given 48 hours to publicly apologise to ANC branches after he wrote a suspension letter to party President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Speaking at the Northern Capes ninth ANC conference in Namakwa, Duarte said the resolution was aimed at those who had been charged with serious crimes.
Comrade John Block when he was charged, he did not hesitate to step aside.
Comrade Marius Fransman, I can go on; the list is quite long.
Comrade Pallo Jordan stood aside.
Comrade Mdu Manana stepped aside.
The issue here is not about an individual and that is where the issue is being made
The issue here is about the resolution of the ANC.
Suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule takes ANC to court:
African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson in the Northern Cape, Dr Zamani Saul, who is expected to be retained, has lambasted National Executive Committee (NEC) members who fail to take their own decisions seriously and to execute their tasks with integrity.
In recent weeks, some ANC NEC members have leaked recordings of their meetings to the media and the public, which Saul regards as ideologically bankrupt.
Speaking during the provinces ninth elective conference in Namakwa, Saul said the ANC NEC has the responsibility of providing leadership to all structures of the ANC and society.
We don’t want to see squabbling and fighting in the NEC; we can’t sit with political bankruptcy there.
We have NEC members who have converted NEC and NWC meetings into a new fun game which records NEC discussion and selectively leak them to the public and media.
This, comrades, is politics of brinkmanship and honestly must be stopped.
Zamani Saul says the ANC needs to restore its damaged image: stealing of branch members
A faction opposing Saul in the John Taolo Gaetsewe region, has accused the ANC of stealing branch members.
The regions ANC conference was postponed late Friday night.
It was to be the last regional conference before the provincial conference next week.
Saul, who is also Northern Cape Premier, says the Provincial Executive Committee will meet on Saturday to discuss the way forward.
All branches have not yet been registered because there are parallel structures that were submitted straight to the provincial secretary and not via the regional secretary.
So, they want to steal the branches and delegates, Party member Olebogeng Leserwane says.

Parliament has celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Constitution.
The final Constitution was adopted in December 1996 and it came into effect in February 1997.
Parliament held a joint sitting today, to reflect on its values and principles.
Hailed as the world’s best Constitution and anchored in human rights and dignity following decades of colonialism and apartheid, South Africas apex document elicits diverse responses.
Twenty-five years since the adoption of South Africas Constitution, the countrys lawmakers still dont agree on its value.
While the vast majority of political parties have described it as a proud achievement, others have equated it to an instrument of oppression and dispossession.
The two Houses of Parliament held a joint sitting debate to mark 25 years of the adoption of the Constitution
In 1996, South Africas Parliament held a joint sitting on the occasion of the adoption of its new constitution.
Up to the podium walked the then-Deputy President of the country to deliver a landmark oration that has become as iconic as the document itself.
Two and a half decades on, many South Africans are still in awe of this document that they call a living embodiment of their hopes and aspirations.
Instrument of freedom
In opening the debate, International Relations and Co-operation Minister, Naledi Pandor, has hailed those who participated in the drafting of the countrys Constitution.
She has praised leading African National Congress (ANC) leaders such as the late Zola Skweyiya and Kader Asmal for the important role they played.
Pandor says opposition party leaders such as Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, James Selfe of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Kenneth Meshoe of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) also made a meaningful contribution.
Pandor, who took part in a joint sitting debate, says the document unites the people of the country in a manner that no other legal document does.
Those who shaped our Constitution number millions.
Not just those who were in the constitutional assembly.
It does not belong to a few
It is our instrument of freedom honouring Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou Toure.
We in parliament and government have a critical role to claim in honour of these men and women and millions of others.
We need to consistently ensure that the ambitions of service to the people are honoured and realised, says Pandor.
"Reflecting on 25-years of the South African Constitution Political parties weigh in"
Some of the country’s leading lawmakers were themselves in their youth when the constitution was adopted.
Yet they too hold it in high regard
One of them, DA Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone calls for those who seek to undermine this document to be shunned.
She says it is the job of all Parliamentarians who took an oath to uphold the Constitution, should do so.
It is therefore essential that when this document is undermined we must take it for what it is a treasonous act.
We simply cannot have high-ranking politicians making statements that the Constitution should be ignored or is not going to be considered or even more worryingly, not affect their course of action.
We should have a collective outrage at such utterances and have the guts to take them and put them where they belong behind bars, says Mazzone.
Even though Buthelezi has handed the leadership of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) over to new, younger leaders, he continues to be viewed by many of his fellow MPs as an elder statesman whose counsel they value.
He says while he was unhappy about certain provisions of the Constitution, he is happy with the role his party played in its shaping.
EFF criticises Constitution
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) say South Africas constitution has done nothing to undo the oppression of black people.
The party says, in fact, it has cushioned those who benefited from oppression while millions of black people still live in abject poverty.
EFF National Chairperson Ntombovuyo Mente says the party will not rest until the constitution is amended to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.
It draws a moral equivalence between the needs of the dispossessed majority and the interests of the dispossessing minority.
It imagines a world where the persecuted live in peace with their persecutors with no redress and no material acknowledgment of the past wrongs.
It proclaims to recognise the injustices of our past while at the same time acting as a stonewall around those who perpetrated these injustices and their descendants, says Mente.
How has government and South Africans upheld the values of the Constitution?
Parliaments Joint Defence Portfolio Committee has called Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to appear before it to respond to allegations of corruption.
Mapisa-Nqakula is alleged to have received gifts and cash to the value of R5 million from a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) supplier.
The United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa brought the allegations to the attention of the committee, saying a whistle-blower presented them to him.
Mapisa-Nqakula has written to the committee denying the allegations.
However, Committee Co-chairperson Elleck Nchabeleng says they need more information from the Minister and the whistle-blower.
First engage and get time to engage the minister so we can get her responses
And then we can ask questions.
We need info from the whistle-blower, like a statement or an affidavit, at least we know someone has written something to us.
We need something tangible from this person.
Holomisa implicates Minister Mapisa-Nqakula in a R5 million scandal.
In April, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent investigation into allegations that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula wasted millions of taxpayers money on chartered flights and luxury accommodation.
The party says she must also be suspended without compensation pending the outcome of the investigation.
DA Shadow Defence Minister Kobus Marais says a dossier of evidence has been submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence, detailing at least five instances where doubt can be cast over Mapisa-Nqakulas actions.
Pressure is mounting from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and others for Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to step down or be removed by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
National Health Department briefs media on the irregular Digital Vibes contract: The Special Investigating Unit is probing allegations that the Department of Health had paid Digital Vibes R150-million for services related to the National Health Insurance (NHI) and the governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Alleged irregular contract between Health department and Digital Vibes.
Political analyst Tessa Dooms has raised questions over the veracity of claims made by Mkhize after he denied any involvement in the awarding of the irregular multi-million-rand contract by his Department.
Mkhizes former personal spokesperson, Tahera Mather, and former personal assistant, Naadhira Mitha, are reported to control the company, Digital Vibes, although the two are not listed as directors.
Dooms says it is hard to believe Mkhize as he contradicted himself in the press briefing.
Its very hard to believe him when he contradicted himself in the press briefing itself
He said he didnt know up until a point until he came to know that she was involved when she was setting up meetings with him in order to do the work that was being paid for; so, he clearly became aware at some point.
But of course, it would be highly irregular for that level of work to be done in his office and he not have a clue about it.

The chairperson of the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg, Justice Raymond Zondo says President Cyril Ramaphosa will make another appearance before the Commission at a later date in June.
Ramaphosa will appear as President of the country.
His previous appearance was as president of the African National Congress (ANC).
Ramaphosa was scheduled to give evidence next week but will no longer be doing so.
Zondo says he will announce another date in the course of June for when the President will appear.
Ramaphosa will be the last witness to give oral evidence at the commission which is wrapping up before starting work on its report.
State Capture Inquiry: 25 May 2021
Last month Ramaphosa appeared before the commission as the president of the ANC.
He is also expected to make closing remarks as the State President.
On Tuesday, the Commissions Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said they had hoped to finalise oral evidence at the end of March, and were working around the clock to make this possible.
He said he will make exceptional hearings where possible and will apply to the High Court for a limited extension to finalise the Commissions report.
Zondo said it was important that high-ranking officials in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) where there are serious allegations of corruption and state capture are given the time to complete their evidence.
Deputy Chief Justice Zondo said the Commission is mindful of the fact that there are some applications for leave to cross-examine.
He suggested that the Commission can make exceptions and some witnesses may still be called.
Legal expert Dr Llewellyn Curlewis says the special plea of former President Jacob Zuma calling for the recusal of State prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer in his corruption trial at the Pietermaritzburg High Court is a tall mountain to climb.
Zuma and French arms company, Thales, have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and corruption in the Pietermaritzburg High Court.
The matter has been postponed to July 19 for the arguments to be heard by Judge Piet Koen.
Curlewis says the defence will have to bring exceptional arguments to court for the special plea to be successful.
On Wednesday this week, Zuma’s legal team led by Advocate Dali Mpofu presented the court with a statement in terms of the special plea that will be argued on July 19.
The plea deals with section 106 1 H of the Criminal Procedure Act.
While the State will also have a chance to present their case in this regard, Downer told the court that separate counsel was preparing this response because he was in fact the main subject of this special plea.
Former President Zuma pleads not guilty:
Independence and impartiality
Through the statement read in court, Advocate Mpofu told the court that Zuma believes that Advocate Downer lacks independence and impartiality.
There are facts and circumstances that give me a reasonable impression that Downer had conducted himself in a manner that lacks independence and impartiality that is necessary for a lawful prosecution.
Downer failed to uphold the standard and prosecutorial independence needed to secure that my trial is fair and conducted in accordance with the Constitution.
Downer placed himself as a witness against me when he filed an affidavit in support of the Democratic Alliance application to review and set aside a decision by the NPA to terminate my prosecution
Curlewis says Judge Piet Koen will be positioned to hear the special plea as the trial Judge, saying it falls within the trial proceedings.
No, that is not possible.
The pre-proceedings have already taken place that means that the judge that is currently presiding will see the matter end out unless there is another reason for recusal that might come out later on.
But that is not anticipated
When offered the opportunity to respond on the matter of the special plea, Thales defence led by Advocate Barry Roux, humorously responded that they were merely passengers in the matter.
But he says the defence has a feat ahead of them to argue the special plea.
Once the special plea is determined, only then is the expected of the accused to formally then plea in terms of the lets call it the general type of pleas namely guilty or not guilty.
In this instance, not guilty as he has done.
It is not uncommon to enter into a special plea the one they have raised in section 106.
The 1 H to be specific where they actually want to remove the State Prosecutor from the proceedings.
In this instance advocate Billy Downer, now in very limited circumstances, will a court generally uphold such a special plea?
But the grounds that was advanced by Dali Mpofu on behalf of Zuma is that Billy Downer will not be objective and independent in his prosecution of this matter because at one stage filed an affidavit on behalf of the Democratic Alliance in a matter that was before court and based on that they say he is not independent.
Curlewis explains the process that will follow once Judge Koen hands down judgement- possibly not immediately- on the special plea.
If the defence is correct in their special plea and if the court upholds it and once again I repeat personally from what I have seen in the case law, and in our law journals and articles and authorities on this issue they will not be successful, but let assume for argument sake they are successful then they will also advance next prey before the court that is to the matter then be struck from the roll which will not happen because they have already pleaded not guilty in all those charges yesterday and if one reads section 106 specifically not talking about 106
The 1 H special plea I’m talking about the ordinary pleads of guilty or not guilty and this instance not guilty then the court must make a finding after such a plea only the court can do it, so no the matter will proceed after the 19.
Over the next few days, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will answer the submission by June 2.
Zumas legal team is expected to file their heads of argument by July 5, with the NPA following suit by July 12.
The hearing for the special plea is set down for July 19.
Zuma addresses a crowd of supporters after his court appearance on Wednesday.
Cabinet has expressed its concern over the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 infections with fears that the country is on a third wave.
The government is now consulting on the best response to the increasing number of infections with President Cyril Ramaphosa expected to address the nation soon.
On Wednesday, the Health department recorded over 4 600 new infections with COVID-19-related deaths surpassing 56 000.
The number of infections has been increasing in the past few days.
Briefing the media on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, Acting Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says they are still consulting on the governments best response to the pandemic.
The country has also embarked on Phase 2 of vaccine roll-out with people over the age of 60 being prioritised.
But with thousands of them already registered, Ntshavheni says they will have to wait a little longer for their jab.
She says the vaccination of those who have registered depends on the availability of vaccines in their provinces.
On the alleged corruption in the R150 million Digital Vibes COVID-19 contract and with pressure mounting for Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to step down, Minister Ntshavheni says in as much as they view any allegation of corruption seriously, the matter was not discussed at the Cabinet level.
She also says Cabinet is still considering the possibility of what should happen with the Gauteng e-tolls given the financial commitments made during the provincial road improvement programme.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has raised concerns over delays in reopening the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital after it was gutted by a fire a month ago.
The fire started in the storeroom that houses medical supplies and spread to other parts of the hospital.
Gauteng Premier David Makhura speaks to journalists outside the hospital.
DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom says some patients who were instructed to use nearby hospitals have not yet received medical care due to backlogs.
According to the department, there are sections of the hospital that are structurally safe.
I think that is very important to know
but the hospital management are awaiting a safety certificate from the JHB city council, says Bloom.
Meanwhile, I am getting the most terrible calls from patients, particularly cancer patients and people on dialysis who are not being accommodated.
People tell me they are trying all the various hotlines and they are not getting help.
It is a crisis happening because we are going into a third wave.
The problem with the closure of this hospital is that patients are being transferred to other hospitals which are very overcrowded and we need to know what is happening with the hospitals, explains Bloom.
Below is the full interview with Jack Bloom
Former President Jacob Zuma has called on all those who have authority over the countrys justice system to refrain from being biased in the name of settling political scores.
He says if the judges of South Africa want to command respect from him and his family, they will have to do the right thing in prosecuting him in the corruption trial.
Zuma was addressing a number of his supporters gathered in Pietermaritzburg after he appeared on fraud and corruption charges.
The former President says he wants the trial to come to a close soon.
I wish the law could stop being biased because its becoming a trend for the justice system to take sides.
Let that come to an end, so that we can respect the law.
If those who are in authority dont respect us, how are we going to respect them.
Zuma pleads not guilty
Zuma and French arms company Thales are facing fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges in connection with the 1999 multi-billion rand arms deal.
The trial has been postponed to July 19
SABC News Political Editor Mwandile Mbeje gives analyses on the trial.
The African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee (IPC), in the North West, has instructed five party members to step aside.
The members based in Tsetse village outside Mahikeng are implicated along with 11 others in serious charges, including attempted murder.
One of them is the branch secretary, while the others are senior government officials.
Provincial Coordinator for the ANC IPC, Hlomane Chauke, says the five accused have already been served with letters, informing them of the decision.
Chauke says, In terms of the resolution of the conference and guidelines we have already communicated with the five comrades that they need to step aside from the activities of the organisation
So we have communicated with them in terms of Rule 25. 7 that they need to step aside in terms of ANC activities.
SABC Reporter, Patrick Dintwa has more on the story.
On Wednesday, the South African Communist Party (SACP) in Limpopo urged all ANC members affected by the step aside resolution to comply.
According to the party, only one of eight affected ANC members in Limpopo have heeded the call voluntarily, while others were served with suspension notice.
The SACP says the whole country expects them to comply:
Last week, suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule filed court papers challenging the constitutionality of the step aside resolution that resulted in his suspension.
All leaders of the governing party who face charges relating to fraud, corruption and money laundering had to step aside from their positions.
Magashule refused to do so and was suspended by the ANC NEC.
Its been 15 years since allegations of corruption first surfaced against former President Jacob Zuma.
Now his trial finally started in the Pietermaritzburg Court on Wednesday.
Zuma and French arms manufacturer Thales, both pleaded not guilty to the charges they face including racketeering, corruption, fraud and money laundering in connection with the controversial arms deal of the 1990s.
The trial has been postponed to the 19th of July for argument, in the special plea application brought by Zuma against lead State Prosecutor senior counsel advocate Billy Downer.
Hearing adjourned until 19 July 2021.
Former Presidents legal team led by Advocate Dali Mpofu has, through a statement in terms of a special plea, accused State Advocate Billy Downer of lacking independence and impartiality.
Mpofu says that Zuma had been, in his own words, crying for his day in court and offered up a lengthy explanation as to why his client believed he would not receive a fair trial as long as Advocate Downer led the States case.
There are facts and circumstances that give me a reasonable impression that Mr. Downer had conducted himself in a manner that lacks the independence and impartiality that is necessary for a lawful prosecution.
Mr. Downer failed to uphold the standard and prosecutorial independence needed to secure that my trial is fair and conducted in accordance with the Constitution, Mr. Downer placed himself as a witness against me when he filed an affidavit in support of the Democratic Alliance application to review and set aside a decision by the NPA to terminate my prosecution.
Despite Zumas so-called Stalingrad tactics employed to use every legal aspect to his disposal to halt his prosecution, he failed to convince the courts that the charges should be dismissed due to alleged political interference in the states case against him.
Thales faces four charges, one of racketeering, two of corruption and one of money laundering.
State accuses Zuma and Thales of organising and conducting a racketeering enterprise, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment.
The state alleges that Zuma received hundreds of payments amounting to millions of rands via his then financial adviser, convicted fraudster, Shabir Shaik, at the time of the arms deal acquisition process in the 1990s.
The state alleges that Zuma received a bribe of R500 000 a year from Thales, facilitated by Shaik.
Other charges against Zuma include fraudulent tax claims and returns, non-disclosure of financial assistance to Parliament and lying to the institution about meeting with representatives from the arms manufacturer.
Advocate Downer has told the court the State was not yet ready to respond to the special plea, referring to the over 1 000-page document as voluminous.
He says that it covered the lengthy litigation period.
My Lord we then perused these papers and we are hard at work drafting our answer on these papers we have formed an attitude that the state is ready to put the charges to the accused and between my Learned Friend and the state agree than they will then tender their plea formally in court both the accused I must also mention that we also agreed the application in term of 106 I H is voluminous with thousand pages with annexes we all agreed that the state needs time to answer by the way of affidavits.
The former Presidents son Edward Zuma in court to support his father.
Thales said in its plea explanation, denies that it was aware of any payments to Zuma via Shaik.
Thales contends that its payments to Shaiks businesses were legitimate business deals as a BEE partner in the arms deal.
Downer served the indictment on both Zuma and Thales, represented by Pierre-Marie du Randt.

Prince Philip passed away this morning at Windsor Castle at the age of 99.
The prince recently spent a month in hospital for heart-related surgery.
Flags are flying at half-mast in Britain.
Johnson says Prince Philip was a devoted consort to Queen Elizabeth.
Prince Philip spent over seven decades by the Queens side after marrying in 1947.
A statement from The Royal Family says further announcements would be made in due course.
After earning the label as one of the hardest working royals, the Duke of Edinburgh retired from official royal duties with the full support of the Queen in 2017.
Spending a lifetime supporting The Queen, often a step or two behind her in public to observe protocol, they marked their 73rd wedding anniversary last November.
Born on the Greek Island of Corfu in 1921, Philip Mountbatten’s engagement to Princess Elizabeth, as she was then, was announced in 1947.
Philip had spent the Second World War serving in the Navy, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his bravery and quick thinking during fierce fighting.
Wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill described the royal wedding in November 1947 as a flash of colour in a country struggling to rebuild after the horrors of war.
His Royal Highness, as he became known from then onwards, was forced to cut his naval career short with the worsening health of his father in law, King George VI.
It was whilst in Kenya, on a tour of the Commonwealth, that Prince Philip told his wife that the King had died, and she was now queen.
From the coronation in 1953 to when he retired from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip was never far from the Queens side.
But as a husband, and not a King, he was left to forge his own path.
His socialising in 1950s London raised eyebrows, and his blunt and sometimes insensitive comments when on royal visits, were front page news.
But his concern for the welfare of children and young adults became a driving force in his life.
The scheme that still bears his name helped build self-confidence and create fun and friendships for young people from all walks of life.
With his Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, he shaped and inspired the lives of countless young people and at literally tens of thousands of events, he fostered their hopes and encouraged their ambitions.
We remember the duke for all of this and above all for his steadfast support for Her Majesty the Queen, not just as her consort, by her side, every day of her reign, but as her husband, her strength and stay of more than 70 years, says Prime Minister Johnson.
The Duke of Edinburgh visited 143 countries in an official capacity, often on solo tours.
Keen to modernise the monarchy, he had the ear of the longest reigning British monarch through some turbulent times.
In later years his public role diminished, although palace insiders often said that his influence didn’t.
Additional reporting by SABC News UK Correspondent, John Bevir.
Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth and a leading figure in the British royal family for almost seven decades, has died aged 99, Buckingham Palace said on Friday.
The Duke of Edinburgh, as he was officially known, had been by his wife’s side throughout her 69-year reign, the longest in British history, during which time he earned a reputation for a tough, no-nonsense attitude and a propensity for occasional gaffes.
It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the palace said in a statement.
His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle.
Further announcements will be made in due course.
The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.
Discussing the mood outside Buckingham Palace following Prince Philips passing.
A Greek prince, he married Elizabeth in 1947 playing a key role in modernising the monarchy in the post-World War Two period, and behind the walls of Buckingham Palace being the one key figure the queen could turn to and trust.
He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.
Chairperson of the Music Publishing Association of South Africa David Alexander says local musicians are struggling to make ends meet and are desperate for an intervention.
The association works to safeguard music publishers and engages with government to ensure artists receive adequate compensation.
Artists across the country have been battling to stay afloat with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Alexander says many artists could be forced to turn their backs on the industry.
I think its facing a crisis; I think there are a lot of professionals in the industry that are considering alternative careers.
Many are already working doing other jobs, whether they are driving or waiting tables or doing handyman work.
I think the longer the COVID-19 crisis continues, the more people will leave the creative industry because there isnt the support from government for the industry.
Earlier, it was reported that the COVID-19 pandemic caught many industries off guard, and forced those in the creative sector to do things differently.
For months live events and social gatherings were halted, which meant no income for artists who rely on live performances as their main stream of income.
Most of them slowly moved their craft to digital platforms.
Small and developing companies depending on events, social gatherings and concerts were hit hard.
Gatherings of large groups of people were prohibited for entertainment purposes.
However, CEO of Tencent Africa Brett Loubser says the move to digital has been growing steadily.
Impact of COVID-19 on artists.
US singer Dionne Warwick, who has reigned as a diva for over six decades, is now using her voice as the Queen of Twitter, spreading joy and poking fun in viral tweets to a new audience.
The pop legend, 80, regularly tweets her thoughts on life, career and fellow musicians, sometimes prompting responses that lead to heart-warming exchanges.
If you are very obviously a rapper why did you put it in your stage name?
Warwick asked Chance the Rapper in a tweet.
I cannot stop thinking about this.
I will be whatever you want to call me Ms Warwick, Chance responded.
The five-time Grammy Award winner was surprised Chance even knew who she was.
It all started when Warwick saw her nieces and nephews having fun on Twitter and wanted to join in.
Once she got the hang of it, Warwick decided how she would use her new platform.
I’m going to do it when I have an urge to say something or feel that I need to say something and/or ask a question, somebody is going to answer it, she recalled telling her niece who showed her the ropes.
Warwick, who is often referred to now as the Queen of Twitter, relishes bringing positive energy to social media.
that’s one of the things I’m enjoying more than anything else in the world, that everybody’s laughing with me, you know, and that I think is something that has been missing, she said.
Warwick is also trail blazing with virtual concerts.
Her first was held live from home on Easter Sunday.
I had a little bit of anxiety, based on the fact that I had not sung in a complete year, and vocal cords are muscles and muscles had to be exercised, and I don’t do that, she said.
I wanted to do a disclaimer, you know, there might be a couple of squeaks, croaks, she said with a laugh.
She will perform a second show on May 9, which is Mother’s Day in the United States.
A three-week long sit-in protest at the office of the Northern Cape MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture by artists has been called off.
The department and the artists have reached an agreement over a R4 million plan of action for the arts in the province.
The plan includes the full operation of the Northern Cape Theatre and the establishment of hubs for arts and crafts in the province.
Artist Mkhululi Mabija says they are now ready to get back to work.
Finally, they could see and take artists seriously and that has been the problem.
People sometimes think this is a hobby, but now they can see we were dead serious.
This is our living.
We need to all come together as a sector to discuss our concerns.
There is a programme ready for the year at the theatre.
So, we can start including everybody from the districts in the programme, explains Mabija.
Northern Cape Department of Sports, Arts and Culture, Conrad Fortune, says R4 million has been allocated.
After an intensive exercise of re-prioritising and re-planning we have managed to allocate an amount of R4 million to assist with the implementation of the three projects.
We are also in the process of developing a service level agreement, which basically indicates how the funding will be utilised and remain in line with all the financial policies and acts of government when incurring expenses, he adds.
Giorgio Armani may consider a joint venture with another Italian company, the founder of the Milanese fashion house told US magazine Vogue, opening the door for the first time to a potential business partner.
In an interview published on the vogue.com website, Armani, 86, said the COVID-19 emergency had made us open our eyes a bit.
Armani ruled out going the way of many other Italian luxury goods brands, including Gucci, Fendi and Bulgari, which have been bought by industry giants LVMH and Kering SA, saying a French buyer was not on the cards.
However, he said his long-held idea that the company should remain independent was no longer so strictly necessary.
One could think of a liaison with an important Italian company, he said without elaborating, except to add that it did not have to be a fashion company.
Vogue also quoted Armani’s niece Roberta Armani, who works at the family’s company, as saying it could be great, finally, to have an important Made in Italy joint venture in the fashion industry though she added she had no insight on her uncles plans.
Facebook Inc did not notify the more than 530 million users whose details were obtained through the misuse of a feature before 2019 and recently made public in a database, and does not currently have plans to do so, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
Business Insider reported last week that phone numbers and other details from user profiles were available in a public database.
Facebook said in a blog post on Tuesday that malicious actors had obtained the data prior to September 2019 by scraping profiles using a vulnerability in the platforms tool for synching contacts.
The Facebook spokesman said the social media company was not confident it had full visibility on which users would need to be notified.
He said it also took into account that users could not fix the issue and that the data was publicly available in deciding not to notify users.
Facebook has said it plugged the hole after identifying the problem at the time.
The scraped information did not include financial information, health information or passwords, Facebook said.
However, the collated data could provide valuable information for hacks or other abuses.
Facebook, which has long been under scrutiny over how it handles user privacy, in 2019 reached a landmark settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission over its investigation into allegations the company misused user data.
Irelands Data Protection Commission, the European Unions lead regulator for Facebook, said on Tuesday it had contacted the company about the data leak.
It said it received no proactive communication from Facebook but was now in contact.
The July 2019 FTC settlement requires Facebook to report details about unauthorized access to data on 500 or more users within 30 days of confirming an incident.
The Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the company’s conversations with regulators but said it was in contact to answer their questions.
In a hall at London’s Royal Academy of Music, pianist Yuanfan Yang performs pieces by Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt and Joseph Haydn with just a cameraman for company.
The 24-year-old is taking part in the first round of the Leeds International Piano Competition, hoping to win over a jury that will see his performance by video.
Held every three years, The Leeds has had to change its processes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no live jury or audience watching Yang and his fellow pianists compete for a coveted prize.
I thought it might be a bit challenging at first, but once I started playing, I just forgot about everything, Edinburgh-born Yang said.
It was just literally just me and the music.
With travel restrictions in place, The Leeds invited some 60 competitors from around the world to its virtual first round this week, increasing the number of host cities to 17 from 2018s three so that the selected pianists could take part close to their home or place of study.
From one competitor in Miami to 14 in Berlin, they all performed their roughly 25-minute recitals under the same conditions: playing on a Steinway Model D grand piano and with identical camera set ups.
We realised very quickly that we couldn’t do it in the way which we would love to do it with an audience and the jury present, Adam Gatehouse, The Leeds artistic director, told Reuters.
Clearly we were not going to be able to travel a jury from London to Berlin to wherever all around the world so we will watch the videos at home online and judge them in that way.
He added the competition would in future keep aspects of this year’s event, namely cutting travel distances for crews and contestants but would welcome live audiences.
First held in 1963, The Leeds is a prestigious music competition offering a career-making package of prizes for its winner: a recording and management deal, recitals at London’s Wigmore Hall and tours of Europe and East Asia among other bonuses.
Up until the last minute I thought (The Leeds) would be cancelled, Italian pianist Giulia Contaldo, who practiced playing in front of a cameraman before the competition, said.
So many of my colleagues don’t have this opportunity, or don’t have any opportunities at the moment.
So whatever happens, I am grateful.
While the first round is virtual, organisers plan to hold the second round, semi-final and final in Leeds in September, hopefully with a live audience.
Music has been and always will be a social occasion, Israeli competitor Ariel Lanyi said.
Its not only about the music itself but its also about the people in the hall and
That is how it’s supposed to be.
Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will produce their first Netflix Inc series that will focus on athletes competing in the Invictus Games for injured veterans in The Hague in 2022.
Harry will appear on camera in the documentary series called Heart of Invictus and serve as an executive producer through the couples Archewell Productions, Netflix said in a statement on Tuesday.
The series will provide behind-the-scenes stories of athletes and organisers as they prepare for the event, which has been delayed until next spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Netflix said.
Orlando von Einsiedel will direct the multi-episode series and Joanna Natasegara will be its producer, Netflix said.
The duo produced the Oscar-winning short documentary The White Helmets about a rescue group in Syria.
The Invictus Games is a multi-sport event created in 2017 by Prince Harry who served as a soldier in Afghanistan for military personnel wounded in action.
The couple, who has been in the news following an interview with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey last month, signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix in September.
Harry and Meghan now live in Southern California after making a final split with the British royal family.
Queen Elizabeth says she is saddened by Harry and Meghan’s experiences.
Kim Kardashian has added billionaire to her resume.
The cosmetics and shapewear businesswoman, who launched her career off the reality TV series Keeping Up with The Kardashians, was included on Tuesday for the first time on Forbes magazine’s list of the worlds billionaires.
The Forbes estimate means Kardashian joins her soon-to-be ex-husband Kanye West in the billionaires club.
Forbes on Tuesday estimated Wests net worth at $1.8 billion, mostly from deals on his Yeezy sneaker and fashion line.
Kardashian filed for divorce from West, 43, in February, citing irreconcilable differences.
Her half sister Kylie Jenner, however, lost her billionaire status, Forbes said on Tuesday.
It valued the 23-year-olds fortune at around $700 million, citing a tough year for cosmetic sales during the coronavirus pandemic and what it said were previous overestimates of revenue from Kylie Cosmetics, now 51% owned by Coty Inc.
Kardashian founded KKW Beauty in 2017, promoting and selling the products online, helped by a social media presence that includes some 213 million Instagram followers.
She launched the multihued shapewear line Skims in 2019.
Kardashian celebrated on Tuesday by posting a photo of herself in a bikini on a beach, with the caption Bliss and announcing the launch of the first Skims pop-up shop at a high-end shopping mall in Los Angeles.
Named Heart Of Invictus, the show is being produced under the banner of Archewell production, the creative arm of Meghan and Harry’s non-profit foundation Archewell Organisation, the video-streaming company said on Tuesday.
Netflix said the series will provide behind-the-scenes stories of athletes and organizers as they prepare for the event, which has been delayed until next Spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The duo is known for their Oscar-winning work in short documentary The White Helmets.
The Invictus Games is a multi-sport event created in 2017 by Prince Harry for military personnel wounded in action.
The couple, who has been in the news following an explosive interview with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey last month, signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix in September.
Harry and Meghan now live in Southern California after making a final split with the royal family.
They are working with Winfrey on a documentary series about mental health for the Apple TV+ streaming service.
The death of prolific Sesotho author, Dr Kgotso Maphalla, has been described as a colossal loss in the literary fraternity.
Most of his works have been prescribed for schools and tertiary institutions.
Maphalla won his first major literary prize in 1980, in the Sesotho poetry competition of the Radio Bantu Sesotho Service, now known as Lesedi FM.
The 66-year-old author passed away after suffering a stroke.
Affectionately known as KPD, the multi-award-winning author published more than 70 Sesotho literary works.
Dr Kgotso Maphalla also wrote several radio dramas.
The selfless veteran mentored many budding authors.
Several of his works have also been analysed for dissertations and doctoral studies.
Sesotho Literature Museum Assistant Director, Tseliso Masolane says they will continue to preserve and develop Sesotho in his honour.
Ntate Maphalla was an all-rounded person.
Even if you look at all his writings, there will always be an element of religion.
He would never just write lyrics or maybe write empty lines.
It would always resonate revolution, always make sure Basotho know where they come from and ensure that they keep up with that.
The Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) has described Maphalla as a custodian of Sesotho.
PanSALB, Nikiwe Matebula, says Maphalla always produced quality work.
As the PanSALB, we always like to instill pride in home languages because that is our main mandate, to ensure that we promote all languages of South Africa.
So, that was the most fascinating fact when it came to his writings, that he fights for the language.
He writes very good quality novels.
His literary work is of quality.
That’s what really fascinates us about his work.
Prolific Sesotho authors death described as a colossal loss. A teacher by profession, Maphallas illustrious career started more than 40 years ago.
Publisher and author, Pule Lechesa wrote a book about Maphalla’s life called the The literacy legacy of Dr KDP Maphalla.
Lechesa says KDP will be remembered for his steadfast passion for Sesotho and writing.
He has also taught us that as writers we must always be united as he used to say bangodi ke metjodi meaning the writers are like shepherds.
They must work together because if anything happens to them the sheep will scatter around.
He taught us that as writers we should always advocate for unity.
Maphalla was bestowed with several lifetime achiever awards.
His plethora of awards and accolades include the MNET Award and the Chairpersons Award by the South African Literary Awards.
He was also bestowed an honorary doctorate from the University of the Free State in 2007.
University of the Free States Dr Nyefolo Malete, says Maphalla was trying to depict the life of an ordinary black person oppressed by Apartheid.
As a political activist through his writing, we realised in so many books that he was trying to depict the life of an ordinary black person who was oppressed by the previous regime.
A relative says Maphalla was the face of the family.
Spokesperson, Lefu Maphalla says his passing is a great loss.
He was the most recognisable face of the Maphalla family and even because of him, we happened to know each other.
So, he was this shining star amongst us and not only that, and even to the community that he lived amongst he was always surrounded by people because he was also a community builder.
The family is yet to finalise memorial and funeral arrangements.
Rest in power Dr KPD Maphalla, at the very young age of 66.
Ntate Kgotso Maphalla wrote classic Sesotho and English radio plays & poetry and prose.
Many of his titles are not yet accounted for; so far, 47 works in 80 publications in 2 languages and 616 library holdings.
The musician and actor reportedly suffered a heart attack during a drug overdose on Friday.
A hospital spokesperson declined to release his condition or even confirm that he was a patient there, citing privacy laws.
A hospital spokeswoman declined to release his condition or even confirm to Reuters that DMX, 50, who was born Earl Simmons, was a patient there, citing privacy laws.
His family, in a statement widely reported in celebrity media, said he was rushed on Friday, April 2, to the facility roughly 30 miles (48 km) north of New York City after facing serious health issues.
Known to his fans by his stage name DMX or Dark Man X, Simmons was reported to be on life support on Monday, according to RollingStone.
Celebrity publications TMZ and Billboard reported over the weekend that Simmons, who has had a public history of substance abuse, was rushed to the hospital after suffering a heart attack at his home about 11 p.m. Friday.
Neither his publicist, manager nor his lawyer immediately responded to Reuters request for comment on the singer and the reports.
The singer, a fixture in the music world since the 1990s, has long struggled with illegal drug use and has spoken about entering rehab in 2019 after serving federal prison time for tax fraud.
He was convicted of failing to pay $1.7 million in taxes from 2000 to 2005, by shifting money among accounts belonging to managers and associates.
Simmons also has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama Belly, the 2000 action movie Romeo Must Die, and the 2003 heist film Cradle 2 the Grave.
A sit-in in the office of the Northern Cape MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture by some Kimberley artists has entered its third week.
The artists are demanding a revival of the arts, COVID-19 relief funds for some and the full operation of the Northern Cape theatre.
They believe this move will help them recover income lost due to COVID-19 regulations.
Mkhululi Mabija, who is an artist, says they are demanding operations at theatres.
We demanding that the theatre be operational, the craft and the music hub be operational too for our artists to actually work.
But we need the support of the MEC and the province to support us in our quest.
Theyve not been taking us seriously, conversations have been had and conversations have just been left in mid-air.
And until our demands are met, then well move away from here, says Mabija.
The provincial Department of Sports Arts and Culture says there are plans to meet the artists halfway.
Northern Cape Department of Sports, Arts and Culture Conrad Fortune says an amount of R4 million has been allocated.
We are also in the process of developing a service level agreement which basically indicates how the funding will be utilised and remain in line with all the financial policies and acts of government when incurring expenses.
The artists say the departments delay to prioritise their demands is further compromising their already insufficient income.
The cast of British royal drama The Crown took the top television prize for drama at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards on Sunday while Schitts Creek, the story of a once-wealthy family forced to relocate to a small town, was named best television comedy.
Gillian Anderson, who plays British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in The Crown, which focused its most recent season on the troubled marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, also picked up best actress award.
Heavy is the head that wears The Crown Congratulations to this amazing ensemble!
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, 2021’s SAG ceremony was scaled down from a gala dinner to a one-hour presentation, held remotely, and peppered with jokes about how actors filled their free time during lockdown or got a start in their careers.
On the film side, courtroom drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 and jazz period film Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom were the big winners at one of the last major ceremonies before the Oscars.
The SAG awards are chosen by members of the acting union.
Many of the SAG winners and nominees are also up for honours at the British BAFTA awards next week and the Independent Spirit Awards on 22 April.
Godzilla vs. Kong muscled its way to a pandemic-era box office record, giving Hollywood studios and theatre owners alike hope that people are ready to return to the movies after a year of watching Netflix at home.
The tent pole, from Warner Bros. and Legendary Entertainment, generated $32 million over the weekend and $48.5 million in its first five days of release.
The time has come to choose a side!
Prior to this weekend, Wonder Woman1984 had the biggest three-day start with $16.7 million, followed by Tom and Jerry with $14 million.
The results for Godzilla vs. Kong are especially impressive because the film is also available to HBO Max subscribers for no extra fee.
Its unclear how many people have streamed the movie.
David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, called opening weekend ticket sales strong given the still-difficult conditions.
More than 50% of movie theatres in the country have reopened, but many, including those in New York City and Los Angeles, have been operating at reduced capacity to comply with pandemic safety protocols.
While its half of what it would be under normal circumstances, the weekend is a clear and positive indication that movie-going has inherent strengths that aren’t going away, he said.
Though ticket sales for Godzilla vs. Kong are certainly encouraging, the United States box office has yet to fully recover from the yearlong shutdown.
Godzilla vs. Kong wasn’t this weekend only new release.
Sony Pictures horror film The Unholy pulled in $3.2 million from 1 850 locations, a modest start for the low-budget movie.
It narrowly beat out Universal’s action thriller Nobody for third place on box office charts.
Nobody, starring Bob Odenkirk as a mild-mannered father-turned- vigilante, earned $3million in its second weekend, boosting its domestic tally to $11.8 million.
In fourth, Disney’s animated adventure Raya and the Last Dragon made $2 million from 2 031 locations.
The film, which is also playing on Disney Plus for a premium $30 fee, has grossed $32 million at the domestic box office.
Tom and Jerry rounded out the top five, amassing $1.5 million in its sixth weekend in theatres.
To date, the movie has made $39.5 million in the US.
Its also available on HBO Max.
The Presiding Officer of the Methodist Church, Bishop Purity Malinga, says the availability of vaccines against the coronavirus is a sign of hope and one of the good news stories to tell this Easter.
Bishop Malinga was delivering the sermon during a virtual Easter Sunday Service broadcast on SABC 2, hosted by the South African Council of Churches (SACC) and its member churches.
She stressed that vaccination should not be discriminatory.
The Bishop says despite all the darkness the country is faced with, there is hope.
We have seen the darkness of corruption, Gender-Based Violence, poverty, hunger; the list goes on.
As Easter people, we do not despair; we do not lose hope.
Rather we lift up the signs of hope as we see because Jesus is alive.
We find courage in lifting up any sign of hope that we see.
It is because of the good news of Easter that we lift up vaccination as a sign of hope, calling for it to be made available to all; whether they are rich or poor, she says.
The Vice President of the South African Council of Churches, Reverend Frank Chikane, gave recognition to frontline healthcare workers who put their lives at risk to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.
He was delivering the Benediction and gave concluding remarks at the service.
Our frontline workers risked their lives daily to safe our lives.
But one thing is certain that God we believe in is a God whos always present with us.
He was forsaken on the Cross so that we never get forsaken.
Jesus is Emmanuel,- that is God with us.
Our God is also an all knowing God,- an omniscient God.
God knows what we are going through and knows how to make up for our loss.
God knows how to heal us from the ravages of life and the coronavirus.
Our God is all powerful and he is able to save us and be with us under difficult circumstances, Chikane said.
Also speaking at the event, SACC Secretary General, Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana, said the last year was a year of helplessness against the coronavirus.
Bishop Mpumlwana says Easter brings hope despite the challenges the country is facing due to the pandemic.
Praise be to the God and father to our Lord Jesus Christ.
In his great mercy, he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
It is to that hope that we come this morning.
We have come through a year of grief, anxiety, of fear and distress, year of exasperation and a sense of helplessness against the COVID-19 pandemic.
In faith on Good Friday, we consciously mounted these troubles on the cross of the crucified Christ.
This morning we come to celebrate the resurrection of our Lord with restored faith and confidence of the power of live over death, he said.
Concerns over slow vaccine rollout
Speaking during the Easter Vigil Service, which was held at St Georges Cathedral, in Cape Town, Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba raised concern over the governments slow COVID-19 vaccine rollout programme, especially in poor and marginalised communities.
Makgoba says he is sceptical about how long it will take to administer vaccines across the country.
We know very well that there are large areas of our country where political corruption has poisoned public healthcare systems.
Shame on those who have left hospitals and clinics short of people, equipment and protection.
I have read that on the current strategy it would take 18-years to vaccinate our entire present population!
We cannot allow that to happen, he added.
So far, 269 102 healthcare workers have been vaccinated the country prepares for the second phase of the programme.
A leaker says they are offering information on more than 500 million Facebook users, including phone numbers and other data, virtually for free.
The database appears to be the same set of Facebook-linked telephone numbers that has been circulating in hacker circles since January and whose existence was first reported by tech publication Motherboard, according to Alon Gal, co-founder of Israeli cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock.
Reuters was not immediately able to vet the information, which is being offered for a few euros worth of digital credit on a well-known site for low-level hackers, but Gal said on Saturday that he had verified the authenticity of at least some of the data by comparing it against phone numbers of people he knew.
Other journalists say they have also been able to match known phone numbers to the details in the data dump.
In a statement, Facebook said that the data was very old and related to an issue that it had fixed in August 2019.
An attempt by Reuters to reach the leaker over the messaging service Telegram was not immediately successful.
Gal told Reuters that Facebook users should be alert to social engineering attacks by people who may have obtained their phone numbers or other private data in the coming months.
News of the latest leak here was first reported by Business Insider.
A grand parade conveyed 22 ancient Egyptian royal mummies in special capsules across the capital Cairo on Saturday to a new museum home where they can be displayed in greater splendour.
The convoy transported 18 kings and four queens, mostly from the New Kingdom, from the Egyptian Museum in central Cairos Tahrir Square to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Fustat, about 5km (3 miles) to the south-east.
Authorities shut down roads along the Nile for the elaborate ceremony, designed to drum up interest in Egypt’s rich collections of antiquities when tourism has almost entirely stalled because of COVID-19 related restrictions.
As the royal mummies arrived at the museum, which was officially inaugurated on Saturday, cannons fired a 21-gun salute.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stood by as the mummies filed past on vehicles bedecked with golden pharaonic motifs.
The heads of the UN cultural agency UNESCO and the World Tourism Organization were also present at the ceremony.
Each mummy had been placed in a special capsule filled with nitrogen to ensure protection, Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass said.
They were carried on vehicles designed to cradle them and provide stability.
We chose the Civilization Museum because we want, for the first time, to display the mummies in a civilized manner, an educated manner, and not for amusement as they were in the Egyptian Museum, Hawass said
Popular rapper and actor Earl Simmons, known to his fans by the stage name DMX or Dark Man X, was reportedly in grave condition Saturday in a New York hospital after suffering a heart attack triggered by an apparent drug overdose, according to the celebrity publications TMZ and Billboard.
The publications reported that Simmons, 50, who has had a public history of substance abuse, was rushed to a White Plains, New York, hospital after suffering a heart attack at his home about 11 p.m. Friday.
His publicist did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment on the singer, who has been a fixture in the music world since the 1990s.
Reuters has not independently verified the news accounts.
The musician has been open about his struggles with illegal drug use and has spoken about entering rehab in 2019 after serving time in federal prison on a tax fraud conviction.
A Manhattan federal court found that he failed to pay $1.7 million in taxes from 2000 to 2005, by shifting money among accounts belonging to managers and associates.
His debut album in 1998 Its Dark and Hell is Hot, was listed as number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States and sold more than 5 million copies.
Along with his rap career, Simmons has starred in such films as the 1998 crime drama Belly, the 2000 action movie Romeo Must Die, and the 2003 heist film Cradle 2 the Grave.
Churchgoers at the Good Friday service at St Georges Cathedral in Cape Town, in the Western Cape, say they are grateful that they are able to attend in 2021.
In 2020, Easter services across South Africa were cancelled when the nation was placed under strict Level 5 lockdown after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country.
Under the current revised Level 1 restrictions, 250 people are allowed to attend indoor gatherings and 500 people are allowed to attend outside gatherings.
Church congregants gather in small, controlled numbers at places of worship in Cape Town. About 50 people attended the morning service at St Georges Cathedral.
They shared their feelings.
It felt a bit bitter sweet.
Its been a bit weird for this entire year and for most of last year, we haven’t been able to attend church
and so it feels really solemn and really special to be able to be here today, one congregant says.
This is a high holiday for us as Christians and I missed it.
I’m just so privileged to be among the saints and remember more than 2 000 years ago that a man, just an ordinary man, gave his life for the whole world and Im one of them.
So I made an effort this morning to get up and to come to the house of the Lord, says another congregant.
Dean of St Georges Cathedral, Reverend Michael Weeder, says the church will be extremely cautious when hosting services, in order to comply with strict COVID-19 protocols to curb the spread of the virus.
Reverend Weeder says congregants are also encouraged to worship at home.
The intuitive sense is to stay at home if you’ve got co-morbidities; God is everywhere.
We said that right at the beginning of the lockdown, and particularly on our first Good Friday and Easter, we encourage our people, with the understanding that God is worshipped wherever we breathe, wherever we live, wherever we love and care; and so that is a very essential reality of faith.
You don’t need a magnificent building.
The creation is the cathedral of God’s gift to us, he adds.
Congregants gather at the St Georges Cathedral to observe Easter.
Services at various churches around the world are expected to continue over the weekend as Christians commemorate Easter.
A grand parade will convey 22 ancient Egyptian royal mummies in specially designed capsules across the capital Cairo on Saturday to a new museum home where they can be displayed in greater splendour.
The convoy will transport 18 kings and four queens, mostly from the New Kingdom, from the Egyptian Museum in central Cairos Tahrir Square to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Fustat, about 5km (3 miles) to the south-east.
Authorities are shutting down roads along the Nile for the elaborate ceremony, designed to drum up interest in Egypts rich collection of antiquities when tourism has almost entirely stalled because of COVID-19 related restrictions.
Each mummy will be placed in a special capsule filled with nitrogen to ensure protection, and the capsules will be carried on carts designed to cradle them and provide stability, Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass said.
We chose the Civilization Museum because we want, for the first time, to display the mummies in a civilized manner, an educated manner, and not for amusement as they were in the Egyptian Museum, he said.
Archaeologists discovered the mummies in two batches at the complex of mortuary temples of Deir Al Bahari in Luxor and at the nearby Valley of the Kings from 1871.
The oldest is that of Seqenenre Tao, the last king of the 17th Dynasty, who reigned in the 16th century BC and is thought to have met a violent death.
The parade will also include the mummies of Ramses II, Seti I, and Ahmose-Nefertari.
Fustat was the site of Egypt’s capital under the Umayyad dynasty after the Arab conquest.
By doing it like this, with great pomp and circumstance, the mummies are getting their due, said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo.
These are the kings of Egypt, these are the pharaohs.
And so, it is a way of showing respect.
When Holy Week processions were cancelled because of Spain’s COVID-19 restrictions, keeping a Good Friday drumming tradition alive took on extra importance for the residents of Calanda.
Dressed in vivid purple costumes, they played the drums in the streets, in front of houses or from balconies as part of the Rompida de la Horaz.
The drums boomed throughout this south-eastern Spanish town of 3 700 inhabitants but with all the players observing social distancing.
This Holy Week is a little sadder because I like to be with my friends and play the Calanda drum with them
but we hope that next year this will pass and let us get together, said Ivan Rodriguez, 24, a drummer and local resident.
After all the suffering of the last year, Santiago Villanueva, another resident, said residents felt a strong need to keep up the tradition.
We are having a very sad time but the spirit continues, he said.
Molapisi from the Ethiopian Episcol Church has described the past year as midnight in the lives of many people.
She likened the coronavirus pandemic to the sudden darkening of the sun during Jesus last moments on the cross.
Molapisi was one of the Speakers at the South African Council of Churches (SACC)
Virtual Good Friday Service that was broadcast on SABC 2.
She says before Jesus died, there was what seemed like a spiritual midnight, much like the past year for many people.
Before Jesus shouted out, Father into your hands I commit my spirit, notice how the Bible tells us that the sun was darkened.
It seemed like a spiritual midnight had covered the whole earth.
This last year for many people, it has indeed felt like midnight in their lives.
Job losses, death of loved ones, funerals have been the order of the day bazalwane.
In many instances, incidences of abuse and violence against children and women has dramatically increased as COVID-19 took its toll.
Right now, I come into your home to bring a word of encouragement direct from the Lord.
The darker the night, the brighter the dawn of a new day, says Molapisi.
The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has likened the pain and isolation suffered by many victims of COVID-19 as the same pain and humiliation that Jesus Christ suffered during his crucifixion.
SACCs Director of Church and Community Engagement, Reverend Mzwandile Molo, encouraged people not to give up.
And whatever humiliation God goes through, God refuses to give up on us.
We heard him cry out why have you forsaken me?
And in that moment that of crying out, it’s a reminder to those who cry out as they face their own death through the COVID-19 pandemic, the 52000 or so people who have lost their lives in this nation and they have lost their lives almost alone.
But we want to remind you as family members to them, that they did not go through this alone because this God has experienced loneliness of death and cried out, why have you forsaken me?
We have hear him cry out I thirst.
At that moment, we are reminded of Gods solidarity and all those who struggled with their bodies giving in to death in ICU, in ventilation and all the places where death seems to win, says Molo.
Last year, Christians in South Africa couldn’t gather for the first time ever to observe Good Friday due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Instead all services were held virtually as part of efforts to slow the spread of the virus which was first detected in the country in March 2020.
This years gathering was also held under strict COVID-19 safety protocols.
While some churches adhered to them and promised to continue doing so during the Easter weekend, others called for the relaxation of the regulations.
A pastor at the Kingdom of God International Ministries Church in Mfuleni near Khayelitsha in Cape Town, Apostle Sineko Nxesi, is among religious leaders who are calling on government to increase the limit on the number of people who are allowed to attend religious gatherings.
Nxesi says churches have the ability to enforce strict COVID-19 safety protocols.
We are still saying open churches on 50% basis, because thats what we are all about.
We are people of order.
If you are doing it with schools as they are doing it, if you can do it in restaurants, you can do it in the mines, why not the church.
We are most compliant people, most orderly people, we’ve got the man power to perform all those things, he says.
Archbishop Makgoba urges Africa to develop COVID-19 vaccines
Anglican Archbishop of Southern Africa Thabo Makgoba says it is possible for the pharmaceutical industry in Africa to start developing COVID-19 vaccines instead of importing more.
Makgoba delivered the Via Dolorosa Sermon during a Virtual Good Friday Service of the South African Council of Churches.
The virtual service was broadcast to honour frontline healthcare workers who died of COVID-19 since last year.
Makgoba explains, let us challenge the pharmaceutical industry in Africa to manufacture vaccines ourselves.
I’m sure we can make more drugs ourselves instead of importing them.
Let us also challenge vaccine nationalism.
You can’t put a flag and hope the virus will not cross borders.
Let us challenge what I refer to as vaccine Apartheid, practiced by those who play God and determine who is condemned to suffer and to die on the cross of coronavirus.
Makgoba also challenged South Africans to speak out against the atrocities in the Tigray province of Ethiopia and in Cabo Delgado in Mozambique.
Let us renew our resolve that we will speak out and really speak up for the people of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique and for the people of Tigray in Ethiopia.
Let us speak out on the issues of the worlds climate, for the challenges in climate are impacting most severely to those who are contributing least to these changes.
Ramaphosa attends Good Friday service
Earlier on Friday, President Cyril Ramaphosa lauded churches for their role in the bid to preserve lives during the pandemic.
He was speaking in his capacity as the ANC President at the Meadowlands Methodist Church in Soweto as part of the ANCs tribute to the late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,
Ramaphosa said churches have played an important role in the fight against the pandemic.
More on what Ramaphosa said on Friday in the video below.
Recognition just keeps rolling in for acclaimed maskandi musician, Khuzani Idlamlenze Mpungose from Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal.
The artist whose song titled Ijele won top honours in Ukhozi FMs popular Song of the Year contest last year, was recently honoured by his home village.
Thirty-one-year-old maskandi music star Khuzani, as he is popularly known, came from humble beginnings to achieve fame.
He grew up herding cattle like all the other boys in this rural area.
Khuzani started his music career 10 years ago and worked with legends of the maskandi music genre.
Amongst the big names, who helped shape his talent, were the late Mgqumeni, Shwi Nomtekhala and Mtshengiseni Indidane Gcwensa.
His first solo album titled, Bahluleke Bonke, was released in 2011 and he has produced 10 albums since then.
Hes won big at the South African Traditional Music Awards (SATMA) and the South African Music Awards (SAMA).
Receiving his trophy and special guitar donated by the Nkandla Municipality, Mpungose says he feels honoured.
I would like to say thank you to the municipality to honour me like this.
It shows a high respect to me as young as I am.
It is encouraging to me to work hard in order to help those trying to achieve what I have already achieved.
This maskandi is our roots because we are singing with our language.
Nkandla Mayor, Thamsanqa Ntuli, praised Mpungose for his inspiring music and for putting the rural town of Nkandla on the map.
The decision for the municipality to honour Idlamlenze, Khuzani Mpungose is based on the fact that he is no longer an artist at the level of iNkandla.
He is known in the whole country and even abroad.
He is a role model in most of the emerging artists, says mayor Ntuli.
The municipality also used the event to award study bursaries to 150 students.
The Portugal captain’s armband which Cristiano Ronaldo angrily threw on the ground after his goal was incorrectly disallowed in a soccer World Cup qualifier against Serbia at the weekend, was picked up by Djordje Vukicevic, a duty firefighter.
The blue armband with a white letter C was then put up for a charity auction by Vukicevic and his colleagues from Belgrades firefighting brigade to collect money for the treatment of six-month-old Gavrilo Djurdjevic from Serbia who is suffering from spinal muscular atrophy.
Ronaldo was agitated (and) he threw the armband, it fell right next to me, Vukicevic told Reuters on Thursday.
On Saturday, the 36-year-old Ronaldo, who plays his club football for Italian champions Juventus, stormed off the pitch and threw down the captains armband when he was denied a clear stoppage-time winner in the 2-2 draw in Serbia.
Many Serbians resort to fundraising and humanitarian auctions to collect money for medical treatments abroad when they cannot get adequate treatment at home.
Vukicevic said he was ready to sell any memorabilia he could collect from players to help Gavrilos parents collect 2.5 million euros ($2.94 million) for his treatment, but that the armband was a score.
The entire crew agreed this (armband) will go for little Gavrilo, he said.
In the village of Cumic, just outside the city of Kragujevac in central Serbia, Gavrilos mother Nevena said the family had received donations of around 500 000 euros so far.
She added that the proceeds from Ronaldos armband would be a significant contribution.
We could not believe that some people who do not even know us would take the armband, auction it and help our child, she said.
So far, bidders have offered around six million dinars ($60 042.03) during the auction on Serbias Limundo e-commerce platform.
This captains armband, which has attracted the most media attention of all armbands ever, can be yours if you join this charity auction and bid, the advertisement says.
Twenty years ago, Dutch couple Gert Kasteel and Dolf Pasker made history when they tied the knot in the worlds first legally-recognised same-sex wedding in the Netherlands.
They were among four gay couples three male and one female to be married shortly after midnight by the mayor of Amsterdam on April 1, 2001.
On Thursday, they celebrated their 20th anniversaries in small groups or at home due to COVID-19 social distancing rules that prevented large gatherings.
Its nicer to say to other people hes my husband, hes my man, said Dolf, sitting next to Gert as they flipped through an album of photos and newspaper clippings of the wedding, which made headlines worldwide.
It has helped me to accept myself.
All four gay marriages have passed the test of time.
One of the men, Frank Wittebrood, died of a heart attack in 2011 at 55.
Those who participated looked back with pride at having made legal history.
People told me that the Netherlands would be the first and the last country (to pass same-sex marriages), the rest of the world wont follow you, said Henk Krol, a lawmaker who supported the bill when it passed the Dutch parliament in 2000.
Almost 30 countries in the world followed the Dutch example, he said.
Most European Union countries, Britain, the United States, Australia, Mexico and South Africa are among 29 nations to have legalised same-sex marriage since 2001.
Im very proud that its possible, said Gert, who before he could complete his sentence had Dolf jump in and finish it: that we could play a little part of it.
We made history.
Looks like Daniel Craig has a new movie franchise after ending his role as James Bond.
Craig is to star in two sequels to the 2019 Knives Out crime caper that will stream on Netflix in a multi-million dollar deal.
Netflix on Thursday said it had bought the rights to two follow up films that will reunite Craig with director Rian Johnson.
Variety and Deadline Hollywood said Netflix had paid between $400 million and $450 million for the rights to the two sequels, which would make it one of the biggest movie streaming deals ever.
Netflix declined to comment on financial details of the deal but said some reports were inaccurate.
Knives Out, an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, starred Craig as debonair private detective Benoit Blanc along with a star cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Ana de Armas and Christopher Plummer.
The Lionsgate film had a modest $40 million budget and went on to make $311 million at the global box office.
Craig, 53, will make the last of five outings as British secret agent Bond in No Time To Die, which is scheduled to arrive in movie theatres in October.
She was a storyteller par excellence.
Armed with a brilliant command of isiXhosa, its values, traditions and culture.
Noxolo Grootboom bid a final adieu to millions of viewers on Tuesday night.
That moment was so staggering no less than the President delayed his address to the nation to allow the legend a majestic exit.
Grootboom is among over 600 employees who are leaving the public broadcaster.
During her 37 years at the public broadcaster, she strove to preserve her mother tongue.
It is up to you to make sure that the work that we have done doesn’t go to waste, it depends on you how proud you are, about who you are, how proud you are in speaking Venda, Setswana, Sepedi, isiXhosa, isiZulu, Siswati, isiNdebele, it all rests upon you now, it is within you guys, you have all the freedom to make sure that these languages dont perish.
For her, it was all about identity African identity.
Corporative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma urged politicians in the Eastern Cape to emulate Winnie Madikizela-Mandela by prioritising the most disadvantaged people in the rural areas.
She was speaking at the renaming ceremony of the Mbizana Municipality that was named in honour of the African National Congress (ANC) stalwart, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
We must build a reimaged future for this place and for our country as we named this municipality after her.
Hunger, poverty, unemployment, and inequality must be something that we fight with all of our minds and as we leave the name Mbizana Local Municipality, we must also make sure that we work hard to leave behind all those things that have been burdening our people, behind.
