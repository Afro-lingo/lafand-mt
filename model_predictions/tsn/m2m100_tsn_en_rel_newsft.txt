Ramolotja is one of the more than two million deaf people in our country.
He says the deaf struggle every day to take part in the economy.
My 43-year-old father is conducting a metalworking business.
He shares the matter with us with the help of the raft guard, Sebone Kgethe.
My name is Lazarious Ramolotja.
I live in a village called the Mound in Mahikeng.
I am a father of three.
I started cementing many years ago.
Now, I have my company.
With his capacity beyond his disability, Ramolotja found a way of communicating with his users.
He says there are no communications distractions.
Deaf who live where they have no business.
So I thought I had to own a business.
That doesn’t matter.
If there are communications distractions, there are pen and paper.
It doesn’t mean I need a translator all the time.
People know how to be deaf, I think I’m deaf, and they see that I’m a capable person.
I want to see other deaf people own their, he says.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 5 percent of the world’s population has lost their hearing.
The achievement of education and employment opportunities continues to be a major challenge for deaf citizens.
COVID-19 has also proved to be a major stumbling block to deaf residents.
Interpreting coronavirus messages is a growing struggle.
Ramolotja says he still does not understand much about the virus.
COVID-19, I feel great.
As a deaf, I don’t know much about coronavirus.
Hearing people can hear for themselves and being deaf is a challenge.
We are suffering humiliation, he said.
Zebone Kgethe’s parents are deaf.
He is also a professional sign-language advocate.
He believes the deaf are facing social distractions every day.
The deaf urge governments to speed up the process of making signed language the official language.
Messages of commendation continue to flow into South Africa as a result of the ANC enlightenment show, the ANC Octopus Teacher, which won Oscar prize at Los Angeles’s 93rd awards event.
The industry’s artists have praised the group for receiving a prestigious career in an international film.
The film, with many other opportunities for international awards, has won hearts and opinions worldwide.
Film producer, Anant Singh, explains why the prize is great in industry.
It’s big in industry because you have a small film, entering the world’s top movie competition, and proceeding on with the Oscar category.
He knows that filmmakers are producing material from small movies on their waistline (Iphones) and this gives them tremendous incentive to continue to have a superabundance in telling people the news.
Craig has been an inconspicuous News reporter, a decent person, doing a good job and we feel lucky to have done so for the last 10 years.
The documentary is a comprehensive project conducted by the “ Sea Change ” project, which is a NGO awakening insight into the beauty and ecological value of the Eastern kelp forest.
The group is proud to be seen worldwide.
It’s a beautiful way to be placed on stage with the work we do at the “Sea Change ” project, we’ve really focused on the big African forest.
Our objective is to continue shedding myths about the beautiful environment so that it can inspire and amaze people so that they too want to preserve nature, so that they want to touch it and so that we all want to be absorbed in it. It is what we hope people will remember. Remember that you are, that you are nature, that this beautiful planet is your home. That is exactly what we were trying to say in a film, that the areas of the landscape and the animals are important and that we are all part of this. So says Swatiagaray Thijan from the project.
In his interviews with ANCC News, the film star “Foster” said Octopus taught him that nature and humans were made from the same cloth.
And that one needs another in order to survive in this world.
President Cyri Ramaphosa says the film has opened a window to see the beauty of nature and the contrast between the waters of South Africa and the ocean.
We are once again grateful to the ANC Octopus Teacher group for receiving awards to the Oscars Higher Information Programme.
West Cape Minister Alan Winde has also commended the group.

Foster’s film won the awards at Los Angeles’s 93rd athletic show.
The ANC mustet show presents her own experience as well as a small equatorial that she has taken care of throughout the year.
The two ends up building a relationship that allows Foster to see the life of this underwater animal in his own eyes.
Singh says Foster’s victory has encouraged a new band of filmmakers.
Filmmakers are mapping them out of their tune line (Iphone) and thus giving them tremendous incentive to continue engaging in effective discussion of the news.
Craig had been a self-sacrificing, good-sacrificing person.
We’ve been very lucky to be with her in the film for the past 8 or 10 years, he added.
West Cape Minister, Alan Winde, has commended winners of the ANC information show in South Africa for winning the award.
Winde says the country rejoices with that achievement.
I would like to say in behalf of our Western Cape government, to everyone who is involved in the production of the film ANC Octopus Teacher, congratulations you.
You make us very proud.
It was a remarkable achievement with Oscar winning.
Craig says he feels greatly honored to accept this assignment.
The ANC 2020 reality show by Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed highlights the year that movie maker Craig Foster spent socializing with enthusiasm, with a typical outpour in the Kelp South Africa’s woods in False Bay near Cape Town.
Filmmakers James Reed and Pippa Ehrlich have earned respect.
I know there are many South Africans who don’t sleep in the middle of the night to watch this event, but in many ways this is a small personal story that has emerged from the ocean and the forest in the African nose.
And to all, I hope it has provided a limited view of the diversity of social relationships between people and nature.
Reed called the victory respect, and thanked the actress’s family for their support.
He also mentioned South African actor Craig Foster, who built a lower water covenant with Oketopas.

The Nursing Institute of South Africa’s democracy ( ANCosa) says it feels disappointed with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on Tuesday on government accountability for the increase of coronavirus infections in the country.
Denosa says it expected a President to make strict rules to end the spread of the virus.
Former Denosa Secretary General, Cassim L ANCathi, says nurses are overwhelmed by increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients and that more nurses die from the virus.
Patients are increasing and the number of workers is decreasing because nobody enters the level where they save us, as the end of the week I will save three of our nurses, nobody will.
But I am talking not only about those I’m going to save the weekend, I’m talking about those who are already infectious and left out, and a few who have to remain at the wards, must get on with the load.

South Africa continues on to the third wave: Meanwhile, DA leader John Steenhuisen has criticized the vaccine rate, saying the government’s objective to vaccinate a large percentage of the population has not been realized.
The President said while the vaccination project raised the pace, South Africa is still far from achieving a position that will help civic forces fight disease after the vaccination.
Steenhuisen has raised questions about how fast the government buys vaccines.
I think the government has so many questions to answer.
The President has the capacity to empty large numbers but has not stated how we will reach them.
There really are problems with how governments buy vaccines, which has put many South Africans at greater risk for contracting the virus.
It would not be that way if we had a successful vaccination program.
Some people will pay for the failure of government with their lives.
Public Health Department General Director, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, says the institution is ready to welcome other patients to the hospital during the third coronavirus wave.

June is not a typical month in South Africa, especially for its youth.
It is a reminder of 1976, heroes and ladies who have made history this month.
On the 16th of June 1976, South Africa witnessed a riot as thousands of students in Soweto launched a demonstration against the Black Education system, which forced students to learn in Afrikaans.
On that event day of June, the students were to hold a peaceful march to the Orlando arena as a symbol of their opposition to the new language policy.
However, the events did not go as expected and the events took place this same June in South Africa today.
Though this is the month in which we commemorate the courage and victory of the 1976, South Africa is still facing challenges.
I am referring to the young people of 1976 with the courage and specific guidance that they have left behind.
The challenges facing South African youth today are a few things from the fight against corruption to the little faith that young people have in the empire (Patel; Ga Graham: 2019).
In February, the youth of South Africa aged 15-24 a high unemployment rate of 63. ANC while the unemployment rate of those aged 25-34 is 41 in South Africa’s unemployment rate of Q4 2017.
Saul says the movement should influence in its work of removing unrighteous leaders.
He summoned health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to appear before the ANC’s trustworthy commission.
The pressure is increasing on Mkhize to resign after confessing that a R 150 million share of the tender, which was donated by her department to a communications network called Digital vibes, was uncertain.
Mkhize made a statement on Wednesday after a profit of internal investigations into the tender given to her former assistant, Tahera Mathera and former lawyer Naardhira Mitha.
The tender was for services relating to the National Health Insurance Programme as well as government reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Saul says Mkhize must appear before the commission as the law means.
Rather than focusing on fighting the pandemic, we are perplexed by the rumors of a spring from us who must first visit.
There are serious charges against the NEC member commissioner Zweli Mkhize, who is now on duty as a health minister.
If there are similar charges, in line with guidelines received by the NEC, it is understood that he must go to the legal commission to deal with the matter and make proceedings to the NEC.
Minister Mkhize has to retire to follow the test of the tender.
The chairperson, who is also elected in Northern Cape, Zamani Saul, says the movement needs to be cruel in ending corruption under its circumstances.
He has asked the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, to appear before the ANC’s trustworthy commission and explain the following criminal investigations.
Mkhize is in trouble because of the more than 150 million uncertain contracts in relation to the ANCI and COVID-19 National Health Insures to the people she is associating with.
Instead of fighting the pandemic we are being puzzled by allegations of fraud from those of us who must first visit.
There are serious charges against the Committee member of the NEC, Zweli Mkhize who is currently commissioned as Minister of Health.
If there are any such charges in line with the guidelines that were received by the NEC, the hope is that you have to go to the justice commission, that the commission is facing the matter, and make proceedings to the NEC, says Saul.
Special Inquiry unit (SIU) examines the matter.
President Ramaphosa is waiting for an uncertain record of accusations of the Digital vibes tender.
Saul was considering the resolution of the secretary-general Ace Magashule to take the party to court in an attempt to set aside the abdomen.
The ANC Chairperson in the Northern Cape has argued that the ANCashule action is shameful.
Saul says when Magashule thought he was above the ANC’s constitution.
He says in the history of the movement they have not experienced any misconduct from the general registrar.
No amendment will take place within an organization that lacks the ability to influence proper conduct against its members.
‘ ANCP-aside’ is one of the steps that have been taken to ensure that we are going to put our company on the road to recovery.
The fact of the secretary-general is, none of us, there is no self-respecting ANC member, which will not be disappointed with the general secretary who takes the ANC to court, but I realize that he is doing this because he has negative thoughts about his role as secretary-general.
Saul was speaking privately at the ANC elective convention in the North Cape that was held in Springbok.
He says the movement will overcome the challenges it now faces.
Zamani condemns Magashule by taking the party to court: President Ramaphosa is also speaking to the convention.
He has asked members to work hard to restore unity in the governing body, and he has urged them to serve their citizens with a clean heart.
In his speech, Ramaphosa said there is no room for rude members of the ANC.
Ramaphosa has reiterated that those who deviate from the important practices of the ANC must be disciplined.
We are determined to comply with the commission given by the Nasrec conference because the management of the conference said all NEC members of the ANC sector must work together and work hard to unite and upbuild the youth of our glorious organization.
When we speak of the convention, we mean constitution, but it is now well established in the North Cape, a solid assembly.
It is a meeting that must take place on the basis of the African National Congress, he said.
The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has asked the State Capture and Cultural Affairs Department to intervene after private security officials entered the municipality room at Nquthu and removed the ANC councillors from the meeting.

The video is showing security officials confronting a councillor whose name was not given.
It heard councillors calling out and asking what Zikode did.
Security officials, wearing heavy attire, are seen arresting two councillors in an attempt to get them out of the room.
The ANC in the KwaZulu-Natal region accused IFP of planning an attack by their councillors.
The IFP has failed to have a share in analyzing key issues that they raised.
They decided to bring the criminals they hired to remove our councillors.
These are not security officials appointed by the municipality, they are private criminals, says the ANC Spokesperson for the K ANC:akanipho Ntombela.
Only the IFP has pushed the charges aside.
The ANC has argued that the ANC councillors were not in control.
ANC councillors did not want the council meeting to continue.
They really wanted to stop the council.
They did not want anything to be discussed about the lockdown.
If there are members trying to interfere with the council, he should look for ways to do so.
And the one who was publishing, it was clear that a plan was being planned and well planned, says provincial Chairperson, Thami Ntuli.
The ANC believes the election of current IFP Mayor Lindok ANC Shabalala was unconstitutional.
The movement has cited the fact that the council meeting at which Shabalala was elected took place when the country was under the lockdown 5 because of the lack of truth.
The State Capture and cultural Affairs Department of KwaZulu-Natal has given evidence of the conflict and will further evaluate it.

ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says the COVID-19 pandemic is the first real test in the movement since its establishment.
Ramaphosa says the ANC will show no one, but it must show the country the way against the storms.
He was speaking at a Northern Cape provincial conference held in Springbok.
Apart from its impact on public health, COVID-19 has also destroyed the economy and lives.
The COVID-19 pandemic dropped South Africa’s equity even more, millions of people unemployed.

ANC President cryil Ramaphosa is addressing the Northern Cape elective conference.
ANC provincial Chairperson Zamani Saul has been the chief critic of the suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule, says he is a person with many challenges.
Apart from COVID-19, the movement is also facing its own challenges, such as uncertain behaviour.
Since Nasrec, we have been striving to promote unity.
Correct the archaeologist.
That is the unity, says Ramaphosa.

Political analyst Ng L ANCyo Dondolo says the African National Congress (ANC) must have a resolution of oppression if it seeks to undermine the movement.
He says the ANC can renew its confidence, after immediate interventions just ahead, they will need to work hard.
This is after the ANC in the Eastern Cape announced the taking of wisdom from former rulers including former president Thabo Mbeki at a three-day meeting of the current provincial executive committee in East London.
Dondolo says this is a procession for a short period of time.
The involvement of former leaders like Thabo Mbeki, moral leaders as a means of renewing the ANC, is temporary.
It is the ANC strategy that seeks to win the hearts of the candidates, but the ANC needs an indefinitely lasting structure, says Dondolo.
The ANC Chairperson in the Northern Cape Zamani Saul says the movement needs to restore its corrupt picture.
He says, with this short-term resolution, the ANC can win elections in certain municipalities, but there are other cities that will be disputed by other political parties.
Mbeki has been appointed to contribute to the raising of the ANC as a nationalistic society.
ANC Spokesperson Loyiso Magigabaela says the convention will depend on the heritage of individuals who are the founder of the movement so that it can be with the youth who are now benefiting.
To reinforce the process of degradation and reconciliation we must go into the wisdom of former rulers so that our degradation should have proper guidance.
You may have understood that in recent times the ANC is being repressed from left to right, the renewal of the project is now becoming necessary and we also want to repress the authority and leadership of the ANC in the nation, Magigabaela said.
As the ANC EC will open its extended PEC meeting at the EL ICC, in the Dr W.B Rubusana region this morning, it is expected to have the former ANC president Cde Thabo Mbeki.
ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, says putting the economy in the path of recession is one of the most important responsibilities of the movement this year.

On behalf of the National Executive Committee, we want to thank and praise the Mlangeni family and the Ledwaba family to cooperate with the ANC in commemorating Mlangeni’s inheritance under the heading: Morals, conduct and abuse.
This is happening at a good time during the ANC that we have our national unit of unity, renewal, and a new structure this year of Charlotte Maxeke
The important thing is, while there is a generous person who has defended the ANC, who suffers torture has complaints about the situation of the institution, and in his memorial, we believe that like the NEC we owe people like him by ensuring that we link the NEC and we revenge ourselves, says NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane.
June and Andrew Mlangeni Foundation Chairperson, Professor Hl ANCwe Mkhize, said they were overjoyed.
We were determined to continue his final struggle with moral issues, especially in his institution, and also with ethical issues, and we felt that all of us in the present troubles, he left, let us talk about the things we left and other difficult subjects.
So we are grateful that Mr Mlangeni started something.

The challenge facing the Public Protector, Revised Mkhwebane, to the Parliamentary Inquiry Act of the Chief Officer, will be heard at the Western Cape Court on Monday.
The matter that is expected to be heard by the 3 judges has been set aside until Friday.
A month ago, Western Cape Chief Justice, John Hlophe, withdrew from the case after the Democratic Alliance appealed for a resolution of his personal preferences.
Hlophe has been charged with stealing by the Inquisition.
The proceedings of accusing Mkhwebane have been launched by the DA.
Meanwhile, the Commission of Justice Service will decide at the end of the next month whether Hlophe was charged with theft and should he face the charges.
The Economic Freedom Fighters was one of the parties that did not support the formation of the committee.
Parliamentary Party member Natasha Ntlangwini said when the rules were violated, it meant the Public Protector.
We are opposed to the recommendations given by the panel.
The house has yet no rules on the removal of Chapter 9 of the leadership.
These regulations were made with the public Protector in mind, a serious process of removing the Public Protector, not any other.

Tomorrow, he has given us his knowledge and ability.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has outlined a misunderstood and comprehensible rule that robs South Africans of their citizenship.
This follows complaints from London residents, when they try to renew their South African population, they realize that they are no longer South African citizens because they have asked for additional citizenship.
This is because, under the Citizenship Act of current South Africa, it has to apply to the Department of Internal Affairs to obtain a citizenship for another country.
Earlier, DA member of Parliament Adrian Roos says the party is opposed to this Act and will fight in the high court in place of thousands of South Africans who have lost their citizenship without their knowledge.
The DA is challenging this regulation in court.
It is not a rule as the Department of Internal Affairs once declared it is not against the citizenship of both countries.
But it’s your law, you don’t say you support the citizenship of two countries.
When you look at the short-term constitution, you are speaking about the fact that no citizen will be without the support of the law, but this has been amended in the constitution.
They canceled the statement without saying that this right must not be taken into practice so that you will not be denied your citizenship.
So the DA argument is, whatever it may be, you must have the authority to leave your citizenship before it can be lost, says Roos.
Below are the complete negotiations by DA member Adrian Roos.
Deputy President David Mabuza has voiced his opinion on the serious allegations of R 150 million Digital vibes being linked to Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize.
He was addressing a group of former military experts at Limpopo on Saturday.
Special Inquiry unit (SIU) is reviewing allegations that the minister had been involved in funding paid to Digital ANCes for the public-related work of the department.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) is one of the movements that demand Mkhize’s retirement.
Mabuza says people have to wait for the results of the investigation.
It’s true that if there’s any charges, they will block the state’s thinking
But I think we must take what the President said in order that the matter is expected.
ANCana, Kaizer Inquiry Acting of the Special Inquiry unit, said they were still investigating and are determined to complete the investigation quickly.
Deputy President David Mabuza says about R654 million who should have been assisting military personnel specialists go through the Defence Department but are not being used because the department has not been doing well.
Mabuza was addressing a team of military personnel at Limpopo on Saturday.
He has asked military experts to shape themselves into one wild beast rather than fight against one another.
However, money has not been used, it is in the department because there are a lot of problems, but military personnel experts complain.
The biggest problem we are facing is a process of confirmation that has a profound impact on corruption.
Mabuza says he hopes that now that the Deputy General of the Department has been appointed, military heroes will get the help they want.
He has urged military heroes across all political sectors to prepare themselves and allow governments to try to support them.
Army heroes often complain about the lack of housing, dignified health services, and unemployment.
Lack of cooperation between heroes.
Mabuza says the lack of cooperation and elections between former military heroes and former troops is to undermine the efforts of governments in addressing their challenges.
He said the heroes of military officials from former members of the circles were also twisting by confirming their testimony.
You have got to try and prepare yourself, we don’t want these elections among you because we don’t understand why you fight for yourself.
You are a rapidly declining society, and an aging society now that the elderly may want to fight against one another, ANCVA, and the army council quickly resolve their problems.
This is not good for this nation.
Mabuza speaks to heroes from the South African Defence Force, ANChonto we Sigaba, Azanian People Liberation Army and the Venda Defence Force in Polokwane, Limpopo.
Deputy President David Mabuza is also speaking to the South African Defence Force, ANChonto we Sigaba, Azanian People Liberation Army and the Venda Defence Force.
Though unhappy, heroes believe there is a lack of confidence.
I am from Azania MVA, with confidence, our problems will be solved, as long as there is cooperation between us and the national government.
Emmanuel Maake of the ANC National Council says, we have had all kinds of problems including health, housing, furnishings and payments for schoolchildren, we have a lot of problems.
Other military heroes were unhappy that they were denied access to the place where Mabuza took a stand for them.
They were not on the list of those who had to enter the Rakabi arena.
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is led by the Nquthu municipality in the northern KwaZulu-Natal region, taking the provincial Assembly Legislature Department to court due to its being placed under the administration.
The resolution was adopted by COGTA MEC, Sipho ANComuka on Thursday.
He quoted current technical statements as well as the high court decisions that the appointment of other key executives inadmissibly was uncertain.
The Nquthu Council has declared that the MEC has no authority to place the municipality under the administration.
The resolution to challenge Hlomuka’s steps was taken at the meeting of the council on Thursday, a day after the province of the Assembly Department of Authority announced the placement of the municipality under the administration.
In February, the provincial government placed the municipality under the administration.
But the resolution was postponed by National Minister of State, Dr Nkos ANC Dlamini-Zuma ANC
He said there was no good reason for putting the municipality under the administration.
I think this intervention is untrue, but it is MEC’s plan because in March Dr Nkos ANC Dlamini ANC denied the COGTA resolution in the province of placing a municipality under the administration.
Dlamini-Ale has thus advised that the provincial government should comply with Part 139 1A which means that they can watch, guide, and assist the municipality.
Only the K ANC COGTA did not do that.
Yes, we’ve found the financial rewards of not making a request, but for the reasons, the former management, if they ever went along with the important information that was needed in order to raise, said Lindok ANC Shabalala.
Nquthu municipality threatened to take the COGTA to court
The KwaZulu-Natal IFP has accused Hlomuka of collaborating with the African National Congress (ANC) in mismanaging the municipality, placing it under the administration.
The ANC Chairperson, Thamsan ANC Ntuli, said the ANC wanted to run the municipality of Nquthu despite losing the elections in the area.
We all know that IFP and ANC doing well in the City of Johannesburg in K ANC is a very different matter.
That is why you get a list of all our municipalities in the province of K ANC.
We are concerned about the conduct of the COGTA and the COGTA Executive, who allows the ANC councillor list in Nquthu to guide the COGTA, much to the disappointment.
The IFP has also disappointed the ANC after giving the name of one of the regional structures in the province to the north, the name of the liberation procession, the late Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.
Meanwhile, this action will postpone forgiveness negotiations between the two parties that were dismissed by the leaders of both parties to the national level.
Deputy President David Mabuza has affirmed to military heroes that government has no money in hand to give only military heroes government with money to care for their social needs and health needs.
He says the problem was with the Defence Department and military heroes, with a lack of administration to deal with their problems.
When he addressed the band of military heroes, Mabuza said it would turn out well because the Department’s Deputy Director has been appointed.
We still continue with provincial negotiations with military heroes.
Today we are in Limpopo at the Rakabi Plain of Protector and are warmly welcomed by Prime Minister, Stanley Mathabatha.
He has asked military heroes to create themselves into one wild beast rather than fight for themselves.
We are still going to repair the Department of Army heroes.
I can tell you that General Director [Irene Mpoligaba) in the department has been appointed.
He will start his work on June 7.
Now there will be a lot of things together.
Secondly, the President has asked the Headquarters offices to cooperate in the project, says Mabuza.
Deputy President speaks to the media about a discussion with military heroes.
Deputy President David Mabuza has encouraged military heroes throughout the political procession, to create a wild beast in order for governments to give them enough support.
Frequently, military heroes complain that they do not have housing, health services and other items from the state.
In the publication below, ANCC speaks to a former member of the Venda Defence Force:
Speech to a group of military officials at Limpopo from the old South African Defence Force (SADF), the Venda Defence Force (V ANC).
Mabuza says the government is concerned that military personnel are fighting one another.
He says army officials from former parties are still being confidently proselytised to determine who were in the systems while others in SADF and V ANC are better.
You are a society that is becoming smaller and smaller.
You are an aging society.
So why can older people fight for themselves?
ANCVA and the military council must go and resolve your problems quickly.
This is inappropriate for the nation, adds Mabuza.
ANCC speaks to Limpopo Secretary-General Luligaba Jack.
The State Capture and Cultural Affairs Department (COGTA) in KwaZulu-Natal has commissioned the speaker of the local municipality of In ANC Lang ANCalele to investigate allegations of the assault on the councillor.
It is mentioned that the IFP councillor struck two women of the ANC assailants.
CogTAs K ANC Spokesperson, Senzo Mzila says the KwaZulu-Natal State and Cultural Affairs MEC, Sipho Hlomuka has expressed concern over the allegations expressed at the local municipality In ANC Lang ANCalele
allegations that one of the councillors has struck another councillor.
MEC, Hlomuka asked the municipal speaker to investigate the reasons for the incident in order to give him a full report on the matter, adding Mzila.
Deputy President David Mabuza in his position as Chairperson of the President Service Group for Army Officials is expected to cooperate with army officials at Polokwane, Limpopo.
He will review the progress of the provincial government in dealing with the challenges facing military personnel.
Over the years, military heroes from political parties and Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei ( TBVC) have complained that the government does not do enough to take care of their lives.
Among other things, noteworthy by the service group led by deputy president Mabuza, is the need for relief from social distress, to provide educational assistance, to build modest homes and land for military heroes.
In a statement issued by the President’s office, the Service Group continues to receive reports of progress that have been reached by various departments, coming with a legal resolution to assist military personnel.

The committee Chairperson Ngk. Sibong ANC Dhlomo says I had telephone discussions with Ngk. Mkhize last night (Labone).
That is where I heard that you were given legal considerations
It is not a good idea now that he can become a member of the Phote ANC Committee on the basis of allegations that place his name in the picture.
So, it is lawful for him not to come and express himself.
Mkhize’s failure to appear before the committee raises her expectations.
Meanwhile, political analyst Ngk. Dale McKinley says Mkhize’s failure to appear before the Phote ANC Health Committee makes it difficult for her and many people will ask questions on how to contribute to the Digital vibes tender.

The former Mkhizes assistants are managing a company that has found a contract to do work relating to the national Health insurance policy and government announcement about Corona
Special Inquiry raises the matter.
A month ago Mkhize admitted that the preaching was uncertain and said disciplinary measures would be taken against the guilty.
There’s a Health Minister spearheading a reaction to our pandemic, a person whose words are not being heeded, who cannot communicate with the media, who always runs away from accountability.
We have a Minister of Health who cannot answer simple questions about developments taking place in his department, says the Headquarters of the Gauteng Department of Health, Meises Lerutle.
Mkhize’s appearance before the Health Committee raises her expectations.
Meanwhile, political analyst Ngk Dale Mckinley says the failure of Minister of Health Ngk Zweli Mkhize to appear before the Phoebe Health Committee brings him many problems and many people are going to question his impact on the Digital ANCes minister.
The analyst says, the Opposition parties are going to make a fodder over this and if we just say, there will be more oppression.
You have to see that something is wrong here.
I have a case to answer.
I am going to get out of my situation now.
People will respect this and I think the ANC should approve of it and encourage it to take place.
Not only on Mkhize, and all its members are facing serious charges because that is the only way that they will clarify the party’s name and revive the integrity of the population if they appear to comply with this rule.
Not only when he is found guilty, though there are clear evidence that there were faults.
But I think that’s important and the president must take it seriously.
Dr Dale Mckinely on Mkhize’s appearance before the Committee.
Political analyst Ngk Dale Mckinley says the absence of Minister of Health Ngk Zweli Mkhize before the Phote ANC Health Committee makes a lot of trouble for her and many people will question her involvement with the Digital ANCs minister.
Mkhize is accused of having a personal interest clash that she has produced from a tanning of about R 150 million that her department has donated to the communications company.

I had a phone discussion with Ngk Mkhize last night.
Opposition movements to the Phoebe Health Committee have expressed regret over Mkhize’s decline in appearance
Ngk Sibong ANC Dhlomo in the appearance of Minister Mkhize before the Parliament Committee:
Opposition movements have been unhappy with Mkhize’s duties.
They disagree with the ANC position that the matter should not be examined in public after the DA has opened the case at the police station in the Cape Town against Mkhize and General Director, Sandile Buthelezi.
The DA has opened a criminal case against Dr Zweli Mkhize.
EEF Members, Ngk Suzan Thembekwayo and Naledi Chirwa say the ANC position in this regard is a sign that the committee cannot condemn the minister.
This was a clear indication that as a committee we cannot speak in one voice to bring the national department into account, says Thembekwayo.
So, we cannot say the matter because the matter has been opened against the minister, what will happen if the NPA brings the case to court?
May we go hand in hand until it’s finished?

It raised allegations that Mkhize produced from a R 150 million R 150 million tender assignment to the communications company, Digital vibes.
Sar ANCsky says Ramaphosa finds himself in a very difficult situation because Mkhize is a doctor and knows what to do with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister Mkhize has made matters difficult for President Ramaphosa because in some of the cases of this humiliating democracy, the reward is for the minister to step aside from his duties with a view to protecting and taking disciplinary measures.
So it’s a job to do.
But if that were the case in South Africa, we would have had a revolution in all the disgraceful cabinets emerging in media investigations and at Zondo Commission.

However, Gwarube says Mkhize had to be suspended long ago. We note that the President has failed yesterday to use his leadership position to stop Dr Mkhize, while further investigations from the SIU are waiting to be finalised.
We feel that this is inappropriate, we feel there is a governing authority for the minister to continue his work while further investigations are being made.
Mkhize is accused of signing a contract that guides are accused of being her friends, Tahera Mather and Naadira Mitha, of state communications service.
Only the amount that is meant has resulted in Mkhize, her family and stepfamilies.

The committee has been given the commission to come by law to enable a development that will allow for global financial recovery, a further application being made this week.
Its life ended at midnight on Monday.
The Chairperson of the National Assembly, Cedrick Frolick, said this did not alter the committee’s mandate.
A committee decree will be that way.
The committee will be re-created and requested that they return with a report by the end of August, although they have asked for an extension of 30 days, we know that the council will be on a break even if they finish on 30 days, the report will be there and wait for us to return in August.
Parliament had hosted a public oral hearings by amending the proposal to revise Article 25 of the Constitution.
This follows a call by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to approve oral warnings in the amendment of the Constitutional Development.
The part-time committee that deals with the matter has responded to over 200 000 written complaints.
It is currently conducting a proposal to amend the Constitution in order to enforce the law of loss of property at no cost.
Now there is much controversy over the development.
However, the COS) deployment agency says it is upholding the amendment and the policy of Property deprivation.
The highest law in the world
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa is the Act
Legislation of Parliament of 2017.
It is the highest law in the world.
So every law that conflicts with the Constitution does not work, unless even until it is amended it can pass the constitution tests.
The Bill of Rights in Chapter 2 is still the basis for democracy as expressed in the Constitution.
It is a region that makes provision for the protection of human dignity, the right of life, freedom of expression, equity, freedom of secrecy, freedom of religion, freedom of faith and reason.
Some of the freedoms include political rights, freedom of business, employment and education.
However, all rights are within boundaries
To amend most of the Bill of Rights requires most of the two-thirds.
One example requiring two-thirds boundaries is the legal statement of property, it is a statement under Part 25 of the Constitution.
It is under the Act of Part 25 where land bills and goods have been donated.
Earlier, the legal statement was amended by the Interim Committee to amend Part 25 of the Constitution in order to allow the world’s capital to be free of charge.
The amendment of Part 25 is currently undergoing the amendment of the 18th Constitution.
This means the 18th anniversary of the Constitution of South Africa being revived.
Additional report by Mercedes Besent.
A new member of the African National Congress (ANC) of the provincial Committee of the Free State (IPC) has to broaden the project on Thursday.
The company, which was appointed in May, is going to speak to the media later on Thursday morning.
The initiative member, Tshidiso Nkgedi, says the first-time profit to be the IPC currently being held will be the one that is being watched.
The company, which saw an impressive discontinued Secretary-General Ace Magashule who is the MEC of Economic Development, Mxolisi ANCwana, appointed as Deputy and Prime Minister Sisi Ntombela as his Deputy, has seen the province in the elective conference.
The company, formed after the party’s struggle with membership, defeated the High Court of Appeals that saw the provincial Executive Committee as unconstitutional and unconstitutional.
Enraged ANC Free State Members are responding to the ScA verdict
A number of ANC branches in Mahikeng have vowed to support Magashule.
ANC members from 35 sectoral branches in the Mfikeng region in the North West have condemned the temporary restriction of the party’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule.
His brief resignation began on May.
Magashule has issued a will and faces charges of fraud, corruption, and illicit loans relating to tents in the Free State that were removed during his period as Minister of provinces.
ANC members at the Mahikeng regional sector gathered shortly after news that Magashule had been suspended.
Members look to Magashule for beauty and corruption.
The leader of the youth in the Minister-General of the Working Department, Koketso Moiloa, blames the ANC President for the Magashule stand.
Herman Mashaba’s political party, ActionSA, has accused the South African Electoral Commission (IEC) of asking for gifts from political parties through the Multi-P ANC Democracy Fund.
The fund is established in accordance with the Political Party Funding Act, which was enacted in April this year.
Theona is determined to raise and donate donated funds from the private sector to represent political parties.
Only two months after its implementation, Multi-P ANC Democracy Fund is under the test fund.
ActionSA explains that the IEC violates constitutional supplies in connection with the fund.
It accuses the commission of regularly collecting funds for the 14 political parties at the National Assembly but does not include political parties such as ActionSA, which can have a representative after the 20 ANC National elections.
ActionSA wrote to the IEC leader, Sy Mamabolo and Deputy Chairperson, Masego Sheburi that the gathering of the funding of the IEC to Multi-P ANC Democracy stops quickly.
The IEC has confessed that it was enthusiastic to request funds for the 14 political parties represented at the National Assembly, which have now earned billions in public funding each year from taxpayers.
It is unbearable that the IEC operations continue in the present political context especially when South Africans fail to do so, says ActionSA lawyer Lato Ngobeni.
Herman Mashaba of ActionSA accused the IEC of asking for gifts from political parties
Earlier this year, the IEC indicated that it was taking steps to further the fund.
The fund can eliminate corruption by plunging political parties and financial aid into the open.
Democracy is expensive and even a single funding department cannot provide funding for political parties, especially under extreme circumstances.
To ensure that we continue to rejoice in the enthusiasm, joy and strengthening support of the majority of people we hope this fund will provide easy support so that business companies, individuals and other organizations can drop funds to other parties without directly participating with them or trying to express themselves, says the IEC Deputy Chairperson Janet Lato.
The party has issued a statement to the ANC Commission and the ANC Deputy Chairperson, demanding that the funds be lifted quickly and that the donations be returned to the donors.
ActionSA has given the IEC until Friday to respond to their demands, otherwise they will take the matter to court.
Gavjaana, the commission still has a head on the matter and will announce it at a later stage.
President Cyril Ramaphosa says he has dealt with charges against Dr Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Health, and uncertain R 150 million councillor.
President Ramaphosa delivered a speech at the vote for the State Capture budget in Parliament:
He says the charges are serious and should be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement agencies.
President Ramaphosa says procedures are followed when the process of investigation is finalised.
The accusations of uncertain tender operations at the Department of Health are serious and a test to combat corruption.
Lawson Naidoo, senior Secretary of the Constitution Council of South Africa, explains that the accusations of tender dishonesty in the Department of Health are a serious test in the fight against corruption.
Naidoo says the matter is a truly enlightening sign for the nation of South Africa.
This is a real sign to South African society as a whole that the matter is serious.
The issue of government devotion, to what extent are they willing to fight corruption.
We will receive a report from Deputy Chief Justice in three months explaining how we will deal with government.
And we are going to deal with the problems as they look at us now.
Is there any hope that the proceedings of the Zondo Commission will be held ahead of the court of law?
Oppression from the DA.
The pressure is rising from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and others for Mkhize to retire or be removed by President Ramaphosa.
Mkhize said a investigation into allegations of the millions of contractors of her Department found that the affairs and communications company, Digital ANCes, were uncertain.
Mkhize denies that it contributed
Mkhize denies that she contributed to the uncertain contraction of millions of rands by her Department.
This is after the Special Inquiry unit found that the partnership between the Department of Health and the communications company,Digital ANCes, was uncertain.
Following is the report that the Department paid Digital ANCes 150 million to perform services relating to national health insurance and government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mkhizes interview due to Digital vibes:

The long-awaited case of the ANC Secretary General, ACE Magashule, who was suspended is expected to be heard before the end of June.
The High Court is expected to hear the matter.
Magashule has been suspended for a while after refusing to take a stand on the party resolution resolution.
A brief interview with the ANC Secretary General, ACE Magashule:
The National Executive Committee has instructed him to make a public apology to the ANC regions after he wrote a letter of recommendation to President Cyril Ramaphosa, but he declined and continued the matter in court.
The ANC National Deployment Committee is going to discuss the ACE Magashule Discipline.
Magashule has applied for the service of the Chief Council, Spokesperson Dali MPfu.
He wants his stand removed.
Magashule’s morals are incomprehensible
Last week, Ramaphosa described Magashule’s behaviour as frightening and incomprehensible.
ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe said the party’s constitution is being weighed.
The party is not in trouble.
Unfortunately, the ANC Constitution has been brought to trial.
The party has already been given a statement stating that it will have a disagreement with the application of the Secretary-General.
As long as courts are disciplined in the manner in which they are disciplined, the ANC must defend itself and its constitution, as well as defend and defend its resolutions.
Pule Mabe speaks out the Magashule court decision and the conduct of other key ANC members at the ANC trial.
Yefu has a right to perform his duties in a professional manner
Meanwhile, some have questioned IPfu’s decision to represent Magashule and President Jacob ANC in his fraudulent case.
EFF leader Julius Malema says:fu has a right to perform his duties in a professional manner, without fear and the party will not interfere in his private duty.
Any EFF doctor can test Jacob ANC if he is sick; They have taken a job vow and we have to let that be done.
We can’t say to the doctor, if ANC is sick, you can’t test her, she will be opposed to her affidavit.
So it is with legal counsel.
We must allow them to do their work without political interference; We must respect their irresponsible responsibilities.
We cannot say EFF treasurer will not be able to import ANC literature; that will be a personal and professional pressure on them.
We will end up telling people who they love and who they are not.
Let people do their rackets
When it comes to political matters, Dali does his duty without fear; when it comes to his civil duty, he does not ask for permission from us.
EFF says it does not have a comment on who is the lawyer.
Dali IPfu is a court representative.

Opposition movements say ANC members are asking ministers and supporters simple questions, but some are not answering written questions.
They have voiced concerns about the law of disaster control, that Parliament does not have a speech on the ban on humanity
DA parliamentary member Jacques Julius says, while ANC members can also play a role in encouraging the executive to take responsibility.
We can do our work with this realism. A good idea for them to start with is that it raises meaningful questions, whether written on the floor or in the oral language.
The allegations of misconduct between the Department of Health and Digital vibes:
Meanwhile, the pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to expel Mkhize, while further accusations continue against the Minister.
Digital vibes, a contracting company linked with the national health insurance policy ( ANCI) and the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, isly paid to provide for the citizenship that belongs to Mkhize’s family reserve.

SIU looks at a contract between Digital ANCes and the Department of Health.
The National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise has reiterated that the Pan African Parliament, which is in Midrand, Johannesburg, is the partnership agency of the African Union and therefore, the principles of the Foundation must be enforced.
The Pan African Parliament has been suspended after parliamentary parties have caused confusion for three consecutive days.
Members need to be united in the system of elections and Southern elections influence a change of leadership process like that of the African Union, whereas Eastern and Western elections oppose this.
The chaos in PAP today.
Modise was delivering a partial address to the National Assembly.
He says South Africa expects PAP to comply.
We acknowledge PAP as the country, we have our members waiting at the institution, we need to take a proper interest in the PAP work, especially on matters that are not on the road in PAP.
SA has been found faulty. It doesn’t matter whether we are to blame or not, but in reality we haven’t played the part well as the audiences and we are correcting it.
Members of the ANC Parliament are condemning confusion.
ANC member of parliament, Bhekiz ANC Radebe condemns the chaos and the hurdles.
South Africa is the country captain of the PAP, and it has representatives who are members of Parliament.
Radebe says events from Midrand could make the continent unresponsive.
What happened at PAP was truly disappointing, but it must be condemned that such conduct can be shown worldwide.
How will other regions of the world recognise us if we are able to treat one another this way?
Malema appealed for ANC intervention.
Economic Freedom Fighters ( ANC) leader Julius Malema says the African Union needs to intervene in matters presented by the Pan African Parliament (PAP) in Midrand, Johannesburg.
Malema, who attended the convention, explained that the incident was disappointing.
The argument is strong.
People have different opinions.
We stopped the meeting to go and discuss these matters further.
We hope there will be a solution and our suggestion is that someone from the ANC be brought to intervene and conduct the elections.
There are two letters from the ANC that colleagues have refused to respond to and controversial issues relating to letters from the ANC.
So if another person from the ANC comes to guide us, we can all cooperate.
The African National Congress Women League (ANCWL) says it is disappointed with the incident of gender-based violence that took place at the Pan- ANCican Parliament (PAP) on Monday.
Djibril War of Senegal, appeared on a camera kicking ANC Parliamentary member, ANCmy Majigaba during a heated dispute.
In a statement, ANCWL says, Cde ANCmy has described the incident in public and says, he tried to intervene and halt the struggle between the two leaders, but he found himself already beaten and his dignity undermined in the public.
As ANCWL we condemn the actions of Djibrils. but we are deeply disappointed that the leader of his position in public would violate a woman in the same manner.
ANCWL members will be standing outside the Pan- ANCican Parliament on account of the Majodinas attack.
They call on the PAP to end the war.
Majodina was ready to raise a case against the Senegal ambassador.
However, he changed his attitude after War apologised.
A member of the PAP in Senegal is calling on the Jews for discipline.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) says, up to date, 50 000 people have signed an appeal against the amended Bill of Flower Control.
The context of the Act can, if it is legalised, prohibit the giving of a gun license in terms of personal protection.
It will also reduce the number of guns that a person can own, for sports and hunting.
The DA condemns this Bill and calls on many people to sign their appeal.
DA Police Spokesperson, Andrew Whitfield, says the little gun that is legalised is another way that South Africans can defend themselves.
The DA believes the amended principle of gun control is one of the most cruel features of the law they have experienced over the course of a long time.
The principle intends to remove the defence as a reason for the possession of a gun.
The DA acknowledges that in the civil uprising such as in South Africa, this is uncertain and unrealistic.
The DA is also concerned about the concern of shooting companies as well as the private protection and the legal restrictions that are being imposed on them, explains Whitfield.
The Congress of the People (COPE) is also against this Act and says it will influence some opposition movements to be against it.
Party spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, says all South Africans have a right to defend themselves.
This development is shameful and mad.
This principle is unrealistic when it says no provision should be given for a gun license with a view to self-defense.
It is evident that the government does not take the lives of its citizens seriously.
Flowered criminals will harass law-abiding citizens more than before, explains Bloem.
The government says the proposed law will help reduce corruption.
Former African National Congress (ANC) President, Thabo Mbeki, the movement has to watch members of the party for the purpose of advancing their own selfish interests.
He was speaking at the ANC provincial meeting of the Executive Council (PEC) in the Eastern Cape.
The ANC PEC three-day gathering focused on the renewal of the party.
Mbeki says greedy secular work has corrupted the ANC and has divided its responsibility for improving the lives of the poor.
Because we haven’t yet spoken about the issue raised by former President Nelson Mandela in ANC on greedy employment, we failed to address the issue.
If we say the amendment, can you amend the ANC and the greedy people, but the answer was that it would not make sense, explains Mbeki.
Former ANC Comrade President Thabo Mbeki, first arrived at the three-day addition to the PEC that began today.
Former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba has denied at the State Capture Commission that she received bags of money from the Gupta family.
Gigaba continues testifying after being accused by a number of accusations, including his wife, Nomachule, of being united with the family that are being spoken of.
He explains that his wife, who is on the path to the breakup, tries to find fault with him about the breakup.
If he was there, and you have seen that I was given money, then he is also involved in the crime.
So, if she was instructed in her office, it would be that you did not get a case of money or if she was given money, you just got it inside and you imagined it was coming from Gupta, said the former Minister.
I couldn’t tell the chairperson his plans.
The fact that he doesn’t see when I got money or I take it to the car and I try to insert security, is because there wasn’t any such money, explains Gigaba.
The commission listens to the evidence relating to Gupta.
Gigaba continues to refute all the allegations against her that her wife has made.
The former minister has challenged Nomachule’s agreements at the commission on the former South African Airways Chairperson (SAA) Dudu Myeni, saying he gave her orders from President Jacob ANC.
Gigaba also denied his wife’s testimony that Myeni at one point threatened to bring her back to the throne of the Minister of Inquiry, a humble condition, if she failed to comply.
The summons will continue on Tuesday.
It will listen to evidence relating to Prasa from two staff members of the Rail Agency, including the Head of the Legal sector, Martha ANCye.
Former Transnet Financial Officer, Gary Pita, will stand up and testify to the company’s testimony.
The trial will start at 3pm.
Former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba continues to refute all allegations against her at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg, which was done by her wife, ANC.
The Gigaba also argued with his remarks at the commission on the matter that former SAA Chairperson Dudu Myeni had given him instructions from President Jacob ANC.
I would look stupid if I said I didn’t understand why and Myeni was put on the bench because I was the minister when he was appointed.
We have asked Kabinet to rent a new boarding and approve his appointment as chairperson as one of the people involved in the former application appointed by Minister Hogan.
Last week, Gigaba rejected allegations by his wife that he had business dealings with the Gupta clergy.
Gigaba remembers going several times to the Gupta offices, the Sahara Computers in Johannesburg for an invitation.
He stressed that he had social and cultural relations with the Guptas and not business matters.
Gigaba told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he continued to meet the Gupta and after his appointment as Minister.
Building strong ties with political parties, the media and other key role players are marks of success with the independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Western Cape.
This is according to Courtney sampson minister who for 22 years was the Chairperson of the IEC Province.
sampson retired earlier this month.
He dropped in his first study at 38 years of age.
Five years later, he was appointed the chairperson of an agency that was facing the elections in the country.
Meanwhile, former president Thabo Mbeki is expected to raise a warning about the convention and the party’s renewal.
He will have a role in affirming the ANC as an internal movement.
ANC PEC Spokesperson, Loyiso Magigabaela says the convention will reiterate the heritage of the founder of the movement to assist those who are now following.
To confirm the point of the adjustment and the convention, we must take wisdom from those who are taking the lead in the past so that the adjustment can be properly directed.
Today you can understand that the ANC is under pressure from left, right and middle.
Now the renewal project will be necessary.
We want to put more emphasis on the authority and leadership of the ANC in the nation, Magigabaela said.
Magigabaela says on Monday the movement will speak to different representatives to listen to their concerns.
On May 21 2021. Political analyst Dr L ANCyo Dondolo said the ANC needs a forceful resolution to undermine the movement.
He says, the movement can rekindle confidence after current solutions, but in the long run they will need to work hard.
This comes after the ANC in the Eastern Cape speaks of taking the wisdom of former leaders, including Mbeki to participate at the current three-day executive committee meeting.
The involvement of former leaders like Thabo Mbeki, leaders who have been identified with legal tradition in the way of renewing the movement, is a short-lived process that the ANC uses to defeat the hearts of the electors but the ANC needs lasting strategies, with this short-lived resolution, enabling them to defeat elections at certain municipalities and there are certain cities where they have strong competitions from political parties, he added.
The African National Congress (ANC) has called on an extended three-day meeting of the provincial executive committee (PEC) at East London International Convention Centre in the Eastern Cape.
Former ANC President, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to raise a summary of the party’s renewal.
We will bring all those who are concerned under the same space because, what matters to us is that the people are. What are their concerns before the leaders, so that when they make admonitions the former President may have the opportunity to speak to others and try to respond to the points that they can take.
Advocate general of the African National Congress (ANC) Jessie Duarte says, in opposition to negative feelings, the objective of the first step aside is not to look at the same person.
His talk followed the general writer, Ace Magashule, speaking to the highest court in Johannesburg to request a disclosure of the constitution and a resolution of the resolution.
He was suspended after refusing to retire.
Magashule is facing a number of charges of fraud, corruption, financial management relating to unacceptable claims of donations of over R 250 million on the stake stake.
Magashule was given 48 hours to make a public apology to the ANC branches, after writing a letter to the party’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa.
He speaks at the ANC’s ninth conference in the Northern Cape in Namakwa, Duarte said the resolution was addressed to those who were charged with serious crimes.
Comrade John Block when found guilty, did not hesitate to step aside.
Comrade Marius Fransman, “ I can go ahead, a long list).
Comrade Pallo Jordan is waiting privately.
Comrade Mdu Manana has moved aside.
The problem here is, not with a specific person but, that is where the problem lies.
The key issue is the ANC resolution.
ANC suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule takes the ANC to court.
ANC Chairperson in the Northern Cape, Ng Dr Zamani Saul, who is expected to continue with the work, has disciplined members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) who fail to take their decisions seriously and fulfill their duties directly.
In recent weeks, ANC NEC members have released the publications of their conventions to the news media and the nation, a fact that Saul views as a misunderstanding.
Speaking during the 9th provincial elections conference in Namakwa, Saul said the ANC NEC has a responsibility to provide for the leadership of all the ANC and public.
We are not looking forward to the NEC and weapons; we are not going to have political devastation.
We have members who have changed the NECs and the N ANCs new and enjoyable commerce, which publishes NEC negotiations, and they are selecting those which they lock out to the public and the media.
This is archaeological, dangerous politics, but to be realistic, it must be suspended.
Zamani says the ANC must postpone its corruption: kidnapping of members of the members.
Opposing parties to Saul in the Gaetsewe region have accused the ANC of stealing members of the members.
The ANC Conference has been postponed on Friday night.
It was supposed to be the final district conference, ahead of the next weekend conference.
Saul, also the Northern Cape Minister, says the provincial executive committee will meet on Saturday to negotiate further.
All branches have not yet been registered because there were institutions being sent to the provincial writer but not according to the secretary’s district.
party member Olebogeng Leserwane says; they want to steal branches and representatives.

Report on WOVando Nomoyi.
Parliament celebrated the 25th constitutional year.
The final constitution was adopted in December 1996 and came into effect in January 2017.
Parliament was holding a meeting today to remind itself of its customs and rules.
Praised as a good constitution of the world and strong for human rights and dignity following the colonial and apartheid years, South Africa’s Apex colony comes with a wide range of responses.
For 25 years since the adoption of the constitution of South Africa, the constituents of the country still disagree with its quality.
While most political parties have described the success of their achievement, some consider it a tool of oppression and loss of property.
The two doors of Parliament had a heated debate celebrating the 25th anniversary of the constitution.
In ANC South Africa’s Parliament held a meeting of the General Assembly to receive its new constitution.
At the platform where they are speaking, the former president of the country has delivered a keynote address.
For two-and-a-half years, many South Africans fear this phenomenon, which they call a living shape of their hopes and aspirations.
A tool of freedom.
During the debate, the minister of international relations and cooperation Naledi pandor honors those who have taken part in the constitution of the country.
He praised African National Congress (ANC) leaders such as the late Zola Skweyiya and ANC Asmal for the key role it played.
pandor says opposition leaders; such as King Mangosuthu Buthelezi, James Selfe of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Kenneth Meshoe of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) also played a beneficial role.
pandor, who has taken part in the joint resolution, says the pandemic unites the people of the country in a way that no other pandemic can legalize.
Our constitution has been formed by some millions.
Not just those attending the constitutional assembly.
Not for just a few.
It is our freedom tool to honor Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou T ANC.
We in Parliament and government have a key role in honouring men and women and millions of others.
We must continue to make sure that conditions for public service are honorable, says pandor.
Looking back at the 25 years of constitution, political parties in South Africa are taking their stand.
Some of the foremost lawyers in the country were still young when the constitution was ratified.
And they too have held it out loud.
One of them, DA’s headquarters Natasha Mazzone, says those who want to undermine this young man must be ignored.
He said it is the duty of all Parliamentary Members who have vowed to uphold the Constitution.
So it is very important that if the pandemic is undermined, we should view it as a means of overthrowing government.
We cannot have high-ranking politicians to make claims that the Constitution is being disregarded or that it is not going to be considered, or more. What is more concerned is that it will not affect their work.
We need to have the same pressure on these languages and the power to get them, to get them to their proper place and then to the prison to say Mazzone
Though Buthelezi has dedicated the leadership of the IFP to younger, younger leaders, he continues to be seen by most of his members as a politician whose reminders are respected.
He says although he was unhappy with certain constitutional provisions, he is happy with the part his party played in its composition.
EFF blames the Constitution.
The Economic Freedom Fighters ( ANC) says the Constitution of South Africa has done nothing to undo the oppression of the Black.
The movement says, indeed, they have defended those who have produced from oppression, while millions of Black people are still living under extreme poverty.
EFF Chairperson Ntomb ANCyo Mente says the party will not rest until the Constitution is amended to allow the land to be taken away without charge.
It traces similar morals between the demands of the lives of the lost majority of people and the preferences of the minority who take care of them.
It reflects on the world in which you, persecuted people living in peace with their persecutors, without even experiencing justice and acknowledging past wrongs.
It refers to its acknowledging the injustices that have been committed against us in the past and also protecting those who committed these injustices and their offspring, says Mente.
How have governments and South Africa upheld constitutional procedures?
The Phote ANC of the combined defence committee has called on the minister of defence Nomiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula ahead of him to answer charges of corruption.
Mapisa-Nqakula is charged with receiving gifts and money of over 5 million, from the provider of the South African Defence Force (SAN ANC).
United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Homisa has raised charges against the committee, saying someone has given him information.
Mapisa-Nqakula has written the committee to refute the charges.
However, ANCck Nchabeleng, a fellow chairperson of the committee, says they need more information from the minister and the person who has delivered the news.
We start by doing and finding time to talk to the minister so that we can get his answers.
But then we might ask questions.
We need information, such as a statement or a statement, at least we know that someone else wrote something on us.
We need something that comes from that person.
Holomisa refers to Minister Mapisa-Nqakula in News of 5 million shame.
On April, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to raise an urgent investigation into allegations that ANCivi Mapisa-Nqakula had wasted millions of taxpayers on airlines and luxurious accommodations.
The ANC says; he must step aside without charge, remaining in expectation of the results.

Tahera Mather, former Mkhize personal lawyer and former assistant Naadhira Mitha, are to be in charge of Digital ANCes, although both of them are not listed as guests.
Doom says it’s hard to believe Mkhize, since she was contradicting herself in the media.
It’s hard to believe her when she’s opposed at a press conference.
He said he did not know until the time came for him to know that he had taken part in arranging meetings with her, to be able to do paid work, so he realized on one occasion.
But it would be a high degree of consistency that the level of work that has to be done in his office and that he should have little insight into it.

He suggested that the Commission could make some distractions, but some praises can also be called.
Legislature Ngakawellyn Curlewis refers to the extraordinary application of former President Jacob ANC to request that lawyer, Billy Downer, resign himself from his criminal case at the Pietermaritzburg Court, it is a very difficult request.
ANC and the French arms company, Thales, have confessed their innocence in charges of fraud and corruption at the Pietermaritzburg High Court.
The matter has been postponed on July 19 so that the debate can be heard by Justice Piet Koen.
Curlewis says the defence will have to raise special issues at the special appeal court for its success.
On Wednesday this week, the ANC Legislature, led by lawyer Dali IPfu, issued a statement in court on grounds for a special appeal that will be argued on July 19.
application deals with part 106 H of the Criminal Procedure Act
The government will also have an opportunity to raise a case in this regard, Downer told the court that the isolated counsel prepared the answer because it was the key point of the special appeal.
The former president of ANC does not condemn himself.
Independence and neutrality
In view of the statement that was read in court, the lawyer IPfu told the office that ANC believes that the lawyer Downer needs balance and balance.
There are facts and circumstances that convince me that Downer acted in a way of independentness and neutrality, which is essential in the application of the law.
Downer has failed to support the circumstances that are necessary to safeguard the constitution in order for my trial to be ordered and carried out in accordance with the Constitution.
Downer has taken a stand against me when he filled out the afidavits with the support of a democratic alliance, an application to reconsider and set aside the NPA decision to end my trial.
Curlewis says that Judge Piet Koen will be placed in position to heed a special call for accountability in the charge and trial as a judge, saying it falls into the process.
No, that is not possible.
The first questions started, not meaning that the currently responsible judge will see the matter coming to an end, unless there is a basis for dismissal that will come later.
But that is not what is expected.
When he was given an opportunity to respond to a special call, Thale protection led by Justice Barry Roux responded with a humiliation that they were the only passengers in the matter.
But he says there is a funeral ahead of them to refute the application.
If a special appeal shows a purpose, then only then can the accused be expected to be officially accountable for the charges, which we will call in the form of the application, which is inappropriate or inappropriate.
In this instance, he does not condemn himself.
It’s not ready to go to a specific application, one that was raised in part 106.
In fact, 1 H, where they want to remove the dean of the country from the trial.
That’s why lawyer Billy Downer, now in minor cases, will the court now have a special application?
But the facts raised by Dali youth in behalf of ANC are that Billy downer will never have a resolve and independent standing in his application in the matter, because he made a vow in behalf of the Democratic Alliance with a statement that was in court and as a result, they say he did not stand on his own.
Curlewis described the service that will follow after Justice Koen handed down his sentence, not at the same time for the special application.
If the protection is correct with their application for accountability, and the office supporting it, I repeat myself, in view of what I have seen in our newspaper andarchy and the authorities of the matter will not succeed, just imagine that they will succeed by continuing to look at a matter in the court of the matter and then they are assaulted from a letter that will not happen because it is inappropriate in the charges of yesterday also if somebody speaks mainly of 106 rather than 106.
The request for 1 H, I am speaking of the applications for “ it’s guilty, ” or “ it’s guilty, ” and at this time, “ it’s guilty, the court must state its findings after the request. Only the court can do that, so the matter will continue after 19.
For the next few days, the National Capture Agency (NPA) will answer on June 2.

In the case of the 150 million Digital ANCes contract crimes and the enormous pressure of the healthcare team Ngaka Zweli Mkhize to step aside, Minister Nts ANCheni says they heed the allegations of crimes, the matter was not prosecuted in the cabinet.

The DA Health MEC in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, says some patients instructed to use nearby hospitals have not yet received medical attention because so many people are in dire need of assistance.
According to the Department there are some safety areas.
I think it’s very important to know
But hospital management is waiting for a safety certificate from the JHB mayor, says Bloom.
Meanwhile, I receive tremendous calls from patients, especially cancer patients and people in the kidneys (dialysis) who are unacceptable.
People tell me they tried just different ropes and didn’t get any help.
It’s a problem because we look at the third wave.
The problem with closing the hospital is that patients are being taken to other crowded hospitals and we also have to know what is going on with hospitals; explains Boom

There are facts and circumstances that give me good reason that Mr Downer acted in a manner that shows inconsistency and a lack of partiality which is essential in carrying out the law.
Mr. Downer has failed to uphold the circumstances needed to protect the indefensibility needed to ensure that my trial is proper and carried out in accordance with the Constitution, Mr Downers has personally testified against me when he installed an alphabet to support a Democratic Alliance application to review and set aside the NPA decision to end my trial.

My Lord, then we have examined the papers and we work hard to record our answer on these papers, we have established a behaviour that the state is willing to place the charges between my friend and the state is confident that then it will review their application in court all of us must also say we must also agree that the application for the position I is plentiful and has a lot of pages. We all agree that the state needs time to answer in the form of the capital.

Only her concerns about the care of young and old were a force for her life

The movement works to protect music advertisers and join the government to ensure that artists receive enough salaries.
Workers across the country have been proselytizing for money due to the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic.
Alexander says many singers may be forced to close the factory.
I think they are facing problems; I think there are many factory analysts thinking other ways.
Many others are already doing other tasks, whether it’s driving or opening tables or doing manual work.
I think if the coronavirus crisis persists over a period of time, many people will step aside from creative service because there is no support from government in service.
Always, it has been that coronavirus pandemic is being carried on by many factories, but it does not force those in the creative sector to do things in another way.

Lawyer, Lefu Maphalla, says her passing is a great loss.
She was the remembered face of Maphalla family and because of her we know one another.
So, he was a brilliant star in our midst, and that’s not all, and in the nation where he lived he was always surrounded by people because he was also a resident.
The family comes to complete honour and funeral arrangements.

The resolution by Reuters to reach the speaker who had opened the ANC message service was unsuccessful.

Each of the remains is placed inside a special box filled with nitrogen to ensure protection, says Egypt archaeologist Zahi Hawass.

A congregation attending Good Friday service at St Georges Cathedral in Cape Town in the Western Cape said they were happy that they were able to go to church in 2021.
In 2020 the Easter Services throughout South Africa were canceled when the nation was not placed under strict 5 conditions, 5 after the coronavirus pandemic swept the country.
Under the adjusted standard of the situation, 250 people are allowed to attend gatherings that are being played inside the building and 500 people are allowed to attend gatherings outside.
The church’s congregation is gathering in small amounts with a number which can be regulated at places of prayer in Cape Town. About 50 people have attended the morning service at St Georges Cathedral.
They voiced their views.
It was fun but also unpleasant.
It was terrible all over the world that most of the year ago, we couldn’t go to church.
And so it sounds true and especially special to be here today, says another member of the congregation.
This is a high day of rest for us as Christians and I have kept in mind.
I feel very lucky to be one of the holy ones and remember that 2,000 years ago a man, the usual, dedicated his life to the whole world and I was one of those people.
So I made an effort this morning to get up and come to the Lord’s house, says one of the congregations.
The St Georges Cathedral Head, minister Michael Weeder, said the church would be very careful in performing services, in obeying the rules and regulations of the coronavirus to prevent the spread of the virus.
Clergyman Weeder said the congregation was also encouraged to pray at home.
The real feeling is to be at home with other illnesses; God is everywhere.
We said so at the beginning of the closure, especially for the first time at our first convention on Friday and Easter, we encouraged our people, understanding that God is being prayed while we breathe, while we are alive, while we love and care; and what is most important in the faith.
You don’t need this beautiful building.
The building is a gift that God has given us, he added.
The congregation gathers at the St Georges Cathedral church in honor of Easter.
Various church services around the world are expected to continue at the end of the week as Christians celebrate the Easter.

The authorities closed roads across the Nile to describe the event, which is meant to rekindle interest in the fertile ancient Egyptian gathering, while the tourism has been suspended entirely due to coronavirus restrictions.
Each of the remains will be placed inside a special box full of nitrogen to ensure safety, and the box will be loaded with a fully built wagon to handle and sustain them accurately, says Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass.
We select the sophisticated Museum because we want, first of all, to demonstrate the bodies in an enlightened manner, in an educational manner, but not in the motif as they were in the Egyptian Museum, he said.
Archaeologist unveiled the remains in two groups at the Deir Al-Hari temple confusion at Luxor and near the Valley of the Kings from 1871.
The main thing is that of Seqenenre Tao, the late King of the Kingdom who reigned in the 16th century BC and is thought to have tormented a violent death.
The exhibition will include the remains of Ramses II, Seti I, and ANCOS-Nefterari.
Fustat was the site of Egypt’s funding under the Umayyad dynasty after the Arab conquest.
In doing this, at best, the bodies are getting what they deserve, says Salima Ikram, Egyptologist at the American University in Khairo.
These are the kings of Egypt, the Pharaohs.
And so, it is a way of showing respect.
When the arrangements for the Holy Week were canceled on the basis of the Spanish coronavirus standards, leaving the drumming culture of Friday the Fine is called the most important thing for the inhabitants of Calanda.
Wearing clean clothes, playing drums on the streets, in front of houses as part of Rompida de la Hora.

We just hope that the following year this will pass and leave us to sit together, says Ivan Rodriguez, 24, a dresser and a rural resident.
Following the abuse last year, Santiago Villanueva, another resident, said the residents had strong emotions to preserve the culture.
We are saddened only because the soul continues, he explains.
A comparison from the Ethiopian Episcol Church described the past year as midnight in many lives.
He compared the coronavirus pandemic to the fast-covering darkness of the day at the last time that Jezo was on the plane.
The overseer was one of the speakers at the South African Council of Churches (SACC)
The publication of Good Friday Service was produced in ANCC 2.
He said before the death of Jezo, there was a spiritual midnight, just like this past year for many.
Before Jesus cried out, Father, I place my spirit on your arms, realize why the Bible tells us that the day was short.
It seemed that the midnight spirits covered the whole world.
This is a year ago for many people, it really sounds like midnight in their lives.
Loss of employment, death of loved ones, funerals are a daily meal for Christians.
In many cases the risk of abuse and violence against women and children has grown considerably as COVID-19 enters.
In the meantime, I am coming to your home to give you a word of encouragement directly from God.
Black night, tomorrow becomes bright in the new day, says the Molapisi.
The South African Council of Churches (SACC) has depicted the pain and neutrality suffered by many of the coronavirus victims as pain and humiliation the Lord Jezo suffered at the time of his impalement.
The director of the SACCS and Public Services, the Chairperson M ANCandile Molo, encourages people not to throw the stake.
And despite the shame that God has gone to, God refuses to forsake us.
We heard her crying, what did you leave me?
And at that time of weeping, I remember those who mourn face-to-face facing their deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, some 52,000 people lost their lives in this nation and their lives on their own.
We just want to remind you as a member of their family, that they don’t look at this alone because this God has had the experience of the loneliness of death and weeping, which is why he left me?
We heard her crying that I was thirsty.
At that time we are reminded of God ’ s unity with all those who have twisted their bodies and suffered torture in the ICU, in the ventilations and in all the places that the lockdown was reaching.
Last year, Christians in South Africa failed to gather for the first time to commemorate the Good Friday because of the rise of the coronavirus.
And all the services were conducted on the inside as part of an attempt to prevent the spread of the newly identified virus in the country in March 2017.
This year’s gathering is being held under the strict supervision of the coronavirus security system.
Although some churches follow and promise to continue doing so during the Easter week, others have requested a relaxation of rules.
A clergyman at the Kingdom of God International Ministries in Mfuleni near Khayelitsha in the Cape Town Town, a Puchetola Sineko Nxesi is one of the religious leaders, taking the lead in government to increase the number of people who are allowed to attend religious gatherings.
Nxesi says the churches have the capacity to measure up to the strict security of coronavirus regulations.
We still open the churches by 50 percent because that is what we are.
We are people who walk by law
If you do it and the schools as they do it, if you can do it in restaurants, you can do it in mining, why not in church.
We are humble people, people who give a law, we have the power to do all things, he explains.

The Anglican Bishop of South Africa, Thabo Makgoba, said it was possible for the African pharmaceutical industry to start replacing coronavirus vaccines.
The slaves delivered the Via Dolorosa sermon during the Fine Friday Service of the Churches of the South African Council.
The broadcast service was raised to honour healthcare workers who have been tormented in coronavirus since last year.
The slaves explained, Let us challenge the pharmaceutical industry in South Africa to make vaccines ourselves.
I have the fact that we can make many substance substitutes for ourselves.
Let us challenge the nationalistic vaccine.
You will not lift the flag and hope that the virus will not cross boundaries.
He says the challenge is what I call a prejudice vaccine, which operates by those who play about God and are judged who must turn around and suffer in a coronavirus clash.
The slaves also asked South Africans to speak against murder in the Tigray province of Ethiopia and Cabo Del ANC in Mozambique.
Let us renew and guarantee that we will speak and speak to the Cabo Del ANC people in Mozambique and the Tigray people in Ethiopia.
Let us talk about the global climate crisis, about the challenges in the atmosphere have a profound effect on those who contribute to the slightest change.

It reflects a prestigious position of respect even though I am young.
It encourages me to work hard to help those who are trying to accomplish what I have already accomplished.
Maskandi is our roots because we are singing in our own language.
The mayor of Nk ANC, Thamsan ANC Ntuli, commends Mpungose for his column and places the name of the town of Nk ANC on the map.
The municipal decision to honor Idlamlenze, Khuzani Mpungose, is based on the fact that he is no longer a singer in the iNk ANC position.
He was known across the country and abroad.
He is a good example for many singers who are giving to grow, says Ntuli.
The municipality used the ceremony to donate scholarship to 150 students.

He adds, the continuation from Ronald’s hand belt can be a very important part.
We couldn’t believe other people who didn’t know us would take the hand belt, sell it and help our child, he said.
Currently, the buyers want to give at least six million, ( ANC60 04 2018) during the sale on the basis of Serbias Limundo e-commerce.

I’m very proud that if possible, he says Gert, who can first finish his story with Dolf in its complete: that we can play a small part in it.
