It’s a legal framework as the State Capture Commission has argued that it is unconstitutional as the State Capture Commission has argued that it is unconstitutional as the State Capture Commission had argued that it is unconstitutional with respect to the two countries.
It’s not their law, let’s not say it is against two countries.

The decision is not true, but it is a decision of the MEC because last month President Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma rejected the COGTA decision in the province of bringing a municipal council under the rules.
Dlamini-Zuma, however, called on the state of emergency to comply with the 139 1A Act that allows them to take action, raise, and assist the district.

We are concerned about the COGTA and the COGTA Chairperson who has appointed the ANC Provincial Secretary in Nquthu to challenge the COGTA actions, this is very sad.
IFP was also suspended by the ANC after sending another state council to the north, the name of a provincial councillor, Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.
