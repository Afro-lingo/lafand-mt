The Democratic Alliance (DA) has explained an unacceptable law and understanding that deprives South Africans of their citizenship.
Following the complaints from residents living in London, when they try to improve their South African citizenship, they realize that they are no longer citizens of South Africa because they have asked for citizenship.
This is because, under the Edict of citizenship in South Africa of this time, he should apply to the Home Department to obtain permission for the citizenship of another country.
Of course, DA Adrian Roos says the party is against the Law, and it will fight it in the highest court instead of thousands of South Africans who have lost their citizenship outside their knowledge.
DA is challenging the Law in court.
It is not an enforceable rule as the Ministry of the Civil Castle once argued that it was not against the citizenship of two countries.
Only your policy, do not say you support the citizenship of two countries.
If you look at the temporary Constitution, you say it is because no resident will live outside the support of the law, but it has been changed in the Constitution.
They have dismissed the words without explaining that this right should not be implemented in order to avoid being rejected by your citizenship.
So the DA contest is that whatever the case, you should have the consent to leave your citizenship before it is lost, says Roos.
Below, the final negotiations of DA Adrian Roos.

We have to let them do their work without political interference; we should respect their responsibility to the province.
We cannot say EFF will not be able to fire the ANC books; that will be pressure on them personally and in the provincial way.
We will end up telling people who love each other and never whom they love.
Leave the people behind their provincial activities

The Democratic Alliance (DA) says until now, 50,000 people have appealed to the Inquisition of the Volunteer Act.
The policy of the Law is that if it is legally administered, stop giving in to the gun license in cases of defense.
It will also reduce the number of guns that one person can own and hunt.
The DA argues with the Inquisition and appeals to many people to sign their appeal.
DA police spokesperson, Andrew Whitfield, says a small legal rifle is another way South Africans can protect themselves.
The DA believes that the revised gun enforcement is one of the most brutal segments they have experienced for a long time.
Basically, an executive aims to eradicate self-defense as a reason for having a gun.
DA believes that in public turmoil as in South Africa, it is unstable and unacceptable.
The DA is also concerned about the escalation of the explosions and private security and the restrictions of the Law to see, explains Whitfield.
The Congress of the People (COPE) is also against the Law and says it will incite some of the Opposition agencies to oppose it.
The party spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, says all South Africans have the right to protect themselves.
The deficiencies are embarrassing and mad
The executive doesn " t make sense when you say it isn " t going to give a gun license for the purpose of defensive.
It is obvious that the government does not take the lives of its citizens seriously.
Criminals with flowers will cause more law-abiding citizens than before, explains Bloem.
The government says the imperial law will help reduce vandalism.

A three-day ANC PEC convention was stable in rehabilitating the party.
Mbeki says greedy executive has damaged the ANC and has divided its responsibilities to improve the lives of the poor.
Because we are not yet discussing the issue raised by former President Nelson Mandela in 1997, with regard to greedy conservation, we have failed to reconcile that fact.

He explains his wife, who is on the way to divide her, is trying to find fault with her about their separation.
If he was there and you saw when I was given money, then he is also involved in the crime.
So when he was directed to his afidafite, he would say he did not get a financial case or when he was given the money, he saw it in the middle of the butu and imagined that it was from Gupta, says the former Minister.
I couldn " t tell the chairman his intentions.
The fact that he didn’t see when I was given money or I took it to the car and I tried to put the security guards is because there was no such money, explains Gigaba.

We have asked Kabinete to hire a new board and to accept his appointment as chairman as one of the former boards appointed by Tona Hogan.
The last week, Gigaba is resenting her wife’s charges that she had business affairs with the Gupta board.

African National Congress (ANC) has called the three-day expansion of the provincial committee (PEC) at East London International Convention Centre in the East Cape.
ANC former president, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to make warnings about the party resolution.

Referring to the ninth provincial conference in Namakwa, Saul said the ANC had the responsibility of supporting the leadership of all ANC and nation.
We don’t fight to see the arguments and fights in NEC; we can’t get political devastation.
We have members who have altered the NEC conventions with a lovely new commerce publishing the NEC negotiations and who are recruiting them to the community and the media.
This in the corporation, they are dangerous politics, and just speaking it must be stopped.
Zamani says the ANC must restore its decay: The kidnapping of members.

Palement celebrated the 25th year of the constitutional constitution.
The last constitution has been adopted in December 1996 and applied in January 1997.
Palement held the meeting today to remind himself of its customs and regulations.
It is praised as a fine constitution of the world and is strong for the human rights and dignity that follow the years of college and discrimination, South Africa " s Southern Apex will come with a variety of answers.
Twenty-five cases since the constitutional recognition of South Africa’s constitutional law, the lawyers of the country still disagree with its quality.
While most political parties have described the success of their achievements, some consider it to be a subject of oppression and possessions.
The two Parliaments held the contest to commemorate 25 years of constitutional
In the year 1996, South African Parliament held a meeting of the General Assembly to accept its new constitution.
At the recommendation platform, it was the former president of the country to deliver a lecture by the official official document.
Two and a half years, most South Africans are afraid of this generation, which they call the living structure of their hopes and dreams.
A relief device.
In the argument, the minister of international relations and collaboration with Naledi Pandor, glorifies those who have taken part in writing the constitutional constitution.
He has praised the leaders of the African National Congress (ANC); such as the late Zola Skweyiya and Kader Asmal in the important role they have played.
Pandor says sectarian leaders; such as King Mangosuthu Buthelezi, James Selfe of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Kenneth Meshoe of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), feels that they have had a useful role.
Pandor, who took part in a joint debate, says the party is connecting the people in the country in a way that another legal circle will not connect them.
Those who formed our constitution may be millions.
Not just those who attended a constitutional convention.
It is not for just a few.
It is our liberation to honor Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou Toure.
We in parliament and government, have a key role in honoring men and women and millions of others.
We have to continue to make sure that the office of public service is respectable to say Pandor.
Looking back at the 25 years of constitutional constitution, South African political parties are infected.
Some of the self-appointed inquisitors in the country were still young when the constitution was accepted.
And it looks they hold it up.
One of DA Natasha Mazzone’s mainstream says those who want to discredit the calf are ignored.
He said it is the duty of all members of the parliament who once swore to the Constitution.
So it is very important that when the census is despised, we should view it as a strategy to overthrow the government.
We cannot have high-ranking politicians to make statements that the Constitution is being discriminated or not to be considered, or more. What is more troubling than it is that it will not affect their work
We must have one pressure in these languages and have the power to take them to the right place in the prison to speak Mazzone
Although Buthelezi has delegated the leadership of the IFP party to the new leaders, those who are young continue to be seen by most of his members as a politician whose reminders are respected.
She says although she did not enjoy some of the charity of the Constitutional Constitutional services , she enjoyed the party’s party’s party in her essay.
EFF criticizes the Constitution.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EF) says South African Constitution has done nothing to undo black oppression.
The organization says it’s true that they have protected those who have stolen from human oppression, while millions of blacks still live under extreme poverty.
The EFF chairman Ntombovuyo Mente says the party will not rest until the Constitution is revised to let the world be taken away without payment.
It underlines similar morals between the demands of many lives that have been deprived of their shares and the interests of a small number of those who are getting away.
It thinks of the world and of you, those who have been persecuted live in peace with their persecutors seeing, without seeing and justice and recognizing past mistakes.
It refers to recognizing past injustices and also protecting those who have committed these injustices and their children, says Mente.
How have Government and South Africa maintained the values of the Constitution ?
A meeting-sponsored factory has called the minister of protection Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula before it appears to answer the charges of theft.
Mapisa-Nqakula is accused of accepting gifts and the worth of five million money from a South African security officer (SANDF).
The U Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Homisa has issued accusations to the committee, saying someone has given him information.
Mapisa-Nqakula wrote to the committee to refute the charges.
However, the coordinator of the committee Elleck Nchabeleng says they need to get more information from the minister who has issued the news.
We first start by working and finding time to communicate with the minister so that we can get his answers.
But then we might ask questions.
We need information, such as a statement or a pledge, a minimum, we know someone wrote something about us.
We need something visible from this person.
The Holomisa refers to the minister Map-Nqakula on five million disgraceful issues.
In April, Democratic Alliance (DA) called President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent investigation on the charges that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula had demolished millions of taxpayers by paying for airplanes and luxuries.
The Society says; he should be suspended outside the payment, there is still the results of investigation.
The DA minister of protection DA Kobus Marais says the evidence has been handed over to a combination of security committees and produces a fraction of five factors that can no doubt be viewed in Map-Nqakula.
There is pressure from DA and some that the minister of health Zweli Mkhize should retire or be dismissed by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The national health department tells the media about the inappropriate Digital Vibes contract. The Yunititi of special surveys investigates the charges that the health-care department paid to Digital Vibesal 150 million services related to the National Health Insolution and the government’s COVID-19 pandemper.
The charges of an irregular contract between the health department and the Digital Vibes.
The political analyst for the irregular Tessa Dooms has raised questions about the truth of Mkhize after denying participation in the multimillion-dollar contract.
Tahera Mather, former Mkhize and assistant of the past Naadhira Mitha, are reported to control the Digital Vibes Foundation, even though they both see it on the list as guests.
Doom says it is very difficult to believe Mkhize, since she contradicted herself in the media.
It is hard to believe him if he is contradicting himself during a media convention.
He said he did not know until the time came to know that he had taken part when he arranged the conventions with him, managed to do the payments, so he realized at one point.
But it would be a higher guarantee that the positions of the work should be done in his office and not have some light on it.
The extension of the report Risha Maduray.
The chairman of the government commission in Johannesburg, Justice Raymond Zondo, says President Cyril Ramaphosa will appear before the commission at a later time on June

Isolation and neutrality
Because of the court statement, lawyer Mpofu told the office that Zuma believes that Spokesman Downer needs to be independent and reasonable.
There are reasons and circumstances that give me a lot of hearing that Downer was acting independently and neutral, which is important in the law process.
Downer has failed to support the circumstances needed to protect the conscription so that my trial will be valid and should be carried out according to the Constitution.
Downer has kept himself packing against me when he filled thefidafiti with the support of democracy, a request to analyze and prod the NPA decision to end my trial.
Curlewis says judge Piet Koen will be put in position to listen to a special request for accountability to the charge and trial as a judge, saying it falls on the proceedings.
No, that is not possible.

If a special appeal shows a purpose, it is the only time that the accused can be expected to render an official account for the charge, and then it will be pronounced in the form of a request that is guilty or not.
In this case, he doesn " t feel guilty.

But the facts presented by Dali kfu instead of Zuma are that Billy downer will not have a purpose and independence from his stand on the issue, since he made a vow instead of the Democratic Alliance in a court party and as a result he is not independent.
Curlewis describes the service that follows after the judge Koen handed the sentence to each other.
If the protection is right with their application for responsibility, and the office supports it, I repeat, according to what I have seen in our journalist and the athletes and the authorities in the matter will be unsuccessful, assuming that they are going to succeed by continuing to look at a matter in the court where they are connected.
Ask 1 HE, I say the court case, whether I’m going, I’m hobby, and I’m not going to say, the courts should be able to do it, so the case will continue after 19.
