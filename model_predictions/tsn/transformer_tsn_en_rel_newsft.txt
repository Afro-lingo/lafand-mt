The Democratic Alliance (DA) has defined a misunderstanding that deprives South Africans of their citizenship.
Following a complaint from London residents who are trying to renew their citizenship in South Africa, they realize that they are no longer citizens of South Africa because they have asked for more citizenship.
This is because under the Constitution of the current South Africa, it has to apply to the Culture Department to get permission for citizenship in another country.
Earlier, DA Adrian Roos parliament says the party is against the Law, and it will fight it against it at the highest court in place of the thousands of South Africans who lost their citizenship without their knowledge.
DA presents a challenge to this law in court.
It is not a law that hears as the Cultural Department once argued that it is not against the citizenship of two countries.
But it is your law, never saying you are supporting the citizenship of two countries.
When you look at the party Constitution, it is alluding to the fact that no resident will be outside the legal support, but this has been changed in the Constitution.
They misrepresented words without saying that this right should not be implemented in order to avoid being rejected by your citizenship.
So the DA controversy is that, no matter what it might be, you must have a chance to leave your citizenship before it loses you, says Roos.
Below, it is the end of the DA Adrian Roos membership.

Of course, if there are any charges, they will prevent government thinking from happening
But I think we must take what the President said the matter is expected.

President David Mabuza says nearly $45 million who should have helped military officials not only in the Department of Protection but are not used because the department is still inappropriate.

Soldiers often complain about the lack of housing, dignified health services, and jobs.
The lack of cooperation between heroes.

The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) party is led by Nquthu municipality in the North KwaZulu-Natal region to the Interim Provincial Provincial Department in court because of its being placed under the administration.
The resolution was made by the MEC of COGTA, Sipho hlomuka on Thursday.
He quoted current philosophical statements and high court rulings that the organisation of other major meat managers was unstable.
The Nquthu commission said MEC has no authority to place the municipality under the administration.

In February, the provincial government put the municipality under the administration.
And the decision was postponed by the National State Minister, physician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma..

We all know that IFP and the ANC are doing well only in the Johannesburg City in KZN is a different matter.
That is why you see a tale against all our municipality in the province of KZN.
We are concerned about the conduct of COGTA and the COGTA Entertainer who allows the ANC council deployment table in Nquthu to guide the COGTA operations, much disappointing.
The IFP is also disappointed by the ANC after giving the name of one of the regional institutions in the province to the north, the name of the host of freedom, the late Nomanble Mzala Nxumalo.
This action, it said, will postpone a discussion of forgiveness between the two parties that were suspended by the leaders of the two parties to the state of nationalism.
President David Mabuza has confirmed to the military heroes that the state does not have any money in his hand to give to the Inquisitors the government has money to care for their social needs and health needs.
He says the problem was with the Department of Protection and the Solitary heroes, inadvertently coping with their problems.
When he stood up for the military heroes, Mabuza said things would start to go well because the Party Premier was appointed.
We are still continuing with provincial negotiations and heroes of the
Today we are in Limpopo at the plain of the Rakabi Polokwane and we are warmly welcomed by Prime Minister, Stanley Mathabatha.

You are a society that continues to be small.
You are a growing society.
So why do older people have a fight to see it ?
MKVA and a military council, you have to go and settle your problems quickly.
This should not be the nation, added Mabuza.

Not only if he is found guilty, although there is a clear evidence that there were mistakes.

The same is true of legal counsel.
We must allow them to do their work without political interference; we must respect their provincial responsibilities.
We cannot say that the EF would not run the ANC literature; that will be a force for personal and provincial oppression.
We will end up telling people who they love and who they never love.
Leave people doing their provincial activities
When it comes to political matters, Dali does his job without fear; when it comes to his career in the province, he does not ask permission for us.

So if he was directed to his elevator, he would say he did not get a financial case or when he was given blood, he found only inside the but but you thought it was from the Gupta, says the former minister.
I couldn " t tell the chairperson his aims.
The fact that he did not see if I was given money or I took it to the car and I am trying to add security to the guards is because there was no such money, explains Gigaba.

Palement celebrated the 25th anniversary of the constitution.
The final constitution was adopted in December 1996 and was introduced to January 1997.
Palement held a meeting today to remind ourselves of its customs and regulations.
It is praised as a good foundation for the world and is able to achieve human rights and dignity that follow during the years of birthday and apartheid, the South African family of Apex comes with a wide range of answers.
Twenty-two beekeepers are still unacceptable to the quality of them.
Although most political parties have explained the success of their discovery, some consider it a means of oppression and possessions.
The two Parliaments hosted a controversy that was taken to commemorate 25 years of legal recognition.
In 1996, the South African Parliament held a meeting of the Conference to adopt its new constitution.
At the stage where it is said, former deputy president of the country has issued a statement of popular legal recognition.
Two and a half years, most South Africans fear the calf, which they call the living structure of their hopes and desires.
A means of liberation.
In the argument, international ties and cooperation Na Star Pandor glorifies those who took part in writing the constitution of the country.
He praised the leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) movement; such as the late Zola Skweyiya and Kader Asmal on the important role they played.
Pandor says party leaders; such as King Mangothu Buthelezi, James Selfe of Democratic Alliance (DA), Kenneth Meshoe of the African Democratic Party (ACDP) have played a useful role.
Pandor , who took part in this joint argument, says the comrade links the people of the country in another legal process that will not connect them.
Those who have made our constitution are about millions.
Not only those attending the constitutional convention.
It is not for just a few.
It is our freedom to honor Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou Toure.
We in parliament and government have a key role in honoring men and women and millions of others.
We have to continue to make sure that the positions of human service are respected to say Pandor.
Looking back at the 25 years of the constitution, the new African political parties are convincing.
Some of the most self-proclaimed lawyers in the country were still young when the constitution was received.
And it looks like those who
One of the biggest DA Natasha Mazzone says those who want to undermine the calf are ignored.
He said it was the duty of all parliamental members who once vowed to uphold the Constitution.
So it is very important that if the generation is despised, we should view it as a policy of overthrowing the state.
We cannot have high-ranking politicians to make statements that the Constitution is disclosed or is not going to be considered, or more. What concerns more is that it
We need to have the same pressure in these languages and have the power to take them, to take them to their right place in prison to say Mazzone
Although Buthelezi has given the leadership of the IFP party to new leaders, the young continues to be seen by most of his members as a politician whose reminders are respected.
He says although he did not enjoy some of the constitutional services , he rejoiced over the role his party played in its essay.
EFF criticizes the Constitution.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says the South African Constitution has done nothing to undo Black oppression.
The movement says, indeed, they have protected those who have stolen from oppression, while millions of black people still live under extreme poverty.
EFF Chairperson Ntombovuyo Mente says the party will not rest until the Constitution is being renounced to allow the land to be deprived without salary.
It enforces similar morals between the demands of many lives that have been deprived of their miscarriages and the interests of a small number that are depriving them.
It reflects on the world and on you, those who have been persecuted who live in peace with their persecutors, without seeing and seeing justice and accepting past errors.
It means recognising the injustices that we have committed in the past, and they also protect those who committed these injustices, and their offspring, says Mente.

The security committee committee has called for the security minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to appear before him to answer the charges of corruption.
Mapisa-Nqakula is charged with accepting gifts and money for the value of five million, from the South African State security provider (SANDF).
United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Homisa brought the charges to the committee, saying someone gave him information.
Mapisa-Nqakula wrote the committee to refute allegations.
However, the chairperson of the committee Elleck Nchabeleng says they need to get more information from the minister and the person who has issued the news.
We start by working and finding time to communicate with the minister so that we can get his answers.
But then we might ask questions.
We need information, such as a statement or a vow, very little we know someone wrote something in us.
We need something visible from that person.
Holomisa refers to the minister Mapisa-Nqakula in five million scandals.
In April, Democratic Alliance (DA) has called President Cyril Ramaphosa to initiate urgent investigation on charges that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has destroyed millions of taxpayers by paying airlines and luxuries.
The Society says; he must be suspended outside the salary, there is still waiting for the results of investigation.
The DA Kobus Marais security minister says the documents testifying have been handed over to a combination of security committees, but they provide a glimpse of five reasons where it can be viewed from Map-Nqakula.
There are pressures from DA and some to get the health minister Zweli Mkhize resigned or removed by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The National Health Department has told the media about the inappropriate Commission of the Digital Vibes. The privacy of special investigations that the health department has paid Digital Vibes 150 million for services connected with the National Inquiry and government curfew to COVID-19.
The charges of the inconsistencies between the health department and Digital Vibes.
Disciplinary analyst Tessa Dooms raised questions about the reality of Mkhize after refusing to participate in the unstable contract of many millions of her departments.
Tahera Mather, a long-standing Mkhize personal spokesperson and former assistant Naadhira Mithatha, are told to control Digital Vibes Foundation, although both see it as solvents.
Doom says it is difficult to believe Mkhize, since he contradicted the media.
It is hard to believe him when he has rebuffed at the media convention.
He said he did not know, until the time came for him to know that he had taken part in organizing the assemblies, being able to do a salary, so he realized at one point.
But it would be a higher stance that the conditions for the work should be done in his office and not have a glimpse of it.

Zuma and the French armamentary commission, Thales, have confessed innocence on fraud and corruption charges at the upper court of Pietermaritzburg.
The issue has been postponed to July 19 so that arguments can be heard by Justice Piet Koen.
Curlewis says the security department will have to present special issues in the court of special appeal for success.
On the Wednesday of this week, the Zuma panel is led by lawyer Dali Mpofu to raise a statement at the court on the grounds of a special appeal that will be addressed during the 19th of July.
Deployment addresses part 106 Criminal Procedure Act
The government will also have an opportunity to warn their case in this regard, Downer has told the court that the explicit advice is preparing for the answer because it was an important issue of special appeal.
The former president of Zuma does not feel guilty.
Staying independent and not taking sides
Because of a statement raised at the court, Mmueledi Mpofu told in office that Zuma believes Mmueledi Downer needs to be independent and reasonable.
There are reasons and situations that are open to me that Downer was conducting himself in a way that requires self-disciplinary and neutrality, which is important in the legal process.
Downer failed to maintain
Downer has made himself a trial against me when he filled the elevator with the support of democracy, an application to review and lay aside a decision made by NPA to end my trial.
Curlewis says the judge Piet Koen will be placed in a position to heed the special proposal to account for the charge and trial as a judge, saying it falls on trial systems.
No, that is not possible.
The first questions began, saying the currently frustrated judge will come to see the end of the matter unless there is any reason for liberation that will come back.
But that is not expected.
When he was given an opportunity to respond to a special request, Thale " s protection led by a judge Barry Roux, has responded in a humor that they were mere passengers in the matter.
But he says there is a burial ahead of them to refute the application.
If a special appeal has a pretense, this is the only time when the accused can be expected to be legally accountable for the reasons, but then we will address it in the form of a request, that is indictable or not.
In the meantime, he doesn " t blame himself.
There are no chances of getting into a special request, one, the one raised in part 106.
Basically 1 H, where they want to clear the country " s restaurants from
In the case of lawyer Billy Downer, now in a relatively small position, will the court have a special request?
But the facts raised by Dali mefu in Zuma " s position are that Billy downer will have no ambitions and independence in his work on the matter because he once committed a vow in behalf of the Democratic Alliance on a matter that was in court and as a result, said he was not independent.
Curlewis describes the next service after the judge Koen issued a sentence to each other, perhaps not during
If the protection is correct in their application for accountability, and the office supports it, I repeat myself, according to what I saw in our journals and tickets and tickets and authorities of the matter will not succeed, let us think they are going to succeed by continuing to look at a matter at the issue of6, and then they are charged on the issue with the issue of the letter inclus 106.
Appropriate 1 H, I am addressing the applications for COVIDENCE, complications and charges, courts must warn the decision after the request. It is only a court hearing that can do that, so the matter will continue after 19.
For the next few days, the National Social Network (NPA) will answer on the 2th of June.
The Zuma law group is expected to be the subject of their controversy on the 5th of Phukwi, while NPA will follow on the 12th.

Mr Downer failed to support the necessary positions to defend the resolution necessary to ensure that my trial is being administered and discontinued according to the Constitution, Mr Downers has made himself a test against me when he added the Democratic Alliance to weigh and lay aside my NPAs decision.
Although Zuma has used so-called strategies that have been implemented to use all the legal issues to stop his trial, he has failed to convince the courts that his cases are suspended for political intervention in the state case against him.
