That we are focusing on the prevention of the pandemic, we are focusing on the last stages of the pandemic for us who have to go ahead.
There are serious charges against incumbent NEC member Zweli Mkhize, who is currently in charge of healthcare.
If there are similar charges, according to the guidelines received by the NEC, it is seen that you must go to the legislative commission to comply with this matter and make recommendations to the NEC.
Minister Mkhize must resign following tender investigations.
The Chairperson who was also elected in Northern Cape, Zamani Saul, says the organisation must be responsible for completing unconstitutional projects in its position.
He has appealed to the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize to appeal to the relevant ANC commission and explain the following extrajudicial investigations.
Mkhize is in trouble because of the unprecedented containers of more than 150 million reports on the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHI) and the COVID-19 pandemic that people compare with.
In the case that we are saddened we are faced with fair charges from us they have to go ahead.
There are serious charges against Comrade NEC member Zweli Mkhize who is yet to be forced to act as a health advocate.
If there are allegations of that according to the guidelines adopted by the NEC, hope is that you must go to the executive commission, that the commission is addressing the case, and make recommendations to the NEC, says Saul.

There is no change that will happen in an organisation that has the capacity to fair treatment against its members.
Step-aside is one of the measures taken to ensure that we are going to put our company in the lead.
The reason for the secretariat is that, for all of us, there is not an ANC that is good enough, and could not have been sworn in with the secretariat you are taking the ANC in court, but I realize you are doing it now because you have misconduct discussions about his role as secretariat.
Saul was saying he was late at the ANC elections meeting in the Northern Cape held in Springbok.
He says the organisation will overcome its current challenges.
Zamani praises Magashule for bringing the organisation to court: President Ramaphosa is holding a local meeting with him.
He called on members to work hard to raise solidarity with the governing party, also encouraging them to serve their citizens with white salaries.

When we talk about the meeting, we read a bill, and now it’s gone well in the North Cape, the meeting is good.
It is a meeting that should appear at the foundation of the African National Congress, he said.

And she, who was reacting, showed that the deal was completed and well organized, said the provincial Chairperson, Thami Ntuli.
The ANC believes the election of the current IFP mayor Lindokuhle Shabalala was unconstitutional.

He says the ANC can also resolve the situation, after the interventions that are taking place not just going forward, they will need to work properly.
This is after the ANC in the Eastern Cape made a announcement of its inability to take responsibility to those who were shouting before including former President Thabo Mbeki at a three-day meeting of the currently held Provincial Executive Committee in East London.
Dondolo says this is a peaceful relationship.
Having been involved in former leaders like Thabo Mbeki, leaders with good ideals as a way of destroying the ANC, is a step forward.
It’s the ANC’s way to collect voters’ accounts, however, the ANC needs a successful collaboration, says Dondolo.
ANC Northern Cape Chairperson Zamani Saul says the organisation needs to upload a photograph of its recent situation.
He says, with a temporary resolution, the ANC can win elections in certain municipalities, but only there are other districts that will be denied by some political parties.
Mbeki is said to have played a role in supporting the ANC as an organisation that knows its media in the country.
ANC PEC Spokesperson Loyiso Magqashela says the gathering will be based on the inspection of individuals who are the founders of the organisation and how it works with the current youth.
To work on the basis of the disciplinary and disciplinary process we have to enter into the welfare of those who used to do so before our discipline is in full order.
He might explain that in these days, the ANC is being dropped from the ground to the ground, the process is now important and we also want to the role and leadership of the ANC in the society, says Magqashela.
As the ANC EC will commence its extended PEC meeting at the EL ICC, in the Dr W.B Rubusana region this morning, it is expected to be the former ANC president Cde Thabo Mbeki.
ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, says bringing the economy to a new stage is one of the most important responsibilities of the organisation this year.
Ramaphosa was celebrating members of the regional governing body at the Northern Cape Provincial Elections Conference held in Springbok.
He added that members of the governing body should elect people who are capable of leading to local positions, and prevent past mistakes of setting out candidates who are unemployed, destroying different municipalities in the country.

In the position of the National Executive Committee, we want to thank and conclude that Mlangeni’s family and Ledwaba will collaborate with the ANC in documenting Mlangeni’s testimony under the name: psychology, discipline and discipline.
This is happening at a very good time in this 2021 package so we have our national group of discipline, discipline, and a new home in that year of Charlotte Maxeke.
What is important is that if you are asking a sincere person who defended the ANC, who is indeed concerned about the state of the organisation, and in his remark, we believe that as the NEC, we are asking people who should be with him to ensure that we compete with the NEC and we are defending it, says NEC member Nomvula Mokonyane.
June and the Andrew Mlangeni Foundation Chairperson, Professor Hlengiwe Mkhize said they were very happy.
We were determined to continue his lifetime struggle before he faced psychological problems, especially in his company, as well as health problems, and we think we are all in the situation now, he said, talking about the things that we have changed and other good diseases.
So we are grateful that Ntate Mlangeni started anything.

The Democratic Alliance (DA) has drafted a law that is unconstitutional for South Africans.
This follows reactions from residents who are in London, trying to clean up their houses in South Africa, realizing that they don’t want to leave it with South Africans because they have requested a residential explanation.
This is because, under the current South Africa Agriculture Act, you must apply to the Department of Agriculture to find a home for any country.
Meanwhile, DA Member of Parliament Adrian Roos says the party is opposed to the Act and will also face it at the highest court in the landscape of tens of thousands of South Africans left without their behalf.
The DA has rejected the Act in court.
This is not the law you are enforcing as the Department of Local Affairs explains that there is no conflict with the residence of the two countries.
With your own law, you don’t want us to support the houses of two countries.
When you look at the provisional Constitution, you speak on the basis that no resident will be without the legal support, but this is amended by the Constitution.
They removed parties without explaining that this right should not be implemented so that you should not be regarded for your own culture.
So the DA agreement is that, even if you are there, you must have the hope of going out of your house before it comes, Roos said.
Below are the most responsible discussions of the DA Adrian Roos.
Deputy President David Mabuza has resumed his hearings about allegations worth R150 million of Digital vibes facing the Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize.
He was speaking to a group of former scientists who arrived at Limpopo on Saturday.
The Special Unit of Inquiry (SIU) has dismissed allegations that Tonna had a role in the services provided by Digital vibes to work in a collaborative manner with the national department.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) is one of the groups that wants Mkhize to take action.
Mabuza says people should pay for complaints.
I thought, if there were charges, they would prevent government negotiations.
But I think we should take what the President has said that the matter is addressed.
Pejana, Kaizer Director-General of Special Inquiry, said they are not yet investigating and are determining to immediately end the investigation.
Deputy President David Mabuza says some R654 million that should be used to assist surgeons who are only in the Department of Defence and are not used because the department is not doing well.
Mabuza was speaking to a team of scientists who returned to Limpopo on Saturday.
He pleaded with the analysts to make sure they are happy with each other and they are happy with each other.
Meanwhile, money has not been used, he has been taken to the ground because there are serious problems, but scientists are getting worse.
The biggest challenge we face is a very serious verification course.
Mabuza says he hopes that as soon as the Department Secretary-General is elected, security officials will receive the support they want.
He urged delegates to move to all political areas to protest and allow governments to try to support them.
Members of the Ministry of Health say there is a lot of concerns about the shortage of funds, the quality of health services, and the availability of jobs.
There is a need for collaboration between the women.
Mabuza says the need for collaboration and elections between ex-election advisors and ex-election advisors is to facilitate the government’s response to their challenges.
He said members of the council have resigned from ex-party groups and they are working to ensure the details of their speech.
You have to try and fight right, we don’t want these voters among you because we don’t understand why you are right.
The nation has not been decreasing over this matter, and the nation is now wondering why clergymen want to complain about themselves, MKVA, and the State Capture Council can quickly resolve their problems.
This is not good for the nation.
Mabuza speaks to reports from the South African Defence Force, Mkhonto we Sizwe, Azanian People Liberation Army and Venda Defence Force in Polokwane, Limpopo.
Deputy President David Mabuza joins South African Defence Force, Mkhonto we Sizwe, Azanian People Liberation Army and Venda Defence Force.

Emmanuel Maake of the MK National Council says, we had all kinds of problems including healthcare, payments, payments and salaries for school children, we have all kinds of problems.

The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is headed by the Nquthu Municipality in the north of KwaZulu-Natal region and brought the Department of Provincial Management to court over its suspension.
The resolution was made by COGTA MEC Sipho on Thursday morning.
He appealed to the current appeals and high-ranking courts that the appointment of some senior managers was unacceptable.
The Nquthu council has told the MEC that it is taking the problems of leaving the municipalities under the control.
The decision to withdraw Hlomuka’s precautions was made during a meeting of the council on Thursday, a day after the province of the Transport Department announced that the municipality was under control.
In fact, the provincial government had left the municipality under control.
And the decision was subsequently filed by the Minister of State, such as Nkoszana Dlamini-Zuma.....
He said there was a problem with leaving the municipality under the regime.
I think this process is uncomfortable, but I am the case of the MEC because in March Dr. Nkoszana Dlamini Zuma rejected the COGTA resolution in the province to put the municipality under control.
Dlamini- Zuma, thus acknowledged that the provincial government pleaded with Section 139 1A to ensure that they can pay attention, say, and assist the municipalities.
But the KNN COGTA did not do so.
Yes, we have received complaints for not making complaints, but for that reason, the ex-managers, if they can do so have taken the necessary information to them and what they needed in the effort to get, says Lindokuhle Shabalala.
Nquthu Municipality plays threats to bring COGTA to court
The IFP in KwaZulu-Natal has accused Hlomuka of collaborating with the African National Congress (ANC) to manage the municipality in an irresponsible manner, taking it under control.
The Provincial Party Chairperson, Thamsanqa Ntuli said the ANC wants to run the Nquthu Municipality even if they have lost the elections in the area today.
We all know that the fact that the IFP and the ANC are doing well in the city of Johannesburg only in the KPN is a different issue.
I am here you can see the online coverage of all of our municipalities in the KDN province.
We are deeply concerned about the actions of COGTA and the COGTA Executive Officer who allows the ANC council members in Nquthu to address the COGTA’s duties, which is very disappointing.
The IFP has also appealed to the ANC after issuing a license for one of the regional institutions in the province to its authority, a license for freedom, late Nobleman Mzala Nxumalo.
He said the move will lead to negotiations between the two parties that were invited by the leaders of the two parties to national positions.
Deputy President David Mabuza has confirmed the delegates that the government has no money enough to provide delegates but the government has money to meet their local and health needs.
He says the problem was with the Department of Defence and Security, in need of processes to deal with their problems.
When he was telling a group of delegates to leave the area, Mabuza said things would start to work well because the Department Secretary-General was elected.
We are still continuing with the regional negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Today we are in Limpopo at the Polokwane Hospital and are welcomed with heavy gifts by Prime Minister, Stanley Mathabatha.
He pleaded with the delegation to ask any of them if they were able to get them.
We are still going to protest the Department of Education.
I will tell you that the MP [Irene Mpolweni] in the department has been elected.
He will start work on 7th of June.
Now things will start to happen.
Secondly, the President called on the High Ministry to collaborate on the project, says Mabuza.
The Deputy President speaks to the press about an agreement with the newspapers.
Deputy President David Mabuza has encouraged stakeholders to move to different political areas, to protest against each other so that the government can give them adequate support.

A group of defence workers have returned to Limpopo from former South African Defence Force (SADF), Venda Defence Force (VDF).
Mabuza says the government is supposed to pay for workers to pay for themselves.
He says workers who resigned from former parties are yet to be verified to see whether they were in control if the position of others in SADF and VDF is better.
The nation that has continued to be smaller.
The nation is disappointing.
So why are the big people going to know them?
MKVA and the executive council, must do so to resolve their problems immediately.
This does not deserve this nation, adds Mabuza.
SABC speaks to Limpopo MKVA Secretary Lulamile Jack.
The COGTA in KwaZulu-Natal has called on the local municipality of Inkosi Langalibalele to investigate allegations of abuse against the council.

So, it is in principle that he will not explain.
Mkhize’s appearance ahead of the Committee to make excuses.

To be the Minister of Health ahead of our pandemic, someone whose colleagues are not available, who can’t speak to the media, who can take responsibility.
We have a Health Minister who cannot answer clear questions about the events happening in his area, says the Deputy Secretary of the Gauteng Department of Health, Meisie lerutle.
This is Mkhize’s appearance before the Health Committee to make sure he is grateful.
Meanwhile, political analyst Ngk Dale Mckinley says the appearance of Health Minister Ngk Zweli Mkhize before the State Capture Committee took place in a series of issues and many will ask questions about his role in the Digital vibes trend.
Mosekaseki says, The Congregational Parties are doing nothing about this and if we say it alone, there will be a lot of discipline.
You must see that nothing is wrong here.
I have a matter that I have to answer.
I will come out of my position now.
People will love this and I think the ANC must allow it and it is encouraging it to happen.
It’s not only for Mkhize and all its members facing serious charges because it’s the only way that will enable them to clear the party’s name and remove the security of citizens, if they want to enforce that law.
Not only if they were found guilty, but there are clear evidence that there was a mistake.
And I think that’s important and the president should act.

The DA has filed a case of state capture against Ms Zweli Mkhize.
EEF Members of Parliament, Ngk Suzan Thembekwayo and Naledi Chirwa say the stance of the ANC on the issue is an attempt that the committee can’t hear the matter.
This was a clear investigation that as we have a committee we can’t speak in any way to challenge the national department to respond, said Thembekwayo.
So, we can’t talk about this because if the matter is brought against it, what happens if the NPA can take it to court?
He says being caught is only possible?

Sarakinsky says the president does not deal with this reason properly.
There have been allegations that Mkhize had recovered from a R150 million tender given to an entertainment company, Digital vibes.

However, Gwarube says Mkhize was supposed to be interrogated. We acknowledge that the President has always failed to use his leadership position to interrogate Ms. Mkhize, even though the investigation has been suspended from SIU.
We think this is wrong, we think there is a doubt that Tony will continue with his job if there is no investigation.
Mkhize is accused of signing the containers of two accused brothers and sisters, Tahera Mather and Naadira Mitha, government intelligence services.
Mkhize’s family, and her two sisters have received the money that she received.

This follows after his memorandum on Wednesday.
The National Assembly has called on the Interim Development Committee (IPC) for an extension of part 25 of the 30th Taskforce Act to complete its work.
The committee has been tasked with a draft law to approve a resolution that will allow the landscape to be extended, with an application to be made this week.
His lifetime ended on Monday morning.
The National Assembly Chairperson, Cedrick Frolick, said this does not change the order of the Committee.
The appointment of the committee will be so.
The committee will be newly led and they will not be asked to file a petition at the end of March, and if they request an extension of 30 matters, we know that the court will be full even if they can pass 30 matters, the petition will be there and we will ask if we hear about the end of March.
Parliament held oral public hearings on the proposed amendment to Section 25 of the Constitution.
This follows a request by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to approve oral submissions to the provisions of the Constitution.
The Interim Disciplinary Committee has received over 200 000 nominations.
It is currently making a proposal to amend the Constitution to enact a law on free child welfare.
There is now an important division in the development.
Nevertheless, the COSatu Workers Association says it supports the adoption of the Amogiwa Dithoto Act.
The law is at the top of the world.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa is a law.
Members of Parliament Act 108 of 1996.
It is the highest law in the world.
Therefore, anyone who does not comply with the Constitution does not do so, even though they are forced to comply with the provisions of the Constitution.
Article 2 of the Constitution remains a framework for democracy as stipulated in the Constitution.
It is the region that carries for the protection of human rights, the right to life, freedom of expression, equality, freedom of religion, freedom of humanity, freedom of religion and religion.
Some of these freedoms include political rights, economic freedoms, jobs and corruption.
However, all rights are constitutional.
A majority of the amendments to this Constitution requires a majority of four bouts.
The law, which requires four bouts, is the High Court Constitution, the law, which is in line with Section 25 of the Constitution.
I am under Article 25 of the land deployment Act.
Meanwhile, a bill has been drafted by the Interim Committee to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow land extraction without compensation.
The amendment to Section 25 is currently not made in line with the amendment of the 18th Constitution.
This means it is a section 18 of the Constitution of South Africa that has been amended.
A review of Mercedes Besent.
The new African National Congress (ANC) party of the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) is expected to renew its contract on Thursday.
The company, which was elected in May, will speak to the press later on Thursday evening.
The governing party member Tshidiso Nkgwedi says the first IPC meeting order that was suspended will be considered.
The company is the only person facing a petition by Congress Secretary-General Ace Magashule who is the MEC for Economic Development, Mxolisi Dukwana, who was appointed Speaker and Minister Sisi Ntombela, as his Deputy Chairperson, has made him find a province at the polling conference.
The company was released after a gathering of members of the party overturned the Court of Appeal overturning the Provincial Executive Committee from the constitution and it does not comply with the constitution.
Deputy African National Congress (ANC) members acknowledge SCA approval
Several ANC posts in Mahikeng refuse to support Magashule.
ANC members from Section 35 of the Constitution of the North West have denied the suspension of the incumbent Secretary-General, Ace Magashule from the party.
His interim campaign started on May 3.
Magashule has continued seriously and faces charges of corruption, misconduct, and financial misconduct in the framework of regulations in the Free State which were issued during his tenure as Provincial Minister.
ANC members at the regional headquarters in Mahikeng met, just after news that Magashule was removed.
Members declare to support Magashule in whole and in part.
The youth leader in the Molema Regional Municipality, Koketso Moiloa, is seeing the ANC president guilty of the intervention of Magashule.
Herman Mashaba’s ActionSA has also accused the Electoral Commission of applying for a petition to political parties on the use of the Multi-Party Democracy Fund.
The fund was approved under the Political Party Funding Act, which has been extended for a period of a year.
Yona seeks to raise and raise funds raised from the private sector to support political parties.
Two months after its implementation, the Multi-Party Democracy Fund is under a privileged fund.
ActionSA explains that the IEC rejects the provisions of the bill.
He pleaded with the commission for collecting funds to serve relevant political parties during the National Assembly and not including political parties such as ActionSA, which may be a half after the 2024 national elections.
ActionSA has pleaded with the IEC leader, Sy Mamabolo and Deputy Chairperson Masego Sheburi that the extension of funding from the IEC to Multi-Party Democracy is accelerated.
The IEC revealed that it was necessary to raise funds from the 14 political parties attended at the National Assembly, which has been receiving billions of funds annually from stakeholders.
It is not surprising that the work of the IEC continues to be political especially if South Africans fail to do so, says ActionSA Spokesperson lerato Ngobeni.
Herman Mashaba of ActionSA accuses IEC of apologizing to political parties
Earlier this year, the IEC predicted that it took measures to extend funds.
The fund can also pass the law by protecting political parties and helping them with money to be transparent.
The state of democracy seeks a ministry of funding and cannot receive funding to political parties, especially under a postponed status.
To ensure that we continue to enjoy the needs, welfare and energy support of our fellow worshippers, we hope that the funding will come to an effective and effective effect so that business companies, individuals and other organisations can receive funds to other parties regardless of whether they have a responsibility with them or try to explain it, IEC Chairperson Janet lerato said.
The party has called on the commission CEO and the Deputy Chairperson of the CEO, and wants the funding to be immediately implemented and that the funds that have been removed will be removed from them.
ActionSA has ordered the IEC until this Friday, to respond to their demands, so they will bring the matter to court.
Governor, the Commission is yet to raise the matter and will remain in the future.
President Cyril Ramaphosa says he is facing charges concerning Ms Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Health and the country’s inadequate value of R150 million.
President Ramaphosa was addressing the resolution of the Constitutional Assembly of Parliament:
He says the charges are crucial and must be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement agencies.
President Ramaphosa says the action follows when the investigation process is suspended.
Accusations of misconduct trends at the Department of Health are crucial and a tool to counter corruption.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Constitutional Development Council of South Africa, Lawson Naidoo explains that allegations of critical standards in the Department of Health are a crucial tool to fight corruption.
Naidoo says the issue is a serious concern for the South African nation.
This is a pleasure for the entire South African community around the world that the issue is crucial.
Because of government accountability, they have struck as a way of fighting corruption.
We will receive a report from the Deputy Chief Justice over the next three months which explains how we will deal with the government.
And we are dealing with the problems when they are dealing with us now.
Is there a hope that the recommendations of the Zondo Commission will be held before the court of law?.
Declaration from the DA.
The controversy is rising from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and others whether Mkhize is tasked or removed by President Ramaphosa.
Mkhize said the investigation into charges of office charges worth millions of rands from his department found that the concerns with the telco, Digital vibes, were unsuccessful.
Mkhize denies that he had something to do
Mkhize denies that he was involved in delivering an incomplete contract of millions of rands to his Department.
This is after the Special University of Inquiry found that the collaboration between the Department of Health and the Communications Agency, Digital vibes, was irresponsible.
This follows a report that the Department has deployed Digital vibes over 150 million to do services related to national health facilities and government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mkhizes Face on Digital vibes:
Mkhize says the funds given to the Digital vibes are found to be faulty and money laundering.
The case was previously filed by the ANC Secretary-General, ACE Magashule who was suspended and is expected to be heard before the end of June.
The Supreme Court is expected to hear the matter.
Magashule has been suspended once after he met to support the party’s resolution process.
Conversation with suspended ANC Secretary-General, ACE Magashule:
The NEC has appealed to the ANC to extend its appeal to ANC regions after receiving a petition to President Cyril Ramaphosa, but he is going to meet and continues the matter to court.
The ANC National Executive Committee is to discuss ACE Magashule’s Independence Act.
Magashule has apologised for the service of the Mogolo Council, Prophet Dali Mpofu.
He wants his message to be removed.
Magashule’s psychology is not understandable
Last week, Ramaphosa explained that Magashule’s behavior was misunderstood and misunderstood.
ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe said the party’s constitution is being rejected.
The party is not in trouble.
In fact, the ANC Constitution has been impeached.
The party has been asked a petition that explains that there will be an application for the Deputy Secretary General.
While courts are followed in a manner that follows it, the ANC must protect and protect its Constitution, as well as protect and conduct its decisions.
Pule Mabe speaks about Magashule’s court decision and the arrest of some senior ANC members in the Zuma trial.
Mpofu has the right to perform his duties in a formal manner.
Meanwhile, some have challenged the Supreme Court decision to condemn Magashule and President Jacob Zuma for his corruption case.
EFF leader Julius Malema says Mpofu has the right to do his duties in a formal manner, without a position and the party may not disappoint in his private service.
Every one of the EFF can love Jacob Zuma if he says; they have taken the contract and we must let that be done.
We can’t say like we are saying, if Zuma says, he can’t come out of peace, he will be fighting his alliance.
That’s just the case with a legal framework.
We must allow them to do their job without political limitation; We must respect their provincial accountability.
We’t think the EFF headmistress will not be able to receive ANC nominations; that will be a complaint for them in a form and in a formal manner.
We’ll end up telling people that they love me and that’s what I love them.
People are leaving their offices.
When it comes to politics, Dali does his job without a position; when it comes to his professional assignment, he does not ask us to leave.
EFF says there is no shortage in asking who is a spokesperson.
Dali Mpofu is a lawyer in court.
President Cyril Ramaphosa raises confidence in his office.
His testimony took place at a time under the guilty arrest of Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Health, as other charges on the Digital vibes tender have been filed.
On Tuesday, some political parties accused the African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament of applying for clear questions as well as delaying their consultations about the Disaster Relief Act.
They said Parliament has no question on the issue of discipline.
Some pointed out that it is part of Parliament’s mandate to ensure that Mkhize comply with the Digital vibes tender.
Political parties will join the president’s assembly, and he will appear on Thursday.

They raised concerns about the Appeal Law, that Parliament does not have a question on the issue of abuse.
DA Member of Parliament Jacques Julius says both members of the ANC can play a role in encouraging the Executive to take responsibility.
We can do our work with this technology. One other reason they can start with it is that they are asking questions that they hear, whether they are answered directly or in form. They are asking questions that are right.
Unconstitutional countrys charges between the Department of Health and Digital vibes:
Meanwhile, the delay is high in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s impeachment of Mkhize, if there are allegations ongoing against the Minister.
Digital vibes, a company dedicated to performing a work related to the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHI) and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been to have access to the Mkhize family’s home building.

Rally in PAP today.
Modise was delivering an informal address to the National Assembly.
He says South Africa hopes for the PAP to comply with the rules.
We acknowledge the PAP as a country, we have our members who are doing well in the institution, we need to take good care of the work of the PAP, especially in cases that are not doing well in the PAP.
SA works wrongly. It doesn’t matter whether we are guilty or not, but I feel that we don’t really share part of ourselves as actors and we are denying that.
ANC Members of Parliament condemn the rift.
ANC Member of Parliament, Bhekizizwe Radebe has condemned the dispute.
South Africa is the founder of the PAP, and has its Members of Parliament.
Radebe says events from Midrand can make this continent its own.
What happened at the PAP was a good swab, and it should be ignored that such spirituality can be spread worldwide.
Will other parts of the world take what to do if we can fight now?
Malema calls for support from the AU.
Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the African Union needs to cooperate in the issues presented by the Pan African Parliament (PAP) in Midrand, Johannesburg.
Malema, who was at the meeting, explained that the events were slowing.
The song is powerful.
People have different relationships.
We have sent a meeting to us to discuss the issues ahead.
We hope there will be a solution and our mission is that the appointment of someone from the AU will conduct and conduct elections.
There are two thousand from the AU that the co-workers refuse to engage in associations related to the thousands that are from the AU.
So if anyone from the AU is going to call us, we can all use it.

In the exhibition, the ANCWL says, Cde Pemmy, explained the incident in general and says, he was trying to deal with the struggle that happened between the two leading men, but heined that his dignity was lowered in general.
As the ANCWL we are reading Djibrils’ works and we are saddened that the leader of his state of affairs can treat women in such a way.
ANCWL members will be outside the Pan-African Parliament over the fall of Majodinas.
They call on the PAP to embrace it.
Majodina refused to appeal the case against Senegal’s lawyer.
However, he changed his relationship after War resigned.
The PAP party in Senegal is apologizing for the May.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) says, so far, over 50 000 people have signed a petition against the Implemented Dithunya Law.
The draft law would, if enacted, prevent the delivery of bribery to the security agencies.
It will also reduce the number of charges that everyone can get. Listen to and read.
The DA denies the Bill and calls on more people to sign their condolences.
DA Police Spokesperson, Andrew Whitfield, says a legal choice is any way South Africans can protect it.

The DA believes that in public protests like in South Africa, this is unacceptable and unacceptable.
The DA is also concerned about the collapse of entertainment companies as well as private security and the followed Constitutional amendments, explains Whitfield.
The Congress of the Peoples (COPE) is also against the law and says it will encourage some of the Congregations to be against it.
Party Spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, says all South Africans have the right to protect themselves.
It’s a disappointing phenomenon.
This bill does not make explanation if we do not agree with the free speech with the aim of committing.
It is clear that the government is not taking away the lives of its citizens.
The smaller beekeepers will harass law enforcement citizens beyond it, explains Bloem.
The state says the amended law will help reduce corruption.
Former African National Congress (ANC) President, Thabo Mbeki, says the organisation must respect the party’s leadership in an effort to continue its campaigns.
He was speaking at the ANC Provincial Council of Executive (PEC) meeting in the Eastern Cape.
The ANC PEC’s three-day meeting was partisan.
Mbeki says crucial courage has been given to the ANC and is proud of its responsibility to boost humanitarian lives.
Because we don’t talk about the issue raised by former President Nelson Mandela in 1997, about the most urgent issue, we fail to deal with that issue.
If we are accused, he can accuse the ANC and those who are accused of this, but Karabo was sure that it could not be a solution, explains Mbeki.
Former incumbent ANC President Thabo Mbeki, comes ahead of the three-minute upcountry meeting of the PEC starting today.
Former Public Enterprises Minister, Malusi Gigaba, has appealed to the State Capture Commission that he received millions of money from the Gupta family.
Gigaba continues testifying after he was charged with several evidence, including his wife, Nomachule, for hearing the family and talking about her.
She explains that her wife, who is on the line to marry her, is trying to hear about their divorce.
If he was there, and if I gave him money, he would know if he is involved in this process.
So, if he was told in his filing, he would have seen no matter of money or if he was given the money, he is only of them honestly and you must admit that he is from the Gupta, said the former Minister.
I couldn’t tell the Chairperson his desire.
The fact that they don’t know if I was given money or I was going to a truck and I tried to keep the security guard, is because it was going to get that money, explains Gigaba.
The Commission reads evidence related to the Gupta.
Gigaba continued to reiterate all the charges against her who were filed by her wife.
The former Minister has denied Nomachule’s decision to the commission concerning former South African Airways (SAA) Chairperson, Dudu Myeni, that he was giving the instructions to President Jacob Zuma.
Gigaba also reiterated the testimony of her wife that Myeni, at a time, had threatened that she would invite her to her selegae Reserve Minister’s house, which is in the lowest position, if she does not follow instructions.
The debate will continue on Tuesday.
It will raise evidence related to Prasa from the two Rail Agency staff, including Chief Justice, Martha Ngoye.

Gigaba also reiterated his appeal to the commission concerning the fact that former SAA Chairman Dudu Myeni is giving instructions from President Jacob Zuma.
I was going to look like the whole thing when I said that I don’t understand why and Myeni was taken to school because I was the Minister when he was appointed.
We have appealed to the Cabinet to submit a new petition and accept his appointment as chairperson as one of those who have done in a former duty appointed by Minister Hogan.
Last week, Gigaba responded to the charges filed by her wife for her business injuries and the Gupta brothers.
Gigaba commemorates several incidents at the Gupta, Sahara Computers headquarters in Johannesburg to fill the reports.
He added that he had local meetings and even local meetings with the Gupta but it was no business accident.
Gigaba has told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he continued meeting the Gupta after his appointment as Minister.
The recent agreement with political parties, the media and other key stakeholders is concerned with the Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Western Cape.
This is true of the late 22 year-old Courtney Sampson who was the IEC Provincial Chairperson.
Sampson resigned early this month.
She has fulfilled her first childhood for 38 years.
Five years later, he was elected chairperson of the organisation that was fighting elections in the country.
Meanwhile, former President Thabo Mbeki is expected to raise a petition on the gathering and promise of the party.
He will play a role in the determination of the ANC as an organisation within the people.
ANC PEC Spokesperson, Loyiso Magqashela, says the gathering will address the investigation of the organisation’s initiatives to help those who are currently pursuing it.
To use the cause of fraud and gatherings, we have to take care of those who have predicted it so that the fraud can be heard properly.
Today you can understand that the ANC is under control from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right, from the right,
Now the reform process will be crucial.
We want to fully respect the role and leadership of the ANC in the country, says Magqashela.
Magqashela says on Monday the organisation will talk to different leaders to raise their concerns.
On May 21, 2021, political analyst Ngaka Luvuyo Dondolo said the ANC needs a comprehensive resolution to strengthen the organisation.
He says, the organisation can step aside after the current solutions, but from the front they will need to work seriously.
This comes after the ANC in the Eastern Cape spoke about taking serious attention to former leaders, including Mbeki to be involved in a three-day Executive Committee meeting currently taking place.
Having been a matter of former leaders such as Thabo Mbeki, acknowledged leaders to have a legal tool in the formalising of the organisation, is a matter of discipline, it is what the ANC is doing to finalize the voters’ polls and only the ANC needs good policies, with this timely resolution, they can conduct elections in various municipalities, and there are districts that rely on those who have a very serious concern from various political parties, he added.
The African National Congress (ANC) has called for a three-day convention meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) at the East London International Convention Centre in the Eastern Cape.
Former ANC President, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to make a petition in line with the party’s commitment.
We will appeal to all those involved under any area because, what is important to us is that “they are”, what their concerns are before they lead, that if they submit the former President there is a chance to talk to others and try to remove the facts that they can do.
African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte says, In spite of misconduct, the aim of the first phase of the struggle is not to see anyone.
His case comes after the documentary, Ace Magashule speaks to the highest court in Johannesburg to appeal to the law and grant discipline.
He was angry after he returned to work.
Magashule faces several charges of fraud, corruption, financial management related to some unacceptable cases of over R250 million in a cross-examination contract.
Magashule was given 48 hours to apologize for an extension to the ANC article, after he gave a deadline to the party President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Speaking at the ANC primary conference in the Northern Cape in Namakwa, Duarte said the resolution is about those who were charged with serious state capture.
Comrade John Block, if found guilty, would not have to sleep in custody.
Comrade Marius Fransman, “I’m going forward, I’m going forward”.
Comrade Pallo Jordan is late.
Comrade Mdu Manana resigns.
In fact, it’s not about someone you’ve said and I’m just where the problem exists.
The most important is that of the ANC.
ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule takes the ANC to court.
The ANC Northern Cape Chairperson, Ngaka Zamani Saul, who is expected to continue work, has condemned members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) who are asked to take their decisions and carry out their duties freely.
In the last few weeks, members of the ANC NEC have released preparations for their meetings to the media and the public, which is why Saul is looking for a special group.
Speaking during the Namakwa Provincial Elections Conference, Saul said the ANC NEC is responsible forining the leadership of all ANC organizations and the nation.
We are not fighting for agreements and agreements in the NEC; we cannot have a political responsibility.
We have members who have reversed NEC and NWC meetings last month overturning NEC consultations and are afraid of those that are being reversed to the public and the media.
The words of Cameroon, they are bad politics, and to say the truth, they should be ignored.
Zamani says the ANC should raise its own unique image: the dismissal of members of parliament.
Parties reject Saul in the Gaetsewe region, accused the ANC of dismissing members.
The ANC Conference was postponed on Friday.
It was supposed to be a last regional conference, before the next week’s conference.
Saul, who is also the Northern Cape Prime Minister, says the Provincial Executive Committee will gather on Saturday to discuss the priority.
The entire article has not been edited because there are institutions that have been sent to the provincial secretary but not to the provincial secretary.
Party member Olebogeng Leserwane says; they want his members and members to be discharged.
Additional report on Reginal Witbooi.
People were grateful to raise condolences after the creation of an 84-year-old advocate, ANC’s Ivy cikizwa Gcina.
The ANC in the Nelson Mandela Bay region has described his death as the most important incident in the organisation.
Gcina formed the ANC Youth League in the 1950s and has a strong role in the fight against black education.

Report by Lwando Nomoyi.
The Parliament commemorated its 25th year of constitution.
The deadline was adopted in sedimonthole 1996 and implemented in February 1997.
The Parliament held a meeting today to discuss its policies and regulations.
He says as a decree on human rights and freedoms that comes after years of colonialism and apartheid, South Africa’s Apex landscape will be in a variety of ways.
25 years without the passing of the South African Constitution, the country’s judiciary is yet to comply with its law.
Although most of the political parties described the lack of access to them, some view it as a conduct of self-determination and misconduct.

In 1996, South African Parliament held a General Assembly to approve its new constitution.
This is while speaking from him, he is coming to the country’s former deputy president to give a letter of a bill of law.
For the past two years, many South Africans are afraid of the pandemic, saying it is a life of their dreams and sacrifices.
Freedom service.
In an interview, the tone of national gathering and collaboration Naledi Pandor, highlights those taking part in breaking the constitution of the country.
He called on leaders of the African National Congress (ANC); the brothers Zola Skweyiya and Kader Asmal about the important thing they had with him.
Pandor says the leaders of the governing party; kgosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, James Selfe of the Democratic Alliance (DA), Kenneth Meshoe of the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and they also had something wrong.
Pandor, who participates in the vaccination process, says the vaccination process communicates with the people of the country in a legal manner that cannot be communicated with them.
Those who passed our bill will be millions.
It was not just those who attended the constitutional meeting.
Not just a few.
It is our dedication to freedom to thank Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Sekou Toure.
Rona in parliament and government, we have a great role in protecting men and women and millions of others.
We must continue to work to ensure that the state of human service is appropriate, says Pandor.
Looking back to the 25 years of constitution, the new South African political parties are concerned.
Some lawyers who were elected in the country, it was still young when the bill was adopted.
And they are also standing up.
One of them DA secretary-general Natasha Mazzone says they want to renew the strike, they have been removed.
He said it is the job of all Members of Parliament who refuse to support the Constitution. They should do so.
So it is very important that if the charge is given, we must take it as a measure to remove the government.
We cannot have high-ranking politicians making proposals that say that the Constitution is either abolished or not, or beyond. What is more important is that it cannot do their work.
We have to have any control over these positions, and we have to have the power to take, they have to be where it is, Mazzone said.
Although Buthelezi has given the IFP leadership to the new leaders, they hope he continues to be seen by many of his members as his political leaders whose primaries are respected.
He says although he was not satisfied with certain provisions of the Constitution, he was satisfied with the role his party played in her own position.
The EFF is breaking the wrong Constitution.
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says the Constitution of South Africa does nothing to address black abuse.
The organisation says, I am the one, they have safeguarded some of their loved ones from the lives of people, while millions of black people still live under an unfortunate poverty.
EFF Chairperson Ntombovuyo Mente says the party will not fail to reach a amended constitution to allow the land received without a gift.
It also exists a relationship between the needs of a large number of survivors who have been welcomed as well as groups with a small number of survivors.
It reflects on the earth and on you, they are encouraged to live with love with their brothers, without having any excitement, and acknowledging past mistakes.
It means it recognises the drugs that we used in the past, and they also protect those who did the drugs, and their children, says Mente.
Have the governments and South Africans supported their constitutional framework?

United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Homisa has submitted the allegations to the committee, saying anyone is in charge.
Mapisa-Nqakula has appealed to the committee to respond to the charges.
However, the joint chairperson of the committee Onack Nchabeleng says they need to get more information from consulting the media outlet.
We start with doing and getting time to talk to us so that we can see his books.
And then we can be asking questions.
We need encouragement, such as forgiveness or compassion, so that we know that somebody has done anything for us.
We need somethimg from that person.
Holomisa insists Mapisa-Nqakula in the coverage of the 5 million state capture projects.
Earlier, the Democratic Alliance (DA) urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to conduct a thorough investigation into charges that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula had sent millions of funds to people who operate in the airline and the airline.
The organisation says; it should be suspended without a fee, even though the prosecution funds are allowed.
DA Defence Minister Kobus Marais says the documents containing evidence have been brought to the gathering defence committee and presented a sum of five cases at Mapisa-Nqakula Hospital.
There is a warning from the DA and others whether the formal tone Zweli Mkhize works or is submitted by President Cyril Ramaphosa.
The National Department of Health is speaking to the press about the misconduct of Digital vibes. The special investigation unit is investigating allegations that the Department of Health has given Digital vibes 150 million of services related to the National Health Insurance and government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
allegations of corruption are unprecedented between the Department of Health and Digital vibes.
Political analyst Tessa Dooms has raised questions about Mkhize’s misconduct after he refused to play a role in the multi-million-long constituency of his department.
Tahera Mather, a spokesman for the former Mkhize community and former coach, Naadhira Mitha, has been asked to pay tribute to Digital vibes, although both of them are not listed as investors.
Doom says it’s hard to believe that Mkhize, would have communicated to the media.
Unfortunately it was unfortunate when he joined the press conference.
He said he did not know. So far he knew that he worked a part when he was planning meetings with him, to be able to do a good job, so he recognised at a time.
And then, it will be a higher determination that the job position should be made in his office and he does not agree with it.
Explanation of the case Risha Maduray.
The Chairperson of the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg, Justice Raymond Zondo, says President Cyril Ramaphosa will appear before the commission at a later stage in June.
Ramaphosa will appear as the President of the country.
His previous appointment was the president of the African National Congress (ANC).
Ramaphosa was scheduled to give evidence next week but he will not do so.
Zondo says he will announce a date in June, and the president will appear with him.
Ramaphosa will be part of the deadline for oral evidence to the commission until it ends before they begin to make a petition.
State Capture Inquiry: 25 May 2021
Last month Ramaphosa appeared before the Commission as the President of the ANC.
He is also supposed to make restrictions for his tenure as the President of the government.
On Tuesday, the commission Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said they were hoping to end the evidence at the end of March, but they worked carefully to make this possible.
He said he will make questions so that he can easily and will appeal to a higher court to end the Commission’s Appeal.
Zondo said it was important that top officials in government agencies (SOEs) if there are allegations of corruption and arrest given time to testify.
Deputy Chief Justice Zondo said the Commission understands why there are applications for leave to cross-examine.
He was optimistic that the Commission could make some findings, but also some findings can be heard.
Justice Ngaka Llewellyn Curlewis says a special request by former President Jacob Zuma, to ask the Chief Justice, lawyer Billy Downer to withdraw from his criminal case at the Pietermaritzburg High Court, is a very valuable request.
Zuma and the Fora Division, Thales, have appealed against him on charges of corruption at the Pietermaritzburg High Court.
The matter was postponed to July 19 that the debate could be heard by Justice Piet Koen.
Curlewis says the Department of Defence will also have to raise special cases to the Special Court for Appeal for which it is recognised.
On Wednesday this week, Zuma’s legislature, led by lawyer Dali Mpofu, filed an appeal in court on the grounds of a special appeal that will be filed on July 19.
Appeal in line with Section 106 H of Criminal Procedure Act
The state will also have the opportunity to appeal their case on this matter, Downer has told the court that a state-owned agency should comply with this section because it was a matter of importance for a special appeal.
Former President Zuma is unacceptable.
Fela’s funeral is a funeral for her husband and grandfather.
Because of an appeal to the court, Spokesperson Mpofu has told the office that Zuma believes that Spokesperson Downer needs to comply with the agreement.
There are reasons and critical positions that revealed that Downer had been taken care of the way he needed to adhere properly and not properly, which is important in the enforcement of the law.
Downer fails to support the necessary positions to ensure that my trial is complete and done according to the Constitution.
Downer wanted to be part of the fight even though he left the affidavit with the support of a democratic alliance, a request for suspension and a reversal of a decision made by the NPA to end my trial.
Curlewis says Judge Piet Koen will be taken to the position of reaching a special application to respond to the evidence and trial as the judge, he says it is in the process of trial.
No, that’s not possible.
First questions started, which doesn’t mean that the newly elected judge will see the matter at the end, even though there is any reason for removal and will come back.
But that’s not expected.
When he was given the opportunity to appeal a special application, Thale’s protection was forwarded by Justice Barry Roux, he pleaded with pleasure that they were only witnesses in the matter.
And he says there is an opportunity ahead of them to respond to the request.
If a special appeal can show ambition, it is only time the accused can be expected to formally appeal the indictment on the grounds, but it will ask for the form of application, whether it is wrong or not.
In this regard, he does not respond.
It’s not easy to enter any special appeal, it’s all. It’s presented in section 106.
Tota tota 1 H, where they want to release the Chief Justice of the country.
In the case of the lawyer Billy Downer, who is now in minority positions, where will the court issue a special application?
But the reasons that have been raised by Dali in Zuma’s impeachment are that Billy downer will not be motivated and complaining about his performance in this regard, because he was complaining about the impeachment of the Democratic Alliance in a case he was in court and therefore, they are not complaining about it.
Curlewis explains the service that will follow after Justice Koen’s appeal, however, did not have the time for a special application.
If the protection did not come with their request to respond, and the office supports it, I ask, whether I am not clear in our guidelines and guidelines and the lawyers of the matter, they would not be heard, but we assume that they will continue to seek to look at any matter at the same court and then they are threatened to go back to a month and what will happen because it is unacceptable in the complaints even if somebody asks more than 106 part of the complaints not to say 106.
In the case of 1 H, I speak about the application of “I’m guilty” or “I’m not guilty” and at this time, “I’m guilty, the court must announce its findings after this application. It’s only the court that can do so, so the matter will continue after 19.
In the next few days, the national chief executive (NPA) will rise on June 2.
Zuma’s legal entity is expected to have their petitions on 5th of July, while the NPA will follow on 12th of July.
A special appeal show was scheduled for July 19.

But with their thousands already registered, Ntshavheni says they will have to give it a little bit to the nation.
He says the vaccination process was based on the absence of vaccines in their provinces.
On the issue of legal abuse of the 150 million digital vibes containers and corruption charges by Pholo Dr Zweli Mkhize under his mandate to work, tone Ntshavheni says they are taking the charges of legal abuse, the matter is not reversed in the cabinet.

DA funding MEC in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, says some of the victims who have been forced to use some nearby services, have not yet received medical service due to the highest need for help.
According to the Department there are some specific sections.
I think it’s very important to know.
And hospital service providers have allowed the safety facility to go from JHB, says Bloom.
Meanwhile, I am receiving very good food from babies, especially babies wearing and people in dializes who are unacceptable.
People are complaining that they have taken a variety of places but they don’t help them.
It’s a problem that happens because we look at the third wave.
The most important thing about going to the hospital is that people are sent to some of the nearby cities and we also have to know what is happening in the nearby cities; explains Boom.
Below are the questions that followed by Jack Bloom

If they are in town they don’t love us, we’ll love them now.
Zuma pleases not guilty.

ANC IPC Provincial Spokesperson, Hlomane Chauke, says the five accused, who have already received thousands, are encouraging the decision.
Chauke says, according to the meeting resolution and the guidelines we have addressed the five stakeholders that need to participate in the organisation’s duties.

The SACP says the entire country hopes that they will comply with the law.
Last week, suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, dismissed court papers contrary to the Constitutional Decision of the exercise of employment.

It’s 15 years since the charges emerged against former President Jacob Zuma.
His trial begins at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday.
Zuma and the prosecutors staff in France, Thales, are not guilty of charges of corruption, corruption, and financial misconduct in relation to the 1900s prosecution.
The trial was postponed to the 19th of June, with a special appeal filed by Zuma against the chief executive, lawyer Billy Downer.
The matter is postponed until July 19, 2021.
A former president’s rule of law led by spokesperson Dali Mpofu, in particular, accused government spokesperson Billy Downer of failing to comply with the matter.
Mpofu says Zuma was, in his hands, celebrating his day in court and also explains that it is because his lawyer does not receive a long trial when a Downer lawyer processes the government case.
There are reasons and statements that sound that Mr Downer was treated in a clear way that he was not able to stand up properly and that he needed to take a role in the implementation of the law.
Mr. Downer failed to support the necessary positions to safeguard the necessary measures to ensure that my trial was completed and processed in accordance with the Constitution, Mr. Downers appealed to them to be part of the struggle if he had put in charge the Democratic Alliance petition to step aside and submit a NPA resolution to end my trial.
Although Zuma used the accused clergymen to use all legal details to use his trial, he was forced to make the courts agree that his cases were suspended on political grounds in the face of the government.

The state has accused Zuma and Thales of organizing and managing an open house, which has a historic 25 year history at the end.

The state has accused Zuma of receiving R500 000 a year from Thales, which is predicted by the law.
Some charges against Zuma include allegations, donation of funding to parliament, and inviting the institution to meet supporters from the media.
Spokesperson Downer told the court that the government was good enough to respond to a special application, which they demanded to take over 1 000 shillings.
He says it includes a long trial.
My mother, after that we canceled the jabs and we worked very hard to cover our jabs in getting the jabs, we found a concern that the government has failed to submit charges to the accused among the jabs and also the government believes that after that they will cancel their formal application in our courts I must also say that we agree that the 106 jabs I is not enough and has a lot of reasons. We all agree that the government needs time to follow the findings.
Fellow Former President Edward Zuma is in court to support his father.
Thales explained in his application that he claimed he knew about Zuma’s salaries taken to Shaik.
Thales said their salaries to Shaik’s were in the business process as a collective strike for students.
Downer beat Zuma and Thales, led by Pierre-Marie du Randt.
Speaking to the court, Thales lawyer.
Prince Philip died this morning at the 99-year-old Windsor Castle.
The queen passed a month in hospital on issues related to the heart disease.
Reports are shifted down in Britain.
Johnson said Prince Philip was in attendance with his wife, Queen Elizabeth.
Prince Philip died at the Queen’s funeral more than a year after he died in 1947.
A statement from the House of Representatives said other submissions would be made in the course of time.
After receiving gifts as a great queen, the Prince of Borra Edinburgh took part in a formal moral service arrangement with the late Queen’s support in 2017.
I’ve spent a long time supporting the queen mother, I don’t have a single or two steps behind her in the society to look at the administration, they’ve lived 73 years ago in a royal family.
He was born in the Greek Corfu capital in 1921, reminding the marriage of Philip Mountbatten to Elizabeth, as he was, and announced in 1947.
Philip has passed the second term at the Lewatleng Hospital, where he was uncovered for his health and early recovery.
Winston Churchill’s mother-in-law described the royal’s marriage in April 1947, as a landslide in the country recovering from a new era after the pandemic.
A great king, who was forced to start from before, was forced to leave the ministry as the health of the royal was on the rise, king George VI.
It was in Kenya, with a national commendation, that Prince Philip told his wife that the queen mother, who is now the queen mother, is the queen mother.
From his funeral in 1953 to his funeral in civil service in 2017, Prince Philip had not worked with the queen mother.
But as her husband, he was left to follow his way.
His funeral in 1950 in London was distracted and speaking alone, sometimes attending the funeral while in royal cities, made a first note in the news.
Fela’s concerns about the unity of children and elderly elites were something that gave her life a lot of energy.
The unprecedented phenomenon has her own character, which helps her well-being and engage in solidarity with the youth in all areas of life.
In addition to her Edinburgh Duke’s family, she has lived and encouraged the lives of young people in many events, increased the happiness and encouraged their works.
We are grateful to the Duke and above all we are grateful to his spiritual support for the queen mother, not only as her lawyer, in her life, in her life, day and day in her grandfather, but only as her husband, her energy and living with her over the age of 70, says Minister Johnson.
The Queen of Edinburgh has passed over 143 states in official custody, especially in private custody.
The royal’s grandfather, Keen, had a long-serving place in the British Kingdom in difficult times.
In the coming years his participation in the society has been reduced, although the royal family wishes that his determination is not reduced.
SABC News Update UK Secretary, John Bevir.
Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth, a long-serving British royal family leader, died of 99 years, Buckingham Kingdom Hall said on Friday.
The Queen of Edinburgh, as he was officially known, won the funeral of her wife in the 69th wedding ceremony, spent a long time in British history, at the time serving a very respected name, without looking for a beautiful funeral and funeral.
I am saddened that the honorable queen mother, her husband, honorable Prince Philip, Edinburgh’s Duke, received a royal funeral.
The funeral will be held at Windsor Castle on Saturday at Windsor Castle.
Other recommendations will be made at a later stage.
The royal family, who gathered with people around the world, lauded her life.
A heart attack runs outside Buckingham Palace following the death of Prince Philip.
Britain’s Queen Elizabeth was born in 1947, where she played a crucial role in celebrating the royal royal in the past 2nd century, as well as in the backdrop of the Buckingham Palace which was a crucial place for the queen mother to live for her and her father.
She was, unclearly, and energy for me and for all the years, Elizabeth has always praised Philip in a special way, giving her a song commemorating the 50th anniversary of their wedding in 1997.
