However, this puts more families into different families.
Because of this wrong situation, some countries in Igbo land, made it law that a man must marry with her wife in celebration, which he does not do when he is dead.
Why marriage is used in ceremony:
In Igbo land, it is not acceptable that a man has married a woman if he has not fulfilled something on his behalf.
If he did that in court, it is expected that he would come to do something as the children wanted.
According to a cultural specialist Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (Second Duruagwu) in Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele of Imo state told the Igbo BBC, the law that has been implemented by the Igbo BBC, the law that
A person who is not married in life, he marries him in death, is the process many countries do.
But in Akukwa town as well as Imo state, the plan is not easy, where the girl families come to take their corpses and go to their home.
How to marry a woman in ceremony:
The person will come to tell the parents and their children with fire (he will not go a way to tell them that he has died).
They will join him to 'visit' their child, when they saw her corpse, they will accuse the man of killing their child, which will make him explain that he was the one who killed their child, which wil
To show that not he killed her, he would agree to marry the woman's corpse
She will come to marry her
She will come back and tell the children who have died
The man will continue to celebrate his ceremony.
What will happen to someone who refuses to marry a woman in ceremony:
According to Nze Ukaejuoha, these are things that will make a person who refuses to marry a woman who does not do his rights in ceremony:
The person will get suicide in different ways
Different things are meeting with the person
There is nothing that would not go well for such person.
The person could also die in the death
But that person may reflect, refuse if all these distractions begin to distract him.
What the person will do if he remembers
If the man stopped and eventually refused to remember because of the suspension he gets, these are the following things he will do:
That person will send their elder communities to come to make the land free
He will be given transparency by ensuring that he has done what he needs to do in two ways.
