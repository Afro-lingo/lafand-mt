They cautioned the Igbos to know that if they prepare Buhari's president to go into another match again in 2019 and the president would challenge the Igbo man's promise to be a woman on the ground, because it was a cramped statement.
In the republic, a number of APC members, the Ministry of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the federal secretary of Boss Mustafa and the director of Voice of Nigeria on Onsita Okechukwu told the Igbos to be among Buhari in 2019, let him arrive in 2023.

Did he have a spirit that resides in a child born with a dad?
What Igbo culture said about desolation in the olden days and also the motive behind it is now.
In the olden days, Igbo believes that those who are headed can do the occult
A babe in every house brings great joy in the heart of the former.
But there are some places in Igbo where a baby who is born to bite can be terrified.
The community is like Izo (Ibusa) in Delta state , where children are seen to fall down as special.
Who is the head?
Some reports explain that a baby who is born to be born should fall down because his mother pleads for a spirit in the land to give him a child.
Would you overreact this kind of arrest in the olden days
Do you know the gods that the Igbos are crossing in the past?

But the problem of people who are headed down.
It hurts you to take good care of your head
Holy joined in the
Many of the adventurers, believe that a child who is a bird will be seriously ill or die if he has successfully entered his shop.
It is the demeaning of the hair of the draft.
Everybody who does this should give the child money quickly or create a loan for his head.

What Igbo kolanut describes in delinquency
A professor of African and linguistic studies at the University of Lagos Chiago Nnabuihe explained to BBC Igbo in ancient times that there is no belief in the kidnappers.
Nnabuihe stressed that if an Igbo in old age has a conviction on the right that they should give him a name.
In his words: 'Dada is the name of yoruba gave him.
The Igbos who fall down are because they have had a relationship with the Yoruba.
But is it really bad?
Nnamdi Daniels was an actress.
Many people we interviewed said that there is no harm in the head but in the right while many still look down on those who have fallen down like bad guys.
The father of Daniels is a definitive man who told the Igbo BBC that he had bent on insulting him for his demeanor.
In his words: 'Theretera' was one time I traveled to Niger State University.
The security guard began to question me for my dad down. This caused me a lot of embarrassment.
