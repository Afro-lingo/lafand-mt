Monastery is a traditional ceremony known as Igbos
The martyrs, 'The Way' in the Idemili North Local Government in Anambra State, invaded a Catholic prayer meeting and destroyed more than 30 vehicles, injured many people, where it was thought that one of their handsome persons died on Saturday.
The Chief Priest of the church, Father Emmanuel Obimma, notoriously known as 'Ebube Monsu' and other priests, and the captured women who came to the place displaced the youths who attacked those who went for God's worship in the watch on Friday night into early Saturday morning.
A police officer, Francis Okoye told the BBC journalist on phone that the dead invaded the night meeting place at about 8pm and injured many people and destroyed more than 30 vehicles.

After the things turned out, we counted three times their damaged vehicles.

We do not know whether he is alive or dead.
It is evident that Uke youths have done what is expected to torture the Christians because, 'U streak' is being done, death is coming down at 6 : 00 p.m and the dead are invaded at night' at 8 : 00 p.m.
They started beating people with cars to bring to the church, collecting their money and phone calls.

The security officers tried their best to stop them from spoiling things but when we saw that things were going too far, we called the police.
They came and arrested some of them.
The Anambra state police said that the church was actually attacked by death but they said that nobody died.
The spokesman of the police in the state, Nkiru Nwode told the BBC that 'a friend who has been arrested three dead, we are investigating what happened there.'
The report said that this is not the first time the youths in the community are mistreating those attending this special Catholic church meeting held on Friday night, attracting more than 20 percent every week.
The people at the scene said that the youths in the community are persecuting motorists and churchmen and robbing them of money and some things.
In the aftermath, they beat the officer of Father Obimma, which led the officer to contact the police that captured the youths and left them when the king of the town and the elders fought.
It was alleged that youths mistreated motorists who frequently drive people to church

The Igbos have said that the Igbos will reject President Buhari's support during the 2019 election as they did in 2015.
They warned the Igbos to soon be aware that if they encourage President Buhari to enter the next presidential election in 2019 and the presidential election will reach Igbo is a promise given to a woman on a bridge, because it is deception.
Finally, the APC includes, Minister of Transportation and Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the secretary of the Federal Government, boss Buhari and also the chairman of the Voice of Nigeria, Mr Okechukwu, told the Igbos to compare Buhari in 2019, to reach them in 2023.

But some of the spokesmen said that the issue was a lie to get the Igbo votes, and people like Buhari challenged the Igbo for his release in 2015, that they would not give him in the 2019 election.
In a conversation with the Sun news agency who was the former governor of Anambra state, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife said: 'It was not seen how it could be done.
I don't think we should appeal to people for presidency.
My mind is that we will plead with God, who knows that if an Igbo takes the lead as president, the Fulani will be happy, the Yoruba will be happy, and the thinkers in Nigeria will be happy because we will adjust the Nigerian economy as he continues.
To speak about 2023 is an insurgency, everyone is saying it to deceive the Igbos.'
Similarly, the former President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Dozie Ikedife, said that the Igbos who have vowed to win the presidency mean nothing in the past.
He told the Sun press: 'A lot of such promises have been made to Igbos in the past, and our people have been deceived.
If somebody deceives you twice or three, when it comes to fourth, you think seriously.
The creation of the land is boring.
Ikedife went on to say: 'I am concerned that the law and dialogue will get Biafra without fighting or inciting everyone.'
Remember that in 2015, many Igbos failed to vote for Buhari, which made him not to give the 95 per cent voter and the five per cent voter the same wage, a word many expect him to have fulfilled by the people he has given the leadership since his entry into office.

What Sanusi said
Sanusi said that the person who is preparing to invest in Africa, 'he has Nigeria, has Ghana, has Rwanda, Kenya and South Africa'.
He went on to say, 'Nigeria may be more than all others in trafficking, but he could say instead of putting $500 in Nigeria, let me put $100 in Ghana, $100 in Rwanda, $100 in Code Vuwa, to win the award.'
'We went for a meeting with those who have their investments in the country, we should start by 9pm and we should start by 10pm.
When I arrived there, they took me to the house of the representative of Nigeria.
Those who came to the meeting were there, the Vice president was not there, the ministers were not there, Sanusi said.
Sanusi said that the action was not good, for it shows that Nigeria has not been prepared for what is being said.
He said, 'You invited people to come and hear how trafficking is done in Nigeria, but you did not come.
That's not how to get those who will invest in Nigeria.
If the meeting was organized by the Rwanda, their president, Kagame, would be there telling people to come to Rwanda.

three things having a lot of exchange rates leads to
IMF instructed Nigeria to summarize its exchange rates to one, while experts are saying the consequences of having more.
Naira
EFCC said that Umar is looking for a million naira
In an attempt to stabilise the Nigerian currency exchange, the IMF has advised Nigeria to combine its currency exchange.
Nigeria has at least five currency changes; one for the importers of fuel in Nigeria, one for Christians who travel to the faith in Saudi Arabia, one for Christians who travel to the holy land, and one for readers in overseas and one formed by the government.
As experts in economics Pat Utomi and Uche Uwaleke explained to BBC report, having a lot of money change was disastrous.
See some of the cases of multiple exchange rates:
It is causing harm
Pat Utomi explained that he is doing 'he who knows a person has the opportunity to raise money and sell it, but whoever has the need for the money to import what he will produce goods in the country without knowing somebody will not qualify for it.
It's not good for business progress.'

Currency Exchange: Has dollar fallen alongside naira?
In his speech, Uche Uwaleke gave a plan, 'As the exchange rate of the government is N305, a person is sold to the mouth, he may leave what he wants to get, sell it to another person N365, get interest, but if there is one exchange, you can't turn it back.'
It extends energy to intensify and produce in communities.
Uwaleke said that there is a lot of money change that makes them too much.
All they can do is to sell cheap currency, not produce produce.
It undermines the nation's economic development
Utomi said, 'If people are making the currency to send their child to the country for education, it will make everyone wants to send his child to the country for education, the schools in the country will fail.

Nigeria's peace has been put in Ekweremadu's hand again
About 109, if 108 senators are in Ekweremmadu's house now, it means they are all in his house.
Remember that the Senate decreed that the security agencies should immediately evacuate the house of the deputy senate president Ike Ekweremadu, where they attacked today.
Ekweremadu was prevented from coming out of his house in the morning, making him not to attend the council meeting held today, whereas up to 14 senators decamped APC to PDP.
Uche Anichukwu the spokesman of Ekweremadu, told BBC Igbo that the EFCC had prevented him from going out of his house in Abuja, that it was not the DSS as we wrote earlier.
@MrBanksOmishore, a special assistant of Bukola Saraki, wrote letters sent to Ekweremadu by the EFCC this morning, on Twitter.
In that letter, EFCC said that they want to investigate Ekweremadu for plotting, violating his office rights and borrowing money called'money laundering'.
As Saraki entered the senatorium and started the plenary, he spoke that Ekweremdu did not come, and said it should be done to ensure that his senatorial administration does not spoil.
Senate Sam Anyanwu said that he was with Ekweremadu yesterday, but no document showed that the police was looking for him.
After the plenary, the senators ruled that the security agencies should immediately leave the house of the deputy senate president Ike Ekweremadu, so that he can get his right.
This morning, Saraki was among those who prevented him from leaving his good house.
On the other hand, the Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari thanked those who left APC today for their success.
He said this through his tweet address @MBuhari:

But after the police arrested the four, they declared that they received the priest's family one million naira (N1.7m) as her capital money, but they shot it when they heard that the villagers were ready to come and bail her where she was arrested.
One of them stated that he was the gunman who killed him, whereas the remaining two lions are condemned to death on Wednesday.
In a message sent to the Daily Post by the priest's family, they expressed satisfaction that eventually, the penalty had reached them.
But they lamented that the decision reminded them of the killing of Adeyi, who is a professor.

Five things that interest women
Is it a culture that will end in Igbo land?
However, this usually involves families in turning around.
Because of this critical situation, some Igbo communities have made it a mandate for a man to marry a woman he lived with, which he did not have when he lived.
Why you should get married in general:
In Igbo land, it is not believed that a man has married, unless he has done something for himself.
Even if he does that of the court, he is expected to come and act according to the parents ’ wishes.
According to the culture specialist, Nze Olueze Ukaejuha (Duruagwo II) in Umuakara, issues in Nwangele of Imo state, told the Igbo BBC that this law is very true in their country, and that it has its various consequences.
Who never married in life, he married in death, is the tradition of many societies
But in Akoku and Imo state, the scheme does not sell any, where families of native women come and take their child's corpse and go and bury in their homes.
How to get married in general:
The person will come and tell my parents that their child has a fever (he will not first tell them that he has died).
They will follow him and visit their child, and when they see his corpse, they will accuse him of killing their child, thereby causing him to defend himself.
To prove that she was not killed, she would agree to marry the woman's corpse.
she will come and marry her.
He will come back and tell my children and his wife that they are dead
The man will then go on to celebrate his burial.
What will happen to a person who refuses to marry at all times:
As Nze Chkaejuwa explained, these things are what will happen to the person who refuses to marry without doing his own thing at all:
The person will experience punishment in various ways.
There are also different types of injury that beset the person
Things do not go well for such a person
The person may also die a shameful death.
But the person may be repentant, even if all these things start falling upon him.
what the person will do if he is repented
If the man has locked his ear and later regrets the loss of his legs, these things he will do:
The person will send the elders of the community to come and refine the land
He would be punished by ensuring that he fulfilled his obligations in two thousand ways.

Atiku came to America and he has a question to answer us-Lai Mohammed
Olusegun Obasanjo: what Atiku was better than Buhari
Obasanjo told BBC that he looked into Buhari's actions and saw that Atiku was better than two.
In a conversation with BBC Yoruba, the former Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, spoke about the former deputy and candidate in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar.
He said that he is right now that he will choose Atiku better because of Buhari's actions.
The people among them are who belongs to APC and PDP.
From what I saw in Buhari- unemployment, malfunction, corruption, weakness, mental and other factors compared to Atiku.
Atiku will do more than Buhari.
He also spoke about Boko Haram and the Independence National Electoral Commission (INEC).
Obasanjo explained that he believed in President Muhammadu Buhari as superior to Atiku, which is why he refused to support the youths out of the 73 candidates for the Nigerian presidency.
He also stated what happened before the military invaded Odi in 1999 when up to 2500 people were killed by the military.
The discussion will appear on the 22nd of January 2019.
Igboam also contributed to the fact that people who take drugs are not supposed because they don't take their money to the hospital.
According to Oriuiakhi, it is this kind of harrowing that some people are doing against thorns of prevention that caused certain thorns of malaria to die.
four things you do not know about malaria
He said that some people are going to kemist, denied the inability of the drugs from his medicines.
This will happen that when they need the drug, it will no longer work on them.
He also said that this is a health problem.
How can preventive drugs be effective?
People should be given good training for how to take preventive drugs.
Only when a doctor has prescribed these vaccinations is when he should be heard.
Nutrition: Obesity is not your baby's body
Those who sell preventive drugs should not deliver them to somebody but the person does not have his doctor's document.
'Culture and Sensitivity' should also be done before vaccination is given.
The person who does not go to the hospital will do research so as to be prescribed for proper treatment.
Healthcare workers should explain to people the need to know how to take these preventive drugs.

Inec said that the names of all those who were registered in the 2019 election were on their computer.
Festus Okoye and Emeka Unachukwu
Inec Commander Festus Okoye is insisting that the agencies do not have the 'Server' which gave them the opportunity to issue the 2019 election result.
Okoye said that Nigerian law did not give them the opportunity to do the same.
Justice Garba has seated in Atiku's trial in Buhari
The House of Representatives has said on the 2019 budget.
In his voice, 'Nigeria's bill has authorized to take to heart all the result of the elections contained in the EC8A form and go to where they will be treated.
The Nigerian law we used to do so is a election that does not know how to send any information via computer.
The Colation Officer is the duty of carrying the documents to the place needed.
We never used the computer to send out the result of the election.
Okoye confirmed that the enrollees for the 2019 general election are on the computer, and give all parties these names.
The incident form will not stop corruption in the elections
He emphasised that 'It is only when computers are used to vote that something is on the phone'
He said that he does not know about the 2019 election result.
Similarly, the BBC asked a renowned computer worker, Emeka Unachukwu what is'server'?
Unachukwu said that 'Server' is a computer that connects other computers with which different messages are kept.
He said that Inec could say that they don't have a server because there's another company that they were arrested but it is not true that they don't have a servant where there's a cell.
He said that the Internet has its own server while many people post their messages.
Unachukwu said that 'Inec will not say that they do not have a matter because they have a place to keep the data.
They may call this 'data base' and what it is because the computer unites others who are capable of drawing or sending messages to it'.
He said that it is difficult for Inec to believe that they do not have a servant.
They invite people to come and get their PVC ready for election
Unachukwu said that even if a voter was handed him over to a place he was counted, the Inec would also put him in the Server.
But they can say that they have not added the 2019 result to the'server' which indicates that they have not completed their project.

Dapchi children: The fight between Buhari and Jonathan has collapsed
The fight between Buhari and Jonathan for the kidnap of Dapchi students in northern Nigeria has collapsed.
Buhari embarked on a tour of neighbouring Nigerian towns including Taraba, Plateau, Benue before going to Yobe.
President Moh Muhammadu Buhari said that it is better for the former president, Goodluck Jonathan to look into the kidnapping of children
He said this yesterday when he made a visit to Dapchi, Yobe state, where the children were kidnapped last month.
He condemned the reign of Jonathan and the neglect of the Chibok students when they were kidnapped in 2014, and said that it was unreasonable.
Some of these students were kidnapped

The spokesman of the group 'Bring Back Our Girls' named Sesugh Akume has said that the president did not try
Akume said, 'We are not happy, this is four years of Chibok children's kidnap, now that it has happened in Dapchi as Buhari's administration is doing the same thing that Jonathan did in his due time.
It's up to one month that the children are kidnapped, but now the government is going there.
Notwithstanding all the rumours they made that they had rescued the children of Dapchi.
The president assured Dapchi's parents that he will rescue the kidnapped children

He said that during the kidnap of Chibok children, Jonathan called on a security meeting, where Buhari annulled the security meeting during the kidnap of Dapchi children.

Is it a culture that will end in Igbo land?
A baby is born, it is born with fish, hot water, sounds and wings. That's what is called birth
baby and mother
Debt is an Igbo culture that started since the olden days and is still happening to this day
Looking at a reward in Igbo culture is a time when a mother comes to visit her daughter and her child (which is her grandson).
Sometimes, if a woman has lost a mother ( if her mother has died), the wife of her father or the mother of her husband will come and treat her at home.
Five things that interest women
Women have adopted new forms of headship
The value of a woman is not exclusive
The reason why she is a woman who is waiting for birth rather than a man, is that she is thought to be the woman who knows most about her because she has gone through the situation herself.
The time of birth is when a mother teaches her daughter everything she knows about caring for a newborn baby.
Sometimes when the mother of a child goes home, the mother of her husband begins to look at her child's reward.
The woman who gives birth to a baby takes advantage of the opportunity of healthy birth when the mother takes care of the baby.
What a mother does in debt
A mother will give her daughter something that will make her milk well
The mother will prepare foods that will make it healthy
The mother will burn it in the womb and other places she wants, and boil it with a container that will burn it.
The mother will feed the baby, wash and bathe
She will attract the baby, and treat it properly
She will ensure that her baby is seated on the bucket with hot water and salts and antibiotics, which will make it possible for damaging blood
It will bother her so that she can and should get pregnant before pregnancy.
A mother will encourage her daughter because she has been in the first position with herself
She will also handle other household tasks such as managing houses and cooking for families.
The value of education
Debt is a time when the mother, her baby and baby enjoy good relationship called 'bonding' because of this many mothers go wherever their baby is born, either at home or abroad, to spend up to three months or more together.
She will instruct her daughter what the speaker also means, whether her child is tigered or harassed.
food that is supposed to be eaten in debt
The woman who is waiting for treatment has foods that she eats, some of them with blood in the womb during childhood in her midst, these foods are both roots and different foods.

People with guns attacked St. Phillips members last year
The women of Ozubulu under Ekwusigo in Anambra State went to the police station in Abujawbia to beg them to cover the night.
They did this because of the trial among those who thought they were attacking the church in their town on 6th August last year.
They said that the victims are threatening their lives and that is why they are looking for omens to give evidence against those who attacked them in court.
They took a petition to the place and wrote 'women want to prosecute' 'women want to cover the police in court'
What a witness said about Ozubulu's murder
Anambra police spokesman, Nkiruka Nwode told Igbo BBC that what is important to these women is for peace to take place in their country.
Nwode said that the women who practiced this pleaded with the police as they were preparing to go to court due to their homicide.
Anambra state police commanding officer, Garba Baba Umaru gave the women support, saying that they should go on.
Umaru told the women that 'as long as I am here, there is nothing that will happen to you, I will make sure you get enough judgment.'
What happened in Ozubulu
Those carrying guns went to St. Phillips church which became Catholic and shot people while they were churchgoing
The attack took 11 lives in the morning of August 6 2017,
The news said that it was the issue between two people living in South Africa that caused this
This led to the investigation of the Nigerian and South African police in the matter.
Those accused of plotting were: Onyebuchi Mbanefo, 46, Chukwudi Ugwu, 30 and Great Chinedu Akpunonu, 44
The case is still in court where witnesses are appearing on a daily basis.

Unmarried women are being harassed
Nkiru (we did not include her father's name as we promised him) is more than 30 years old working as a receptionist in his office in Lagos but has not yet been married.
Nkiru told the BBC journalist that his position is bringing him insults, oppression, violence and cruelty to his family and others.
The last time I went home, the people told me I had returned home if I had no man with my hand.
She also lamented that her uncle (and she has died) does not give her and her sister enough for them because they are not yet married.
Listen to what Nkiru said:

In Igbo land, marriage is a requirement for an elder
According to a study carried out in 2013 by National Demographic and Health Survey, women aged 15 to 19 were married by 28 percent while women aged 35 to 39 were married by 89.4.
The value of education in Igbo culture
Will this trend cease in Igbo land?
This is saying that marriage is a tribal culture in Nigeria
But if a woman is up to the age of getting married and she is not married, especially in the Eastern part of Nigeria, she is underestimated and some are harassed, most of what they have produced in life.
What is the cause?
According to the sociologists, the common cause of oppression or persecution of unmarried women is culture without real understanding.
In his speech, Dr Adedeji Oyenuga who is a professor of Sociology at Lagos State University, explained that it is a culture and that some unmarried parents look at the evidence of poor parenting of their child.
It comes from culture. There's a time when a child focuses on his parents, but when a child grows old and grows old, a brother is expected to marry, a brother is expected to marry. if he does not do the same, especially if he is a woman, his parents will think that they have failed in raising him.
Dr. Nkechi Emma-Echiegu who is a lecturer at Ebonyi State University also said that it is a culture.
In Igbo land, it is a parent who is asked who is getting married.
He went on to say that it is a bad culture that a girl is being insulted or oppressed for not married.
Listen to his words in mourning:
What happens without getting married on time:
Dr Adedeji Oyenuga said that one of the reasons why a woman does not get married on time is high schooling which could cause men to fear her.
He also stated that men usually leave their born place for longer periods than women, so that getting married to an adult is very difficult.
What unmarried girls are suffering from harassment
According to Professor Oyenuga, it is against unmarried women that bring glory to such things as drunkenness, smoke, insecurity, extreme anxiety called 'depression', which can cause extreme death, jailing.
Echinho said that it can cause various tragedies including much thought, hurtful speech, marriage, loss and violent death.
They said that having insight will help you stop the misbehaviour that makes a single woman perceived unworthy.
