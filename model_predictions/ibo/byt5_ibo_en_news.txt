Many times people are asking why marriage is used in some parts of Igbo land, the story explained.

There are most reports of some youths or young people who loved themselves, and agreed to collaborate as married couples.
Sometimes there are also different accidents in this situation, especially a woman who died in the house without a marriage or relationship event.
Woman's character in Igbo land
Five things that interest women
Will the culture stop in Igbo land?
However, this is more affected by different families.
Because of this situation, some countries in Igbo land, made it law that a man must marry his wife with himself, which he did not do when he was young.
Why marriage is used in the body:
In Igbo land, it is not acceptable that a man has married a woman, if he has not fulfilled what he has done.
If he did the court, it was expected that he would come to do as the parents wanted.
According to a cultural expert Nze Olueze Ukaejuoha (The Second Duruagwu) in Umuakara, Isu in Nwangele Imo state told BBC Igbo, the law was prohibited.
An unmarried in life, he married in life, is a process many countries do.
But in Akokwa town also in Imo state, this plan is not worthy, where the families come to take their children's bodies and take their home.
How to marry a woman in the body:
The person will come to tell my children and their children that they have fire (he will not tell them that she has died).
They will go to 'visit' their child, when they saw her body, they will accuse the man of killing their child, accusing him of killing their child, which will make him happy.
To show that it is not him she will agree to marry the woman's body
She will come to marry her
She will come back to tell my children and her wife have died
The man will continue to celebrate his birthday.
What will happen to a woman who refuses to marry a woman in the body:
According to Nze Ukaejuoha, these are things that will make a woman who requests to marry a woman without his heart:
The person will have different ways
There are different things that affect the person
There is nothing that goes well for someone who is such a good person
The person may also die in death
But the person might forgive, thought if all these influences began to influence him.
What someone will do if he refuses
If the man called and later refused to forgive his prosecution, these are things he will do:
The person will advise the young communities to come to make the land disappear
He will be given transparency by ensuring that he did what he should do in two ways.

The mother will bring food to the new baby, put his hands and put him
She will also breastfeed the new baby, even if she is properly breastfeeding.
She will ensure that her child is sitting under a box containing fire water and virus drugs, which will lead to blood from the blood.
She will be forgiving her to be able to today and understand how public before he is able to do.
A mother will be warning her daughter because she has been in the first situation.
He will also do other activities in home such as organizing the house and family foods.
The benefits of education
The pregnancy is the time of a mother, her daughter and her new baby called 'bonding'. For this many mothers travel to the hospital and many mothers travel to the hospital.
