What Igbo culture said about desolation in the olden days and also the motive behind it is now.
In the olden days, Igbo believes that those who have fallen from the head can do the occult
A babe in every house is bringing great joy in the heart of the former.
But there are some places in Igbo where the baby who is born can be terrified.
The towns are like Izo (Ibusa) in Delta state , while children are seen to be trapped as special.
Who is the head?
Some reports explain that a baby who is born to be born should fall down because his mother pleads for a spirit dwelling in the land.
will you do the kind of sacrifices that were made in the olden days?
Do you know the gods that the Igbos are passing in the old days?
They believe that the definition is a prelude to the spirit of the child which they will know it.
They call the children 'Ezenwa'.
They believe that their dad is their crown.
As they did with conviction, a child who dared to be a child will succeed in the world because his god was stable on his side, they were very strong and that they will carry a hero during the war.
But the problem of people who are headed down.
It hurts you to take good care of your head
Holy joined in the fall
Many of the coaches, have the belief that a child who falls a tantrum will suffer serious illness or die if he has successfully entered his shops.
It is a deficit of the hair of the presidency.
Anyone who does this should give the child money quickly or borrow money from his head.
The goal would end the child with serious illness.

This has caused many Igbo lamena to change.
Now many Igbos are not convinced that the wicked spirit creature who resides in the development of any child falls down to the world.
But they still take such a child from house to house as the priests prayed to him.
Dr Anthony Mgbolu told the Igbo BBC that the collapse of the house is what leads to the family.
What Igbo kolanut described in the fall of the princes
A professor of African and linguistics at the University of Lagos, Chiagozie Nnabuihe explained to the Igbo BBC in ancient times that there is no belief in the kidnappers.
Nnabuihe stressed that if an Igbo in the olden days had a conviction on the basis of their dad should give him a name.
In his words: 'Dada is a name given by yoruba.
The Igbos who fall down are due to their relationship with the Yoruba.
But is it really bad?
Nnamdi Daniels is an actress.
Many people we interviewed said that there is no harm in the head but in the right, many people still see those who have fallen from the headache as bad.
Daniels's father is a headman who told the Igbo BBC that he has demeaned for insulting him for his demeanor.
In his words: 'Echeteram once I traveled to Niger State University.
The security guard began to question me for my demeanor. This caused me a lot of shame.'
