They warned Ndigbo that if they were to support the president Buhari to go to the next election in 2019 that the presidential election would serve as a guarantee for a woman on the stake, for it is a deceitful matter.
In the end, most of the APC members including, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, the Secretary of the Federal Government Bos Mustafa, also President of the Voice of Nigeria, Mrsita Okechukwu, urged them to join Buhari in 2019, to reach them in 2023.

In his discussion with the Sun Commissioner for the Anambara State, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife said: 'In't see how it will be done.
We don't think we should be asking people for the position of president.
My mind is that we are going to pray to God, who knows that if the Igbo man has appointed as the president, will be happy with the Fulani people, who are Yoruba and whose Yoruba are very good for Nigerians because we will reconstruction the economy of Nigeria to continue.

Ikedife went on to say: 'The need is the same that will adhere to the law and inclusion of Biafra and not fighting for anybody.'
Remember that in 2015, most of the Ndigbo did not vote for Buhari's election which led him to accept the support of 95 percent and those who gave it to five per cent, many of his statements have proved true by those he gave to rule since he entered office.

Why a woman is married:
In Igbo, it doesn't admit that a man has been married, if he has not done anything in his head.

How to marry:
The person will come to tell my children that their child has a fever (thin it will not have told them that he has died
They will go to their child, when they see his corpse, they will accuse the man of killing their child, which will make him disqualify his hand.
To show that he was not killed by him he would accept the burial of the woman.
She will come to marry her
She will return to tell my family that she has died
The man will then attend his burial ceremony.
What will happen to a person who refuses to marry:
According to Nzejuha, these things are what will happen to a man who refused to marry his wife without having her head in full:
The person will undergo punishment in various ways
Bad things are also different for the person
Things do not go well with such a person
The person can die shamefully
But the person could rematch, thirty if all the damages started.
What the person will do if he repents
If the man took his ear and eventually repented because of the damage he had, these things he would do:
The person will send the elders to come and calm
He will be punished by ensuring that he meets what he needs to do in two stages.
