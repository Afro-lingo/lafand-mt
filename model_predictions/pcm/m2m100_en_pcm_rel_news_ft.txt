Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don ask di Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) make e mind im business and make e stop to dey oppose di Muslims right to dey operate Shariah.
MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, tok am for her statement on Sunday
Dis one follow a warning wey di PFN issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di constitution review wey dey go on by di Senate.
PFN and oda Christian groups dey aware say Shariah dey di South West decades before di arrival of christianity for 1842.
dem dey practice sharia for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, wey be Muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court wey dey operate till 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem carry am go Agbongbon area for 1914

Oba Aliyu Oyewole wey be di seventh Akirun of Ikirun (died 1912), wey dem institute Shariah for Ikirun for 1910
Dis na just example of di existence and spread of sharia for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Sharia for Yorubaland kom impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.

Hin tok say awa Christian neighbawas know well say shariah na di Allah-given fundamental human right of muslims

Dey believe say dem dey wit Muslims for war and to dem, evritin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and foul means to dia objective
We dey call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa christian neighbours.
Like all aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence.
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last more dan one century, dem don decide to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeathed to dem
Dem don decide to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters go drive dem go
Di Constitution Review Panel tell Nigerians say make dem forward dia view regarding wetin dem want for di constitution.

Na attempt to gag Muslims for di South West and e no go work
E tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery.
Muslims for di region dey wake up dey ask for freedom
we demand make dem halt di forceful use of christian school uniform, christian education, christian law
We dey demand for civil shariah, no be criminal shariah wey involve to dey cut hand but civil shariah to regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anything wey e go do wit Christians
He add say; We go use evri peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to reach dis objective.

Police I guess get som question wey I fit answer.
For hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write say, di soul of awa innocent pipo dey more important pass dis scam wey dem dey call Nigeria unity
Dem no go accept dis illiteracy, enough na we be peacemakers

Buhari you failed us woefully, you dey urge Imo police make dem confront di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write say, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent fulani herder dem and now dem don turn to northern goment officials & prominent politicians dem.
Di IPOB wey dey outlawed, inside one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, fault report linking am to di murder of Gulak, noting say di assasination of politicians no dey part of im agenda.
We, state witout equivocation say IPOB no know anytin about di assassination wey dem tok.
For di first place, which threat di late Gulak constitute to awa kos to warrant hin elimination?
we no get anytin wit ham and we no fit kill am anyhow
To dey point di accusing fingers for IPOB for dis barbaric act na only to divert attention away from di real masterminds.
Dis na di same way terrorist dem for security uniform dey commit different atrocities for South East and dey turn around to blame IPOB for dia crime just to tarnish awa global reputation.
Dis na smokescreen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans.
Instead make di security agencies dey investigate di incident and possible factors, dem go swit go accuse IPOB of a crime wey we no sabi anytin about.
Shey IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak make im get waylaid am for airport?

Di perpetrators of dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri.
Dis contrivance suppose mislead, confuse and destroy.
E bears di unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on how dem dey put di kontri for di path of conflagration.
Dem no go allow dis criminals suceed.
We wan use dis medium to express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma.
We advise hin and oda governors dem for di South Eastern State make dem brace up, kom confront di current security wahala wey dey make dem end di bloodbath for di land
Di enemy dem of di pipo dey always employ di weapon of fear to create disaffection for di polity
Dem calculate dis cowardly act to instigate Nigerians against each oda, especially Northerners, against di Igbo wey dey live outside di South East.
We need confront di enemy dem of di pipo wit a view to neutralise dem.
True true dis no be di time for political correctness.
Make dem no allow banditry subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all levels.
We dey call all security agency to join bodi wit a view to unveil di criminal elements wey dey sponsor and undertakin terrorist acts.
Dem go need punish dem seriously.

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom dominating topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
End Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dem dey struggle to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey seek to stop di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce herder-farmer conflict wey dey deadly
While di plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenge
Deficient political leadership, popular misperception about di purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by di COVID-19 pandemic, lack of personnel wit di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, dey all hinder progress
If di plan fail as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Approved by di National Economic Council for January 2019, di Plan represent di comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
Di core na strategy to curtail migration or open grazing, and thus, reduce di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmer
E dey animated by di hope say ova 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go dey persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breedingg farms and oda livestock management practices na to boost di sector's productivity.
By di end of 2028, authorities go get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all participatin states, wey go create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processin and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buhari administation kom up wit di Plan afta di wave of violence wey dey between herder dem and farmer dem, a surge for related violence wey dey afflict rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don commit to dey fund 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participatin states submit, don take preliminary steps toward puttin di Plan into practice, including to dey provide technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like help wit field surveys and site maping.
Plenty states don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, dey open office dem and dey set up steering committee to administer di Plan
Authorities don also do workshops and do oda works to explain di benefits of livestock reform to large audience
But two years inside di 10-year plan, di first new ranch neva dey build, and di obstacles plenti
Di opposition, partly among herder dem, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plan benefits to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land between herder dem and farmer dem, notwitstandin peacemakin and military efforts wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget don dey pinched, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri no get sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey scare away potential investors.
Unless dem solve am, dis and oda problems fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, leaving di kontri vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate to wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To tackle dis challenges, federal and state authorities go need effort, wit help from dem donor and investor.
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to disple misgiving and misperception about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, dem go ask dem to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and dem legitimately doubt di Plan promises about available pastures.
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Plenti pipo for di Middle Belt and southern states dey deeply suspicious of di plan long-term goal, wey dem see as creating privileges for herder dem, and more broadly, di Fulani
wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment need build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production wit meat processin
Federal and state goment suppose dey do budgetary commitments, make dem quick release moni and make dem provide financial transparency wey go ensure say dem dey accountability, dey work wit donors and investors as e dey necessary
To dey address rural insecurity, to dey stop di impunity and to dey rehabilitate communities wey di violence don affect before wen dem dey participate states dey important
plus, authorities go need consider climate change wey fit impact and reach one decision about how di transhumant herder dem wey cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from di Plan
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plan proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible result for a relatively short-term basis.
less dan two years now, di kontri go hold general election
If to say di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to dey able to produce clear proof of hin benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and many state governors are not available to compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
ideally, by di time campaignin heats up for late 2022, make di Plan backers dey able to point to at least handful of ranches wey dem just construct or reserves wey dem rehabilitate, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first cadre of livestock management professionals wey dem just train
E no go easy, but di plan dey worthy di effort
While e dey far from perfect, e offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of herder dem and small scale farmers
Na about 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity ova di same time say e take a big step toward resolving one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts.
wit di clock tick down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quickly to make a visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity lost
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to hasten its implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kin problem wey I get wit di king
no una agree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na small holders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dem dey hold back from participating more actively for commercial oriented agriculture by variety of constraints.
No energy for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own / mine own
Na dis dey bring me for di conclusion say evryone na evil
Dem don characterise dis systems as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey generally small, dem dey always hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey marginal or risk-prone environments
Yield dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase yield.
we dey tok say life and prosperity to dis day
send your account number
Di emphasis now na on top agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as enterprise
I sabi eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yield wey di smallholder farmers dey get dey really profitable
Shey you dey kom?
Dis wahala wey dey emerge dey lead many small farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower-risk and lower-yieldin agricultural activities.
Shey you be witch?
I dey my way to sabo market to buy food stuff
make I call my papa
As developing kontri populations dey grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go apun for quick changein agri-food value chains
so far wetin dey, make I dey my way?
Dis developments dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di kwanta
E go require integrated approach of methodologies
di loan sharks dey on hin neck
Na dis kind thing be
I dey errand from my work place
Di water don flood di whole farm
Plenti battle of farmers for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders wey dey di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers go need contend wit.
Di agricultural sector don face plenti challenges wey dey range from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agricbusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time wey dry season farmers wan harvest dia crop and wet season farmers wan start cultivation.
Plenti farmers no fit access dia farm while for odas to get labourers to harvest dia farm since mechanization na huge challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus lock-down market don scatter di rural economy.
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so dem go fit buy seed and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services.
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer too high dat plenti smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go as high as N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey suppose dey sell for farmers for N5,000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia rise di price no go reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places.
for farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activity no only deny dem access to dia farm but kom leave many pipo wey dem kill for dia farm
plenti farming communities na hin dey raze down
Dem don kidnap plenti pipo for ransom.
Plenti don pay large sum of moni or don surrender large portion of dia harvest to di bandits.
Plenti village for dose states don bikom desolate
Di agric sector also witness one of di worst disaster wey apun wen flood whip out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize farm wey dem estimate at ova N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Plenti of di affected farmers neva dey compensate as dia livelihood don destroy
Di flood be di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Naija coastal cities and flood-prone areas wey dey kil pipo and washing away farmland
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey face drought
For two months, farmers watch dia investment for crops witered away
no disguise
Anoda subsector wey dey badly hit dis year na poultry and feed
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos price to increase
E kom force di Poultry Association of Nigeria to send a save our Soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers plus to grant some of di big players license to import about 222 metric ton of maize make dem increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean hit, wey make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut down completely
Di scarcity result for serious feed crisis for di industry as price reach record high for hin history as e dey rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,000 now
Di poultry industry don lose estimated N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem project to reach 10 million by January 2021 but dem estimate di loss for investment conservatively at about N1.5 trillion
While di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marry di subsector, di crop farmers despite di daunting challenges wey face di sector tru di 2020 farmin year, don buyers wey dey kom right up to dia farms even before dem harvest to make bulk purchase arrangement
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, wey dey cause fear of looming hunger and di call for di border to dey reopened, wey go allow a influx of smuggled products through di kontri's porous borders.
Di name of di lord na strong tower

Today, dem dey sell maize for N210, 000/MT for most states of South-West, soya meal for N240, 000/MT
due to di importance of dis two items, di price of poultry feed don dey continue to dey increase from N2750 to N3000 for April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now
For December, most farmers no fit sell dia broilers bikos di cost of production dey high pass wetin average Nigerian fit afford
Right now, egg dey go out of di reach of an average family wey get ideal price for N1,300
We really need goment intervention to save di current 10million jobs for di poultry value chain of awa economy

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy trends dey for di public domain, as Southern governors dey slamming a ban on it during dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN) and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, examine how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di Southern State governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminalities.
Na wetin you take on top di controversy wey dis decision cause?
Evri human being get right to action and opinion
But di one wey important pass be say once una take una action, una suppose dey aware of di consequences
Una suppose dey able to consider di advantage and disadvantage
I no be one of those wey tok say e dey good or bad
As a Nigerian, you get di right and freedom to live anywia for di kontri wit good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
On dis basis, I no go tok say e be good tin
But as a leader for di North Central, I go tok say e dey good tin, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefits for us and di nation
Di ban be an advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am realventure and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herder dem no matta di number wey fit make troop from di South into di North Central
Wetin be una position on top open grazing?
I no be one of di propagator of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as a pesin.
I believe say if we take to ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central Governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching.
Dis kind move fit make di North Central cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products
And den e becom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo.
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herder dem and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenges wey di Fulani herder dem dey pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di kwanta be say dem no dey educate dem on e advantage
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem go need dey well educated to embrace ranching.
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia almost all di family get ranches and u no dey see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for be dat?
Di governors dem no dey categorical for dis regards.
Dem no dey call for ranching and for federal goment make dem kom inside
wetin dem dey tok be say di herder dem don bikom problem to us and make dem go away
Dem tok say make di herder dem apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don ask dia indigenes make dem apply for land like di herder dem
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programme, especially for di agricultural sector and di value chains, why some government policies dey fail to realise dia objective and wetin be di way out?
Firstly, administation no dey wey fi touch di lives of pipo like President Muhammadu Buhari administation whereby you fit conveniently sit for your house and apply for facilities and you fit get am
Di target credit facility wey dem also know as COVID-19 loan dey
Many Nigerians don get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia homes and dem no even go office.
Also, wit SMEs wey dem dey expand such as di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two side of doz wey go believe in you and doz wey go criticise you
For pipo wey no believe in Buhari's administation, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for it

Passage of forensic Bill by National Assembly: E dey relevance to Buhari's fight against corruption
Di National Assembly of di Federal Republic of Nigeria for Wednesday 19th
May 2021 for di House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 for di Senate don make history as dem passin into law, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.
791), afta dem read am for di Third Time in both Chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, wey go target to strengthen and re-invigorating national frontiers for di fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, wey don eaten deep inside di fabric of awa nation.
wit di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguish and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly, hin ardent resolve to carry out hin legislative functions in line wit di provision of di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended.
And dis also attestate to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great joy and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dem don put togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on top so we go fit complement national efforts for im quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and cyber-crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di Senate don pass dis Bill, and bikos of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di house of representatives wey dey ready and resilient, under di leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di Hon.
Speaker follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As u fit know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don dey among di bill wey dem dey attack most viciously and wey dem dey antagonise pass for di National Assembly for recent time.
Sadly, di attack kom from those wey suppose be partners in progress in di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don designate demsef as enemies of di general good
Good is good e no get substitute so e also bad
No mata how e take long, gud dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important for us to get glimpse of how e apun for di National Assembly
Interestingly, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na hin dey first passed into law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dem don undergone di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for hin 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 di bill was unanimously passed into law by di Nigeria Senate afta dem consider di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no dey witout series of thunderbolts from detractors wey no go stop at any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful to assist Buhari administration to fight corruption no dey see di light of di day but di senate andthroughdi firm.
E dey veri important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but new one for Nigeria wey dem dey target to bridge di gap wey don dey exist for di forensics space
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-goment bodies wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no be lie say, na clear demonstration of e patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national effort wey dey towards di fight against corruption, wey don hide development for evri aspect of awa national lives.
Di legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of the National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, e dey kom for a time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
wey go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di increase spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di world
As all of us know, crime generally, don take new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century
therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit global reality wey dey emerge and e dey ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians
E dey good make we still tok am say di journey, wey culminate to di passage of dis Bill, start for di 8th National Assembly whereby, awa Bill na hin dey sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen im be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
for di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers during di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings were conducted by di relevant Committee of di respective Chambers
Afta, wit opposition from stakeholders wey dey minority, wey di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead, di National Assembly pass di Bill, bikos of wetin e mean and di part wey e go play for di fight against corruption.
Afta, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019
E dey di strength of dis, say dem introduce di Bill again for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, wey be di current Leader of di Senate, dey sponsor am, bikos of di importance wey dey attached to am.
We get am for mind to make dis clarification so we go fit clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propell say awa Bill na hin di 8th National Assembly reject.
Di fact say awa Bill dey mistaken for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di Senate and di House of Representatives Chambers
Dis Bill, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem be merely duplication of di intent and purports of awa Bill
We suppose stress say dem no introduce any of dis Bill for di 8th National Assembly, oda dan our Bill
So, na we be di first wey ever kom up wit a Bill of dis magnitude(Forensic)
don see say na urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
Dem don take di decision to establish di Institute afta painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how well dem don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey so tey 2009
And ova di years, we don train professional for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go dey target to inculcatin di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, weda na error or fraud kos am; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cyber security; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
You go agree wit me say for di world wey we dey today, di conventional ways wey we dey use investigate crimes, wit a view to dey fight am don bikom obsolete
As such, for us as a nation to do something wey dey meaningful for dis regards, e dey perfect make we align awasef wit di global trend and innovations wey dey emerge, wey dey target for fighting corruption.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say dem conceive di idea to establish dis Institute wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill here
Howeva, I wish crave your indultance to highlight some of di objective of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria so dem go fit develop and train Professionals for dis special field,throughdia systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in di use of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in di investigation of fraud for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standard dem, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners for di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and also develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di existing huge vacuum for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of one special operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri spend hin scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigation for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involve professionals like Lawyer, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists
E go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanism,throughdia provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey relevant to tok am again say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standard
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute include but e no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accountin; forensic nursin; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Also, una go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on top, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity wit international best practices
Dis concept dey far pass di reasoning of those whose myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia sense of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evribodi to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out strongly to oppose im passage bikos according to dem, e dey unnecessary duplication of functions wey dia Institute don already undertaken.
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and acceleratin legislative supports, awa Bill don receive from di two Chamber, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na one unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce a similar Bill wey dey currently before di House of Representatives, as dem don fail woefully in dia attempts to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make dem no get any institute wey go dey regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as me
I wish also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no dey commot for dis funny theatrical episode
Like dia ICAN colleague, dey don introduce Bill for House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey ANAN initiate and dey promote
I decide to bring out all diz facts so dat Nigerians and even di international community go understand di extent wey some pipo fit go so dem go fit dia aims
Howeva, we no dey perturbe by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin is right and not to allow dem manipulate dem for any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as not to make mockery of di whole thin.
Di known practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN bikos say e don bikom evident
Dem engage several bystanders into writing frivolous petition some even target for di leadership of di Senate wit a tone of blackmail
As dem don fail badly at di senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders write all kin publication
again, dey fail
ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill wey di Senate don pass go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observation dey
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and for di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persins wey dey seek to becom Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) dem passed into law by di House of Representative.
ICAN don register im Bill for di House of Representatives wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Dis ICAN new bill get full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead such a persin to some years inprisonment.
Dis dey strange for a kontri wey full of enlightened pipo.
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level wey corruption dey
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives
Make we note am say, awa challenge di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow dia antiks deceive awasef and Nigerians.
You go remember how ICAN strongly opposed dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of its publication wey di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey Engr.(Chief) lead
Olumuyiwa Alade on di 24th of May, 2019 don make frantic effort to say ICAN under im enable law dem dey empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to dey passed it go amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present im ACT to repeal and re-enacted wit di inclusion of Forensics for di new law.
Di question na, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN dey always tell di public say e get forensics don dey seek for hin re-enactment
As e dey always be, while we no dey opposed to any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for hin law, we dey howeva concerned dat a bodi should not try to perpetuate esef.
ICAN wit dia cohort dem don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so dem wan get bodi for inside demsef
Wetin dem dey fear na check and balance, dem no go want make anoda professional bodi investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis kontri
How dem fit wan be judge for dia own case?
E dey strange
On dis note, we dey call di National Assembly make dem beware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit dey tok from both side of dia mouth and dey expect make di National Assembly cajoled.
We wan appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly again to ensure say di Bill don pass, di Nigerian pipo dey more dan before convinced of di readiness of dis administration to fight corruption through evri possible means and go at all time encourage legislation wey dem aim to dis goal.
We dey sure say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate to assit dis Bill as e reach hin desk
We dey call on all Nigerians make dem kom and make dem dey part of di Forensics Profession
Di profession dey open to all professional for various fields of endeavours
One trainin arm of di institute go guide you studiously and equip you
I wish thank you all and make you repeat awa resolve and commitment to uphold ethical standard in line wit global best practices, wen we dey render awa professional service and trainin wey go bring about innovative ways wey dem go use fight corruption and financial crimes, generally
I wish appeal to all stakeholder and well-meaning Nigerians make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore all of us make we make frantic effort so dat collectively, we fit surmount di threat of corruption, di plethora of security challenges, across di kontri and oda associated crises.

between DSS and regional separatist
DSS don repeat warning to pipo and groups wey em be provocative disruption of di ethno-religious environment and dey threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks for dis kontiri, dem begin dey sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingering questions about who or which persins and groups di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourse for di heated rhetorical outburst of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Ihe Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E kom start on top wetin be di persins and groups wey dey continue to dey use inciting, unguard and divisive statements, and acts wey dey use pit citizens against each oda so e go dey inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS don charge for one of its warnings.
Wetin dey interesting be say, no one of dis prime suspect for di exploitation of some fault lines wey fit kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance esef from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency see.
Dem kos common conviction say DSS know those wey dey responsible, differing only for di respective directions of dia accusing finger
As Afenifere don return dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehashed im grouse about plenti pipo wey dey feel say dem dey alienated and ACF don feign ignorance, dey ask who dem be di pipo?
So tey di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive to deal wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crisis and dem know dem; make dem treat dem according to di law
You no suppose know wetin DSS know about all dis pipo wey get geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem know say DSS know dem, even say dem insist to dey pass di buck outside dia cliques.
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics know of no beta solution to Nigeria myriad problem than for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord am ova di rest of di kontri as ruler, no be leader
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous as dem dey pursuin dia inordinate ambition say dem dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce evritin wey dey take excisin di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease to dey cut dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to inordinate ambition of pesin or group restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, e dey easy than don do.
Dis regional groups dey constitute major hindrances to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag independence
As long as dem continue to dey parade di political terrain as ethnic champion, so long dem go regard Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake for di population, make dem claim am or seize am and, if all di oda fail, deconstructed and disowned as a fail state.
Anywia wey dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless im leadership dey firmly for dia level, odawise, e dey about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Weda na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go dey different to Nigeria quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda undeniable indication of dis regional separatist be say dem all be self-styled political pressure group masqueradin as representatives of various ethnic groups.
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consists of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency dey give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to dey relevant for democratic system wey dey entirely by elected representatives through registered political parties wit legislative and executive institutions konstitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all dem brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey always threaten and attempt, so dat, perchance, dem fit regain political relevance if not kontrol.
Na di reason why dia frequent clandestine meetin dey trigger security alerts
As dat kind predator-politicians dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intension to dey undermine di goment wey dem elect just bikos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest go dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robber dem, bandits and ally terrorists, wey dem combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.
double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of di Buhari administration having to contend wit such array of formidable fees unleashing incessant attack on national security for a time of unprecedented economic adversity
To reach dat extent, na only two groups of politicians fit dey: those wey dey positively participate for di democratic dispensation as partner in moving di nation forward against all odds and those wey dey negatively engaged in planting seed of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
By dia utterance and activities, we know dem!
At di end of di day, di majority of Naija pipo be ordinary citizen wey hin condition of survival wey dem no determine by and e no depend on di geography of dia origin
dia struggle to eke a livin dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith
Nigeria na dia destroyed fatherland wey dem dey loyal to, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get any oda kontri wey dem go call dia own, collectively showing how citizenship dey breeds true patriotism
Dey also know say Afenifere, Ihe Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to dey incit, unguard and divisive statements and activities to pit citizen dem against each oda in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambition of dia leaders.
Soso, di poor man prayer go remain:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER

RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tagged Hijab Bill by a section of di Nigerian media
Di two events don cause heated and often emotional debate wey, for di bottom of it all, dey threaten to negate Nigeria multicultural identity and reality
Di idea wey dey Kwara of di proprietors of di schools ban hijab-adorning Muslim student dem and dia sympathisers fit dey reduced to wetin not to wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities.
female Nigerians dey face wit bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to show dia faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence for taking dat kind position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians wiava or weneva dem dey threatened wit discrimination based on dia faith wey dem professed.
Running through di argument of di proprietors of di christian faith schools for Kwara, one could easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda schools for anoda place if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey dey get dis argument dey plenti
First, to say Muslim student dem suppose go anoda place unless dey conform to di school rule on uniform dey very small to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society
Secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: e dey justifiable to base a school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Den, thirdly, di go elsewia argument dey appear to ignore di difficulty to dey change school for pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of changing schools for a pikin, educational psychologists go tell you say, e dey interfer negatively wit no be only im emotional but academic development too.
Last last, di Christian faith schools by dem risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization by concentrating students wit di same religious beliefs for particular schools.
Di social cost of dis exacts on di society dey enormous.
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argu, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say hin policy to allow Muslim schoolgirls wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony anchored on mutual respect and understanding
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, signed di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable is it to deny Nigerian pikin access to school of hin choice on di manifestation of hin religion?
Na big concern bikos Nigeria dey signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say everybodi dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 articles on di right and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political right like di right to life, free speech and privacy
E also include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find articles 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey very relevant to di issue under consideration and quote dem for full below:
Article 18: Everybodi get di freedom to dey think or believe wetin dem want, plus di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to dey practice awa religion for public or privately, alone or wit odas.
Na evrione get di right to education
Make primary schooling dey free
Make all of us dey able to kontinue awa study as we wish
For school, dem suppose help us develop awa talent, and dem suppose teach us understanding and respect for evribodi's human rights.
Dem suppose teach us make we dey get on top wit odas weda dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri dem wey dem kom from
awa parents get di right to choose which kind school we go to
Dis kind law dem be di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for House of Representatives for di US wey dey wear her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey be U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal Konstituency of Niger State, Hon sponsor
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies and oda sectors from discriminating against persins, students or personnel based on dia religious belief or manifestation.
Wen pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for gud
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or those executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am becloud dia sense of judgment.
Di law suppose be welcome development
afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Naija's constitution and di UDHR document as we explain am above
E dey in line wit similar laws wey dem pass recently for di kontri wey dey seek to tackle social threat and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persins Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability dey seek to end all form of discrimination wey dey base on pesin disabilities, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for di time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social threats wey dey torment awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no be say prior generic law no dey wey go cover dem but bikos dem need to address dem more comprehensively to leave room for opacity
While UDHR fit seem far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like am na hin dey provide to allocate punishments for offenders
Contrary to di view of im critic, so far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing dey to show attempts to seek di enthronement of a state religion for any state wey fit domestice di law eventually.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution say di goment of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion like State Religion.
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public spaces smacks of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female hin or her religious freedom negate awa multicultural pretenses
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey for inside Nigeria's constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
Di bill wey go criminalize dis kind decimations based on religious grounds, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

Police dey go afta newspaper vendor dem ova reports on IPOB
Police don dey harass newspapers and readers for Aba, di commercial hub for Abia State.
Daily Trust don gather since di weekend, policemen for di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers ova reports on di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents tok say tension dey Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raid di place on Sunday
One eyewitness tok say residents dey scamper for safety, as police officers dey shot sporadically, as dem dey try arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
Dem accuse di vendors say dem dey distribute newspapers wey get tori for di sit at home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB)
Dr. Elendu Ukoh wey be one of di eyewitness, appeal to di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so e no go create crisis in di city.
Di kind pipo wey we put into police dis days dey wonder if we really want anythin good out of dis kontri wey dem dey call Nigeria
How someone fit dey search for newspaper sellers around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo to dey read hard copies of newspapers, you go also stop dem to dey read di same tori for facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram and odas dem?
How primitive policing be dis?
Dem kos panic on Sunday by dia shooting and noisemakin
Di whole neighbourhood dey think say dem dey find kidnappers.
Na later we discover say police kom arrest a vendor and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspapers dem?
How paper fit cause kasala wey Social Media no fit cause 20 times ova
Hin tok say dis pipo no dey normal
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident, tok say almost all di place wey di vendor dey visit for Aba
Dem dey empty on Tuesday
He tok say, we hear say dem dey tok on Saturday and Sunday say di newspaper pipo get Tori on di sit at home order in honour of Biafra heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit am?
Di early political leaders for South East, dey remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra big pass IPOB wey dey beta for dem
IPOB proscription mean say Biafra don dey proscribed too?
All of us be Biafrans!
For di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) do zoom conversation, dey tok about Biafra fall heroes
why police no fit go YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey Ayire am?

NAMA don kil as air traffic controlers dey lament bad tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don shout out on top di dilapidated navigational equipment wey dey most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di sponsorship of di National Air Traffic Controlers Association (NATCA) tok say di situation be threat to air safety.
Dey also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go help safe aircraft navigation
Di president of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit tori-men for di weekend, tok say wetin dey for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and e no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controlers.
Hin kom tok say oda airports for di kontri lack di necessary equipment for seamless navigation
Hin explain say some airports no get functioning equipment
Even Kaduna no get control tower
wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we don dey call on top di goverment make dem do somethin
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, kontrolers go go look for umbrellas to sit for di control tower, and wetin e be, dem ced some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings to FAAN, while those wey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication for here and for there.
Calabar dey there; airport no dey wey you go go to today say you go say thins dey work for 80 per cent
NAMA recently employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall.
Capt Fola Akinkuotu wey be di Managing Director for di Naija Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), tell Daily Trust say di claim no be true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest well well for di improvement of navigational aid and to dey assist safe flight operations.
E tok say na just politics
Di goment don spend plenti time for di recent past to dey improve aviation infracstucture
I dey tok am no be bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always dey, ask di pipo for street, ask di pipo for NAMA, dem go tell you say dem neva get am so good under dis administation
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis government put two in place, two odas dey kom
goment just spend N1.7bn on top a mobile control tower
Also dey go ongoing revitalisation of di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Oda sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey reflect to dey use of communications technology di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift in national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and language and isolated by di national differences in goment regulations.
E-commerce dey also promote direct access to distant markets and promote globalisation and commercial activities and e dey blur many of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e no dey possible to determine di origin of di product
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communications platform, all information or service wey a company fit offer to customers ova di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
Di major significance of E-commerce dey for di fact say e dey encourage one single world trading system, wey dem dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services wey kom from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Dem don do plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis tins be say di opinion of di Nigerian legal system lag for behind ICT-based legislation and say di statutory laws wey dey exist dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and many more.
There are, therefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime.
Dem don tok am well well say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of draft bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say even for wia dem pass dis bills into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
If to say di speed wey Internet dey use pass commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunication sectors of di economy, di best tin wey we fit suggest na say make dem solve di legal issues and problems wey dey face e-commerce for di kontri, directly and quick, wit di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To dis one, make dem pressure di National Assembly to pass bill concerning electronic commerce, wey be di top priority so dem go fit enact dem into law as quick as possible
In di interim, awa court suppose take giant stride by interpreting di traditional laws wey dey exist liberally so as to bridge di gap derin in order to make dat kind laws amenable to electronic transactions, especially for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
Indeed, dem argue am say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit use electronic transaction and attendant documentation legally
Di court fit also adapt to recognise electronic transactions if legislation or private contract no dey.
As di then Justice Bingham don put am so: di common law get di same facility for judges hand as di law merchant) as dem dey adapt demsef to di changein need of di general public; principles no dey alter, but old rules wey dey apply to di change, and new rules wey start to existence.
Dem dey hope say oda Nigerian Judges go adopt dis judicial activism, Supreme Court justice inclusive, especially for areas wia awa current legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advancements.
Dis go set good precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all, e go bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di germane issues wit regards to contracts for E-commerce na documentation and signature
The provision of section 4 for di Statute of fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and our various statutes on real property and instrument wey dem land, all of dem go need make sure say some contract dey write and make dem execute well. The
question be say electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of contract by email and be binding
Plenti of dis issues still no dey quite settle even for UK although som decision dey favourable towards interpreting electronic signature
so mark for e-mails as dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transactions na paperless transactions wey dem make through magnetic materials like tapes or discks.
Dis dey in contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dem embodied for permanent form and typically expressed for word and figure usually authenticated by signature
We no fit alter dat kind transactions witout an alteration for di face of di document.
wit respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3)), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey dey relate to data message conveniently satisfy any requirement for handwritten signature so far e reach to identify electronic record to di persin
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
so, for di purpose of establish proof of electronic signatures
Di use of password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
So, persin fit stand well for di position say electronic signatures wey dem go use execution dey admissible for evidence if dem certify and put am for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenges wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contract
Di element for form of valid contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to enter into legal relationship.
Di question na for how dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how dem fit differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for which point dem fit tok am say dem get intention to enter legal relationship?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction wey send order or invoices neva alter and emanate from whoeva dem appear to be
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
Last last, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
No be lie say electronic commerce be aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time
Di goment suppose dey pass to dey create laws, make dem activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for im commercial interaction and for delivery of goment services.

Chad don pass new charter wey dem dey call Deby's son president
Chad don pass charter wey dey declare Mahamat Idriss Deby president, despite di rumours of hin death wey dey trend for social media
Mahamat take over in place of hin Papa, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey for Tuesday dey swiftly name transitional leader as head of military council afta hin Papa's death, go occupy di function of di president of di republic and also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter repeal di constitution wey dey preceding and dem go implement am as di basic law of di republic, accordin to hin terms.
Dem don call di younger Deby supreme head of di armed forces, e tok
Deby's son don dey overseer hin Papa's security as head of di elite presidential guard and hin don dey always appear wit am
Mahamat Deby na di top commander of Chadian forces as he dey assist one United Nations peacekeepin mission for di restive north of Mali wey dey near.
E sign decree on Tuesday wey dey setting out military council wit 15 generals, plus hinsef and 14 odas wey we know say dey part of di late president circle of loyalists
Di council dey work wit 18-month transition toward free and democratic elections.
According to di charter, Mahamat Idriss Deby also be chairman for di military transition council, di council of ministas, di council and superior committee dem for national defence.
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat
Di Transition Charter, wey get 95 articles, also guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship
Dem don set up transition goment wey di new president name dia members
Di members of di army wey dem dey call to di transition goment dey free from all military duties, di charter tok
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for almost 30 years, die for wound wey dem suffer wen dem visit di battlefield for di kontri's north wia Chadian soldier dem fight against a rebel group, na di military announce am on Tuesday.
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce a 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders, as dem suspend di constitution and dey scatta di National Assembly.
Howeva, politicians wey dey opposition for Chad don reject di army appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over for di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose don take power afta Deby die and no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case say hin die, den di speaker of di parliament go take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so a transition go dey place until dem hold elections, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am earlier on Tuesday.
[But] di military announce say dem don scatta di legislative assembly and say dem don scatta di constitution too, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di constitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction afta dem brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by him FA for di team failure to control dia players, Mirror tok
for seven years, dem don find pants down for seven hot-tempered rows wit opponents
Di recent brawl for clash wey dem get on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League team
For last week match wey dey between Chelsea and Leicester na hin skirmishes wey dey between di players of di two teams
As dem dey quote similar offences for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea.
Dem don charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coachin staff followin Ricardo Pereira's challenge for Ben Chilwell
For 2016, dem charge Chelsea for indiscipline say dem need warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollars for dia part for mass bust-up durin a match against Tottenham.
If affect am, di points deduction go significantly affect dia season as dem go enta final campaign for top four spot.
Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and ova here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion wey many British pipo kom get of di thousands of America GIs stationed for different military bases for Britain durin di Second World War.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldier dem dey always get inside pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey kom from a feeling of disdain for di yanks wey dey among di locals.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldier dem evriwia for di hundreds of America military base overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for Philippines.
Na di reason why I dey perturb, like many Nigerians, say for one virtual meetin last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari don ask say make di United States dey consider to relocate di Afrikan Command (Africom) of im military presently based for di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
Dem dey presume am say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, e breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken's Nigerian opposition numba, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go then transmit di details afta to di president
Yes America be superpower and evritin be dat, but protocol na protocol and make dem follow am strictly for all circumstances.
Understandably, currently Nigeria dey face gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best efforts of goment and di nation's security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelatin terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all over di kontri and di target killin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians coupled wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity now wey dey destroy di kontri.
But even for dat one, di call make dem host di Africom for Nigeria soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implication of dis move to Nigeria no dey justified.
Africom na one of di nine command wey di American military establishment give exclusively serve American strategic interest for di world
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, those outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues of dia area of coverage
Dem go only do am wen dat kind issues affect American interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no go fit yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security agencies dem and law enforcement agencies dem.
If Africom don set up for Nigeria, e go be Island of im own restrict access to Nigerians wey get all category and e go establish jurisdiction for di Territorial area of di base wey go virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies dem.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be a forward operatin base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to contain di growin strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa record of peace kipin around di world.
Africom precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, don make many secret and open visits to a number of African kontri make dem sell di idea.
But bikos say Nigeria na di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, nah im be di coordinatin base of di ACRI and though say dem tout am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocols dey unmistakably military and strategically target for Nigeria.
due to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to see di America pipo wey dey try to butt into area wey e consider its exclusive sphere of influence, di ACRI concept na hin dey review
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by di American congress for secret session, di Americans consider and realise di need to set up African command to add to di oda command already in place wey cover di various continents of di world.
So, based on di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of America political and security establishments, Africom na hin dey set up by di Bush junior administration wit a wide mandate wey no just contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on di growin Chinese strategic penetration of Africa
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM) wey dey base for Florida, na to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey base for Stuttgart, Germany, na to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) wey also dey base for Florida, na to Latin America and di Caribbean.
French military presence don already surround Nigeria for Niger, Cameroon, Chad and Benin
Di Americans also get a drone base for Niger
To dey add Africom join di mix for Nigeria go be total capitulation of awa strategic interest for France and America
Bearing in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent of letting in di wolf into di chicken coop
Notin dey di present insecurity wahala wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents in dose kontri dem from a long logistical supply line wey reach thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldier dem wey distinguish demsef for dose operations.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, having fall from di high standard wey we know am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internally
But intrinsically and importantly, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capacity to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di America pipo fit give us if dey willing.
But even as awa circumstances dey, we dey strong to dey host di Africom bikos of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, for awa soil.
Even as wahala dey, Plateau don target 7m metric ton of irish potato.
Plateau State na di number one grower of Naija's irish potato wit di tuber wey dem dey produce for nine of di state's 17 local goment area
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di Afrikan Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri wit kontris like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and odas wey dey receive plenti supply of potato from Nigeria
Di large potato production for Plateau State, accordin to PotatoPRO.com, wey be one of di leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth biggest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say inadequate dams and road network, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to dey pose a major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export
Oda wahala wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wiltas as well as poor seedlings.
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 states wey poor pass for Nigeria, and poverty rate don pass 70%.
Di state, howeva, get comparative advantage to boost economic activities to dey improve di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain.
Di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say though di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment areas wey be Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di state's potato hub.
Dem dey produce more potatoes dan any LGA wey dey di kontri
Muopshin, howeva, tok say adaptability research show say di eight LGA wey remain for di state dey viable to produce potato; e dey make all of Plateau's 17 LGA potentials to produce di tuber, especially durin di dry season.
Di association of Potato farmer (APF) for di state, howeva, tok say unless dem solve squarely challenges wey dey affect di value chain, increase production and export for potato go continue to dey elude di nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wit Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor road and high cost of farm inputs, continue to dey affect potato outputs.
Hin tok say di cost of mechanized farming wey fit increase productivity don dey expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to afford mechanization
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water durin di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield.
bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey search for borehole location to farm make dem access irrigation water for dia farm
Martha kom explain say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent many farmers from dey improve quantity and quality of yield, she add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output
Di cost dey also prevent many of us make we no expand di business
so, to get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes
If di water no dey sufficient for di crop, e go dry and eventually die and na why some farmers wey get di resources go like dig boreholes for Mangu purposely for irrigation bikos, witout am, dry season farmin dey difficult, she tok.
Potato for one market for Jos
Production go reach 7million metric ton afta dem complete di labor.
As Plateau State's potato production dey jump from 1,656,650 metric tons for 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons for 2020, di establishment of di Potato Value Chain Support Project and di construction of di tissue culture lab go kos di tripling of production to ova seven million metric tons by di end of 2021
Di monitoring and Evaluating officer for di state's Potato Value Chain Support Project, Baleri Yakubu, tell Daily Trust say dem dey expect make di state start di production of six million metric ton of potato evri year afta dem complete di tissue culture lab for di end of 2021 but im express optimism say di production fit pass seven million metric ton evri year.
Yakubu, howeva, tok say di state goment suppose tackle oda challenges wey farmers dey face especially those wey fertiliser dey face as well as more dams and road network as farmers suppose dey properly apply potato farming regulations to di target wey dem expect
Awa tori-pesin hear say di tissue culture lab, wey dem wan improve potato yield for di state as dem dey provide clean seed wey dey resistant to pest and oda diseases wey dey related to potato, dem suppose start operation well within few months.
Yakubu tok say di arrival of di lab go improve income for farmers and revenue for di state goment while e go also help food security effort for di kontri

UEFA on Tuesday don open formal disciplinary proceedings against di three clubs wey neva gree give up di aborted Super League project.

Di statement tok say FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wan express dia absolute rejection of di insistent coercion say UEFA don dey maintain towards three of di institutions wey dey relevant pass for football history.
Dis alarming attitude constitutes a flagrant breach of di decision of di court of justice, wey don already make a clear statement warning UEFA to refrain to take any action wey fit penalise di founding clubs of the Super League while di legal proceedings dey ongoing.
Therefore, di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and na direct attack against di rule of law wey we, di citizens of di European Union, don democratically build up, while we dey constituting lack of respect toward di authority of di court of justice demsef.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve month ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi na hin dem arrest for June 2020 for Dubai bikos say dem laund money from business electronic compromise fraud and oda scams wey target firms and one English premier league club
E make a total sum of $435 million afta im defraudin 1,926,400 victims.
Afta one year, Abidemi Rufai ( wey dem also know as Sandy Tangâ), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun na hin dey arrest by di Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for John F Kennedy Airport for New York as a criminal complaint of defrauding Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di moni wey dem thief na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fit don suffer job losses as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster who for don go Nigeria's Federal House of Representative making laws if e neva lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Konstituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di pipos Democratic parti (PDP).
Dem thief di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem dey file falsified claim wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem thief, dem create separate e-mail account so dat di claim go dey associated wit different pipo and e go fit escape automatic fraud detection system
Afta, more dan $288,000 na hin dem pay inside hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to individuals, organisations and kontri dem
Nigeria dey lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year.
By di end of 2021, di world go don lose a total of $6 trillion
till date, ova 40 Nigerians don dey or dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai tok say unemployment benefits fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on top di loopholes wey di COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, government and organisations.
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia fraud along di intervention from goment and private sectors and dem scam many and some of dis schemes still exist till date.
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promote sales fraud among odas
While pipo dem dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngster dey do am for inside Nigeria.
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey arrest dem, judge dem and convict dem everytime
Understandin di culture dem wey dey support cyber-criminality fit help serious goment for fighting di crime
Di family na di microcosm of di society wey large
Na di place wia dem suppose nurture normal human being for di society
Apart from di fact say plenti Naija family dey dungeon of poverty and dem no fit take care of dia children, some of dis children don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegal.
E get challenge wit ethical behaviour training for plenti house as dem dey arrest parents wit dia pikin wey dey cyber-criminality
for anoda place, mothers of yahoo boys dey form association to celebrate dia sons success and justify dia criminal behaviors
For di religious setting, pastors wey dem depraved, alfas and traditionalists dey create a home and benefit for Yahoo-boyism proceed
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Viral video dey wey dem show some boys say dem dey spray moni wen dose wey appear to be shepherd for one suppose white cloth church enjoy di moment wen di captive members of di church, wey dia female youth lead record di shameful scene
Pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don dey 21 years
sadly, dem grow up to appreciate liing as a way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many cases from home) wey deceive pipo to vote dem and no fulfil or jettison di campaign promises
Lyin itself na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Youths dey socialise to corruption and fraud by dose wey dey hold public office evriday
Dem see how dia systems dey provide soft landing for fraudulent persins ( Public or private).
Dey ask how dem don fully investigate and free many fraud and corruption allegations wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty?
Di majority of di case wey end wit off-di-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as a family affair
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyles wey dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how once poor political aspirants dey transform into millionaires within months of inauguration.
Dem see how traditional institutions don turn cash and dey carry in awarding chieftaincy titles.
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, give undeserving honours for exchange for moni
All pipo wey dey mismanage moni get soft landin.
Dem add to di list of culture wey dey nurturin cybercrimes be di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work and game say evribodi dey involved in and no be crime
If we elect fraudsters as legislors, dem go make law against di crime wey dem dey involve in
Di process to dey give parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need to dey review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products into awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni dey dangled for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for dubious character dem to cover up dia track and awa society dey worse off through dia actions
Greed dey nurture cyber-criminality sef
Di FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers.
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and dey expect grace to abound
Nigeria go need sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey dey track lifestyle wit material accumulation
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria as we dey create employment opportunity, dey reduce poverty and dey review reward systems.
Di EFCC need invest inside technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspects as di FBI don do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless di culture wey dey support cybercrimes for Nigeria dey tackled through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester

How e dey feel to give birth durin di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen death news dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
For January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red lines change my life
I dey get belle and I dey hapi
Na amazing start to new year
Na di year wey dey remarkable pass for my life
All of sudden, evritin change
dem born my daughter Roshomon Tara for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, for Bangladesh; she don dey nine month old
na she be di reason why I bikom mother for di middle of global crisis
No be only her wey dem born am be di new me, mama of Tara, wey don spend an entire pregnancy for lockdown for house and born am for emergency condition witin di emergency.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
her grandmothers sef dey afraid to hold am or to kom near am witout wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey to motherhood go dey different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter don dey front of me, dey smile and dey star for me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow for inside me
Di only tin wey no change be say, di pandemic
I dey 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic struck, and di planet go lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes.
Dat 22 weeks no less pass war
my husband Sina Hasan na hin be musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts at dat time
na freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
so, we dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and we spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalist association dey forward to help for di time being
I dey afraid of evritin
most of di time, e dey like death
dey knock di door
I dey adapt to one new online life wia we click kom get awa things home-delivered
I gats wait for one week make dem deliver groceries dis way
I even dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me, make hin go outside go buy food for storage
so, I dey chop less
Besides, I no fit go for my scheduled antenatal check-ups
and I no dey sure if my pikin dey grow healthy or all development dey take place on time
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring am into a different world pass before
Tele-medication help me pass some hard times during di last trimester
I don forget my gynaecologist face
I no fit remember how she look witout di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help
plenti information dey floating around
for inside dis wahala of information, mama wey get experience, my mother, and mother-in-law no fit only help me if I support and if I no meet me in persin wen I dey born pikin
Traditionally, mama wey get experience and old women for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get different panic attack bikos say I no get information and understanding.
So, I dug for di experience of new mothers wey born during dis time
I find social media as lifeline
I read plenty exciting experience for social media as I follow one group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactatin mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic.
Different media groups for dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers to dey share dia experience and information durin di lockdown.
One of dis group help me find health care facility wey I go do emergency ultrasound afta heavy bleedin durin di lockdown.
Anoda group help me curb my anxiety during pregnancy and post-partum depression.
I dey vex say I no fit meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share di joy of welkoming a new member for di family
Dem born my daughter for August 25, 2020, for di same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, wia dem born me decades ago
and she meet anoda pikin in persin wen she dey four months old for December 31, 2020, wen Tara and her papa waka go rooftop wit me go see di fireworks
Anoda family wey get two pikin, probably my next-door neighbour wey I meet di first time, sef go there to say goodbye to 2020
Everi day na gift, considering di recent statistics of increased Covid-19 cases
Wen news of death dey evriwia, di new life bring happiness kom allow hope thrive

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
E kom from Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and dem don make some far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem dey call as di Asaba Declaration now
Di meetin wey kom on top di heels of worsenin insecurity inside di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending threat of murderous herdsmen generate nationwide attention
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meetin and di unanimity wey di 17 governors display show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing form di core of di declaration
major highlights include di clamour for state police, devoluton of power, review of revenue formula in favour of federatin units and di need for a national dialogue to discuss di national question
While di foot-dragin of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and runs contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions na actually a cardinal tenet of di rulin All Progressives Congress (APC) wey Gov. El-Rufai-led committee on True Federalism don make far-reachin recommendation.
One for don expect make di leading lights of APC take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelmin support of di major opposition parti to start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempts to play for di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devoluton of powers, resource kontrol, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federatin units among odas
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
If to say di state of di nation wey security and di economy don face serious wahala, dis two sectors suppose get di best attention, concrently.
On top di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make sufficient effort to translate dat to improve standards of living for di majority of awa citizens.
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wit like 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes wey reach 17m of di population
Di efforts wey Buhari administation, though new and commendable, still represent drop for inside ocean and dem no dey adequate to make di necessari impact
Na dis be di place wia devoluton of power and resource kontrol dey kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey go stay a day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all di states for di kontri get commercial viable natural resources wey dem fit use use create wealth and generate di necessari foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wia states kom in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri breeds indolence, run contrary to di principle of true federalism
As di El-Rufai committee don propose, make dem review di revenue formula for favour of states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem
On state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excess by governors dey understandable, but like say Richie Norton tok say To escape fear, you go need go through am, no be around am
for too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force wey don bikom no just overly inefficient, but largely conundrum
Like Vice-President Osinbajo wey we tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey time don kom
We need address awa fears and overkom am.
One of di ways wey we fit do na to enact legal instrument for di establishment of di state police regulatory commission (SPRC), wit constitutional amendments wey go allow state police
E go dey similar to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e get wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban on open grazing although wey di governors dem restate no be new and e form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
Di core na strategy to curtail migration or open grazing and dat one go reduce di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmers. Dem beggars belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions go choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis new plan so we go fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes for awa back
Di convocation of a National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since di report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendations of di Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on True Federalism dey.
Two report don make far-reaching recommendations say awa elected governors and dia legislors for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of to dey waste scarce resources on anoda jamboree
On di issue of separatist agitation, modalities go dey for convening referendum wey dey spelt out for di constitution
E dey almost sure say majority of Naija pipo wan live togeda, awa differences, notwitstandin
To do dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord.
Di Southern Governors dem don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian
Even say we get challenges like evri oda kontri, we need listen to awaselves, as US President Joe Biden dey always tok.
Tomori dey live for Abuja

Im admit say apart from di few customers wey dem get for Kano, dem no see dia tomato products for di local market for reason.
Di first na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na special species and di second reason be di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producing area.
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey veri high pass wetin we dey obtain for open market
So, wetin dey important be say pipo no dey look us, dey feel say dem dey apprehensive for wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen u get product wey dey available, pipo go go for di cheaper brand
One farm hand dey feed di fish
Dem ask am for di average lifespan of dia tomato products, hin tok say, If u give di tomato wetin e need, I mean nutritional supplements u dey feed am wit while e dey grow, if u give am all di things, dis tomato fit last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even if e no dey, e go last for minimum of one week, no under any refrigeration, but surely, e no go dey under intensive pressure and heat.

While Manchester City neva win Champions League title, Chelsea win dia first and only title for 2012
Therefore, even as football pundits don tip City wey just win dia seventh Premiership title, Chelsea go kom into di contest wit beta credentials
dem be former champions
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead di Chelsea technical crew neva taste Champions League victory, him opponent for Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner
E win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona.
Therefore, plenti tins dey to expect from di actors wey go dey there for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Wetin dey interesting be say, even as two contestants parade na only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal and Chelsea) African interest for di final don drop
For Nigeria wia Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy plenty followers from passionate football fans, wetin dey expect don reach feverish point, wey dey lead to interesting re-alignments
Fans of those European clubs wey dem eliminate from the Champions League for different stage don re-aligned demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interest
Di final be one of di topic wey dem dey discuss pass for sporting circles for Nigeria, as fans of di Premiership clubs continue to dey predict wetin go be di final result.
Howeva, while almost evribodi dey wait to swour di football artistry wey fi go be on display, some pundits dey worried for di increasing decline for di number of African players for di final of one of di biggest football competition wey dey earth.
By di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don contest and win di trophy wit dia European clubs.
Sadly African football legend like George Weah wey dem vote World Footballer of di year for 1995
Nigeria Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt fail to win di Champions League even as dia football prowess.
Even say Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
Hin di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
Dem follow am by di Algeria legend wey be Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu don lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995
Dem don record am say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon na hin be di first African wey win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giant Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan
Oda African winner of di highly coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005 - Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
2010 between Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya)
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
As e dey closer home, di last time wey Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for di expense of Bayern Munich
Afta wey di former captain of di Super Eagles don, Nigeria don see di rise of oda talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
but neva feature for di final of Europe's biggest club competition
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched.
Di competition dey dominate by di top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don fail to kom inside dis highly rated European clubs for di years
Na di hope of Nigeria football stakeholders say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all di barriers and begin dey play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to dey live wit di agony to dey watch final of di UEFA Champions League kom and go witout di presence of any Nigerian player
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club final na few hours away
for di end, victory go die for di Manchester club wey dey die hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey die prime for di second itle and di football league wey dey die dem go dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner
