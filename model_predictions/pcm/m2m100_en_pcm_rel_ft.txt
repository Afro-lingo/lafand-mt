Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don tell di Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) say make e mind im business and make e stop to dey oppose di Muslims right to dey operate Shariah.
Prof. Ishaq Akintola wey be MURIC Director, tok am for one statement on Sunday.
Dis one follow one warning wey di PFN issue against di move by any group make dem introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoin constitutional review wey di Senate dey carry out.
PFN and oda Christian groups dey fully aware say Shariah dey di South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842.
dem practiced sharia for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, a Muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court operate up to 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem commot am go Agbongbon area for 1914
dem apply Shariah for Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey kpeme for 1906
Even di seventh Akirun of Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole(died 1912), institut Shariah for Ikirun for 1910.
Dis na just example of di existence and spread of Shariah for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.
Hin add say di PFN and oda Christians dey also aware of di rising tide of Islamic awareness for di same South West and say dem dey only afraid say di giant wey dey sleep dey wake up to take back wetin belong to am
Im tok say, awa Christian neighbours know well say Shariah na di Allah-given fundamental human right of Muslims.
But dem dey determined to make us miss am using unorthodox methods
Dem believe say dem dey war wit Muslims and to dem, evritin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and foul means to dia objective
We dey call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours.
Like all aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence.
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last pass hundred years, dem dey determined to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeathed to dem
Dem dey determined to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drive dem
Di Constitution Review Panel tell Nigerians say make dem forward dia view regarding wetin dem want for di constitution.
Evri group suppose submit hin needs

Na attempt to gag Muslims for di South West and e no go work
Hin tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery
Muslims for di region dey wake up and dey ask for freedom.
We dey demand make dem stop di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law.
We dey demand civil shariah, no be criminal shariah wey involve di cutin of hand but civil shariah to regulate Muslim marriage, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anything to do wit Christians
We go use all di peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to dis objective, hin add

For hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write say, di soul of awa innocent pipo dey important pass dis scam wey dem dey call Nigeria unity
Dis illiteracy no go dey acceptable to us, enough na enough we be peacemakers

Buhari you fail us woefully, you dey urge Imo police make dem confront di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent Fulani herder dem and now dey turn to northern goment officials and prominent politicians
Di IPOB wey dem comot, inside one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, fault report wey dey link am to di murder of Gulak, noting say di assassination of politicians no dey part of im agenda.
We, therefore, state witout equivocation say IPOB no know anything about di assassination wey dem tok
For di first place, which threat di late Gulak constitute give awa kos to warrant hin elimination?
we no get anything in common wit am and we no fit kill am anyhow
To dey point accusing finger for IPOB for dis barbaric act na only to divert attention away from di real masterminds
Dis na di same way terrorist dem for security uniform commit various atrocities for South East and turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global reputation
Dis na smokescreen wey justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kil more innocent Biafrans.
Instead of di security agencies to properly investigate di incident and possible factors, dem swit to accuse IPOB of a crime wey we no know anything about
IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak to have waylaid am for airport
Di group tok say make security agencies first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, and hin political opponents to establish dia possible involve

We go deploy all di resources wey we get to make sure say dem bring dat kind callous and criminal elements go justice.
Gulak dey kil Akeredolu wey no dey accepted
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu describe di news of di assassination as very shocking and disturbing
For one statement wey di governor personally sign, e tok say na one murder too many, dey describe di action as senseless and wicked.
Di pipo wey do dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri
Dis contrivance suppose mislead, confuse and destroy.
E bears di unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent as dem dey set di kontri on di path of conflagration.
Dem no suppose allow dis criminals succeed
We wan use dis medium express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma.
We advise am and oda governors dem for di South Eastern State say make dem brace up, and make dem face di current security challenge wey go end di bloodbath for di land.
Di enemy of di pipo dey always use di weapon of fear create disaffection for di polity
Dem calculate dis cowardly act to instigate Nigerians against each oda, especially Northerners, against Igbo pipo wey dey live outside di South East.
We need confront di enemy dem of di pipo wit a view to neutralise dem.
Dis no be di time for political correctness.
Make dem no allow banditry subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all level.
We dey call all security agencies make dem join bodi wit a view to unveilin di criminal elements wey dey sponsor and undertaking terrorist acts.
Dem go need punish dem well well.

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom dominatin topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
Endin Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey find to stop di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce herder-farmer conflict wey dey deadly.
While di plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges.
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about hin purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by di COVID-19 pandemic, lack of personnel wit di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, dey hinder progress
If di plan fail as previous initiative to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
National Economic Council approve am for January 2019, di plan represent di effort wey dey comprehensive pass to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to reduce di migration or open grazing, and thus, reduce di risk of conflict between herder dem and farmer dem.
E dey animated by di hope say ova 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go dey persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breedingg farms and oda mechanized livestock management practices na to boost di sector productivity.
By di end of 2028, authorities dey aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all participatin states, wey go create ova two million jobs for livestock production, processin and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buhari administration kom up wit di plan afta a wave of violence wey dey between herders and farmers, a surge for related violence wey dey afflict rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don committed to fund 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participatin states submit, don take preliminary steps toward puttin di Plan into practice, including providing technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like help wit field surveys and site maping.
Plenty states don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, open offices and set up steering committee to administer di Plan.
Authorities don also do workshops and do oda work to explain di benefits of livestock reform to large audience
But two years inside di 10-year plan, dem neva build di first new ranch, and di obstacles dey plenti
Di oposition, partly among herder dem, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey dey resent di plan benefit to pastoralists, dey hindre reform efforts.
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land between herders and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Dem pinch federal and state budget, partly bikos of di pandemics economic fallout, and di kontri lack technical expertise wey dey sufficient for managing ranches and grazing reserves
For plenti state, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey fear away potential investors
Unless dem solve am, dis and oda problem fit delay or even scuttle di plan, comot di kontri wey dey vulnerable to di escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate to wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To dey tackle diz challenges require a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgiving and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey dem go ask to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and who legitimately doubt di plan promise about available pasture
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Many pipo for di Middle Belt and Southern states dey deeply suspicious of di plan long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privileges for herder dem, and more broadly, di Fulani
As Abuja and oda partners dey support, state goment need build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processin.
Federal and state goment suppose also up budgetary commitments, hasten di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, work wit donors and investors as necessary
To dey address rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities wey dey adversely affected by di earlier violence for participatin states dey also important
plus, authorities go need considerate climate change wey fit impact and reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross into Nigeria seasonally suppose or suppose no benefit from di plan
While some of dis steps go take time, make di Plan proponent focus on delivering concrete, visible result on a relatively short-term basis.
less than two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to dey able to produce clear proof of im benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors dey ineligible to compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
Di idea be say, by di time campaignin heats up for late 2022, di Plan backers suppose dey able to point at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
No one of dis go dey easy, but di plan dey worth di effort
While far from perfect, e dey offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of herder dem and small-scale farmers.
Na about 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity overall at di same time wey e take a big step toward resolving one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts
As di clock dey tick down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quick make dem make a visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity go lost.
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to hasten its implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kind problem wey I get wit di king
Una no gree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na small holders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dem dey keep back from participating more actively for commercial oriented agriculture by a variety of constraints.
energy no dey for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own / my own
Na dis dey bring me to di conclusion say evryone na evil
Dem don characterise dis systems as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey small, dem dey always hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey marginal or risk-prone environments
Yield dey low and farmers lack di capacity to increase yield
we dey tok about life and prosperity to dis day
send your account number
Di emphasis now na on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as enterprise
I know eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yields wey smallholder farmers dey get dey really profitable
You dey kom?
Dis wahala wey dey emerge dey lead many small farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower risk and loweryieldin agricultural activities.
You be witch?
I dey on my way to sabo market to buy food stuff
make I call my Papa
As developing kontri population dey grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go apun for rapidly changing agri-food value chain
how far wetin be, make I dey my way?
Dis developments dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodology.
di loan sharks dey for hin neck
dis kind thin
I dey on errand from my work place
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers don fight plenti for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholder dem for di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of small farmers must contend wit
Di agricultural sector dey face plenti challenges wey dey range from di issues wey dey relate to di climate change, conflicts and di complication wey global COVID-19 pandemic don exacerbated, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time wey dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crop and wet season farmers dey about to start cultivation
Many farmers no fit access dia farm wen odas dey get labourers to harvest dia farm since mechanization na huge challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem.
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus lock down market don scatter di rural economy
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so dem go fit buy seed and fertilizer, pay labourer/tractor service.
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer don bikom so high dat plenti small farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price don go as high as N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey wey dey wey dey wey dey wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia r dey di price no rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places.
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activities no only deny dem access to dia farm but leave many pipo wey dem kill for dia farm
Plenti farmin community na hin dey raze down
Dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
Many pipo dey pay plenti moni or dey surrender plenti portion of dia harvest to di bandit
Plenti village for dat state don bikom desolate
Di agric sector also witness one of di worst disaster wen floods wip out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize farm wey dem estimate at ova N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Many of di affected farmers neva dey compensate as dem destroy dia livelihood
Di flood na di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Nigeria coastal cities and areas wey flood-prone kill pipo and washing away farmland
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey face drought
For two months, farmers watch dia investment for crops witered away
no disguise
Anoda subsector wey dey badly reach dis year na poultry and feed
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos price to increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria to send our save soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention.
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers plus to grant some of di big players license to import about 222 metric ton of maize to increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean hit, wey make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut completely.
Di scarcity kos serious feed crisis for di industry as price reach record high for hin history rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now
Di poultry industry lose estimated N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem project to reach 10 million by January 2021 wen dem estimate di loss for investment conservatively at about N1.5 trillion
While di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marry di subsector, di crop farmers even as di daunting challenges wey face di sector throughout di 2020 farmin year, don buyers kom up to dia farm even before harvest to make bulk purchase arrangement.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refuse to kom down at harvest time, e dey cause fear of looming hunger and di call for di borders to dey reopened, wey go allow influx of smuggled products through di kontri's porous borders.
Di name of di lord na strong tower

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy dey trends for di public domain, wit Southern governors dem dey slamming a ban on it durin dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN) and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, dey examin how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di governors of di Southern state meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herder crisis and oda form of criminality.
wetin you dey take on top di controversy wey dey generate by dis decision
Evri human being get right to action and opinion.
But di one wey important pass be say once una take una action, una suppose dey aware of di consequences.
Make u dey able to consider di advantage and disadvantage.
I no be one of those wey tok say e good or bad
As Nigerian, you get di right and freedom to live anywia for di kontri wit good faith and enjoy di freedom of association
On dis basis, I no go tok say e be good tin
But as a leader for di North Central, I go say na good tin, especially for di North Central Zone, due to di potential economic benefits for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am a real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herders, no matta di number wey fit troop from di South to di North Central
wetin be una position on open grazing?
I no be one of di propagator of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as individual
I believe say if we do ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central Governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching.
Dis kind move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products
and den e becom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herder dem and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di wahala wey di Fulani herder dem dey pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on e advantage
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem go need educate dem well to embrace ranching
We fit adopt Kenya method, wia all di family get ranches and una no dey see open grazing despite di plenti of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dem dey make case for?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard.
Dem no dey call for ranching and for federal goment make dem kom inside
wetin dem dey tok na say di herder dem don bikom problem to us and make dem go away
Dem tok say di herder dem suppose apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don ask dia indigenes make dem apply for land like di herder dem?
As one of those wey dey involve for youth empowerment programmes, especially for di agricultural sector and e value chains, why some goment policy dey fail to realise dia objective and wetin dey di way out?
Firstly, no administation wey fit touch di lives of persin like President Muhammadu Buhari's administation whereby you fit conveniently sit for your house and apply for facilities and you go get dem
Dem also get di target credit facility wey dem dey call Covid-19 loan
Many Nigerians don dey conveniently get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house and dem no even go office
Also, wit SMEs wey dem dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two side of those wey go believe in you and those wey go criticise you
So, for dose wey no believe in Buhari's administration, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am

Passage of forensic Bill by National Assembly: E dey relevant to Buhari's fight against corruption
Di National Assembly of di Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th
May 2021 for House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 for di Senate make history by passing into law, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.
791), afta dem read am for di Third Time for both Chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, aimed at strengthening and re-invigoratin national frontiers in di fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, wey don eaten deep into di fabric of awa nation.
wit di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguish and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly, im ardent resolve to carry out im legislative function in line wit di provision of di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.
And dis also attests to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great joy and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dem don put togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on board so we go fit complete national effort in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and cyber-crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di Senate don pass dis Bill, and bikos of di fact say we dey operate a bi-cameral Legislature, di house of representatives wey dey ever-ready and resilient, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di Hon
Speaker, follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As u fit dey aware, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don dey among di viciously attack and antagonise bill for di National Assembly for recent time.
Sadly di attack kom from those wey suppose be partners in progress in di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don rather designate demsef as enemies of di general good
Good is good e no get substitute so e also bad
no matta how long e take be, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e take apun for di National Assembly.
Di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) first passed into law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual at its 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 di bill was unanimously passed into law by di Nigeria Senate having deeply consider di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no be witout series of thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop at any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful to assist di Buhari-led administration to fight corruption no see di light of di day but wey dey stand wit am.
E dey important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but na novel one for Nigeria wey dey target to dey bridge di gap wey don dey for di forensics space.
Today, di journey to get a standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti- goment bodi dem wey go want sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of hin patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national effort wey dey towards di fight against corruption, wey don hinder development for evri aspect of awa national lives
Di legislative bold step, wey di two Chamber of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, e dey kom for time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
dat go give more bite to its anti-corruption drive in view of di raise spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di world
As all of us know, crime generally, don get new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century
Therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey tune and e dey touch wit global reality wey dey emerge and e dey ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey apposite to also state say di journey, wey culminate inside di passage of dis Bill, start for di 8th National Assembly whereby, awa Bill dey sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen im be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers durin di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings na hin di relevant committee of di respective Chambers conduct
Afta, despite di opposition from stakeholders wey dey minority, led by di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), di National Assembly pass di Bill, in view of its significance and di part e go play in di fight against corruption.
Afta, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem neva give before di dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
Na di strength of dis, say dem re-introduced di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, dem sponsor am by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader of di Senate, in view of di importance wey dey attached to am.
We dey constrained to make dis clarification so we go fit clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey tok say awa Bill na hin di 8th National Assembly reject
Also worthy to mention na di fact say awa Bill don dey mistaken for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di Senate and House of Representatives Chambers
Dis Bill, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem be merely duplication of di intent and purports of awa Bill
We suppose stress am say dem no introduce any of dis Bill for di 8th National Assembly, oda one pass awa Bill.
As such, na we be di first to kom up wit a Bill of dis magnitude(Forensic)
having see di urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
Di decision to establish di Institute na im dem take afta one painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdictions and how well dem don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey since 2009
And ova di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go target to dey inculcat di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, whether na mistake or fraud kos am; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacity, preparation of forensic report, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
Una go agree wit me say for today's world, di conventional ways wey dem dey use investigate crimes, wit a view to dey fight am don bikom obsolete
As such, for us as a nation to do something wey dey meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and innovations wey dey emerge, wey be target for fighting corruption.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say dem conceive di idea to establish dis Institute wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill here
Howeva, I wan crave your indulgence to highlight some of di objective of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills in di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for trainin and re-trainin of intending professionals in di use of Forensic Science and technology tools and technique in di investigation of fraud for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquette amongst practitioners for di farm, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and also develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;
To complete di huge vacuum wey dey for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of one unique operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri make e no dey expend im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigation for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals like Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
E go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms, through di provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas
From wetin we don tok, e dey apparent say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey relevant to tok am again say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standard.
Di wide spektrum of di scope and focus point of di Institute include but e no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursin; forensic patology; forensic engineering; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic languageistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, una go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in accordity wit international best practices.
Dis concept far pass di reasoning of those whose myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia senses of reasoning, bikos of narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of everybodi to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out vehemently to oppose im passage bikos according to dem, nah unnecessary duplication of function wey dia Institute don already undertaken.
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and having see di overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, awa Bill don receive from di two Chambers, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce a similar Bill wey dey currently befor di House of Representatives, having fail woefully in dia attempts to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One pesin fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say Institute wey pass dia own suppose dey regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as I dey
I wan also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no dey comot for dis funny drama episode
Like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don introduce a Bill for House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey ANAN initiate and dey promote
I decide to komot all diz fact so dat Nigerians and even di international communities go understand di extent wey some pipo fit go so dem go fit dia aims
Howeva, dis developments no perturbe us bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin dey right and not to allow dem manipulate dem for any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so we no go make di whole thing mockery.
Di known practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN bikos say e don bikom obvious now
Dem engage several bystanders to dey write frivolous petition some even targeted at di leadership of di Senate wit a tone of blackmail
As dem don fail woefully for di senate, di antagonist shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders write all manner of publication.
yet again, dem fail
Regularly by legislative procedure, a bill wey dem don pass by di Senate go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observation dey
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and for di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persins wey dey seek to be Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) dem pass into law by di House of Representative.
ICAN don register im Bill for House of Representatives wey dem dey call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT of ICANS ACT.
Di ICAN new bill don dey full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead a persin to some years inprisonment.
Dis dey sound strange for a kontri wey full of enlightened pipo
my joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level of corruption wey dey there
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives
Make we note am say, awa challenge di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow dia antiks deceive awasef and Nigerians.
You go remember how ICAN strongly opposed dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of im sponsored publications by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey Engr lead.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade for di 24th of May, 2019 don make frantic effort to tok say ICAN under im enable laws dey empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to dey pass it go amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present im ACT to dey repeal and re-enacted wit di inclusion of Forensics for di new law.
Di question be say, wetin don change
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics don dey find for e re-enactment
As e dey always be, while we no dey opposed to any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for im laws, we dey however concerned dat a bodi no suppose try to perpetuate imsef.

so dem wan get bodi inside demsef
Wetin dem dey fear na check and balance, dem no go want make anoda professional bodi investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.

LG polls: Dem protest ova di imposition of APC candidates
Some members of di All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ogun State don stage protest against di party's adoption of consensus candidature for some local goment areas ahead of di July 24, local goment election for di state.
Di top echelon of di parti don announce say di parti go adopt consensus candidates for some local goment areas while dem go conduct direct or indirect primary polls for di emergence of candidates for some
Di protesters wey storm di secretariat of di Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ogun State, accuse some leaders of di APC for Abeokuta South LGA say dem dey impose chairmanship candidate on dem.
Dem carry placards wit different inscriptions like We Say No To Money Bags
for Abeokuta South and
Make Party Members Pick Who Dey Want, kom tok say dia aspirant wey dem prefer na Farouk Akintunde
One of di party leader wey lead di protest, Balogun Ololade, don urge Gov Dapo Abiodun make e intervene for di mata to save democracy from jeopardy.
We dey between DSS and regional separatist
Di DSS don repeat warning to pipo and groups whose outterance and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, dey begin to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingering question about who or which pipo and groups di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourise for di heated rhetorical outburst of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Hausa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
Na all di pipo and groups wey continue to dey use incitin, unguard and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against anoda one so dem go fit apparently inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS charge for one of im warnings.
Interestingly, no one of dis prime suspect for di exploitation of some fault lines wey fit kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance imsef from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency see.
Dem crouse common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, differing only for di respective directions of dia accusing finger
As Afenifere return dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but e no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehashed im grouse about plenti pipo wey dey feel alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, dey ask who be di pipo?
Since di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive to deal wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey pushin di kontri into deeper crises and dem know dem; dem suppose treat dem according to di law
You no suppose be spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS no know dem yet dem insist on to dey pass di buck outside dia clique.
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics know of no beta solution to Nigeria myriad problem dan for dia sectional enclave and chiefs to lord am ova di rest of di kontri as ruler, no be leader!
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous as dem dey pursue dia inordinate ambition say dem dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all e take to excise di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease to cut dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to inordinate ambition of persins or groups restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, e dey easy than done.
Di regional groups dey constitute major hindrance to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey work for since flag independence
As long as dem continue to dey parade di political terrain as ethnic champion, so tey dem go see Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake for di population, make dem claim am or seize am and, if all oda fail, deconstructed and disowned as failed state.
Wheneva wey dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria's progress and development, unless im leadership dey firmly for dia perception, odawise e dey all about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene president.
Weda na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda undeniable indictment of dis regional separatist dem be say dem all be self-styled political pressure groups masqueradin as representatives of various ethnic groups.
from dia membership, e dey clear to see say dem consist of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency dey give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to remain relevant for democratik system wey dey run entirely by elected representatives through political parties wey dey registered wit legislative and executive institutions constitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem persist in acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria unovernable as dem dey threaten and attempt, so, perchance, dem fit regain political relevance if not kontrol.
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetin dey trigger security alerts
Wit dat kind predator-politicians wey dey around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent to undermining an elected goment just bikos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest wey dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combined to make Nigeria unovernable.
double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of Buhari administration having to contend wit dat kind array of formidable foes wey dey unleashing incessant assaults on national security for a time of economic adversity wey we no get before.
To dat extent, na only two groups of politicians fit dey: those wey dey participate positively for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward against all odds and those wey dey negatively engaged in planting seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
By dia outterance and activities, we all know dem
At di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens whose condition of survival no dey determined by and no dey dependent on di geography of dia origin
dia daily stuggle to eke a living dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith
Nigeria na di fatherland wey dem destroy to which dem go remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get any oda kontri to call dia own, collectively showing how citizenship dey bread true patriotism
Dey also know say Afenifere, Buhari Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey use incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one anoda in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambition of dia leaders.
Na why di poor man's prayer remain:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER
Manzo Reuben na youth leader for Lokoja
Dem kill 10 pipo as terrorist attempt to attack army formation
Troops of di Nigerian Army, for Saturday, neutralise no less 10 members of Boko Haram terrorists wey attempt to launch attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai for Rann, di headquarters of Kala Balge Local Goment Area of Borno State.

Wetin we no go wear for public: Negating Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Shey na pure coincidence say, as trouble dey brewing for Kwara state recently, dem consider solution to its kind for di lower house of di National Assembly wey dey di capital territory of Abuja?
Di trouble for Ilorin na ova di refusal of some faith schools wey go allow dia Muslim student wear hijab to di schools
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tagged Hijab Bill by a section of di Nigerian media
Di event spark heated and often emotional debate wey, for di bottom of it, threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality
Di whole idea for Kwara of di owner of di schools wey dey ban hijab-adorning Muslim student dem and dia sympathisers fit reduce to wetin dem no go wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
female Nigerians dem dey face bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to express dia faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence for taking such a position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also for Christians wiawia or weneva dem dey threatened wit discrimination based on dia faith wey dem professed
Running through di argument of di owner of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, one fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda schools for anoda place if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument dey plenti
First, to say Muslim student suppose go anoda place unless dey conform to di school's rule on uniform dey very small to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: e dey justifiable to base a school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
den, thirdly, di argument wey go anoda place dey appear to ignore di difficulty wey dem get to dey change school for pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of changing schools for a pikin, educational psychologist go tell you, e go interfer negatively wit no be only hin emotional but academic development too
Last last, di faith schools by demsef risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization by concentrating students wit di same religious beliefs for particular schools
Di social cost dis exacts on di society dey huge
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say hin policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony anchored on mutual respect and understanding
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, signed di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e be to deny Nigerian pikin access to a school of hin choice on di basis of di manifestation of hin religion?
Na big concern bikos Nigeria na signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 topic on di right and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political right, like di right to life, free speech and privacy.
E also include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find articles 18 and 26 for UDHR wey dey very relevant to di issue under consideration and quote dem for full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get di freedom to dey think or believe wetin dem want, plus di right to religious belief
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to practise awa religion wey we choose for public or privately, alone or wit odas.
Evribodi get di right to education
Make di primary schooling dey free
Make all of us dey able to kontinue awa studies as we dey wish.
For school, dem suppose help us develop awa talent, and dem suppose teach us understand and respect for evribodi's human rights.
We suppose also learn to get on top wit odas weda dia ethnic, religion, or kontri wey dem kom from
awa parents get di right to choose which kind school we go go
Dis type of law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for House of Representatives inside di US wey dey wear her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019.
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance sponsor and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal konstituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors make dem no dey discriminate against persins, students or personnel based on dia religious belief or manifestation.
Wen pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or those executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am becloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welcome development
Afta all, na to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document as we explain am above.
E dey in line wit similar laws wey dem pass recently for di kontri seeking to tackle social threats and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persins Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability dey find way to eliminate all form of discrimination based on persins disabilities, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for a time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social threats wey dey fight awa kontri wit legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no bikos dem no get prior generic law wey dey cover dem but bikos dem need to address dem more comprehensively to leave room for opacity.
While UDHR fit be like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, dem provide RDPP Law and odas like am to allocate punishments for offenders.
Contrary to di view of hin critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing dey to show attempt at seeking di enthronement of a state religion on any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution say di Government of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State Religion.
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public spaces smack of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female hin or her religious freedom dey negate awa multicultural pretendence
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey for inside Nigeria's constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
Bill wey go criminalize dis kind decimation based on religious ground, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

IBEDC don warn trader wey dey under power lines
Di Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) don warn say make dem no dey do trading under high tension wire to avoid disaster.
Chief Operatin Officer (COO), Engr John Ayodele, give di charge against di backdrop of di increasing trading activities under high tension wires.

Police dey go afta newspaper vendors dem ova reports on IPOB
Police don dey harass newspapers and readers for Aba, wey be di commercial hub for Abia state.
Daily trust don dey gather since di weekend, policemen from di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers ova reports on di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents tok say tension dey Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raided di place on Sunday
One eyewitness tok say residents dey scamper for safety, as police officers shot sporadically, as dem dey try arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
Dem accuse di vendors dem say dem distribute tori-pesin wey get tori on di sit-at-home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, beg di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so e no go create crisis for di city.
Di kind pipo wey we put inside police dis days dey make me wonder if we really want anytin good out of dis kontri wey dem dey call Nigeria
How persin fit dey chase for newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo to dey read hard copies of newspapers, you go also stop dem to dey read di same tori for Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram and odas?
How primitive policing be dis?
Dem kos panic on Sunday by dia shooting and noisemaking
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey chase kidnappers
Na later we discover say police kom arrest a vendor and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspaper vendors dem?
which kind problem paper fit kos say Social Media no fit kos 20 times ova
Dis pipo no dey normal, e tok.
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident, tok say almost all di vendor stands wey hin visit for Aba
on Tuesday dey empty
He tok say, We learn say dem dey tok for Saturday and Sunday say di journalist get tori on di sit at home order in honour of Biafran heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit am?
Di early political leaders for South East dey remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra big pass IPOB wey dey beta for dem
IPOB proscription mean say dem don proscribe Biafra sef?
All of us be Biafrans
On di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold zoom conversation, dey tok about Biafran fall heroes
why police no fit go YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey give am?
wetin dem dey do na to kom street kom start dey find unnecessary trouble
I wish say di leaders for Igboland go warn those reckless police officers make dem no allow wetin dey apun for Imo State enter Aba, bikos e go worst for evribodi
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, wey be Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), don deny say di police arrest newspaper vendors and readers for Aba.
NAMA don kick as air traffic controlers dey lament bad tools
Air Traffic Controller dem (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don yarn out ova dilapidated navigational equipment for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) tok say di situation pose threat to air safety
Dey also claim say Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go help safe aircraft navigation
Di president of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit di newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and e no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controlers.
Hin also tok say oda airports for di kontri lack di necessary equipment for seamless navigation
Hin explain say some airports no get equipment wey dey work
Even Kaduna no get control tower.
wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we dey call on di goment make dem do somethin
We go Sokoto, once rain dey today, kontrolers go go look for umbrellas to sit for di control tower, and wetin be dat, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings na hin dem ced to FAAN, while dose wey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisation
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication for here and der
Calabar dey there; airport no dey you go today say things dey work for 80 per cent
NAMA recently employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall.
Capt Fola Akinkuotu wey be di Managing Director of di Naija Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest well well in improving navigational aids and aidin safe flight operations
Hin tok say, na mer politics
Di goment don spend plenti time in di recent past to dey improve aviation infrastructure
I no dey tok am bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion dey always dey, ask di pipo for street, ask di pipo for NAMA, dem go tell una, dem neva get am so good for dis administation.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two in place, two oda dey kom
goment don spend N1.7bn for one mobile control tower
Also dey go ongoing revitalisation of di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar coverage of Nigeria) system.
oda sector suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce refers to di use of communications technology di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and language and isolated by di national differences for goment regulations.
E-commerce dey also promote direct access to distant market dem and dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and dey blur many of di current distinction between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e dey practically impossible to determine di origin of di products.
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communications platforms, all information or service wey a company fit offer to customers ova di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
Di major significance of E-commerce dey for di fact say e dey encourage one single world trading system, wey dem dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services wey kom from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey for Nigeria dey behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Dem don conduct plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system dey behind ICT-based legislation and say di statutory laws wey dey exist dey quite inadequate to address som of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenti more
There dey, therefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emergein regime.
Dem don tok am well say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of draft bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say even wia dem pass dis bill to law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
If to say di internet dey permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best thing wey we fit suggest na say make dem address di legal issues and problems wey dey face e-commerce for di kontri, straight and quick, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To dis, make di National Assembly dey pressureSed into passing bill concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so dat dem go fit enact dem into law as quick as possible.
In di interim, awa court suppose take giant stride if dem interpret di traditional laws wey dey exist liberally so dem go fit bridge di gaps therein in order to make dat kind laws wey dey amenable to electronic transactions, for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
Indeed, dem argue am say legislation no be di only means wey electronic transaction and attendant documentation fit dey facilitate legally
Di court fit also adapt to recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract
As di then Justice Bingham don put am thus: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility [as di law merchant] for adaptingsef to di changein needs of di general public; principles no dey alter, but old rules of applying di change, and new rules spring into existence.
Dem dey hope say oda Nigerian Judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive go adopt dis judicial activism, especially for areas wia awa legislation wey dey exist dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advancements.
Dis go set beta precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di germane issues wit regards to contract for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 for di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statutes on top real property and landed instrument, all of dem require make certain contract dey in writing and make dem duly executed
question be say electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of contract by email and e dey binding
Plenti of dis issues still no dey quite settle even for UK although som decision dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
Marks in emails as e dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transactions na paperless transactions wey dem make through magnetic materials like tapes or disks
Dis dey contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dem embodied for permanent form and typically expressed for word and figure usually authenticated by signature
Dem no fit change dat kind transactions witout alteration for di face of di document.
Wit respect to signature, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey dey relate to data message dey conveniently satisfy any requirement for handwritten signature so far e go sufficiently identify electronic record to di individual
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
so, for di purpose of establish proof of electronic signature
Di use of a password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
So one fit safely posit say electronic signature for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence if dem certificate am and dem incorporate am for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction.
Also, oda legal wahala wey dey affect e-commerce na di formation of contract
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter legal relationship
Di question be say dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for which point dem fit tok am say dem get intention to enter legal relationship?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction say dem neva alter order or invoices and emanate from whoever dem appear to be from
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy / confidentiality wit respect to information
Last last, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce na one aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time
Di goment suppose dey pass to dey create laws, to dey activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for im commercial interactions and for delivery of goment services.

Chad don pass new charter wey dem dey call Deby son president
Chad don pass charter wey dey declare Mahamat Idriss Deby president, despite rumours of hin death wey dey for social media
Mahamat take over in place of hin Papa, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey on Tuesday dey swiftly name transitional leader as head of military council afta hin papa's death, go occupy di function of di president of di republic and also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter don repeal di constitution wey dey before and dem go implement am as di basic law of di republic, according to im terms.
Dem don call di younger Deby supreme head of di armed forces, e tok
Deby son don overseen hin papa's security as head of di elite presidential guard and dey always appear wit am
Mahamat Deby dey best known as a top commander of di Chadian forces wey dey assist one United Nations peacekeepin mission for di restive north of Mali wey dey near.
Hin sign decree on Tuesday setting out military council wit 15 generals, plus hin and 14 oda pipo wey dem know say dem don dey part of di late president's circle of loyalists
Di council get 18-month transition toward free and democratic elections.
Accordin to di charter, Mahamat Idriss Deby sef dey chair di military transition council, di council of ministers, di councils and superior committees of national defence.
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat
Di Transition Charter, wey get 95 articles, also guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
Dem don set up a transition goment wey di new president name hin members
Di members of di army wey dem call to di transition goment dey discharge from all military duties, di charter tok.
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for 30 years, don suffer wound for visit to di battlefield for di kontri's north where Chadian soldier dem fight against a rebel group, di military announce am on Tuesday.
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders, as dem suspend di konstitution and dem dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army's appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over in di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose don take power afta Deby die, no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case say e die, den di speaker of di parliament dey take charge of di kontri for 40 days and den dem put a transition in place until elections go dey, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am for Tuesday.
Di military announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and say dem don also dissolve di constitution, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di constitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction afta wey dem brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by hin FA for di team failure to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, dem don find di team down for seven hot-tempered rows wit opponents
Di recent brawl durin clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League teams
Last week, Chelsea and Leicester don marry skirmishes wey dey between di players of both teams
As dem dey quote similar offences in di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea.
Dem don charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff wey dey follow Ricardo Pereira's challenge for Ben Chilwell
For 2016, dem also charg Chelsea for indiscipline say dem suppose warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollars levy for dia part for mass bust-up durin a match wey dem get against Tottenham.
If e affect, di point deduction go affect dia season significantly as dem go head into final campaign for top four spot.
Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and ova here
Na dat be di resentful and contemptuous opinion wey many British pipo kom get of di thousands of American GIs wey dey stationed for different military base for Britain durin di Second World War.
Di gum-chewin, brash, hard drinking and womanising American soldier dem dey often get into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey don build up a feeling of disdain for di Yanks wey dey among di locals
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldier dem evriwia for di hundreds of American military base abroad from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for di Philippines.
Na why I dey perturbed, like many Nigerians, say for one virtual meetin last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari don ask say di United State dey consider to relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
Dem presume am say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Afrika
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
Di meetin suppose dey wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go later transmit di details afta to di president.
Yes, America na superpower and evritin, but protocol na protocol and make dem follow am strictly for evritin.
Understandably, Nigeria dey face gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best effort of goment and di nation's security establishment to tackle am
Unrelent terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clash all ova di kontri and di target killin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians togeda wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity now wey dey ravagin di kontri.
But even for dat one, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigeria soil wen we consider against di various issues and implication of dis move to Nigeria dey hardly justified.
Africom na one of di nine command by di American military establishment to serve exclusively American strategic interests around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, especially those wey dey outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues of dia area of coverage.
Dem dey only do am wen dat kind issues dey affect American interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no dey mandate to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies.
If Africom dey set up for Nigeria for instance, e go be Island of its own restricting access to Nigerians of all category and establishin a jurisdiction wey dey within di territorial area of di base wey go virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
As e dey always apun wit American military base outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operation and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement effort for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa record of peace kipin around di world.
Africom precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, don make many secret and open visits to a number of African kontri dem to sell di idea.
But bikos say Nigeria na di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na to be di coordinatin base of di ACRI and even say dem tout am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocols dey unmistakably military and strategically targeted for Nigeria.
due to undisguise hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to see America pipo wey dey try butt into area wey e consider its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di ACRI concept
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di American congress midwifed for secret session, di Americans consider and realize di need to set up African command to add to di oda command already in place wey dey cover di various continents of di world.
So, based on di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of America political and security establishments, na by di Bush junior administration dem set up Africom wit a wider mandate no just to contain Nigeria but also to dey keep eye on di growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey base for Florida, na to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey base for Stuttgart, Germany, na to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), wey also dey base for Florida, na to Latin America and di Caribbean.
French military presence don surround Nigeria for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans sef get drone base for Niger
To add Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America
To dey remember say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent of to dey let in di wolf into di chicken coop
Nothing dey for insecurity wahala wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for those kontri dem from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldier dem wey distinguish demsef for those operations.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, having fall from di high standard wey we know about am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internally
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capacity to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dey so willing
But even say awa circumstances dey arm-twisted into hosting di Africom bikos of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, on awa soil.
Even as challenges dey, Plateau don target 7m metric tons of Irish potato
Plateau State na Nigeria number one grower of irish potato wit di tuber wey dem produce for nine of di state's 17 local goment areas.
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri wit kontris like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin among odas wey dey receive large supply of potato from Nigeria.
Di large potato production wey kom from Plateau State, accordin to PotatoPRO.com, wey be leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth largest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say inadequate dams and road network, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to dey pose a major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export.
Oda wahala wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wilt as well as seedlings wey poor
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 states wey poor pass for Nigeria wit poverty rate wey pass 70%.
Di state get comparative advantage to boost economic activities as dem dey improve di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain
Di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment areas wey dey Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di state's potato hub.
Dem dey produce more potatoes dan any LGA for di kontri
Muopshin, howeva, tok say adaptability research show say di state's remaining eight LGAs dey equally viable to produce potato; making all of Plateau's 17 LGA potential to produce di tuber, especially durin di dry season.
Di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state, howeva, tok say unless challenges wey dey affect di value chain dey address squarely, increase production and export for potato go continue to elude di nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wit Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farmin dey viable as well as road wey poor and high cost of farm inputs, dey kontinue dey affect potato outputs.
Hin tok say di cost of mechanized farmin wey fit increase productivity don dey expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to afford mechanization
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water durin di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield.
bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey search for borehole place to farm to access irrigation water for dia farm
Martha explain say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent plenti farmers make dem no dey improve quantity and quality of yield, e add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output
Di cost also prevent plenti of us make we no expand di business
So, to get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes

Hardcore Super League trio defiant against UEFA coercion
Super League trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus insist on Wednesday say dem dey committed to modernising football despite UEFA threat of disciplinary action.
UEFA open formal disciplinary proceedings against di three clubs wey neva give up di aborted Super League project.
For one joint statement, Italian Juventus and di two Spanish sides tok say dem still dey committed to modernising football through open dialogue wit UEFA.
Di statement tok say FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express dia absolute rejection of di insistent coercion say UEFA don dey maintain towards three of di most relevant institutions for di history of football.
Dis alarming attitude constitutes a flagrant breach of di decision of di court of justice, wey don already make clear statement warning UEFA to refrain from taking any action wey fit penalise di foundin clubs of the Super League wen di legal proceedings dey ongoin.
Therefore, di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and na direct attack against di rule of law we, di citizens of di European Union, don democratically build up, as dem dey constituting a lack of respect toward di authority of di court of justice demsef.â

from Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve month ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi na hin dem arrest for June 2020 for Dubai for di alleged money laundering from business email compromise fraud and oda scams wey target firms and an English premier league club
Hin make a total sum of $435 million afta defraudin 1,926,400 victims
Afta one year, Abidemi Rufai ( wey dem also know as Sandy Tangâ), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun na hin Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrest for John F Kennedy Airport for New York as di criminal complaint of defraudin Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di moni wey dem thief na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fit don suffer job losses as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster wey go don dey for Nigeria's Federal House of Representative making laws if e neva lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di pipos Democratic parti (PDP).
Dem perpetrat di fraud as dem steal di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem filing falsified claim wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem thief, dem create separate e-mail account so dat dem go associate di claim wit different pipo and e fit escape automatic fraud detection system
Afta, more dan $288,000 na hin dey pay for hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to individuals, organisations and kontri dem
Nigeria don lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year
By di end of 2021, di world go don lose a total of $6 trillion
till today, over 40 Nigerians don dey or dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai alleged unemployment benefits fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Dis na fraudulent scams leveraging on top di loopholes wey di COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisations.
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia fraud along di intervention from goment and private sectors and dem scam plenti and some of dis schemes still dey till today
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among odas
While doz wey dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngsters dey do so for inside Nigeria
Di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey always arrest dem, tried dem and convict dem
To understand di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment to dey fight di crime.
Di family na di microcosm of di larger society.
Na di place wey normal human being suppose nurture for di society
Apart from say plenti Nigerian family dey di dungeon of poverty and dey hard to take care of dia pikin, some of dis pikin don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegal
Di challenge dey wit ethical behaviour trainin for many house as dem dey arrest parents wit dia pikin dem wey dey involve for cyber-criminality
For oda place, mama dem wey be yahoo boys dey form association to celebrate dia sons success and justify dia criminal behaviours.
For di religious setting, pastors dem wey dem no get, alfas and traditionalists dey create house and benefit from Yahoo-boyism proceed
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Di viral video dey wia dem show some boys dey spread moni wen dose wey appear say dem be shepherd for white cloth church enjoy di moment wen di captive members of di church, wey dem lead by dia female youth wing record di shameful scene.
One pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don dey 21 years old now
Sadly, dem grow up to appreciate lie as way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for plenti case from house) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and make dem no fulfil or jettison di campaign promises.
Lyinsef na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Di pipo wey dey hold public office dey socialise to corruption and fraud every day
Dem dey see how dia systems dey provide soft landing for fraudulent persins (public or private).
Dem dey ask how dem don fully investigate and discharge di allegation of fraud and corruption wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty?
Di majority of di case wey end wit off-the-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as a family affair
Di youths dey see flamboyant lifestyle wey dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem dey see how befor, poor political aspirants don turn to millionaires within months of inauguration
Dem dey see how traditional institutions don bikom cash and dey carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, dey give undeserving honours for exchange for moni
Dem provide all dose wey mismanage moni wit soft landing
We add to di list of culture wey dey nurturin cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work and game wey evribodi dey involve in and no be crime.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, dem go make law against di crime wey dem dey involve in?
Di process of giving parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need to dey review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products inside awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni dey dangled for dia eyes
Dem dey provide platform for dubious character dem to cover up dia track and awa society dey worse off through dia actions
Greed dey also nurture cyber-criminality
Di FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem alleged to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers.
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and expect grace to abound
Nigeria need sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey dey track lifestyle wit material accumulation
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria as we dey create employment opportunity, dey reduce poverty and dey review reward systems.
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose e detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspect as di FBI don do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless di culture wey dey sustain cybercrimes for Nigeria dey tackled through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester

How e dey feel to give birth durin di pandemic by Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
For January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red lines change my life
I be pregnant and I dey hapi
Na amazing start to new year
na di year wey dey remarkable pass for my life
All of a sudden, evritin change
dem born my daughter Roshomon Tara for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she don dey nine month
na she be di reason why I bikom mother for di middle of global crisis
No be only her wey dem born, but na new me, mama of Tara, wey spend an entire pregnancy for lockdown for house and born for emergency condition for inside di emergency.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
her grandmother dem sef dey afraid to hold am or to kom closer to am witout wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey into motherhood go dey different
Dis Mother's Day dey very special as my daughter don dey front of me, she dey smile and dey star for me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
di only tin wey no change be di pandemic
I be 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic hit, and di planet go lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes
Dat 22 weeks no less dan war
my husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts dat time
I be freelance journalist so tey January 1, 2020
So, we dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and we spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalist association kom forward to help for di time being
I dey afraid of evritin
most of di time, e be like death
she dey knock for door
I dey adapt to one new online life wia we dey click kom get awa things home-delivered
I wait for one week make I get groceries delivered dis way
I even dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me husband to go outside kom buy food for storage

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make some far-reaching resolutions on top di state of di nation, wey dem dey call as di Asaba Declaration
Di meetin wey dey kom on top di heels of worsenin insecurity for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending threat of murderous herdsmen generate attention for nationwide
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meetin and di unanimity wey di 17 governors show show show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for inside di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing form di core of di declaration
Di major highlights include di clamour for state police, devolution of power, review of revenue formula for favour of federatin units and di need for national dialogue to discuss di national question.
While di foot-dragin of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and runs contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions na actually a cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey Gov. El-Rufai-led committee on True Federalism don make far-reaching recommendations.
One go don expect make di leading light of APC take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempt at playing to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of powers, resource kontrol, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federating units among odas
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
If to say di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose serious challenges, dis twin sectors suppose get di best attention, concurrently.
Even as di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make effort to translate dat to improve standard of live for di majority of awa citizens.
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get a National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes wey reach 17m of im population
Di effort wey Buhari administation get, even say e dey novel and e dey commendable, still dey represent drop for ocean and e no dey adequate to make di required impact.
Na wia devolution of power and resource kontrol dey kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey dey stay a day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercial viable natural resources wey dem fit exploit to create wealth and generate di foreign exchange wey we need for di kontri
Di present system wia states dey kom hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey bread indolence, runs contrary to di principle of true federalism
As di El-Rufai committee don propose, make dem review di revenue formula in favour of states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem.
On state police, di fear of abuse and devised excesses by governors dey understandable, but as Richie Norton tok say to escape fear, una go through am, no be around am
for too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force wey don bikom no be only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum
As Vice-President Osinbajo tok am some years ago, State Police na idea whose time don kom
We suppose address awa fears and overcome am
One of di way wey we fit do na to enact legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments wey go allow State Police.
E go dey similar to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e go get wider power to dey exercise appointive and regulatory function.
Di ban on open grazing wey di governors restate no be new and form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
At di core na strategy to curtail migration or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers It, therefore, beggars belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions dey choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so we go fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes for awa back
Di convocation of a National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of di Gov. El-Rufai APC committee on top True Federalism dey.
Di two report don make far-reaching recommendations say awa governors and dia legislators wey dey National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead say dem dey waste scarce resources for anoda jamboree
On top di issue of separatist agitations, modalities for convenin a referendum spelt out for di konstitution suppose dey
E dey almost sure say a vast majority of Nigerians wan live togeda, awa differences, notwithstanding
To do dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian
Even say we get challenges like all oda kontri, we need listen to awaself, as US President Joe Biden dey always tok.
Tomori dey live for Abuja
Dem kill two officers as IPOB militants set Anambra police station on fire

NEPC, Commonwealth join bodi on top di production of professional service export data
Di Naija Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and di Commonwealth Secretariat London dey collaborate to produce reliable data on how dem dey export professional service for Naija

Hin admit, howeva, say apart from di few customers wey dem get for Kano, dem no dey see dia tomato products for some reason for di local market
Di first na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producin area.
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey small pass wetin we dey obtain for open market
so, essentially, pipo no dey look us, dem dey feel apprehensive for wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen u get product wey dey commonly available, pipo go surely go for di cheaper brand
one farm hand dey feed di fish
Dem ask am for di average lifespan of dia tomato products, e tok say, If una give di tomato wetin e need, I mean nutritional supplement wey una dey feed am wit while e dey grow, if una give am all di things, dis tomato fit last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even if e no dey, e last for minimum of one week, no be under any refrigeration, but surely no dey under big pressure and heat.
You fit keep am for table wia you get beta ventilation

without doubt, enthusiastic football fans for Nigeria dey wait eagerly for tonights finals of di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals to dey contest between two English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea for di Estadio do Dragao, wey dey Porto for Portugal.
Sake of di fact say di UEFA Champions League na one of di biggest football competition wey dey only near di FIFA World Cup and di Olympics football event, di level of expectation dey increase as di giants of di English Premier League dey set to tussle for di prestigious diadem.
While Manchester City neva win Champions League title, Chelsea win dia first and only title for 2012
Therefore, even as football pundits don tip City wey just win dia seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea go kom into di contest wit beta credentials
Dem be former champion
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead di Chelsea technical crew neva test Champions League victory, im opponent for Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner.
Hin win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
Therefore, plenty things dey to dey expect from di actors wey go dey there for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Interestingly, even as di two contestant parade only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) Africans interest for di final don drop
For Nigeria, wia Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy a large followin from passionate football fans, expectation don reach feverish point, wey dey lead to interesting re-alignments
Fans of those European clubs wey dem eliminate from Champions League for different stage don re-align demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interest
Di final na one of di topics wey dem dey discuss pass for sporting circles for Nigeria wen fans of di Premiership clubs continue to dey predict wetin go be di final result.
Howeva, as almost evribodi dey wait to savur di football artistry wey dey possible to be on display, some pundits dey worried by di increase decline for di number of African players for di final of one of di biggest football competition wey dey earth.
To dey follow di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don contest and dem won di trophy wit dia European clubs.
Sadly African football legends like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt fail to win the Champions League even as dia football prowess.
Even say Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey don win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
Hin di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
Dem follow am by di Algeria legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995
E dey on record say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon na di first African wey win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit di Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan.
Oda African winners of di highly coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win UEFA Champions League.
As he dey near home, di last time wey Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta di former captain of di Super Eagles, Nigeria don see di rise of oda immensely talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
but nobodi neva feature for final of Europe's biggest club competition
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched.
Di competition dey dominate by di top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don fail to get into dis highly rated European clubs over di years
Na di hope of Nigerian football stakeholders say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all barriers and begin dey play for clubs wey get potential to win UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to dey live wit di agony to dey watch final of di UEFA Champions League kom and go without di presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club final na few hours away.
For di end, victory go die for Manchester club wey dey die hunt for dem first title ot for Londoners wey dey die prime for di second itle and for football league wey dey wey dey wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
