Constitutuion review; Shariah dey for south west before Christianity MURIC
Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don tell di Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) say make e mind im business and make e stop to dey oppose di Muslims right to dey operate Shariah.
MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, tok am for her inside statement on Sunday
Dis one happun afta dem warn di PFN issue against di move by any group make dem introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoing constitution review wey di Senate dey do.
PFN and oda Christian group dey fully aware say shariah dey for di South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842.
dem dey practice sharia for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, wey be Muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court dey operate till 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem move to Agbongbon area for 1914
Dem use sharia for Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey kpeme for 1906
Even di seven Akirun wey dey Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (died 1912), institute sharia for Ikirun for 1910.
Dis na just example of di existence and spread of sharia for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.
E add say di PFN and oda Christians dey aware of di rising tide of Islamic awareness for di same South West and say dem dey only fear say di sleepin giant dey wake up to take back wetin belong to am.
E tok say awa christian neighbours know well say shariah na di Allah-given fundamental human right of muslims.
But dem decide dem make dem deprive us of am using unorthodox methods.
Dem believe say dem dey war wit Muslims and dem believe say evritin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and foul means to dia objective
We dey call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours.
Like evri aggressor, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence.
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last more dan one century, dem dey determined to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeathed to dem
Dem don decide dem to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drive dem go.
Di constitution review panel don tell Nigerians say make dem forward dia view on wetin dem want for di constitution
Each group suppose submit im need.
But instead say dem dey tell di panel wetin di Christians want, PFN don go ahead to say wetin dem no want make Muslims ask for
Na attempt to gag Muslims for South West and e no go work
E tok say di claim of religious tolerance inside South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims in perpetual slavery.
Muslims for di region dey wake up dey ask for freedom.
we demand make dem stop di use of christian school uniform, christian education, christian law
We dey demand for civil Shariah, no be criminal Shariah wey involve di cutin of hand but civil Shariah make dem regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs
E no get anything to do wit Christians
He tok say; we go use evri peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to reach dis objective.¬ù

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom ever dominatin topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
Endin Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: di Livestock Reform Plan
Federal and state goment for Nigeria dey struggle to implement National Livestock Transformation Plan wey go find way to stop di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce herder-farmer conflict wey dey deadly
While di plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges
Deficient political leadership, popular misperception about im purpose, budgetary constraints wey di COVID-19 pandemic aggravated, lack of personnel wit di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, all dey hinder progress.
If di plan fail as previous initiative to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Approved by di National Economic Council for January 2019, di plan represent di comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system
Di core na strategy wey dem go use curtail migrratory or open grazing, and thus, reduce di risk of conflict wey dey between herders and farmers.
E dey animated by di hope say ova 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go dey persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wer breedingg farms and oda mechanized livestock management practices na to Bolster di sector productivity.
As 2028, authorities dey aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all participatin states, wey go create ova two million jobs for livestock production, processin and marketing chain.
President Muhammadu Buhari administation kom up wit di plan afta wey follow di wave of violence between herders and farmers, a surge in related violence afflicting rural dwellers in 2018.
Di federal goment, wey don committed to funding 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participatin states submit, don take preliminary steps toward putin di plan into practice, including to dey provide technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like help wit field surveys and site maping
Plenty states don reactivate di grazing reserves wey dem don demarcate before, dey open office dem and dey set up steering committee wey go dey administer di plan
Authorities don also hold workshops and dem don do oda works to explain di benefits of livestock reform to larger audience
But two years into di 10-year plan, dem neva build di first new ranch, and di obstacles plenti
Di opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plan benefit to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts
Distrust dey popular for di Middle Belt, wey don dey di scene of violent disputes ova land between herders and farmers, notwitstandin peacemaking and military effort wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget dey pinched, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri lack sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and to dey fear away potential investors
Unless dem address dis and oda problems, dem fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, wey go make di kontri dey vulnerable to escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wide ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To take tackle dis challenges require effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors.
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey dem go ask make dem change one centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately dey doubt di plan promise about available pature.
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Plenti for Middle Belt and Southern states dey deeply suspicious of di Plans long-term goals, wey dem see as to dey create privileges for herders, and more broadly, di Fulani
wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processin.
Federal and state goment suppose dey up budgetary commitment, make dem rush di release of funds and make dem provide financial transparency wey go ensure say accountability, make dem work wit donors and investors as e dey necessary
To dey address rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities wey previous violence affect badly for participatin states dey important
Plus, authorities go need to consider climate change wey fit impact and kom reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from di Plan
While some of dis steps go take time, di plan proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.
less dan two years now, di kontri go hold general election
If di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to dey able to produce clear proof of its benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and many state governors dey ineligible to compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
ideally, by di time wey dem dey campaign go up for late 2022, di plan backers suppose dey able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
E no go dey easy, but di plan dey worthy di effort
As e dey far from perfect, e dey offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of herders and small-scale farmers
Na like 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity ovaall di time wey e take big step toward resolving one of Naija's dangerous conflict
As di clock don tick down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quick to make visible mark, make di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity lost.
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how dem go quick implement am, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kind problem wey I get wit di king
Shey una no agree?
Dem dey responsible for veri high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na smallholders wey dey consume di majority of dia farm output and dem dey keep back from participating more actively for commercial oriented agriculture by variety of constraints.
Energy no dey for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own / my own
Na dis bring me to di conclusion say evryone na evil
Dem don characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey small, wey dem dey always hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey inside marginal or risk-prone environments.
Yield dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase dia yield.
we tok life and prosperity to dis day
send your account number
Di emphasis now dey on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as enterprise
I sabi eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey yarn
Di yields be say make smallholder farmers dey get profit
Shey una dey kom?
Dis emerging challenges dey lead many small-scale farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower-risk and lower-yieldin agricultural activities.
Shey u be witch?
I dey my way to sabo market to buy food stuff
make I call my Papa
As developing kontri population grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go apun for rapidly changing agri-food value chains.
How far wetin dey up, make I dey on my way?
Dis developments dey shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
E go require integrated approach to methods
Di loan sharks dey on hin neck
Dis kain thing
I dey errand from my place wey I dey work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Plenti farmers don battle for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders for di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey million small-scale farmers must contend wit.
Di agricultural sector don face plenti challenges, rang from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agricbusiness players.
First, di covid-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time wey dry season farmers wan harvest dia crop and wet season farmers wan start cultivation.
Many farmers no fit access dia farm while for odas to get labourers to harvest dia farm since mechanization na big challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus locked-down market don scatter di rural economy.
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so e fit allow dem buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer bikom so high dat many smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go up to N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10 wey dey dey dey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5,000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia r dey di price no rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places
For farmers for Zamfara, Katsina, Southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activity no only deny dem access to dia farm but kom kill many for dia farm
Plenti farming communities na hin dey raze down
Dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
Many pipo pay plenti sum of moni or surrender plenti portion of dia harvest to di bandits.
Plenti village for dose states don bikom desolate
Di agric sector see one of di worst disaster wen floods don whip out ova 450,000 hactares of rice and maize field wey dem estimate at ova N3.5billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states
Many of di farmers wey dey affect neva dey compensate as dia livelihood don destroy.
Di flood na di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Naija coastal cities and areas wey dey flood-prone to dey kill pipo and to dey wash farmland
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers wey dey North, farmers wey dey down South dey face drought
For two months, farmers dey watch dia investment for crop wither away
no disguise
Anoda subsector wey dem badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos price make e increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria make dem send a save our Soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention.
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers in addition to dey grant some of di big players license to import about 222 metric ton of maize to increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean hit, wey make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut down completely
Di scarcity result for one serious feed crisis in di industry as price don reach record high for hin history as e dey rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,000 now
Di poultry industry don lose estimated N7 million jobs wit figures wey dem project reach 10 million by January 2021 but di loss for investment wey dem estimate conservatively at about N1.5 trillion.
While di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marry di subsector, di crop farmers even as di challenges wey dey face di sector for di 2020 farming year, don get buyers wey dey go dia farm even before dem harvest am to make bulk purchase arrangement.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, sparking fear of looming hunger and di call for di border to dey reopened, wey go allow influx of smuggled products through di kontri's porous borders.
Di name of di lord na strong tower

For December, most farmers no fit sell dia broilers bikos say di cost of production dey high pass wetin an average Nigerian fit afford

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy dey trends for di public domain, wit Southern governors dem wey dey slamm ban on am for dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN) and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, dey examines how di North-Central governors dem fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di Southern state governors dem meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminalities
wetin dey una take on di heated controversy wey dis decision generate
Na everibodi get right to action and opinion.
But di thing wey important pass be say once you take your action, you suppose dey aware of di consequences
Make una dey able to consider di advantage and disadvantage
I no be one of dose wey tok say e good or bad
As Nigerian, you get di right and freedom to live anywia for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
On dis basis, I no go tok say e good thin
But as a leader for di North Central, I go say e dey good, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefits wey dey for us and di nation
Di ban be advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am a real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herders, no matter di number wey fit troop from di South to di North Central
wetin be una position for open grazing
I no be one of di propagator of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as a pesin.
I believe say if we take ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central Governors suppose accommodate di national programme for ranching.
Dis kind move fit make di North Central cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products.
And den e go bikom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo.
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herders and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey di Fulani herder dey pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate on e advantage
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem go need dey well educated to embrace ranching.
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia all di family get ranches and una no see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for be dat?
Di governors no dey categorical for hia.
Dem no dey call for ranching and for di federal goment make dem kom inside
Wetin dem dey tok simply be say di herder dem don turn problem to us and make dem go away
Dem tok say make di herder dem apply for land wey dem claim say herding na private business
But don dey tell dia indegenes say make dem apply for land like di herder dem
As one of dose wey dey involve in youth empowerment programmes, especially in di agricultural sector and e value chains, why some goment policy dey fail to realise dia objectives and wetin dey di way out?
Firstly, no administation wey don dey able to touch di lives of individuals like President Muhammadu Buhari administration whereby you fit conveniently sit for your house kom apply for facilities and you go get dem
Di target credit facility sef dey wey dem dey call Covid-19 loan
plenti Naija pipo don get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house witout even going to office
Also, wit SMEs wey dem dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two sides of those wey go believe in you and those wey go criticise you.
So, for dos wey no believe in Buhari administration, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am.

And dis sef attest to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of goment in di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great joy and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dem put togeda as platform wey go help us let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on top board so we go fit complement national efforts for hin quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda crimes wey dey related
Afta di senate don pass dis Bill, and bikos of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di House of Assembly wey dey ready and resilient, as e dey under His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di hon
Speaker follow suit and pass di Bill for Wednesday 19th of May, 2021.
As u fit know, di Bill wey wan establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don dey be one of di bill wey dem dey attack and attack pass for recent time for di National Assembly.
Na only di attack kom from pipo wey suppose be partner in progress for di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don rather designate demsef as enemies of di general good
Good na good e no get substitute so e dey bad
No mata how long e take, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how evritin apun for di National Assembly
Di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na hin dey first pass to law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dem don undergone di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventually for 3rd Reading on di 2nd of March, 2021 di bill na hin dey unanimously pass to law by di Nigerian Senate afta im don consider wetin dey urgent for dis noble legislation, of course dis no dey without series of thunderbolts from detractors wey no go stop for any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful for assist Buhari administration to fight corruption no see di light of di day but di senate wey dey stand and wey dey see am through di firm.
E dey very important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but novel one for Nigeria wey dem dey target to dey bridge di gap wey don dey long dey exist for di forensics space
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey on top and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-goment bodies wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no be lie, na clear demonstration of hin patriotic zeal and di nid to strengthen all national effort wey dey towards di fight against corruption, wey don hinder development for evri aspect of awa national lives
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, e kom for time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
wey go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe.
As all of us know, crime generally, don enter new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century
therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit global reality wey dey emerge and e dey ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians
E dey apposite to also state say di journey, wey culminate inside di passage of dis Bill, start for di 8th National Assembly whereby, awa Bill na hin dey sponsor by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, wey be di current President of Senate wen hin be Senate Leader, bikos of hin strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
for di benefit of hindsight, wen dey introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers during di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings dey conduct by di relevant Committees of di respective Chambers
Afta, wit di opposition from stakeholders wey dey di minority, wey di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead, di National Assembly pass di Bill, bikos of how e dey significant, and di part wey e go play for di fight against corruption.
Afta, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem neva give before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019
E dey on top di strength of dis, say dem re-introduced di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, na hin dey sponsor by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya wey be di current Leader of di Senate, bikos of di importance wey dey attached to am
We dey constrain to make dis clarification so we go fit clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propel say awa Bill na hin di 8th National Assembly reject
Worthy of mention be di fact say awa Bill don dey mistake for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di senate and di House of Representatives Chamber
Dis Bills, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem merely duplication of di intent and purport of awa Bill
We suppose emphasize say no one of dis Bill dem wey we introduce for di 8th National Assembly, except awa Bill
For dat kind, we be di first wey eva kom up wit Bill of dis magnitude(Forensic)
afta we don see di urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
We take di decision to establish di Institute afta wey we don study how di Institute dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how dey don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey so tey 2009
And ova di years, we don train professional for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go dey target inculcatin di requisite skil and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, make dem wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, weda e kos by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cyber security; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, forensic report preparation, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
Una go agree wit me say for today's world, di conventional way wey dem dey use investigate crimes, wit a view wey dem go use fight am don turn obsolete
For us as a nation to do somethin meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and upcoming innovations, wey go dey target fight corruption
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say dem conceive di idea to establish dis Institute wit good structure laudable objective wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill for here
Howeva, I wish to crave your indulgence to highlight some of di objective of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as followin:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional for Nigeria so e go fit develop and train Professional for dis specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for trainin and re-trainin of intending professionals in di use of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in di investigation of fraud for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standard, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners for di farm, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and also develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri no expire im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for Nigeria;
To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, wey involve professionals like Lawyer, Criminologist, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economist
E go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanism,throughdia provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas
from di foregoin, e dey apparent say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey relevant to tok again say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standard dem.
Di wide spectrum of di scope and focus point of di Institute, include but e no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursin; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, like dat like dat
Accordingly, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity wit international best practices
Dis concept dey far pass to dey reason those wey dia myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be source of consign for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) kom out strongly to oppose hin passage bikos as dem believe say na unnecessary duplication of function dem wey dia Institute already dey undertaken.
Howeva, as dem re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and as dem don see di legislative support wey dey overwhelm and dey accelerate, awa Bill don receive from di two Chambers, ICAN don know say forensic science na one unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce one similar Bill wey dey currently before House of Assembly, as dem don fail woefully for dia attempts to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One pesin fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say institute wey no suppose dey except dia own to regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey good as me
I wish tell you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no kom from dis funny theatrical episode
Like dia ICAN colleague, dem don also introduce Bill for di House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey ANAN initiate and dey promote
I decide to bring out all diz facts so Nigerians and even di international community go understand di extent wey some pipo fit go so dem go fit dia aims
Howeva, we no dey perturbe by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin dey right and not to allow demsef manipulate in any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as not to make mockery of di entire thin.
Di practical and antagonist wey we know for dis Bill don remain ICAN for reason wey dey bikom evident
Dem engage several bystanders into writing frivolous petitions some even targeted at di leadership of di senate wit a tone of blackmail
Afta he don fail woefully for senate, di antagonists shift dia attention go House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all manner of publication.
Still again, dem fail
Ordinary by legislative procedure, a bill wey di Senate pass go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observation dey
But for di case of CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and for 19th of May, 2021 di Bill wey go establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persins wey wan becom Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) wey House of Representative passed into law.
ICAN don register im Bill for di House of Repesentative wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT).
Dis ICAN new bill get full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead such a person to some year imprisonment.
Dis sound strange for a kontri wey full of enlightened pipo
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level of corruption wey dey der
House of Representatives don already challenge us di passage of di bill
We suppose note say, awa challenge di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow awaselves and Nigerians say dia antics dey deceive
You go remember how ICAN strongly oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of its sponsored publications by di Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria wey Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade for 24th of May, 2019 don make frantic effort to say ICAN under im law wey dey enable dey empowered to dey practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to dey passed e go amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present im ACT to dey repeal and re-enacted wit di inclusion of Forensics in di new law.
Di question na, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey seek for hin re-enactment
As e dey always be, while we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose make dem include forensics for hin laws, we dey howeva concerned dat bodi no go try to perpetuate hinsef
ICAN and dia cohorts don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
So dem wan get bodi for inside demsef
Wetin dem dey fear na check and balance, dem no go want anoda professional bodi investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
how dey wan be Judge for dia own case
E sound strange
On dis note, we dey call di National Assembly make dem dey aware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit dey tok from both of dia mouth and dey expect make di National Assembly dey cajoled.
We wan appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly yet again in ensuring say di Bill don pass, di Nigerian pipo are more dan ever before convinced of di readiness of dis administration to fight corruption through evri possible means and go at all time encourage legislation wey dey aim to dis goal.
We dey confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate in assenting to dis Bill if e reach hin desk
We dey call on all Nigerians make dem kom and be part of di Forensics Profession.
Di profession dey open for all professional dem for different field of endeavours
One training arm for di institute go guide you and equip you badly
I wish thank you all and make you repeat awa resolve and commitment to uphold ethical standard in line wit global best practices, in rendering awa professional services and trainings wey go bring about innovative ways to fight corruption and financial crimes, generally
I wish say I go appeal to all stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians say make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore make we all make we do frantic effort so dat collectively, we go fit surmount di threat of corruption, di plethora of security challenges, across di kontri and oda associated crises.

Dem carry placards wit various inscriptions like We say no to moni bag
for Abeokuta South and

Between DSS and regional separatist
DSS don repeat warning to pipo and groups wey dia utterance and activity persistently constitute provocative disruption of di ethno-religious environment and dey threaten harmious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, dem begin dey sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingerin question about who or which persins and groups di security agency wey dem dey refer dey vapourized promptly for di heated rhetorical outbursts of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Hausa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
Den start wetin be say true dis na di persins and groups wey don continue to dey use incitin, unguard and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against each oda so dem go fit inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS charge for one of im warnings.
Interestingly, no one of dis prime suspect for di exploitation of some fault lines to kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance hinsef from di dangerous and subversive activities wey di security agency see.
Dem don chore common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, different only for di respective direction of dia accusing fingers
As Afenifere return dis pipo know di pipo wey dey responsible for dis acts but no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehashed im grouse about plenti pipo wey dey feel alienated and ACF no sabi, dey ask who dem be di pipo?
So tey di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive to deal wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crises and dem know dem; dem suppose treat dem according to di law
Una no need to dey be spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS know dem yet dem insist say dem dey pass di buck outside dia clique.
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politiks know no beta solution to Nigeria myriad problems dan for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord am ova di rest of di kontri as rulers, no leaders!
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous so dem dey pursue dia inordinate ambition say dem dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce evritin wey e take to excis di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease to dey cut dia portion of di crumbs wey remain of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to inordinate ambitions of persins or groups restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, e dey easy to tok pass do.
Dis regional group dey major hindrance to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey work for since flag independence
So tey wen dey continue to parade di political terrain as ethnic champion, for longe dey go regard Nigeria as di right for dia ethnic stake for di population, make dem claim or seize am and, if all oda fail, deconstructed and disowned as failed state
Weneva wey dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless dia leadership dey firmly for dia grasp, odawise, e dey all about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
If to say na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activity go always dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda undeniable indictment of dis regional separatist be say dem be all self-styled political pressure groups masqueradin as representatives of various ethnic groups
from dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consists of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency dey give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to dey remain relevant for democratic system wey elect representatives entirely through political parties wey dey registered wit legislative and executive institutions wey dey constitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dey persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria Ungovernable as dey threaten and attempt, so dat, perchance, dey fit regain political relevance if not control
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetin dey trigger security alerts
Wit dat kind predator-politicians wey dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent to undermine di government wey dem elect just becos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say na convergence of interest wey go link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnapper dem, insurgents, armed robber dem, bandits and allied terrorists, wey dey combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.
double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of di Buhari administration having to contend wit such array of formidable enemy unleashing incessant attack on national security in a time of economic adversity wey no get precedent
To extend, na only two groups of politicians go dey: those wey dey positively participating for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward against all odds and those wey dey negatively engaged in planting seeds of discord and disorder wey go destabilize di kontri.
By dia utterance and activity, we all know dem
For di end of di day, di majority of Naija pipo be ordinary citizens wey no determine dia condition of survival by and e no depend on di geography of dia origin.
Dia daily struggle to eke a live dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith.
Nigeria be dia destroy fatherland wey dem dey loyal, law abiding and prayerful, sabiing say dem no get oda kontri to call dia own, collectively showing how citizenship dey breeds true patriotism
Dey also know say Afenifere, Hausa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF dey use incit, unguard and divisive statements and activities to pit citizen dem against each oda so dem go fit inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambition of dia leaders.
So di poor man's prayer go remain:
God DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER

Di two events don show heated and often emotional debate wey dey threaten to negate Nigeria multicultural identity and reality.
Di whole idea for Kwara of di proprietors of di schools wey dey ban hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathimer fit dey reduced to wetin no to wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Dem dey face female Nigerians bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human rights of di Muslim student to express dia faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence for taking such a position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also for Christians wia and weneva dem dey threaten dem wit discrimination based on dia professed faith
Running through di argument of di proprietors of di christian faith schools wey dey Kwara, persin fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda schools for anoda place if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey get dis argument plenti.
First, to say Muslim student dem suppose go anoda place unless dey conform to di school rule on uniform no too dey to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: she dey justifiable to base school rule bikos of Christian majority of di school?
Den, thirdly, di go elsewia argument appear say to ignore di difficulty to change school for pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act to dey change school for di pikin, educational psychologist go tell you, interferes negatively wit no be only hin emotional but academic development sef
Finally, di Christian faith schools by demsef risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate students wit di same religious beliefs for particular schools.
Di social cost dis exacts on di society dey enormous
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argues, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say e policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey dey anchored on mutual respect and understanding
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, wey dem sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e be to deny Nigerian pikin access to school wey im choose on di basis of di manifestation of im religion?
E get big concern bikos Nigeria dey signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human being dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 article on top rights and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political right, like di right to life, free tok and privacy
E also include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey relevant to di issue under consideration and I quote am for full below:
Article 18: Everybodi get di freedom to dey think or believe wetin dey want, plus di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa religion wey we choose, alone or wit odas
Na everybodi get di right to education.
Make primary schooling dey free
Make all of us dey able to kontinue awa studies as we wish
For school, make dem help us develop awa talent, and make dem teach us understanding and respect for evribodi's human rights
Dem suppose teach us to dey wit odas whateva dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri dem kom from
awa parents get di right to choose di kind school wey we go do
Dis kain law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to dey sit for House of Representatives for di US wey dey wear her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal konstituency of Niger State, Hon sponsor
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies and oda sectors from discriminating against persins, students or personnel based on dia religious belief or hin manifestation.
Wen dey pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry wey some employers, or those executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am becloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welcome development
afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document as we explain am above.
E dey in line wit similar laws wey dem pass recently for di kontri seeking to tackle social threat and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persins Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability dey find way to eliminate all form of discrimination wey dey base on persin disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for a time, awa representative for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social threat wey dey torment awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no be sake of say prior generic law no dey wey go cover dem but bikos dem need address dem more comprehensively to leave room for opacity
While UDHR fit seem like far, distant document wey no get any instrument of enforcement, di RDPP law and odas like am dey provide to allocate punishments for offenders.
Contrary to wetin criticise, so far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing dey show attempts to seek di enthronement of state religion for any state wey fi domestice di law eventually
E no go against Section 10 for di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di goment of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State Religion.
Make we peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public space smake of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny Nigeria male or female hin or her religious freedom dey negate awa multicultural pretenses
E dey negate di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey for Nigeria's constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document
A bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimation based on religious grounds, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

Police dey go afta newspaper vendors ova reports wey dey IPOB
Police dey harass newspaper vendors and readers for Aba, di commercial hub for Abia state
Daily Trust don gather so tey di weekend, policemen for di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors dem and readers ova reports on di Indigenous pipo of Biafra
Residents tok say tension dey for Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raid di place for Sunday
One eyewitness tok say residents dey scamp for safety, as police officers dey shot sporadically, as dem dey try arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
Dem accuse di vendors say dem dey distribute newspapers wey get Tori for di sit at home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra
Dr Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, beg state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein on dia men so e no go be crisis for di city.
Di kind pipo wey we dey put inside police dis days dey make me dey wonder if we really want anythin good out of dis kontri wey dem dey call Nigeria.
How persin fit dey chase newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world
If you stop pipo wey dey read hard copy of newspapers, you go also stop dem make dem no read di same tori for facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, and odas?
wetin manner of primitive policing na dis?
Dem kos panic for Sunday by dia shooting and noisemaking
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey chase kidnappers
E kom later wey we discover say di police kom arrest a vendor and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspaper vendors?
Wetin manner of problem paper fit kos say Social Media no fit kos 20 times ova
Dis pipo no dey normal, e tok.
Michael Anorue wey be anoda resident tok say na almost all di vendor stands him visit for Aba
Dem dey empty on Tuesday
He tok say; We hear say dem dey tok on Saturday and Sunday say di newspaper get tori on di sit at home order in honour of Biafra heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit am?
Di early political leaders for South East, dey remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra big pass IPOB di beta for dem
Shey IPOB proscribe mean say Biafra don dey proscribe sef
Na Biafrans all of us be
On di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) do one zoom conversation, dem dey tok about Biafra fallin heroes.
Why police no fit go YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey release am?
wetin dem do na to kom street kom start dey find unnecessary trouble

NAMA kil as air traffic controlers dey lament poor tool
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don cried out on top dilapidated navigational equipment wey dey most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di sponsorship of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation be threat to air safety.
Dey also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go aid safe aircraft navigation
Di president of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for di chat wit tori-pipo for di weekend, tok say wetin dey Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controlers.
Hin kom tok say oda airports for di kontri lack di necessary equipment for seam navigation
E explain say some airports no even get equipment wey dey work
Even Kaduna no get control tower.
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we dey call on di government to do somethin.
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controlers go go find umbrellas wey go dey di control tower, and wetin be dat, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings na hin dem ced di FAAN, while di one wey dey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisation
We still dey battle wit radio frequency wey dey terrestrial, communication for here and for there.
Calabar dey there; airport no dey you go meet today say you go say thins dey work for 80 per cent
NAMA recently employ and train 40 new controller, but NATCA tok say di number dey too low to meet di shortfall.
Capt Fola Akinkuotu wey be di Managin Director for di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest hugely for improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations
He tok say na mere politics
Di goment don spend plenti for di past to dey improve aviation infrastucture
I dey tok am no be bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion dey always be, ask di pipo wey dey street, ask di pipo wey dey NAMA, dem go tell you, dem neva get am so good under dis administration.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok like dis
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis government put two for place, two oda dey kom
goment just spend N1.7bn on top a mobile control tower
Also, di revitalisation of di safe tower dey go on
We dey revive di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Oda sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenge and prospect
E-commerce dey reflect on di use of communications technology di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift in national economies wey dem dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by di national differences in goment regulations.
E-commerce dey also promote direct access to distant market and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and e dey blur many of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e dey impossible to determine di origin of di products.
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communications platform, all information or service wey a company fit offer to customers ova di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support
Di major significance of E-commerce na di fact say e dey encourage single world trading system, wey dem dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey for Nigeria dey back dey towards di development and growth of e-commerce for particular and ICT as a whole
We don do plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Naija
plenti of dis studies be of opinion say di Nigerian legal system dey for back of ICT-based legislation and say di statutory laws wey dey exist dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenti more
there be,derfore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime
Dey don tok am plenti time say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of draft bill before di National Assembly
E dey important to note say even for wia dem pass dis bill to law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issue for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention
If to say di speed wey Internet dey use permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best tin wey dem fit suggest na say di legal issues and problems wey dey face e-commerce for di kontri suppose dey addressed directly and quickly, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To dis, make di National Assembly dey pressureSed into passing bill concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so dem go fit enact dem into law as quick as possible
In di interim, awa court suppose take giant stride by interpreting the traditional laws wey dey exist liberally so as to bridge di gap therein in order to make such laws amenable to electronic transactions, especially in di emerging tendency of di present-day information age.
For true dem don argue am say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit use electronic transaction and attendant documentation dey legally
Di court fit also recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract.
As di before Justice Bingham don put am so: di common law get di same facility wey dey for di hands of dem Judges as di law merchant wey dey take dey adapt demsef to di changein need of di general public; principles no dey alter, but old rules wey dey apply di change, and new rules spring into existence.
Dem dey hope say oda Nigerian Judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive go adopt dis judicial activism, especially for areas wia awa current legislature dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di technological advancements wey dey emerge.
Na dis go set beta precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri
Di germane issue wey regards to contracts for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 wey dey di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statutes wey dey on top real property and landed instruments, all of dem wey require say some contract dey in writing and dey duly executed
question den na electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of a contract by e-mail and e dey binding
Plenti of dis issue neva dey quite settle even for UK even though some decision dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
Na so e mark for e-mail as e dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transactions na paperless transactions wey dem make through magnetic materials like tapes or disks.
Diz dey in contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dem dey embodi in permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures usually authenticated by signatures.
Dem no fit change dat kind transaction witout any altaration for di face of di document.
wit respect to signature, by di provision of section 93(2)(3)), evidence act 2011, electronic signature for relation to data message conveniently satisfy any requirement for a handwritten signature in so far say e sufficiently identify electronic record to di pesin
Di provision of article 7 for di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on top dis issue
Thus, for di purpose of establish proof of electronic signature
Di use of password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
Derefor, persin fit position am safely say electronic signature for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence if dem certify am and put am inside electronic communication wen e-transaction dey apun.
Also, oda legal wahala wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relationship
Di question na for what point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how dem go differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for what point dem fit tok say dem don make intention to enter legal relationship
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction wey dem neva altered order or invoices wey dem send and emanate from whoeva dem appear to be from
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information.
last last, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce no be doubt say e be aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time
Di goment suppose pass to dey create laws, make dem activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for im commercial interactions and for delivery of goment services.

Chad don pass new charter wey dem dey call Deby son president
Chad don pass charter wey dey declare Mahamat Idriss Deby president, even afta rumours of hin death wey dey trend for social media

Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey dey rule wit iron fist for almost 30 years, die for wound wey he suffer for one visit to di battlefield for di kontri's north where Chadian soldier dem fight against a rebel group, na wetin di military announce on Tuesday
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders, as dem dey suspend di constitution and dey scatta di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di appointment of president Idriss Dby's son make dem take over for di wake of hin death
experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose don take power afta Deby;s death and no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case hin kpeme, den di speaker of di parliament take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so dem go start a transition until dem hold election, Al Jazeera Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am on Tuesday.
Di military don announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and say dem don dissolve di constitution too, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di constitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea dey face possible point deduction afta dem brawl wit Leichester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by FA for di team fail to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, dem don find di team say dem dey pants down for seven hot-tempered rows wit dem opponent
Di recent brawl wen dem dey clash for Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter wey Chealsea get wit Premier League team
Last week, di match wey dey between Chelsea and Leicester na hin skirmishes between di players of di two teams
As he dey mention di same offenses in di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea
Dem don also charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff wey follow Ricardo Pereira's challenge for Ben Chilwell
For 2016, dem also charge Chelsea for indiscipline say dem gats warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part for mass bust-up durin one match wey dem get wit Tottenham
If e affect, di point deduction go significantly affect dia season as dem dey go final campaign for top four spot
US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No
Overpaid, oversexed and over here
na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo wey kom to get of di thousands of America GIs stationed for different military base for Britain during di Second World War.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard drinking and womanising American soldier dem dey often get inside pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up a feeling of disdain for di yanks among di local ones.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldier dem evriwia for di hundred of American military base abroad from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for di Philippines.
Na di reason why I dey perturbe, like many Nigerians, say for one virtual meetin last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari na hin dey report say dey don ask say di United States dey consider to relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military presently for di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
Dem presume am say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari make e hold dat meetin wit di American Secretary of State
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken Nigeria oppose number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go then transmit di details later to di president
Yes, America be superpower and wetin be dat, but di protocol na protocol and we suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances.
Understandably, currently Nigeria dey face gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best efforts of goverment and di nation security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelatin terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnappin for di North West, farmers/herders dem dey clash all ova di kontri and di target killin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians togeda wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity wey dey destroy di kontri now.
But even for dat one, di request make dem host Africom for Nigeria soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria dey hardly justified
Africom be one of di nine command wey di American military establishment give American strategic interest wey dey around di world.
by dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, especially those outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues for dia area of coverage
Dem only do am wen dat kind issue directly affect America interest for di area and in dat kind situation, dem no get di power to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies dem.
If Africom do set up for Nigeria, e go be Island of im own restricting access to Nigerians wey get all category, and e go establish jurisdiction wey go dey di Territorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies dem.
As e dey always apun to American military base outside America, Africom go be forward operatin base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts wey dey sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri
For Africom particular case, part of im original concept nah to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa sterling record of peace wey dey kip around di world.
Africom precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiave (ACRI) wey Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make plenti secret and open visit to some African kontri make dem sell di idea
But bikos Nigeria be di target, e pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na di coordinatin base of di ACRI and even say dem tout am as initiative wey go facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, hin secret protocol dey unmistakably military and strategically targeted for Nigeria
due to undisguise hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to see di Americans trying to but into area wey e consider its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di ACRI concept
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by di American congress for secret session, di Americans consider and realize di need to set up African command to add to di oda command already in place wey cover di various continents of di world.
So, based on di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of America political and security establishments, na hin dey set up by di Bush junior administration wit a wide mandate wey no just go contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on di growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom go be for Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey base for Florida, is to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey base for Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), wey dey also base for Florida, is to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Nigeria don dey surrounded by French military presence for Niger, Cameroon, Chad and Benin
Di Americans get drone base for Niger
To add Africom for di mix for Nigeria go amount to complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.
Bearing in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent to letting in di Wolf into di chicken coop.
Notin dey inside di insecurity challenges wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit.
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for dose kontri from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldier dem wey distinguish demsef for dose operations.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, having fall from di high standard wey dem know of am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activity of non-state actors internally
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capacity to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dem so willing
But even say awa circumstances dey arm-twisted to host di Africom in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interests, on awa soil.
Even as e dey challenge, Plateau dey target 7m metric ton of irish potato
Plateau State na Nigeria number one grower of Irish potato wit di tuber wey dem dey produce for nine of di state's 17 local goment area
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di Afrikan Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as accounting for 90% of di potato production for di kontri wit kontris like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and odas wey dey receive plenti supply of potato from Nigeria
Di large potato production for Plateau State, accordin to PotatoPRO.com, wey be one of di leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth biggest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers say inadequate dams and road networks, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to dey pose major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export
Oda problem wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wilt as well as seedlings wey poor
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 states wey poor pass for Nigeria wit poverty rate wey pass 70%.
Di state get comparative advantage to boost economic activities as dem dey improve di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain.
Di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment area wey dey Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di state's potato hub.
Dem dey produce more potatoes dan any LGA wey dey di kontri
Muopshin tok say adaptability research show say di eight LGA wey remain for di state dey viable to produce potato, e dey make all of Plateau 17 LGA wey get potential to produce di tuber especially durin dry season.
Di association of Potato farmer for di state, howeva, tok say unless dem address squarely challenges wey dey affect di value chain, increase production and export for potato go continue to dey elude di nation.
Lazarus Makut wey be Plateau State Chairman of APF for interview wit Daily Trust tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor road and high cost of farm inputs, continue to dey affect potato outputs.
Hin tok say di cost of mechanised farmin wey fit rapidly increase productivity don dey expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to afford mechanization.
anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water durin di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield.
bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey find place wey dem go use farm use irrigation water for dia farm
Martha kom explain say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent many farmers say make dem no improve di quantity and quality of yield, she add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output
Di cost dey also prevent many of us make we no expand di business
To get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes.
If di water no dey sufficient for di crop, e go dry and e fit die na di reason why some farmers wey get di resource prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu purposely for irrigation bikos, witout am, dry season farming go dey difficult, she tok.

As Plateau State's potato production don jump from 1,656,650 metric tons for 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons for 2020, di establishment of di Potato Value Chain Support Project and di construction of di tissue culture lab dey expected to kos di tripling of production to ova seven million metric tons by di end of 2021

Super League trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus tok on Wednesday say dem dey commit to modernise football even afta UEFA threat of disciplinary action.
UEFA on Tuesday open formal disciplinary proceedings against di three clubs who still dey refuse to give up di aborted Super League project.
For one joint statement, Juventus and di two Spanish side tok say dem still dey committed to modernising football through open dialogue wit UEFA.
Di statement tok say FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid FC wish express dia absolute rejection of di insistent coercion dat UEFA don dey maintain towards three of di institutions wey dey relevant pass for di history of football.
Dis alarming attitude constitutes a flagrant breach of di decision of di court of justice, wey don already make a clear statement warning UEFA make dem refree to take any action wey fit penalise di foundin clubs of di Super League while di legal proceedings dey ongoin.
therefore, di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and nah direct attack against di rule of law wey we, di citizen dem for European Union, don build up democratically, as we dey constituting lack of respect toward di authority of di court of justice demsef.

Di kontri dey coordinate regular prevention and kontrol wit im vaccination efforts, dey ensure say di regulatory responsibility of local goment and di oversight responsibility dey fulfilled, and dey advance im vaccination campaign in a more secure, orderly and forceful manner, im tok.

from Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang√¢
Twelve month ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi na hin dem arrest for June 2020 for Dubai for alledge money laundering from business e-mail compromise fraud and oda scams wey dey target firms and English premier league club
E make a total sum of $435 million afta im defraud 1,926,400 victims.
Afta 1 year, Abidemi Rufai ( wey dem also know as Sandy Tang√¢), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun na im dem arrest by di Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for John F Kennedy Airport, New York bikos say a criminal complaint wey dey defraud Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di money wey dem steal na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fi don suffer job losses as a result of COVID-19 pandemic
Di fraud incident apun for lockdown and di investigation bureau began dey track di alleged fraudster wey for don be for Nigeria Federal House of Representative making laws if e neva lose Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di pipos Democratic parti PDP
Di fraud wey dey apun as dem steal di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem dey file falsified claim to di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem steal, dem create a separate e-mail account so dat di claim go dey associated wit different persins and e go fit escape automatic fraud detection systems.
Na more dan $288,000 dem pay to hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisations and kontri dem
Nigeria dey lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year
As 2021 dey end, di world go don lose a total of $6 trillion.
till today, over 40 Nigerians don dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai tok say unemployment benefit fraud fall under wetin I call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Diz na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on top di loopholes wey di COVID-19 pandemic create to dey scam pipo, goment and organisation
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals dey pattern dia fraud for di intervention of goment and private sector and dey scam many and some of dis schemes still dey till date
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promote sales fraud among odas
While doz wey dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngster dem dey do am for inside Nigeria.
E dey regularly arrest, trial and convict dem by di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
Understandin di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment fight di crime
Di family na di microcosm of di large society
Na di place wey normal human being suppose dey nurtured for di society
Apart from di fact say plenti Naija family dey dungeon of poverty and dem no fit take care of dia pikin, some of dis pikin don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegal
Di challenge wit ethical behaviour training dey for plenti house as parents dem wey dem dey arrest wit dia children wey dey involve for cyber-criminality
For anoda place, mothers of yahoo-boys dey form association to celebrate dia son success and justify dia criminal behaviours
For di religious setting, pastors wey dem deprive, alfas and traditionalists dey create house wey dem dey benefit from Yahoo-boyism proceed
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Viral video dey wey boys dey show say dem dey spray moni while doz wey appear say dem be shepherd for white garment church enjoy di moment wen di captive members of di church, wey dia female youth wing lead, record di shameful scene.
Pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don dey 21 years old
Sadly, dem don grew up to appreciate lying as way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many cases from home) wey deceive pipo to vote dem and dem no dey fulfil or jettison di campaign promises.
Lyin itself na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism
Dem dey socialise youths to corruption and fraud by pipo wey dey hold public office
Dem see how dia systems dey provide soft landin for fraudulent persins ( public or private).
Shey dem dey ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don dey fully investigated and discharged wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty?
Di majority of di case end wit off-di-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as family affair
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyle dem wey dem dey celebrate inside di squalor
Dem see how once poor political aspirant don turn to millionaire witin months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institution don bikom cash and dem carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, give honours wey dey undeserving in exchange for moni
All those wey mismanage di moni dey get soft landin
We add to di list of culture wey dey nurturin cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musician wey present cyber-criminality as work and game dat evribodi dey involve in and no be crime
If we elect fraudsters as legislors, dem go make laws against di crime wey dem dey involve
Di process to dey give parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need to dey review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products into awa already morally bankrupt political system
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni don dangle for dia eyes
Dem dey provide platform for dubious character to cover up dia track and awa society is worse off through dia actions
Greed dey also nurture cyber-criminality
Donald Voiret wey be FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers
As we dey move forward, we no fit live in sin and dey expect make grace abound.
Nigeria go need sanitise im anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey dey track lifestyle wit material accumulation.
We need give youth hope for Nigeria as we dey create employment opportunity, reduce poverty and review reward systems
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di commission need conclude di investigation before dem go arrest suspects as di FBI don do before dem go arrest Ramini Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless di culture wey dey sustain cybercrimes for Nigeria na hin dem dey tackle through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester

How e dey feel to give birth durin di pandemic by Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red lines change my life
I dey pregnant and I dey hapi
E be amazing start to new year
Na di year wey dey remark pass for my life
All of a sudden, evrithin change
My daughter Roshomon Tara na hin dem born for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she don dey nine month old
She be di reason why I bikom mother for di middle of a global crisis.
No be only her wey dem born, but na new me, mother of Tara, wey spend an entire pregnancy for lockdown for house and giving birth for emergency condition within di emergency.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation.
her grandmothers sef dey afraid to hold am or kom closer to her witout wear mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey to motherhood go dey completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter don dey front of me, she dey smile and star for me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
Di only tin wey no change na di pandemic
I dey 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic start, and di planeta go lockdown.
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes
those 22 weeks no less dan war
my husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts for dat time
na freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
We dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, so we go spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalist association dey forward to help for di time being
I dey fear evrithin
most of di time, e be like death
dem dey knock for door
I dey adapt to a new online life wia we click and get awa thin home-delivered
I gats wait for one week make I get groceries delivered dis way
I even dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me my husband go out go buy food for storage

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
E kom from Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and take som far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem dey call as Asaba Declaration
Di meetin wey kom on di heels of worsenin insecurity for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoist and di unending threat of murderous herdsmen generate nationwide attention
for true di bi-partisan nature of di meeting and di unanimity wey di 17 governors show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for di context of true federalism and di ban for open grazing form di core of di declaration.
major highlights include di clamour for state police, devoluton of power, review of revenue formula in favour of federatin units and di need for national dialogue to discuss di national question
While di leg-draging of di governors on top financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and run contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem dey clamour to, di bulk of dia resolutions dey actually a cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai-led committee on top True Federalism don make far-reaching recommendations.
One go don dey expect make di leading light of APC take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelmin support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process to dey address di issues.
Instead, we see attempts to play to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devoluton of power, resource kontrol, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formule in favor to dey federate units among odas
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
If to say di state of di kontri wey security and economy don pose serious challenges, dis twin sectors suppose receive di utmost attention, concrently.
Despite di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make sufficient effort to translate dat to improved standard of living for di majority of awa citizen
awa annual budget wey dey about $35 billion, for example, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di need of an estimated 220 million Nigerians
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes wey dey reach 17m for di population
Di efforts wey Buhari administation get, though novel and commendable, still represent drop for ocean and dem no dey adequate to make di required impact
Na wia devoluton of power and resource kontrol kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey dey stay a day longer for di Exclusive list
Na almost all di states for di kontri get commercial viable natural resources wey dem fit use use use create wealth and generate di necessary foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wey states enta cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri breeds indolence, run contrary to di principle of true federalism
As di El-Rufai committee don propose, make dem review di revenue formule for favour of di states since dem go add more responsibilities
For state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excess by governors dey understandable, but as Richie Norton tok say To escape fear, you need go through am, no around am
for too long we don waka around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eyes to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria police force wey don bikom no not only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum
As Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey hin time don kom
We need address awa fears and overkom am.
One of di way wey dem fit do na to use legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), wit di constitution amendment wey go allow State Police.
E go dey similar to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but dem get wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory funtions.
Di ban to dey open grazing though di governors dem restate no be new and e form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council approve
Di international Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's comprehensive effort to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
Di core na strategy to curtail migrratory or open grazing and thus reduce di risk of conflict between herders and farmers E,derfore, beggars belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Make di federal and state goment move quick to fully implement dis new plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes for awa back
Di convocation of National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since di report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of di Gov. El-Rufai APC committee on top True Federalism dey.
Both report don make far-reaching recommendation say awa governors wey dem elect and dia legislors for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of to dey waste scarce resources for anoda jamboree.
On top di issue of separatist agitation, modalities for convening referendum wey go dey spelt out for di constitution suppose dey
E dey almost sure say plenti Nigerians wan live togeda, awa differences, notwitstandin
Doing dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord.
Di Southern Governors dem don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Even say we get wahala like evri oda kontri, we need hear awasef, as di US President Joe Biden dey tok am.
Tomori dey live for Abuja
Dem kill two officers as IPOB militants set Anambra police station for fire
24 hours afta di commissioner of police for Anambra wey dem just appoint, Christopher Adetokumbo Owolabi, don resume duty, gunmen attack Obosi police station for Idemili North local goment area for di state and kil two officers.

E admit say besides di few customers wey dem get for Kano, dem rare to see dia tomato products for di local market for som reason.
Di first na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producing area
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey high pass wetin dem dey obtain normally for open market
So, essentially, pipo no dey look us, dem dey feel apprehensive of wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen u get product wey dey available, pipo go surely go for di cheaper brand
One farm dey feed di fish
Wen dem ask di average lifespan of dia tomato products, him tok say, if you give di tomato all wey e require, I mean nutritional supplements you feed am wit as e dey grow, if you give am all diz things, dis tomato fit last up three weeks post-harvest
But even if dem no am, e last for minimum of one week, no under any refrigeration, but surely e no dey under intense pressure and heat
You fit kip am for table wia you get beta ventilation.

Na former Champion dem be.
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey lead di Chelsea technical crew neva taste Champions League victory, im opponent for di Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner.
E win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
therefore, plenti tins dey to expect from di actors wey go dey out for there for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Wetin dey interesting be say, even if di two contestants dey parade na only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) Africa interest for di final don drop.
For Nigeria wia Chealsea and Manchester City dey enjoy plenty followin from passionate football fans, expectation don reach feverish point, e dey lead to interesting re-alignment
Fans of di European clubs wey dem eliminate from the Champions League for different stage don re-align demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interest
Bikos of wetin dey apun, di finals be one of di topic wey dem dey discuss pass for sporting circles for Nigeria wen fans of di Premiership clubs continue to dey predict wetin go be di final result
Howeva, while almost evribodi dey wait to swour di football artistry wey fi go dey display, some pundits dey worried by di increasein decline for di number of African players for di finals of one of di biggest football competition wey dey earth
To go by di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don contest and dem don win di trophy wit dia European clubs.
Sadly, African football legend like George Weah wey dem vote as World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Rashidi Yekini wey dey Nigeria, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila wey dey Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba wey dey Nigeria, Rigobert Song wey dey Cameroon and Hassam Hassan wey dey Egypt no win di Champions League even as dia football prowess dey.
Even say Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
E di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
Dem follow am by di Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria
two of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995
Dem don record say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon be di first African wey win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan
Oda African winner of di trophy wey dem dey highly coveted na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
To dey closer home, di last time wey Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta di former captain of di Super Eagles don dat thing, Nigeria don see di rise of oda immensely talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
but nobodi neva feature for di finals of Europe big club competition
Di reason wey make dem do am no dey farfetched
Di competition na hin dey dominate top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don fail to get into dis highly rated European clubs ova di years
Na,derfore, di hope for Nigeria football stakeholders say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all barriers and begin dey play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to dey live wit di agony to dey watch final of di UEFA Champions League kom and go without di presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club finals na few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londoners wey dey dey prime for di second itle and for football league wey dey wey dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner
