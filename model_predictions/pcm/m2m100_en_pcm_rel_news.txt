MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, tok am for one statement on Sunday.
Dis one follow a warning wey PFN issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoing constitutional review wey di Senate dey do
PFN and oda Christian groups dey fully aware say Shariah dey di South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842.
Dem dey practice Shariah for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court wey dey operate till 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem carry am go Agbongbon area for 1914
Dem apply Shariah for Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey kpeme for 1906
Even di seventh Akirun of Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (died 1912), institut Shariah for Ikirun for 1910
Dis na just examples of di existence and spread of Shariah for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.
E add say di PFN and oda Christians dey aware of di rising tide of Islamic awareness for di same South West and say dem dey only fear say di sleepin giant dey wake up to take back wetin belong to am.
E tok say awa Christian neighbours know well say Shariah na di Allah-given fundamental human right of muslims.

Dem dey use fair and foul means to dia objective
We dey call Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours
Like all aggressors dem, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence.
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last more dan hundred years, dem dey determined to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeathed to dem
Dem dey determined to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drive dem
Di Constitution Review Panel tell Nigerians say make dem forward dia views regarding wetin dem want for di konstitution.

Na attempt to Gag Muslims for di South West and e no go work
Hin tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery
Muslims for di region dey wake up dey beg for freedom
We demand a halt to di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law
We dey demand civil Shariah, no be criminal Shariah wey involve di cutin of hand but civil Shariah to regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anything to do wit Christian
He tok say; We go use all di peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to dis objective.

Nigerians for social media dey berate di federal goment and political actors for hin kilin
One commentator for di facebook link of di tori wey Daily Trust publish, Ifeanyi Maduako, wen e describe Gulak death as distasteful, link di incident wit politics.
Dis kilin dey very distasteful to me
E be like say political and dose wey dey behind am suppose dey unraveled.
Di kilin go expose those wey dey behind di current insecurity for Imo state.
Who invite am and why kil one northerner for Imo state?
I dey very afraid wetin fate dey wait for innocent Imo State pipo for di coming days for di hand of northern kontroled security agencies, e write.
Anoda commentator for di thread, Oloruntobi Micheal Omo, tok say: Di police report show say dis kilin na political and e dey call for in-depth investigation.
Police I think say dem get some question wey dem go answer
For hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write say di soul of awa innocent pipo dey important pass dis scam wey dem call Nigeria unity
Dis illiteracy no go acceptable for us, enough na we be peacemakers
But those dey push us to di wall say dem no fit sustain dis peacemaking again.

Buhari you failed us woefully, I dey tell Imo police say make dem confront di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write say, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent Fulani herder dem and now dey turn to northern goment officials and prominent politicians.
Di IPOB wey dey outlawed, for one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, fault report linking am to di murder of Gulak, noting say di assassination of politicians no dey part of im agenda.
We, therefore, state wey no get equivocation say IPOB no know anything about di assasination wey dem tok
For di first place, which threat di late Gulak constitute to awa kos to warrant hin elimination?
we no get anything in common wit am and we no fit kill am for any way
Pointing accusing fingers for IPOB for dis barbaric act na only to divert attention away from di real masterminds.
Dis na di same way terrorist dem for security uniform commit different atrocities for South East and turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global reputation.
Dis na smokescreen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans.
Instead of di security agencies to properly investigate di incident and possible factors, dem switch to accuse IPOB of a crime wey we no know anything about.
Did IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak to have waylaid am for airport?
Di group tok say security agencies suppose first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, and hin political opponents to establish dia possible involve
Those wey dey behind Gulak's murder no go dey unpunish

Ondo state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu describe di news of di assasination as very shocking and disturbing.
For one statement wey di governor personally sign, e tok say na one murder too many, dey describe di action as senseless and wicked.
Di perpetrators of dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri.
Dis contrivance suppose mislead, confuse and destroy.
E bears di unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on top setin di kontri on di path of conflagration.
Dem no suppose let dis criminals succeed
We wan use dis medium to express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma.
We advise am and oda governors dem for di South Eastern State say make dem brace up, make dem face di security wahala wey dey apun wey go end di bloodbath for di land.
Di enemy of di pipo dey always use di weapon of fear create disaffection for di polity
Dem calculate dis cowardly act to instigate Nigerians against each oda, especially Northerners, against di Igbo wey dey live outside South East.
We need confront di enemy dem of di pipo wit a view to neutralise dem.
Dis no be di time for political correctness.
Dem no suppose allow banditry subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all level.
We dey call all security agency make dem collaborate wit a view to unveilin di criminal elements wey dey sponsor and undertaking terrorist acts.
Dem go need punish dem severely.

We don draw di attention of di Office of di Vice President to one website:

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom dominating topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
Endin Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: di Livestock reform plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey find to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and to reduce herder-farmer conflict wey dey deadly
While di plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges.
Deficient political leadership, popular misperception about im purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by di COVID-19 pandemic, lack of personnel wit di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, dey hinder progress.
If di plan fail as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Approved by di National Economic Council for January 2019, di Plan represent di comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict wey dey between herder dem and farmers.
E dey animated by di hope say ova a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go dey persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breedingg farms and oda livestock management practices na to bolster di sectors productivity.
By di end of 2028, authorities get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all di participatin states, wey dey create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processin and marketing chain.
President Muhammadu Buhari administation kom up wit di Plan afta a wave of violence wey dey between herder dem and farmers, a surge for related violence wey dey afflict rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don commit to fund 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participatin states submit, don take preliminary steps toward puttin di Plan into practice, including providing technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like help wit field surveys and site maping.
Plenty states don reactivate di first demarcated grazing reserves, open offices and set up steering committee to administer di Plan.
Authorities don also do workshops and do oda works to explain di benefits of livestock reform to large audience
But two years inside di 10-year plan, dem neva build di first new ranch, and obstacles plenti.
Opposition, partly among herder dem, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plan benefit to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes over land between herder dem and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget dey pinched, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri lack sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups na to dey cut off access to grazing reserves and to dey fear away potential investors.
Unless dem address dem, dis and oda problem fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, kom leave di kontri wey dey vulnerable to escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To tackle dis challenges require a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgiving and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey dem go ask to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately doubt di Plan promise about available pasture
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Plenti pipo for di Middle Belt and southern states dey deeply suspicious of di plan long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privilege for herder dem, and more broadly, di Fulani.
wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment need build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processin
Federal and state goment suppose also up budgetary commitments, hasten di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, work wit donors and investor as necessary
To dey address rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities wey earlier violence dey affect for participatin states dey vital
plus, authorities go need consider climate change wey fit impact and reach a decision about how di transhumant herder dem wey cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from di Plan
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plan proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible result on a relatively short-term basis.
less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to be able to produce clear proof of hin benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors dey ineligible to compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
ideally, by di time campaignin heats up for late 2022, di Plan backers suppose dey point to at least a handful of ranches wey dem just construct or reserves wey dem rehabilitate, strong donor and investor commitment, and di first of a cadre of livestock management professionals wey dem just train
No one of dis go dey easy, but di plan dey worth di effort
While far from perfect, e offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di needs of herder dem and small scale farmers
Around 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity overall at di same time say e take a big step toward resolvin one of Nigeria dangerous conflicts.
wit di clock ticking down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need to move quickly to make a visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity be lost
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to hasten its implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kind problem wey I get with di king
una no agree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na small holders wey dey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dey held back from participating more actively for commercial oriented agriculture wit a variety of constraints.
No energy for anybodi wey no dey happy for me
Na my own / my own
Dis dey bring me to di conclusion say evryone na evil
Dem don characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey generally small, dem dey always hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dey marginal or risk-prone environments
Yield dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase yield.
we dey tok about life and prosperity to today
send your account number
Di emphasis now na on top agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as enterprise
I know eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yield wey di smallholder farmers dey get dey really profitable
Una dey kom?
Dis wahala wey dey emerge dey lead many smallholder farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower-risk and lower-yieldin agricultural activities.
You be witch?
I dey way to sabo market to buy food stuff
make I call my papa
As developing kontri populations dey grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go apun for rapidly changing agri-food value chain
far wetin be, make I dey on my way?
Dis developments dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodology.
di loan sharks dey for hin neck
dis kind thin
I dey errand from my work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers plenti battle for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders wey dey di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers go dey contend wit.
Di agricultural sector dey face plenti challenge wey range from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time wey dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crop and wet season farmers dey about to start di cultivation.
Many farmers no fit access dia farm while for odas to get labourers to harvest dia farm bikos mechanization na huge challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem be di problem.
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus locked down market don scatter di rural economy.
plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so dem go fit buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer bikom so high dat plenti smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go high as N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey wey dey wey dey wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia di price don rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places.
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activities no only deny dem access to dia farm but leave plenti kil for dia farm
Many farming communities na hin dey raze down
Dem kidnapp plenti pipo for ransom
Many pipo dey pay plenti moni or dey surrender plenti portion of dia harvest to di bandit
Plenti village for dose states don bikom desolate
Di agric sector also witness one of di worst disaster wen flood whip out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize field wey dem estimate at ova N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states
Many of di affected farmers neva dey compensate as dem destroy dia livelihood
Di flood na di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Nigeria coastal cities and flood-prone areas wey dey kil pipo and washing away farmlands.
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey face drought
For two months, farmers see helplessly as dia investment in crop wey dem carry away
No disguise
Anoda subsector wey dem badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos price to increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria to send a save our Soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention.
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers plus to grant some of di big players license to import about 222 metric ton of maize to increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na just short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean struck, making di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut down completely.
Di scarcity result for one serious feed crisis for di industry as price don reach record high for hin history as e dey rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now
Di poultry industry don lose estimated N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem project to reach 10 million by January 2021 wen di loss for investment dey estimated conservatively at about N1.5 trillion.
As di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marry di subsector, di crop farmers despite di daunting challenges wey confront di sector for di 2020 farmin year, don buyers kom right up to dia farm even before dem harvest to make bulk purchase arrangement.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refusing to kom down for harvest time, wey dey cause fear of looming hunger and di call for di borders to dey reopen, wey go allow influx of smuggled products through di kontri's porous borders.
The name of the lord na strong tower

E also tell di goverment, for di interim, make dem enforce ban on export of soya, seed and processed soya bean meal.
E tell governors dem for di region say make dem put plenti effort to di cultivation of maize as dem don do wit rice
Odunsi tok say dem need strong collaboration among maize farmers for Nigeria, soya bean farmers and odas.
E tok say acute scarcity and astronomical price of soya beans and maize go threaten additional five million poultry jobs for di short term if di goverment no intervene.
Today, dem dey sell maize for N210, 000/MT for most states of South-West, soya meal N240, 000/MT
Sake of di importance of dis two items, di price of poultry feed don dey increase from N2750 to N3000 for April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now.
For December, most farmers no fit sell dia broilers bikos di cost of production dey high pass wetin an average Nigerian fit afford
currently, egg dey go out of di reach of an average family wit ideal price at N1,300
So we really need goment intervention to save di current 10million jobs for di poultry value chain of awa economy

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy trends dey for di public domain, as Southern governors dey slamming a ban on it durin dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN) and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, examine how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di governors for Southern State meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminalities.
Wetin be your take on top di controversy wey dis decision generate?
Evri human being get right to action and opinions.
But di one wey important pass be say once you take your action, you suppose dey aware of di consequences.
Make u fit consider di advantages and disadvantages.
I no be one of di one wey tok say e dey good or bad
As Nigerian, you get di right and liberty to live anywhere for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association
On dis basis, I no go tok say e be good tin.
But as a leader for di North Central, I go tok say na good tin, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefit for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am a real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herder dem, no matter di numba wey fit troop from di South to di North Central
Wetin be una position on top open grazing?
I no be one of di propagator of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as individual
I believe say if we take to ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching.
Dis kind move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products
And den e go bikom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herder dem and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenges wey di Fulani herder dem dey pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on di advantage wey dey
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem go need dey well educated to embrace ranching.
We fit adopt Kenya method, wia almost all di family get ranches and una no see open grazing despite di large numba of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for be dat?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no dey call for ranching and for di federal goment make dem kom inside
wetin dem dey tok be say di herder dem don bikom problem to us and make dem go away
Dem tok say make di herder dem apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don ask dia indigenes say make dem apply for land like herder dem?
As one of those wey dey involve for youth empowerment programmes, especially for di agricultural sector and im value chain, why some goment policy dey fail to realise dia objective and wetin be di way out?
Firstly, administation no dey wey don fit touch di lives of individuals like President Muhammadu Buhari's administation whereby you fit conveniently sit for your house and apply for facilities and you fit get dem
Di credit facility wey dem dey target na COVID-19 loan
Many Nigerians don get di loan for hundred thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house and dem no even go office.
Also, wit SMEs wey dem dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two side of dose wey go believe in you and dose wey go criticise you.
so, for dose wey no believe in Buhari's administation, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we dey thank God for it

Passage of forensic Bill by National Assembly: E dey relevant to Buhari's fight against corruption
Di National Assembly of di Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th
May 2021 for di House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 for di Senate make history by passin into law, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.
791), afta dem read am for di Third Time in both Chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, wey dey target to strenghin and re-invigoratin national frontiers in di fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, wey don eaten deep into di fabric of awa nation.
wit di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguish and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly, e ardent resolve to carry out im legislative functions in line wit di provision of di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.
And dis also show say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great joy and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dem don put togeda as platform for us make we let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on top so we go fit complement national efforts for im quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and cyber-crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di Senate don pass dis Bill, and in view of di fact say we dey operate a bi-cameral Legislature, di house of Representatives wey dey ready and resilient, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di hon
Speaker follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you fit know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di bill wey dem attack and antagonise pass for di National Assembly for recent time.
Sadly di attack kom from dose wey suppose be partners in progress in di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don rather designate demsef as enemy of di general good
Good is good e no get substitute so e also bad
No matter how e take long, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e take apun for di National Assembly
Interestingly, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) dem first pass into law by di 9th Senate on the 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dem don undergone di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 dem unanimously pass into law by di Naija Senate afta dem don consider deeply di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no be witout series of thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop at any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful to assist di Buhari administration to fight corruption no see di light of di day but di senate don stand and e don see am through.
E dey very important for di public to know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but new one for Nigeria wey dey target to bridge di gap wey don dey long exist for di forensics space.
Today, di journey to get a standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-goverment bodi wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no be doubt, na clear demonstration of e patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national effort wey dey towards di fight against corruption, wey don hinder development for evri aspect of awa national life.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, koming for a time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
dat go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di world
As all of us know, crime generally, don take new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century.
So, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging global reality and ever-ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey apposite to also tok say di journey, wey culminate inside di passage of dis Bill, start for di 8th National Assembly whereby, awa Bill dey sponsor by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen im be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administation.
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers durin di 8th National Assembly, all inclusive public hearings na hin dey conduct by di relevant Committee of di respective Chambers
Afta and even wit opposition from stakeholders wey dey minority, wey di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead, di National Assembly pass di Bill, in view of im significance and di part e go play for di fight against corruption.
Afta, dem send di Bill give Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
Na di strength of dis, say dem introduce di Bill again for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya sponsor am, di current Leader of di Senate, in view of di importance wey dey attached to am.
We dey constrained to make dis clarification so we go fit clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propell say awa Bill na hin 8th National Assembly reject
Also worthy to mention na di fact say awa Bill don dey mistaken for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di Senate and di House of Representatives Chambers
Dis Bills, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem be merely duplication of di intent and purport of awa Bill
We suppose stress am say dem no introduce any of dis Bill for di 8th National Assembly, anoda dan our Bill.
As such, we be di first wey dey kom up wit bill of dis magnitude(Forensic)
wey don see di urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
Dem take di decision to establish di Institute afta one painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how well dem don help in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey since 2009
And ova di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go target to inculcate di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, weda kos by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacity, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
Una go agree wit me say for today world, di conventional ways wey we go use investigate crimes, wit a view to fight am don bikom obsolete
As such, for us as a nation to do something wey dey meaningful for dis regard, e dey perfect say we align awasef wit di global trend and innovations wey dey emerge, wey dey target for fighting corruption.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say dem conceive di idea to establish dis institute wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administation.
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill hia
Howeva, I wish to crave your indulgence to highlight some of di objective of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis special field,throughdia systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in di use of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in di investigation of fraud for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standard, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners for di farm, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and also develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of one special operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri make dem no dey spend im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigation for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals like Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit world best practices; and
To enhance Naija anti-fraud mechanism,throughdia provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Naija, among odas.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey relevant to tok again say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standard
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focus point of di Institute include but e no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accountin; forensic nursin; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic languageistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Also, una go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity wit international best practices.
Dis concept dey beyond di reasoning of those whose myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia sense of reasoning, bikos of narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw attention of evribodi to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out strongly to oppose im passage bikos according to dem, e be unnecessary duplication of functions wey dia Institute don already undertaken.
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and afta we don see di overwhelming and accelerate legislative supports, awa Bill don receive from di two Chamber, ICAN don realize say forensic science na one special field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce a similar Bill wey dey currently befor di House of Representatives, afta dem failed woefully in dia attempts to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN hold di view say dem no suppose dey any institute wey dey regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as my
I wish also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no dey commot for dis funny theatrical episode
Just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don introduce Bill for House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey ANAN initiate and dey promote
I decide to bring out all dis facts so Nigerians and even di international communities go understand di extent wey some pipo fit go so dem go dia aims
Howeva, we no dey perturbe by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency make dem do wetin dey right and make dem no allow dem manipulate dem for any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as dem no make mockery of di whole thin.
Di known practical and antagonist of dis bill don remain ICAN bikos say e don bikom evident
Dem engage several bystanders into writing frivolous petition some even target for di leadership of di senate wit a tone of blackmail
As dem failed woefully for di senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders write all kin publication.
yet again, dem fail
Ordinaryly by legislative procedure, a bill wey di Senate don pass go only require concurrrence by di House safe for wia observation dey
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth dey prevail and for di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persins wey dey seek to becom Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) na im House of Representative send am into law.
ICAN don register im Bill for House of Representatives wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Dis ICAN new bill get in it full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead such persin to some years in prison.
Dis dey strange for kontri wey get enlightened pipo full
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level of corruption wey dey
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives
Make we note am say, awa challenge di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians make dia antiks deceive dem
You go remember how ICAN strongly opposed dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of its publications wey di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey dey led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on di 24th May, 2019 don make frantic effort to tok say ICAN under im enable laws dey empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to dey pass it go amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present im ACT to dey repeal and re-enacted wit di inclusion of Forensics in di new law.
Di question be, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey seek for hin re-enactment
As e dey always be, while we no dey opposed to any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for hin law, we dey howeva concerned dat bodi no suppose try to perpetuate esef
ICAN and dia cohort don realize dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so dem wan get bodi for inside demsef
Wetin dem dey fear na checks and balance, dem no go want make anoda professional bodi investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
How dem fit wan be judge for dia case?
Dis sound strange
For dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly make dem beware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit dey tok from both side of dia mouth and make dem expect say di National Assembly go dey cajoled.
We wan yet again appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly in ensuring say di Bill don pass, di Nigerian pipo dey more dan before convinced of di readiness of dis administration to fight corruption through evri possible means and go at all encourage legislation wey dey aim to dis goal.
We dey sure say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate to assent to dis bill as e reach hin desk
We dey call all Nigerians make dem kom and be part of di Forensics Profession
Di profession dey open for all professionals wey dey different field of endeavours
One trainin arm of di institute dey wey go guide you and equip you
I wish to thank all of una and to kom tok again awa resolve and commitment to uphold ethical standard in line wit global best practices, in rendering awa professional services and trainin wey go bring about innovative ways wey dem go use fight corruption and financial crimes, generally.
I wish to appeal to all stakeholder and well-meaning Nigerians make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore us all make we make frantic efforts so dat collectively, we fit surmount di threat of corruption, di plethora of security challenges, across di kontri and oda associated crises.

LG polls: Protest ova imposition of APC candidates
Some members of di All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ogun State don stage a protest against di party's adoption of consensus candidature for some local goment areas ahead of di July 24, local goment election for di state.
Di top echelon of di parti don announce say di party go adopt consensus candidates for some local goment areas wen dem go conduct direct or indirect primary polls for di emergence of candidates for some.
Di protesters wey storm di secretariat of di Naija Union of Jornalists (NUJ), Ogun State, accuse some leaders of di APC for Abeokuta South LGA say dem dey impose chairmanship candidate on dem.
Dem carry place wey get different inscriptions like We Say No To Money Bags
for Abeokuta South and
Make parti Members Pick Who Dey Want, kom tok say dia aspirant wey dem prefer na Farouk Akintunde
One of di parti leader wey lead di protest, Balogun Ololade, tell Gov Dapo Abiodun make e intervene for di mata to save democracy from jeopardy.
Wey dey between DSS and regional separatist
repeated warning by di DSS to pipo and groups whose outterance and activities persistently constitute provocative disruption of di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, dey begin to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingerin question about who or which persins and groups di security agency dey refer to were promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outburst of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Ihe Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E don start on top all say indeed na di persins and groups wey dey kontinue to dey use incitin, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against unaself in order to apparently inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS charged in one of its warnings.
Interestingly, no one of dis prime suspects for di exploitation of some fault lines wey go kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance imsef from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency see.
Dem kos common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, differing only for di respective directions of dia accusing fingers.
As Afenifere don return dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehashed im grouse about plenti pipo wey dey feel say dem dey alienated and ACF feign ignorance, dey ask who be di pipo?
Since di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, make dem dey proactive to deal wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crises and dem know dem; dem suppose treat dem according to di law
Una no need to know wetin di DSS know about all dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem know say DSS know dem even say dem insist on to dey pass di buck outside dia cliques.
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics know of no beta solution to Nigeria myriad problem than for dia sectional enclave and chiefs to lord am ova di rest of di kontri as rulers, no be leaders
So desperate and unscrupulous be dem in pursuing dia inordinate ambition say dem dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all e take to excisin di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease to dey cut dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to inordinate ambition of persins or groups restlessly undermining aspiration of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, e dey easier than done.
Dis regional groups dey constitute major hindrances to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag independence.
As long as dem continue to dey parade di political terrain as ethnic champion, so tey dem go see Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake for di population, make dem claim am or seize am and, if all di oda fail, deconstructed and disowned as a failed state.
Anytime wey dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria's progress and development, unless im leadership dey firmly for dia sense, anodawise e dey about heckling and jostling around wit barely hide determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene president.
Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda undeniable indictment of dis regional separatist be say dem be self-styled political pressure groups masqueradin as representatives of various ethnic groups.
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consists of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency dey give dem impetus to kom togeda, desperate to remain relevant for democratic system wey dey run entirely by elected representatives through registered political parties wit legislative and executive institutions wey dem constitutionally establish to dispense good governance and dividend of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem persist in acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey threaten and attempt, so, perchance, dem fit regain political relevance if dem no dey kontrol.
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetin dey trigger security alerts
As dat kind predator-politicians dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent to undermining an elected goment just bikos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest go dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robber dem, bandits and ally terrorist dem, combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.
double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of di Buhari administration having to contend wit such array of formidable fees unleashing incessant attack on national security for a time of unprecedented economic adversity
To dat extent, na only two groups of politicians fit dey: dose wey dey participate positively for di democratic dispensation as partner in moving di nation forward against all odds and dose wey dey negatively engaged in plantin seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
By dia utterance and activities, all of us know dem
At di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens whose condition of survival no dey determin by and no depend on di geography of dia origin
Dia struggle to eke a living dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland wey dem go remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get oda kontri to call dia own, collectively showing how citizenship breeds true patriotism.
Dem too know say Afenifere, Ihe Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against unaself in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambitions of dia leaders.
Na im make di poor man prayer remain:
GOD DEY
NIGERIA GO BETTER

Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
female Nigerians dey face wit bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to express dia faith without discrimination; even though say di school fit get dia defence for taking dat kind position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians wiava or weneva dem dey threatened wit discrimination based on dia faith.
Running through di argument of di proprietors of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, one could easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim pikin suppose go oda schools for anoda place if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey dey dis argument dey plenti
First, to tok say Muslim student suppose go anoda place unless dey conform to di school rule on uniform dey very small to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: e dey justifiable to base a school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Den, thirdly, di go elsewia argument dey look to ignore di difficulties in changing a school for a pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of changing schools for a pikin, educational psychologists go tell you, interferes negatively wit no be only im emotional but academic development too.
Last last, di Christian faith schools by demsef risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization by concentrating students wit di same religious beliefs for particular schools
Di social cost dis exacts on top di society dey enormous
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say im policy to allow Muslim schoolgirls wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony anchored on mutual respect and understanding.
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable is to deny a Nigerian pikin access to school of hin choice on di basis of di manifestation of hin religion?
Na big concern bikos Nigeria dey signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E contain 30 articles on top right and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political right, like di right to life, free speech and privacy.
E also include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find articles 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey relevant to di issue under consideration and quote dem for full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get di freedom to think or believe wetin dem want, plus di right to religious belief
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to dey practice awa religion for public or privately, alone or wit odas.
Evrione get di right to go education
Primary schooling suppose dey free
Make all of us fit continue awa study as we wish
For school, dem suppose help us develop awa talents, and dem suppose teach us understand and respect for evribodi human rights.
Dem suppose also teach us make we dey get on top wit odas weda dia tribe, religion, or kontri dem kom from.
awa parents get di right to choose which kind school we go
Dis kind of law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for House of Representatives for di US wearing her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey be U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal konstituency of Niger State, Hon sponsor.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors make dem no dey discriminate against persins, students or personnel based on dia religious belief or its manifestation.
Wen pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or those executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am becloud dia sense of judgment.
Di law suppose be welcome development
afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document as we explain am above
E dey in line wit similar laws wey don pass recently for di kontri wey dey seek to tackle social threat and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persins Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability dey find to eradicate all form of discrimination based on pesin disabilities, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for a time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social threats wey dey affect awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no be becos dem no get prior generic law wey cover dem but becos dem need to address dem more comprehensively make dem no leave room for opacity.
While UDHR fit be like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like e dey provide to allocate punishment for offenders.
Contrary to di view of hin critic, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing dey to show attempt to seek di enthronement of a state religion for any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di goment of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State Religion.
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public to respect di right of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public spaces smacks of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female hin religious freedom negates awa multicultural pretenses
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey for Nigeria's constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
A bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimations based on religious ground, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

Di Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) don warn against trading under high-tension wire to avoid disaster
Chief Operatin Officer (COO), Engr John Ayodele, give di charge against di backdrop of di increasing trading activities under high tension wires.

Police dey go afta newspaper vendors dem ova reports on IPOB
Di police don harass di magazine vendors and readers for Aba, di commercial hub for Abia State.
Daily Trust gather since di weekend, policemen from di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers ova reports on di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents tok say tension dey Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raided di place on Sunday.
One eyewitness tok say residents scamper for safety, as police officers shot sporadically, as dem dey try arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
Dem accuse di vendors say dem dey distribute newspapers wey get tori for di sit-at-home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, beg di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so e no go create crisis for di city.
Di kind pipo wey we put inside police dis days dey make me wonder if we really want anythin good out of dis kontri wey dem dey call Nigeria
How persin fit dey find newspaper sellers around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo to dey read hard copies of newspapers, you go also stop dem to dey read di same tori for facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, and odas?
How primitive policing be dis?
Dem kos panic on Sunday by dia shooting and noisemakin
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey find kidnappers.
Na later we discover say police kom arrest a vendor and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspaper vendors dem?
Which kind problem paper fit kos say Social Media no fit kos 20 times ova
Hin tok say dis pipo no be normal
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident, tok say almost all di stands wey e visit for Aba
on Tuesday dey empty
Hin tok say, we hear say dem dey tok on Saturday and Sunday say di newspaper had tori on di sit at home order in honour of Biafra heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit am
Di early political leaders for South East dey remind dis police officers say Biafra big pass IPOB wey dey beta for dem
IPOB proscription mean say Biafra don dey proscribed too?
All of us be Biafrans
For di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold a zoom conversation, dey tok about Biafran fall heroes
why police no fit go to YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey ayred am?
wetin dem do na to kom street kom start dey look for unnecessary trouble
I wish say di leaders for Igboland go warn those police officers say make dem no allow wetin dey apun for Imo State enter Aba, bikos e go worst for everybodi.
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna wey be Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) deny say di police don arrest newspaper vendors and readers for Aba.
NAMA don kil as air traffic controlers dey lament bad tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don draw out ova dilapidated navigational equipment for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation pose threat to air safety
Dem also claim say Kaduna International Airport no get any kontrol tower wey go help safe aircraft navigation.
Di president of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and e no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controlers.
E tok say oda airports for di kontri lack di necessary equipment for seamless navigation.
E explain say some airports no get functioning equipment
Even Kaduna no get control tower.
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we don dey call on top di goverment make dem do somethin.
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controlers go look for umbrellas wey go sit for di control tower, and wetin be, dem ced some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings to FAAN, while na only those wey dey stand dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication for here and der
Calabar dey there; airport no dey wey you go go go reach today say you go say thins dey work for 80 per cent
NAMA recently employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall.
Howeva, di Managing Director of di Naija Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
E tok say di federal goment don invest hugely for improving navigational aids and to dey help safe flight operations.
Hin tok say, na mere politics
Di goverment don spend plenti time for di recent past to dey improve aviation infrastructure
I dey tok am no be bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If you wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always be, ask di pipo for street, ask di pipo for NAMA, dem go tell you say dem neva get am so good under dis administation.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
we neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two in place, two odas dey kom
goment don spend N1.7bn on top one mobile control tower
Also dey go ongoing revitalisation of di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system
Oda sectors suppose dey jealous us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce refers to di use of communications technology di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and language and isolated by di national differences in goment regulations.
E-commerce dey foster direct access to distant market and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and e dey blur many of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e dey practically impossible to determine di origin of di product
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communications platform, all information or services wey company fit offer to customers ova di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
Di major significance of e-commerce dey for di fact say e dey encourage one single world trading system, wey dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole.
Dem don do plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis studies na of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system lag behind ICT-based legislation and say di statutory laws wey dey exist dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenti more.
There be, therefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime.
Dem don tok am well say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of Draft Bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say even for di place wey dem pass dis bills into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Sake of di speed wey internet dey permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best wey dem fit suggest na say di legal issues and problems wey presently dey face e-commerce for di kontri suppose dey address directly and quick, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To am, di National Assembly suppose dey pressureSed into passing bill concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so dat dem fit enact dem into law as quick as possible
For di interim, awa court suppose take giant stride by interpreting di existing traditional laws liberally so as to bridge di gap therein in order to make dat kind laws amenable to electronic transactions, especially for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
Indeed, dem argue say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit facilitate electronic transaction and attendant documentation legally
Di court fit adapt to recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract
As di Justice Bingham tok am once: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility [as di law merchant] wey dey adapt itssef to di changein needs of di general public; principles no dey alter, but old rules of applying di change, and new rules wey dey spring into existence.
E dey hope say oda Nigerian judges go adopt dis judicial activism, Supreme Court justice inclusive, especially for di areas wia awa existing legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advancements.
Dis go set a good precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di germane issues wit regards to contracts for E-commerce na documentation and signature
The Law wey dey paragraph 4 of the Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law reform (Contract) Law and the different different law wey we get about property and property, all of dem suppose write some contract and execute am well.
Question be say electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of a contract by email and be binding
Plenti of dis issues still no dey quite settle even for UK although some decisions dey favourable towards interpreting electronic signature
so mark for e-mail as satisfying di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transactions na transactions wey dem make through magnetic materials like tapes or disc
Dis dey in contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dey embodied for permanent form and typically expressed for word and figure usually authenticated by signatures
Dem no fit change dat kind transactions if dem no change di face of di document.
wit respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, one electronic signature wey dey relate to a data message conveniently satisfy any requirement for a handwritten signature so far e sufficiently identify one electronic record to di individual
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
so, for di purpose of establish proof of electronic signatures
Di use of di password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
Dis one fit safely posit say electronic signatures for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence if dem certified and incorporate am for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenges wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element for a valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relationship.
Di question na for which point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how dem fit differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for which point dem fit tok say dem get intention to enter legal relationship?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction say dem neva alter order or invoice wey dem send from who dem appear to be
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
Last last, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce na aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time
Di goment suppose go beyond creating laws, to activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for im commercial interaction and for delivery of goverment services.

Chad don pass new charter wey im name na Deby's son president
Chad don pass charter declaring Mahamat Idriss Deby president, despite rumours of hin death trending on social media
Mahamat take over in place of hin papa, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey on Tuesday na swiftly nameed transitional leader as head of military council afta hin papa's death, go occupy di functions of di president of di republic and also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter repeal di constitution wey dey preceding and dem go implement am as di basic law of di republic, according to hin terms
Dem don call di younger Deby supreme head of di armed forces, e tok.
Deby pikin don dey overse hin papa's security as head of di elite presidential guard and e don dey always appear alongside am
Mahamat Deby dey best known as a top commander of di Chadian forces assisting a United Nations peacekeepin mission for di restive north of neighbourin Mali
Hin sign decree on Tuesday wey dey set out military council wit 15 generals, plus hinsef and 14 odas wey dem know say dem don dey part of di late president's circle of loyalists
Di council dey work wit 18-month transition toward free and democratic election
Accordin to di charter, Mahamat Idriss Deby sef dey chair di military transition council, di council of ministers, di councils and superior committees of national defence.
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat.
Di Transition Charter, wey get 95 articles, also guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship
Dem don set up transition goment, whose members na hin di new president name
Di members of di army wey dem dey call to di transition goment dey discharge from all military duties, di charter tok.
Chadian law
Di military announce am on Tuesday say di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for almost 30 years, do wound wey dem suffer wen dem visit di battlefield for di kontri's north wia Chadian soldiers fight wit a rebel group.
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce a 6pm curfew and close di kontri's borders, as dem dey suspend di konstitution and dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over in di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose don take power afta Deby die, no be im pikin.
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case e die, den di speaker of di parliament go take charge of di kontri for 40 days and dem go do a transition until dem do elections, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am earlier on Tuesday.
[But] di military don announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and dem don also dissolve di konstitution, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di konstitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction afta dem brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by him FA for di team failure to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, dem don see pants down for seven hot-tempered rows wit opponents
Di recent brawl durin clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League team
Last week match between Chelsea and Leicester na hin dey marry by skirmishes wey dey between di players of both teams
As e dey quote similar offence for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea.
Dem don charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff wey follow Ricardo Pereira's challenge for Ben Chilwell
For 2016, dem charged Chelsea for indiscipline say dem suppose warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part for mass bust-up durin a match against Tottenham.
If affect am, di point deduction go affect dia season significantly as dem go enta final campaign for top four spot.
Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and ova hia
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo kom get of di thousands of America GIs stationed for different military bases for Britain during di Second World War.
Di gom-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldier dem dey always get inside pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey kom build up a feeling of disdain for di Yanks wey dey among di locals
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldiers evriwia for di hundred of America military bases overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for di Philippines.
Na why I dey perturbed, like plenti Nigerians, say for one virtual meetin last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari don report say e don ask say di United States dey consider to relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military presently based for di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
Dem dey presume am say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite numba, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go then transmit di details afta to di president
Yes, America be superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and dem suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances.
Understandably, Nigeria dey face gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey be like say dey defy di best efforts of goment and di nation's security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all ova di kontri and di target killin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians coupled wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity wey dey destroy di kontri now.
But even for dat one, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigerian soil wen we consider against di various issues and implication of dis move to Nigeria dey hardly justified
Africom na one of di nine command wey di American military establishment use exclusively serve America strategic interest around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, especially those outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues of dia area of coverage.
Dem dey do am only wen dat kind issues affect American interests for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no dey mandate to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies.
If dem set Africom for Nigeria for instance, e go be island of im own restricting access to Nigerians of all category and establish a jurisdiction wey dey within di territorial area of di base wey go virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to contain di growin strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa record of peace kipin around di world.
Africom precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria's strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make many secret and open visits to a number of African kontris to sell di idea.
But bikos Nigeria na di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, go be di coordinatin base of di ACRI and though say dem tout am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocols were unmistakably military and strategically targeted for Nigeria.
due mainly to undisguise hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to see di Americans wey dey try to butt into area e consider its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di ACRI concept
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by di American congress for secret session, di Americans consider and realize di need to set up African command to add to di oda command wey don already dey place cover di various continents of di world.
So, based on di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of America political and security establishments, Africom na hin dey set up by di Bush junior administration wit a wide mandate wey no go just contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on di growin Chinese strategic penetration of Africa
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey base for Florida, na to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey base for Stuttgart, Germany, na to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), wey also dey base for Florida, na to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Nigeria don dey surround by French military presence for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans sef get drone base for Niger
To add Africom join di mix for Nigeria go be total capitulation of awa strategic interest for France and America
Bearing in mind say awa strategic interests and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent of letting in di wolf into di chicken coop
Nothing dey for di insecurity wahala wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for dose kontri dem from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldier dem wey distinguish demsef for dose operations.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, wey don fall from di high standard wey we know am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capacity to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dey so willing
But even as awa circumstances be arm-twisted into hosting di Africom in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interests, on awa soil.
Plateau don target 7m metric ton of irish potato even as e get wahala.
Plateau State na di number one grower of Irish potato wey dem dey produce for nine of di 17 local goment area wey dey di state.
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri wit kontris like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and odas wey dey receive plenti supply of potato from Nigeria
Di large potato production from Plateau State, according to wetin PotatoPRO.com tok, one of di leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth biggest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say inadequate dams and road networks, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to dey pose a major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export.
Oda challenges wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wiltes as well as poor seedlings.
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 states wey poor pass for Nigeria wit poverty rate wey pass 70%
Di state get comparative advantage to boost economic activities by improving di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain
Thomas Muopshin wey be di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project tok say di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment areas wey be Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di state's potato hub.
Dem dey produce more potatoes dan any LGA for di kontri
Muopshin, tok say adaptability research show say di eight LGA wey remain for di state dey veriable to produce potato; making all of Plateau's 17 LGA potentials to produce di tuber, especially for dry season.
Di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state, tok say unless dem address di wahala wey dey affect di value chain squarely, increased production and export for potato go continue to elude di nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for interview wit Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor road and high cost of farm inputs, continue to dey affect potato outputs.
E tok say di cost of mechanized farming wey fit increase productivity don bikom expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to afford mechanization.
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water during dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield.
bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey search for borehole place to farm to access irrigation water for dia farm
Martha kom explain say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent many farmers make dem no dey improve quantity and quality of yield, e kom add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output.
Di cost sef dey prevent many of us make we no expand di business
So, to get fertiliser no dey easy for us

Di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and na direct attack against di rule of law wey we, di citizens of di European Union, don democratically build up, while we dey constituting lack of respect toward di authority of di court of justice demsef.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi na hin dem arrest for June 2020 for Dubai for di alleged money laundering from business email compromise fraud and oda scams wey target firms and one English premier league club
E make a total sum of $435 million afta e defraudin 1,926,400 victims.
A year afta, Abidemi Rufai ( wey dem also call Sandy Tangâ), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun na hin Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrest for John F Kennedy Airport for New York on top a criminal complaint of defraudin Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di moni wey dem thief na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fit don suffer job losses as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster wey go dey Nigeria's Federal House of Representative making laws if e neva lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Konstituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di Peoples Democratic parti (PDP).
Dem perpetrated di fraud as dem thief di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem filing falsified claim wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem thief, dem create separate e-mail account so dat di claim go dey associated wit different pipo and e go fit escape automatic fraud detection system
Afta, dem pay more dan $288,000 inside im American bank account between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime na global threat to individuals, organisations and kontries.
Nigeria dey lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year
By di end of 2021, di world go don lose a total of $6 trillion
Till date, ova 40 Nigerians don dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai tok say unemployment benefit fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Dis na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on top di loopholes wey di COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisations
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia fraud along di intervention from goment and private sectors and scam many and some of dis schemes still dey till date.
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among odas
As di pipo dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngster dey do am for inside Nigeria.
Di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey always arrest dem, judge dem and convict dem
Understanding di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment in fighting di crime
Di family na di microcosm of di larger society
Na di place wey normal human being suppose nurture for di society
Apart from say plenti Nigerian family dey di dungeon of poverty and dem no fit take care of dia pikin, some of dis pikin don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegal
E get challenge wit ethical behaviour training for many house as dem dey arrest parents wit dia pikin dem wey dey involve for cyber-criminality
For anoda place, mama of yahoo boys dey form association to celebrate dia sons success and justify dia criminal behaviours.
For di religious setting, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalists dey create house and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Viral video dey wey dem show some boys say dem dey spread moni while dose wey be shepherds for one suppose white cloth church enjoy di moment wen di captive members for di church, wey dem lead by dia female youth wing record di shameful scene.
One pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria kom back to democracy dey 21 years old now
sadly, dem grow up to appreciate liein as a way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many cases from house) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and dem no fulfil or jettison di campaign promises
Lyinsef na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Youths dey socialise to corruption and fraud by dose wey dey hold public office
Dem dey see how dia system dey provide soft landing for fraudulent persins ( public or private).
Dem dey ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don dey fully investigated and discharge dem wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty?
Di majority of di case wey end wit off-di-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as a family affair
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyles as dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how once poor aspirant for politics don turn to millionaires within months of inauguration
Dem dey see how traditional institutions don bikom cash and dey carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, award undeserving honours in exchange for moni
All pipo wey dey mismanage moni dey provided wit soft landing
Added to dis list of culture wey nurturin cybercrimes be di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work and game wey evribodi dey involved in and no be crime.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, dem go make law against di crime wey dem dey involve
Di process to dey give parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders suppose dey review if we go stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products into awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni dey dangled for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for dubious characters to cover up dia track and awa society dey worse off through dia action
Greed dey nurture cyber-criminality
Di FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem alleged to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers.
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and expect grace to abound
Nigeria need sanitise im anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey dey track lifestyle wit material accumulation.
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria as we dey create employment opportunities, dey reduce poverty and dey review reward systems.
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspects as di FBI do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless di culture wey dey support cybercrimes for Nigeria dey tackled through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester

How e dey feel to give birth durin di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
When news of death dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
For January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red lines change my life
I dey pregnant and dey hapi
Na amazing start to a new year
Na di year wey dey remarkable pass for my life
All of sudden, everything change
Dem born my daughter Roshomon Tara for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, for Bangladesh; she don dey nine months old
na she be di reason why I bikom mother for di middle of global crisis
No be only her wey dem born, but na also new me, mama of Tara, wey spend all di pregnancy for lockdown for house and born for emergency condition for inside di emergency.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
her grandmothers dey also afraid to hold her or kom near her witout wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey go be completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter dey for front of me, dey smile and dey star for me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
di only tin wey no change meanwhile, na di pandemic
I dey 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic struck, and di planet go lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes
Dat 22 weeks no less dan war
my husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts dat time
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2020.
So, we dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and we spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalist association dey forward to help for di time being
I dey fear for evritin
most of di time, e be like death
dey knock for di door
I dey adapt to one new online life wia we click and get awa things home-delivered
I wait for one week to get groceries delivered dis way
I even dey fear to send di only family member wey dey live wit me my husband go outside go buy food for storage
so, I dey chop less
Besides, I no fit go for my scheduled antenatal check-ups
And I no dey sure if my pikin dey grow healthy or all development dey take place timely
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring am into a world wey different pass before
Tele-medication help me pass some hard times during di last trimister
I don forget my gynaecologist face
I no fit remember how she look witout di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help
plenti information dey float around
Inside dis wahala of information, mama wey get experience, my mama, and mama-in-law fit only help me as dem dey support me and as dem no meet me in persin wen I dey get belle
Traditionally, mama wey get experience and mama wey dey older for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get plenti panic attack bikos say I no get information and understanding
So, I dug for di experience of new mothers wey born for dis time
I see social media as lifeline
I read plenty exciting experience for social media as I dey follow di group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic.
Different media groups for dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers as dem dey share dia experience and information durin di lockdown.
One of dis group help me find a health care facility wey go do emergency ultrasound afta heavy bleedin durin di lockdown
Anoda group help me curb my anxiety during pregnancy and post-partum depression.
I dey vex say I no fit meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share di joy of welkomin a new member for di family
Dem born my daughter for August 25, 2020, for di same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, wia dem born me decades ago
And she meet anoda pikin in persin wen she dey four months old for December 31, 2020, wen Tara and her papa go di rooftop wit me to see di fireworks
Anoda family wey get two pikin, probably my next-door neighbor wey I meet di first time, also go there to say goodbye to 2020
Evri day dey, and na gift, considering di recent statistics of increased Covid-19 cases
Wen news of death dey evriwia, di new life bring happiness kom let hope thrive
For mothers, e no less pass to win war as dem dey give birth to pikin durin pandemic and taking care of di infant alone, dey confirm di highest safety for dia pikin.
So socially, emotionally, and physically, dis time fit be challenging
thanks to di light for di shining eyes of di babies
I thank my pikin, my daughter, wey be mama and wey be successful fighter wey survive dis pandemic

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make som far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem dey call as di Asaba Declaration now
Di meetin wey kom on top di heels of worse insecurity for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending threat of murderous herdsmen generate nationwide attention
True true, di bi-partisan nature of di meetin and di unanimity wey di 17 governors display show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for di context of true federalism and di ban on top open grazing form di core of di declaration
Major highlights include di clamour for state police, devolution of powers, review of revenue formule in favour of federatin units and di need for a national dialogue to discuss di national question.
While di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and runs contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions na actually a cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey Gov. El-Rufai-led committee on top True Federalism make far-reaching recommendation.
One go don expect say di leading lights of APC go take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempt to play for di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of powers, resource kontrol, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formule in favour of federating units among odas.
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
Sake of di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose grave challenges, dis two sectors suppose get di main attention, concrrently.
Despite di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make sufficient effort to translate dat to improve standards of living for di majority of awa citizens.
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes wey reach 17m of im population
Di efforts wey Buhari administation, though say new and commendable, still represent drop inside ocean and dem no dey adequate to make di required impact.
Na di place wey devolution of powers and resource control dey kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey dey stay a day for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercial viable natural resources wey dem fit use create wealth and generate di necessary foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wey states kom cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri breeds indolence, runs contrary to di principle of true federalism.
As di El-Rufai committee don propose, make dem review di revenue formule for favour of states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem
On top di state police, di fear of abuse and overcesses wey governors dey see dey understandable, but like Richie Norton tok say To escape fear, you must go through am, no be around am.
for too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria police force wey don bikom no only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum
As Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey hin time don kom
We suppose address awa fears and overcome am.
One way wey we fit do na by enacting a legal instrument for di establishment of di state police regulatory commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendment wey go allow state police
E go be similar for function to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e get wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions
Di ban on top open grazing although wey di governors restate no be new and e form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's comprehensive effort to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and thus reduce di risk of conflict wey dey between herder dem and farmers E, therefore, beggars belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.
Di convocation of a National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of di Gov. El-Rufai APC committee on top True Federalism dey.
Two report don make far-reaching recommendation say awa governors and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of to dey waste scarce resources on anoda jamboree
On di issue of separatist agitation, modality go dey for convening referendum wey dey spelt out for di konstitution.
E dey almost sure say plenti majority of Nigerians wan live togeda, awa differences, notwithstanding.
To dey do dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Even say we get challenges like evri oda kontri, we must listen to awaselves, as US President Joe Biden dey tok
Tomori dey stay for Abuja
Dem kil two officers as IPOB militants set Anambra police station for fire
Barely 24 hours afta di newly appointed Commissioner of Police for Anambra, Christopher Adetokumbo Owolabi, resume duty, gunmen attack Obosi Police Station for Idemili North local goment area for di state and kill two officers.

E admit say besides di few customers wey dem get for Kano, dem no dey see dia tomato products for local market for some reason.
Di first na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producing area.
Una know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey a little higher dan wetin dem dey obtain for open market
So, wetin dey important be say, pipo no dey look us, dem dey feel say dem dey apprehensive for wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen u get product wey dey available, pipo go dey go for di cheaper brand
One farm hand dey feed di fish
Dem ask am about di average lifespan of dia tomato products, e tok say, If u give di tomato wetin e need, I mean nutritional supplement u dey feed am wit while e dey grow, if u give am all di things, dis tomato fit last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even if e no dey, e last for minimum of one week, no under any refrigeration, but surely no under intensive pressure and heat.

3 Africans, no Nigerian as City, Chelsea don win UEFA Champions League final
No be sure say, enthusiastic football fans for Nigeria dey wait for tonights final of di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League final wey dem go contest between two English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea for di Estadio do Dragao, Porto for Portugal.
Sake of di fact say di UEFA Champions League na one of di world biggest football competition only next to di FIFA World Cup and di Olympics football event, e dey increase level of expectation as di giants of the English Premier League get set to tussle for di prestigious diadem.
While Manchester City neva win Champions League title, Chelsea don win dia first and only title for 2012
Therefore, even as football pundits don tip City wey just win dia seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea go kom into di contest wit beta credentials.
Dem be former champions.
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead di Chelsea technical crew neva taste Champions League victory, im opponent for Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner.
E win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
Therefore, plenti thing dey to expect from di actors wey go dey out there for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Interestingly, even as both contestants parade only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) Africans interest for di final don drop
Here for Nigeria wia Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy a large followin from passionate football fans, expectations don reach feverish point, wey dey lead to interesting re-alignments.
Fans of those European clubs wey dem eliminate from the Champions League for different stage don re-aligned demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interest
Consequently, di final na one of di topic wey dem dey discuss pass for sporting circles for Nigeria for di moment as fans of di Premiership clubs continue to predict wetin go be di final result.
Howeva, while almost evribodi dey wait to savur di football artistry wey go dey display, some pundits dey worried by di increasing decline for di number of African players for di final of one of di biggest football competition for earth.
Goin by di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don contest and win di trophy wit dia European clubs.
Sadly African football legend like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt fail to win di Champions League despite dia football prowess.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
Hin di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
Dem follow am by Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu don lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995
E dey record say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon be di first African wey go win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan.
Oda African winners of di highly coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
As e dey near house, di last time wey Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta di former captain of di Super Eagles don am, Nigeria don see di rise of oda huge talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
But nobodi neva feature for di final of Europe's biggest club competition
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched
Di competition dey dominate by di top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don fail to enter dis highly rated European clubs over di years
Na di hope of Nigerian football stakeholders say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all di barriers and begin play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to live wit di agony of watching final of di UEFA Champions League kom and go witout di presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea's Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club final na few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey give dem first title, ot di Londoners wey dey give dem second title, and di football league wey dey give dem last, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
