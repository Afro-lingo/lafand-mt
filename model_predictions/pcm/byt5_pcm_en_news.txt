How the dedicated body of a civil defence officer was seen in the grave of a civil defence officer.
The dead body of a woman officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) which has been found for 18 months, has been seen in a grave which is not deemed.
Until by the time he was not seen, Josephine Cynthia Inalegwu Onche, was working at the NSCDC office in Otukpo.
Cynthia is Idoma, and is Otukpo, just missing when they are planning her marriage.
Some of her workers who did not want to write their names said she was not able to find her again when her marriage remained small days.
What is said she was going to the market to buy things as she was preparing for her marriage, but she has not returned home since.
One of the officers of the dead said while trying to find him, they did not see him until an other man showed him where he was burried.
The okadaman told the family people that the owner who wanted to marry the children was killed, using him to do a rotual for money.
After the okadaman took the family people and security to arrest the man, the man took them to the baba of the ritual in Obi local government, before his wake entered.
When police arrested the husband and his herbalist in Otukpo, the family of the dead had gone out of the body where he was buried, and organised a burial for him on today.
A call, or an answer message was sent to him on the incident, DSP Catherine Anene, a spokesman at the Benue police, did not carry.
The spokesman of NSCDC in the state, Asc Ejelikwu Micheal did not disclose anythimg when we met him, saying he would speak when time reached.
But an insider said the news of the finding of the deadbody had put sadness in the security peoples minds.
In the review of the constitution: MURIC said Sharia had been in the SouthWest before Christianity entered.
The Penticostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has urged the Penticostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to stop opposing Muslims and mind them business.
The director of MURIC, Professor Ishaq Akintola, said this on Sunday.
He said this after the PFN warning that any group should not use the review of constitution by the Senate to take shariah law enter the south-west.
PFN and other Christian joinbodies knew that Shariah was in the south-west before Christianity entered in 1842.
Shariah was practised in Ede, during the time of Oba Abeeb Olagunju (Abbeb is a Muslim name) and said they were practising shariah in Ede during the time of Oba Abeeb Olagunju (Abbeb is a Muslim name
The shariah court in Ede was still operating until 1913, in Agbeni in the town.
He was taken to Agbongbon in 1914.
Shariah was used in Iwo during the time of Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye), who died in 1906.
Even so, the nomber Akirun of Ikirun, who was oba Aliyu Oyewole (who died in 1912) took Shariah into Ikirun in 1910.
These are examples that shariah has been spreading in Yorubaland, and to say the christian people know that shariah has been spreading in Yorubaland, and to say the christian people know that shariah
He said PFN and some other christian collaborations also knew that islamic waka has been growing in the south west, and there was fear that the sleeping giant is waking to come.
The Christians know that Shariah is the right that Allah has dashed Muslims.
But they have determined that they would not allow Muslims to use it, because it is the new way of using.
It was in mind that it was a war and that there was nothing bad in war.
They use both good and bad ways to do what they mind.
Nigerians are calling on Nigerians to understand the mentalities of the Christians here.
As it is for everyone who is quickly vexed, they believe that attacking people is the only way to defend.
As they gained from the colonial jaguda that reached a century that time, they wanted to kip all the things they could carry to them.
It has been in mind that Muslims would be put into the places they were chased by colonials.
The joinbody reviewing the constitution has said that Nigerians should write what they want for in the constitution.
Each group should bring the things they need to come.
Instead of telling the joinbody what the Christians want, they think they should not ask them.
It was wanted to block Muslims in the south, but it would not work.
He said when saying there is religious tolerance in the south, it is a lie, and it is said to put Yoruba Muslims into slavery.
Muslims in the region are open eyes and ask for freedom.
We demand that they stop forcing us to wear a christian school uniform, go to christian school, using christian law.
We want not only a shariah that regulates Muslim marriages, inherritance and family affairs.
This does not concern Christians at all.
We will use all the ways that would not cause a fight, following law, to do the thing, he said.

The jaguda people were identified as members of IPOB and ESN who were banned.
The driver of late Ahmed Gulak, and the surviving victims have identified the dedicated bodies of the IPOB/ESN members as attacked, and the vehicle collected as the car.
During the face-to-face with the jaguda people, two armored personel carriers belonging to police personnel were taken scater, but they did not spoil the finish.
And the video made after the attack showed that Gulak was wearing a jean trouser, and a blue shirt as he was sleeping in his own blood, near the abandoned car.
Gulak was the chairman of the Imo All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary election which led Hope Uzodinma to represent the party.
He was even said close to the governor, was visiting the state.
Why is he in Owerri
Although Gulak was said to be visiting Owerri well since Uzodinma entered, it was to attend the public hearing of review of constitution in the city to attend the public hearing of review of constitu
As the committee had concluded its sitting, Gulak sat back when other members of the committee left the city on Friday.
A spokesman close to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, chairman of the public hearing held in Owerri, said the deceased private was offered to Kalu after the public hearing held in Owerri, said the deceased pr
According to the source, Kalu team left the city the day of the public hearing, but Gulak stayed back, saying he has things to do for the city.
We left Owerri the day of the public hearing, and we asked him to join us in our private jet, that we have enough security with us.
But he said he had somethimg to do in the city.
Nigerians have carried knock to FG, and other politicians concerning the killing.
Nigerians on social media have also put hands in ear to the federal government and police leaders over the killing.
A Facebook person who commented on the Facebook link to the story published by Daily Trust, Ifeanyi Maduako, who said the death of Gulak was bitter, and linked it with politics.
The killing was bitter in my mouth.
It is like it was done by politicians and the people who did, let us open them face.
The killing will expose those behind the security problems in Imo State.
It was who invited him, and why the northerner would be killed in Imo State.
I am fearing what will do innocent Imo people in some days in the hands of security people controlled by the north, he wrote.
Another commentator on the thread, Olurombi Micheal Omo, said while police reports have proven that it was a political killing, it should be investigated.
It is that police personnel also have questions to ask.
In his own part, Comr Hassan Ahmad wrote that the souls of innocent people are more important than the scam known as Unity in Nigeria.
We don't gree this illiteracy, enough is enough, we are peacemakers.
But those who push us to meet the wall see that we cannot continue with the peace.
I am sending a warning, we will retaliate and worst.
Buhari, you have failed us woefully, and we face the Imo police personnel to follow the jaguda people.
Nasiru Inuwa also wrote that it was a wake-up call to the biggest people in the north, beginning with innocent Fulani herders, now they are turned to northern government officials, including presiden
Secretary of the IPOB non-supported joinbody, Emma Powerful, in a statement said IPOB should not be linked to the murder of Gulak, saying to kill politicians.
Therefore, IPOB did not know anything about the killing.
To beging with, how Gulak is taking threats of our mission which has warranted to be killed.
We have nothing with him, and we have not killed him.
To point hand for IPOB in this kind of barbaric act is just to divert attention away from the real people who did it.
This is the same way terrorists with security uniforms are coming to atrocities in the south east, and they will come to IPOB for their crime, because they want to spoil our relationship.
This is an opportunate opportunity to start another special military operation in the Eastern Region to take more Biafra innocents.
Instead of properly investigating on the incident and the causes, the IPOB has faced over crimes that were not done.
Does IPOB have the information for the movement of the late Gulak to the airport road?
The group said security personnel should first investigate the hoster of Gulak, Hope Uzordinma, and his political opponents, to establish if they are involved.
Those who killed Gulak won't escape punishment.
President Muhammadu Buhari has said the killers of Gulak and other problems in our country would not be scotted free.
President Buhari, in a statement in a spokesperson, Garba Shehu, expressed outrage and disgust over the heinous murder.
The president, who has shown that the incident made him sad, said: I am repulsed by the gruesome murder of Gulak premeditated by evil people, who are saying they have been detrmined.
I should also warn that nobody, or a collaboration doing such despicable things will expect to go free.
We will use everythimg to ensure that people who do such calous and criminal things will face justice.
Akeredolu said the killing of Gulak was unacceptable, says Akeredolu.
Governor of Ondo State, Olwarotimi Akeredolu, described the news of the killing as shocking and disturbing.
In a statement signed by the Governor, he said this was a murder too many, saying this was senseless and wicked.
The people who do this kind of bad things are enemies of the country.
The corner-corner way is to mislead, confuse and destroy.
He has the unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration.
These criminals must not be allowed to succeed.
We want to use this medium to tell our brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzordinma that we are with him.
We urge him and other Governors in South Eastern States to brace up and confront the security issues to end bloodbath in their lands.
The enemies of the people use a weapon of fear to create disaffection.
The coward act is to instigate Nigerians to be in face each other, making northerners in face Igbo people living outside the South East.
We must face the enemies of the people to see that we leave power in their hands.
This is not time to argue who knows better politicians.
We should not allow bandits to spoil the legitimacy of this government at all levels.
We are calling on all security personnel to collaborate to ensure that they show the sponsoring criminals and those who are doing terorists.
They must be punished severely.

The herder-farmer problem in Nigeria has turned to what is showing face in news every day.
To end Nigerias herder-farmer problem: The Livestock reform Plan
Nigerias federal and state governments are struggling to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan to control cattle movement throughout the country.
Many state governments have endorsed it, but it is facing some challenges.
Political leadership working well, increased budget constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased budget constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased budget constraints due to the COVID-
If the plan fails as like the other plans to modernise livestock management, the farmers and herders fight will increase.
The plan was approved by the National Economic Council in January 2019, the plan was to represent the most understandable effort to examine the improved livestock system.
The main part of the strategy is to control where grazing is happening to reduce the fight between herders and farmers.
The movement hopes that after 10 years, herders who are waking up and down mainly will have minds of putting their cattle in ranches and reserves for public grazing, where birds and chickens will be
By the end of 2028, the authorities have in mind to build about 119 ranches in all the states involved, to create about two million jobs in the country.
President Muhammadu Buharis administration made the plan after a period when herders and farmers were fighting, participarly when the fight was too much and affected people.
The Federal Government, which is minding to drop about 80 percent of the Transformation proposal submitted by the involved states, is taking the first step to drop about 80 percent of the Transformat
Many states have been reactivating demarcated grazing reserves, opening offices and setting up a steering committee to manage the plan.
The authorities have been doing workshops and other works to teach people the benefits of livestock reform.
As two years away from the 10-year plan, they have not been able to build any ranch and their obstacles are a lot.
Opposition from the herders, though it is more from the Fulani people, comes still among the farmers who do not want pastolists to enjoy the benefits of their agriculture.
There has been distrust in the Middle Belt, where fights between farmers and herders are so many due to land, despite peacemaking and efforts by the military.
There have been shortages in the federal and state governments budgets, a large part is due to the spoiling economy due to the pandemic and lack of technical experts that know the countrys technical
In many states, especially in the North-West, the way criminal gangs and armed groups are growing spoils access to grazing reserves and makes people wanting to invest in.
Unless something is done about it, this issue and others can delay or spoil the plan, which will make the country helpless when the fight between farmers and herders develop.
To tackle this issue, it is important that Federal and State authorities collaborate with donors and investors.
First, Abuja and other states supporting him should provide stronger political leadership than earlier, and increase their communication with the public to enable them to enhance their communication
This is common by pastoralists on their side, who ask them to change their nomadic lifestyle with their people for centuries, who still have serious doubts about what they have been able to change th
But many farmers are fearing that they will lose their land to producers of livestock.
Many in the middle Belt and other states in the South are still suspecting the plans long-term goals, which are seen as an opportunity for herders and the Fulani people to participate.
With the support from Abuja and other partners, state governments must find experts who will know technical aspects of things, especially managers of the projects.
Federal and State governments should also increase their budgets for the plan, release the funds quickly and create financial transparency to make sure that everything is accordingly according to the
It is also important to deal with insecurities in rural areas, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities that affected seriously in the state.
Authorities must consider weather change issues and decide if herders from other countries sometimes will benefit from the plan.
As some of these steps take time, the planners should focus on how to bring strong results to people in a small time.
Less than two years from now, the country will hold general elections.
If the plan will survive the following change of government, politians must bring clear proof that it has benefited (changes are certain, as President Buhari and many states).
By the time the champaign for elections has been hot at the 2022 ending, the people backing the plan should show some of the ranches built or the reserves repaired.
Nothing in this thing is easy but the plan worth the effort.
Not only is it perfect, but it brings a chance to change Nigerias livestock system with a strategy that will address both herders and small-scale farmers.
About 70 percent of workers in Nigeria get money from agriculture.
To modernise the livestock sector will boost the countrys prosperity and at the same time, it is a huge way to solve one of Nigerias dangerous problems.
As time is coming for the 2023 election, both federal and state authorities must do quickly to create this kind of moment.
This is an executive summary of the report on the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how it works fast, published by the International Crisis Group.
The most questions I have with the king
Abide you don't gree?
They are responsible for very high proportions in food and crop production.
Subsistence farmers are the smallholders who consume the majority of their farm output that have been held back to not participate actively in commercially oriented production.
No energy for nobody who was not happy for me.
It was me.
This brought me to a conclusion that everyone is evil.
This system has been characterised as complex, diverse and risk-prone.
Farms are always large, they do it under traditional or informal tenure, and it is in marginal risk-prone environments.
Yields are low and farmers are lacking the capacity to increase yields.
We say life and prosperity on this day.
Why your aza
The emphasis is on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farming as an enterprise.
I knew everythimg.
Akpos and his friends sat down speaking.
The yields of the smallholder farmers are profitable.
You are coming.
These challenges have led to many smallholder farmers, to pursue livelihoods with lower-risk and lower-yielding agricultural activities.
You are a witch?
I was on my road to know I am going to buy sufficient food.
I should call my father.
As developing countries grow larger, richer, and more urban, the intensification of agricultural production will occur in rapidly changing agri-food value chains.
Aw far what is supposed to come here
This development shifts the competitive advantage away from petty farmers.
It is important that we find a solution to the problem.
This will require an intergrated approach of methodologies.
The loan sharks are in his neck.
This is something.
I was sent errands where I was working.
The water has flooded the whole farm.
Farmers many battles in 2020
For many farmers and other stakeholders in the agro-sector, the year 2020 will remain as one of the worse years in the history of Nigeria because it introduced new dynamics for farmers and other stak
Several challenges have been confronting the agricultural sector ranging from climate change-related issues, conflicts and the exacerbated complications that have exacerbated the industry.
First, the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions happen at the time when dry season farmers should begin harvesting their crops and wet season farmers should begin cultivation.
Many farmers cannot go to their farms while others with labourers to harvest their farms since mechanization is a huge challenge and manual harvest is the problem.
Movement restrictions have been introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus locked-down markets that have disrupted the rural economy.
Many farmers cannot sell their produce that will enable them to buy seed and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services.
Even when the lockdown has been lifted in the agricultural sector, the price of fertilizer has risen so that many smallholders cannot afford it.
In some places the price has risen up to N13,000 for a bag of Indorama and Notore Urea.
NPK 15-15-15 has risen to N25,000 when the federal government NPK20-10-10 under the presidential fertilizer initiative, which was supposed to sold for farmers for N5000 was not available.
For farmers in Zamfara, Katsina, Southern Kaduna, some parts of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandits activities not only denied them access to their farms but the men were also able to gain access to the
Many farming communities were razed down.
People were kidnapped and demanded ransom.
Many people paid a large sum of money or surrendered large portions of their harvest to the bandits.
Many villages in those states have become desolate.
The agric sector has witnessed one of the worst disasters when one of the worst disasters when flood wiped out 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields estimated at over Nigeria.
Many of the affected farmers are yet to be compensated as their livelihood has destroyed.
The flood has been worse since the 2012 disaster which wrecked havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal and flood-prone areas which wrecked havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal and flood-prone areas
Meanwhile, as the flood brings pain to farmers hearts up in the North, there is drought confronting farmers down south.
For two months, farmers did not have joy but watch as their investments in crops were withering away.
It is not disguised.
Another subsector where the thing hit badly was poultry and feeds.
The scarcity of maize at the begining caused the increase in prices.
He also forced the poultry association of Nigeria to send save our souls appeal to the federal government for urgent atention.
The federal government has responded for the appeal and released 5,000 metric tons of maize from the nations strategic reserve for farmers in addition that some of them would be granted to farmers.
However, this is just a short-term solution because three months ago, the scarcity of soyabean struck, which made the farmers expressing their fear that by January 2021, the production of soyabean wo
The scarcity resulted in a serious feed crisis in the industry as prices rose from N2,600 in February to about N5,500.
The poultry industry has lost an estimate of N7 million jobs with projected figures reaching 10 million by January 2021 whereas the loss in investments could be estimated to reach 10 million by Janua
While the poultry farmers are still struggling with the challenges that mark the sector, the crop farmers despite the daunting challenges that confront the sector in the 2020 farming year.

About 3,000 youths to benefit from NALDA's farm estate in Ebonyi
The National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) has said the agency would engage at least 3,000 youths in Ebonyi State in its proposed intergrated farm estate.
The intergrated farm estate will be completed and commissioned by October this year.
The executive secretary of the agency, Prince Paul Ikonne, who announced it on Tuesday said the proposed integrated farm estate would be established on 104 hectares of land.
Prince Ikonne, who was also in Ebonyi State on a courtesy visit to the governor on Monday, Engr David Umahi, said the intergrated farm estate would be completed on October 2.
This is the mandate of Mr President, that we should reactivate abandoned farms and develop new ones for security.
The Governor of Ebonyi State is eager.
He was in total support of achieving his dreams.
So, Ebonyi State has committed to working with NALDA to engage the teeming youths into full agricultural productivity.
We have seen that the governor has keyed into Mr Presidents agenda which concerns achieving food security in the country.
We are establishing an intergrated farm estate in Ebonyi State as we do it in other states.
The scheme will engage Nigerians and draw their attention to agriculture.

New President of Niger Republic chooks hand on terrorist eyes over crimes committed.
Niger Republics new president Mohamed Bazoum has put hand of terrorists who barbaric acts passed limits after entering power on Friday in the country.
Bazoum said the groups are killing many innocent people and by that, they are committing real war crimes.
He said the leaders of the groups came from other countries, saying they are just attacking Niger for nothing.
No terrorist leader has been vexed with the country, he said.
Bazoum, 61-year-old, was elected in two rounds that took place in December and February.
Right hand of Mahamadou Issoufou, 68-year-old, stepped down by himself after sending two fove year terms in office.
His inauguration was the first time elected leaders were handovering each other in Niger history for over 60 years of independence, but the attacks from jihadists in the country.
Niger is suffering a close conect to Al-qaeda or Islami State (IS), which enters west from Burkina Faso and Mali, and from Nigeria as Boko Haram is engaging.
Over 300 people have been killed in three attacks in the west since the commencement of the year.
The most recent was when 141 members of the Tuareg community were killed on March 21, in Tahoua, a huge desert entering Mali.
Bazoum said the efforts of Niger Rebuplic under him as the president would focus on Mali.
He said the current situation in Mali had a direct impact on security in their own country.
Insurgents linked to IS have based in Menaka and Gao, in eastern and central Mali, Bazoum said.
He said they would be very difficult as long as Mali as a country has no full charge over the region.
In the early hours of Wednesday, after shooting guns near the presidency in Nigeria, the government said the coup was stopped.
He described the thing as an act of a coward and regressive who is a treath to democracy and state of the law.
The countries in West Africa have suffered four coups, the most recently in February 2010, and the leave of President Mamadou Tandja.
Google says they can leave Australia
Google has carried a threat to Australia to leave the search engine within the country, as the country has asked them to share gains with publishers of news.
Australia wants to introduce the first law of its kind as they want Google, Facebook, and other tech companies to pay news people for the content they deliver.
But the firms in the US have fighted back, warning that they may leave their services within the country.
The Australian Prime Minister in Australia, Scott Morrison said lamakers would not listen to any threat.
Although Australia is not one of the biggest places Google markets things, this proposed news code could be a global test of how governments would begin regulating them.
This code in Australia will tie Google and Facebook to negotiate with publishers over the worth of their news content if they cannot reach an agreement at the begining.
The managing Director of Google in Australia, Mel Silva told a senate siddon on Friday that the law would not work.
She said if this kind of version of the code is passed to become law, Google would have no choice beyond packing them out in Australia.
But lawmakers were attacked, saying it was blackmail and bully Google wanted to do in Australias seek of raising the reform.
It will rech everywhere around the world.
If you will come at every market, will you leave?
Senator Rex Patrick asks Senator Rex Patrick about stopping the precedence?
Silva replied that the code is a risk that is not tenable for their operations in Australia.
Morrison said his government was committed to making the law for progress through parliament this year.
Let me say clearly: Australia makes a rule of what you can do in Australia.
We are doing that in our parliament, he told news people on Friday.
Why is Australia pushing for such laws?
Google is the dominant search engine in Australia, and the government has described as an essential utility without any market competition.
The governments argument is that because the tech giant has customers among readers of news, they should pay a good amount to the newsroom for their journalism.
In addition, they argue that the financial support is necessary or the embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy.
According to the government, print media in Australia has suffered a 75% reduction in money since 2005.
The thret that Google said would be removed from the entire search engine is the toughest.
The lawmakers said news only accounted for 12.5% of the searches taken by Google in Australia.
Poultry farmers are urging poultry farmers to begin importing animal grade maize and soya meals.
General Secretary of the South West Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), Dr. Olalekan Odunsi, has called on the government to facilitate importation of animal grades from Nigeria.
Odunsi said the importation could save the poultry business from collapse, Odunsi said.
He said the importation of feed grade maize would sustain the over 500 million layers, 100 million broilers, 1 million breeders and other classes of poultry until next harvest.
He also urged governments to not allow them to export processed soya, seed and soya bean meals to the country.
He urged governors in the region to put efforts in the production of maize as they did in the production of rice.
Odunsi said maize farmers, soya bean farmers and the others in Nigeria needed to collaborate to take work.
He said if government did not intervene, that scarcity and hish prices of maize and soya would threaten another five million poultry jobs if the government did not do anythimg about it.
Today, maize is sold at 210,000/MT in most states in the South West, while most states in the South West are 240,000/MT.
With the importance of the two items, the prices of poultry feed have just increased from N2750 to N3000 in April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now.
In December, most farmers cannot sell broilers because the cost of production is higher than an ordinary Nigerian.
Presently, eggs are above what average person can buy, the price is around 1,300.
So we really need to intervene to save the remaining ten million jobs in the poultry value chain of the economy.
As he spoke.

How North-Central govs can optimize open grazing ban from South APC leader
As open grazing controversy has trended enter public domain, which Southern governors have hit it with ban during their meeting in Asaba, the president, Farmers Empowerment Association, Farmers Empow
Recently, the governors of the Southern State met in Asaba, Delta State, and banned open grazing to cut farmers-herders crisis including other forms of criminality.
What is your take on the controversy that this decision generated?
Every human being has the right for action and opinion.
But the most important thing is that once you take your own action, know there are consequences.
You should consider the advantage and disadvantage.
I am not one of those who say good or bad.
As a Nigerian, it is your right and liberty to live anywhere in the country with good faith and enjoy the freedom of association.
On this basis, I will not tell you that it is a good thing.
But as a leader in the North Central, I will say it is a good thing, especially in the North Central zone, as per the potential economic benefits for us and the nation.
The ban is an advantage to us.
We need to tap into it and see how we can make it a real venture and make money from it.
Luckily for us, we have a landmass enough to accommodate the herders, no matter the number of troops from the South to the North Central.
What is your position about open grazing?
I am not one of the people who support open grazing.
I believe more in ranching because I do it.
I believe if we begin ranching, it will work out for us.
Governors in the North Central should allow the national programme on ranching.
This move could make Northern Central the most popular place for cows, where people can buy cows and some allied products.
It will become a means of economic empowerment for the north central people.
We have the land that the southern states might not have.
See in Kogi, Niger, Kwara, among other states.
We can give the herders houses and ranches to be our own advantage.
The challenges following the Fulani herders are not because they don't want to adopt ranching.
The problem is that they are not really educated on the advantages.
Their culture is nomadic.
As a result, they need a good education to accept ranching.
We can also adopt the method in Kenya, where almost all families have cows, but you cannot see open grazing, as cows take much there reach.
That is what the southern governors are saying.
The governors do not show where they belong in this regard.
They do not call for ranching or to say the federal government should put mouth.
What is saying is that the herders have become a problem for us, and they should leave.
They say herders should apply for land, saying herding is a personal business.
But have they asked people to apply for land like the herders?
As one of the members of youth empowerment, especially in agriculture and value chains, why do some government policies really work, what is the way out?
Firstly, no other administration has been touched able to touch the lives of individuals like one of President Muhammadu Buhari, who you can sit in your house without any problems and problems.
There are also some credit facilities called COVID-19 loans.
Many Nigerians have been getting the loan for many hundreds of thousands of naira from their homes without staying at offices.
Also, with expanding some SMEs like the Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and the remaining.
The challenge is that we have two sides, those who will believe you and those who will not believe.
So, for those who don't believe in the administration of Buhari, nothing has benefited.
But for us who believe in Buhari, we are benefiting, and we thank God for him.

The forensic Bill passed by the National Assembly: It is relevant to the fight against corruption by Buhari.
The National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th.
May 2021 in the House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd.
March 2021 in the Senate made history when it was passed into law, the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.615).
It was read for the Third Time in both Chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
This act is a clear demonstration of the patriotism and direct response of the National Assembly, targeted, plus strengthening and re-invigorating national frontiers.
The passing of this bill, the 9th Assembly under the distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala would pass this bill.
And this also attests to the fact that the National Assembly has waken to the performance of its complementary role with other arms of Government in the fight against corruption.
I wrote this with a happy mind and a deep sense of gratitude that I wrote this, which has been put together as a platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed the whole world know what this is.
After the Senate passed the Bill, and in view that we are operating a bi-cameral Legislature, the House of Representatives we are always ready and resilient, under the auspices of the President of th
Femi Gbajabiamila, who is the Hon.
The speaker also followed what was done and passed the Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you can hear before, the Bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) is among the bills we have passed.
The sad thing is that people who are supposed to put mouth in the fight against corruption in Nigeria are attacking the bill, they have become enemies in common ood.
Good things are good things, no substitutes, so bad things are also.
No matter how long it takes, good always prevails over bad just as the light superior over darkness takes constant and unquestionable.
It is important that we see a little of how it happened in the National Assembly.
It is interesting that, the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) was first passed into law by the 9th Senate.
It is very important for the public to know that (CIFIPN) is not just a noble body but a new one in Nigeria targeted to bridge the gap that has been for long time in Nigeria.
Today, the waka is to have a standard body that will regulate the practices of forensics in Nigeria at its peak and enable Nigerians to rise to challenge the few anti-government agencies.
This bill passed by the National Assembly, shows that they clearly demonstrate that they are patriotic and the need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, which has started in the country
This good step in legislation, taken by the two Chambers of the National Assembly, is historic and symbolic, happening at a time Nigeria is needing legislation.
That will give a better way to his anti-corruption drive as the spate of criminal and corruption has risen across the globe.
According to us, crime has entered another level as science and technology improved in the 21st century.
Therefore, by passing the bill was good and happened at a good time, plus it showed clearly that we have a flexible and responsive legislature who knows the things in the country.
Let us also say that the journey inside the taking pass of the bill to turn to law, has started since the 8th National Assembly, where Distinguished Senator Ahmed Muhammadu Buhari said that the bill
For better understanding, when we introduced our bill in the two chambers during the 8th Assembly, there was a public hearing that carried everyone along in the chamber.
Thereafter, and on the opposition of minority stakeholders, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), the National Assembly passed the bill, while the National Assembly passed the bil
Afterward, the bill was forwarded to the President to put hand, but never put hand before the 8th Assembly was scattered in June 2019.
The bill was brought about the 9th National Assembly in the 9th National Assembly, Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, the current Leader of the Senate, in view of as executive chairman of the
We are pushed to make this clarification in order to clear the air on the cheap cheap propaganda by people who distract us saying the 8th Assembly has rejected our bill.
Also we should mention the fact that our bill has been mistaken with abother similar bills introduced in both the Senate and House of Representatives.
These bills, while scrutizing them with close eye, we discovered that they just copied our intentions and the things our bill stands for.
We should draw hear that any of the bills were not introduced into the 8th Assembly, only our bills.
As such, we are the first to carry a bill like this (Forensic).
As we have seen it is very urgent to establish such a great Institute.
The decision to establish the Institute was made after studying how the Institute operates in other jurisdictions and how they have helped crime detection.
This is part of instruction to know that our Institute has been operating since 2009.
And over the years, we have trained professionals to know forensic science technology, targeted at inculcating the requisite skills in the pragmatic areas of forensic science.
Forensic analysis can be taken to eliminate material misstatements, whether by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic analysis; and digital foren
You will follow me reasons that in the obscene world we are today, the normal way of investigating crime on to stop it has become old somethimg.
As such, when we as a country should do something that has meaning in this matter, it is paramount that we should follow global trends and new innovations, which are put for ground the country.
This is where we took reasons to establish this Institute with good objectives that are relevant to the anti-corruption agenda of this administration.
There is not time for me to speak about everything in the bill here.
However, I want to allow you to mention a few of what the Bill will do, for the purpose of this statement, as it should be like this:
That we should establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria, to develop and train professionals in this specialised field, as well as training professionals
To provide a platform for training and retraining of people who want to become professionals on how to use Forensic Science and Technology tools and techniques.
Promoting high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes among people doing them, in a bid to cut fraudulence and corruption, and as well developing a mechanism for financial control.
To fill the huge vacuum existing in our old normal system of investigation with the introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help the community in the country.
To develop broad-based mechanisms and training programmes that will cut across all the strategies of our investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminal Investigators, e
This will enhance effective plus efficient disposition of cases globally; and
To enhance anti-fraud mechanism in Nigeria, through the provision of a legal framework for the professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals.
From the foregoing, it shows that the role of this Institute is strategic and important.
It is also important that forensic science is a very wide field and involves many others, and requires effective and efficient regulation to attain.
The broad spectrum of the scope and focal points of the Institute, includes but not only forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics among others.
Accordingly, you will agree that our Institute has brought unique concepts into crime detection and investigation following international best practices.
The concept of myopic people taking things about our bills has covered them a sense of thingking, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, which has been constructed by
On a lighter note, I want to draw the attention of everyone to the funny scenario that is playing out now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all better people.
When the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill was introduced in the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, the Institute
However, as our bills have been introduced again in this 9th National Assembly, and as we have seen the overwhelming and accelerated legislative support between the two Chambers have received from th
What has changed between now and the past, where ICAN has the view that any other Institute should not regulate the practices of forensic science?
Your answer is the same thing with my own.
I would also like to inform you that the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also part of this episode.
Which was initiated and promoted by ANAN, just as the ICAN counterparts, they also introduced a bill in the House of Representative with the same structure as the ICAN counterparts.
I decided to disclose all the facts that made Nigerians and even the international community to understand the extent to which some people could go to make them for achieving them.
However, this development did not disturb us at all, because we believe in the credibility and ability of the National Assembly and also for the Presidency to do the right thing, making it the right
ICAN is the practical and antagonist of this bill and we are seeing the reason now.
Several bystanders were engaged in writing bad petitions, even targeting the leadership in the Senate, and it sounded like bleckmail.
With failure in the Senate, the antagonists shifted attention to the House of Representative with the same bystanders as they just wrote many publications.
And again, they failed.
Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bills passed by the Senate only need concurrence by the House except when observations are made.
But in the case of the CIFIPN Bill, the people against it fighted until truth until truth win on the 19th day of May, 2021 when the House of Representative passed the Bill establishment of the Nation
ICAN has registered its own Bill in the House of Respresentatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
The new Bill brought by the ICAn contains full provision for taking practice of forensic, including establishing a forensic university in Nigeria, and without it, no one will be able to establish a f
This wants to be strange in the ears in a country where there are many other eye people.
The most important thing made me appreciate was that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic.
No matter the level of coruption.
We are challenging the House of Representatives to pass the bill.
We should note that, while challenging the bill is not in bad belle, but because we are certain that the purpose of the bill is to stop presidential assent under the directive of the country.
We will not greet to deceive us and Nigerian people with their ways.
You will remember how ICAn took open eye opposition of the CIFIPN and in a publication sponsored by the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief).
Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 made many efforts to tell us that the law enabling ICAN to do forensics and pass the CIFIPN Bill would be like them.
The question is, what has changed?
The same law that ICAN has told the public that it has forensics and seeks to re-enact it.
As always, as we do not oppose any group proposing to include forensics in their law, our concern is that a body should not try to perpetuate itself.
ICAN and their cohorts have realised their inability to stop the passage of CIFIPN.
So they want to have an union for themselves.
They are fearful of checks and balances, they will not want another professional body to investigate their activities because they know what they do to the economy of this nation.
How do they want to judge their own cases by themselves?
This sounds strange.
On this note, we are calling on the National Assembly to beware of the way this group has, they should not be talking from both sides of their mouths, and expecting to expect to them.
Once again, we want to appreciate the commit put by the 9th Assembly to ensure that the Bill is passed, Nigerians know that this administration is ready to fight corruption.
We are confident that His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari would not hesitate to put hand of the Bill as soon as it entered its table.
We are calling Nigerians to take part in the Forensic Profession.
The profession is open to all professionals in different areas.
The Institute has a training section to guide and equip you.
I want to thank all of you, and also talk again that we are committed to stand with ethical standards as it takes following the way they do it worlwide, as we are giving our professional professional
I want to appeal to stakeholders and better Nigerians to support this noble course and to beg all of us to make efforts to finish corruption together.

He said.
The brands new E195-E2 aircraft, the third, will enter very soon, saying the reason for expanding their fleet is the commitment to satisfy the air travel needs of the country.
Testing a flight is a regulatory requirement that must be dobbed before the aircraft is put into regular operation.

Tela maize harvest has potential to give 8 tons in a hectare.
On the just passed Tuesday, the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, invited relevant stakeholders, including journalists, to come together with relevant stake
The name is derived from the maize variety TELA from Latin TUTELA which means protection.
This kind of maize has protection against pests and draughts for its breed.
Principal Investigator, Professor Rabiu Adamu, along with other scientists who took journalists round the harvest, said the idea of the project was to produce maize varieties which were available to
This is all about producing high yielding crops under stressed conditions; the stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production.
If it is not controlled, if it can cause losses of up to 80 percent, including drought if you do not manage the rain shortage, you may not have any yield.
It is the third time this has done this trial.
The first trial was done in the under dry season in March and during the rainy season, we did another from June to November.
This is the third trial from November to April.
The principal researcher said that is what they are trying to showcase, the principal researcher said.
As the three CFT trials have been successful, researchers will need to test and validate them to show that what they recorded in their research stations were performed.
By the end of 2022, if all things work well, Nigerian farmers will expect to make all these hybrids with them.
Dr. Muhyideen Ayekunle, a maize breeder under this project, said from the last two trials, the recorded transgenic varieties gave 17 percent advantage over maize.
We have infested the varieties put for trial three times unlike the previous ones to look at how the BT gene is effective in the maize product.
With the outcome, researchers have said the yield would increase by 17 percent.
So after, we will analyze the data and prepare documents to get approval for environmental release.
We will submit the dossier to the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and it will be reviewed.
Once given us approval for this product, we can show our faces outside.
And then we can get a national performing trial.
The Director General/CEO of the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NBDA), Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, at the event, called the scientists to continue to continue their research and developm
We have tested some technologies capable of providing solutions to problems farmers face, to take advantage of it and move forward, he said.
Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, the Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, said the impact was very well.
Farmers yields will increase by 17 percent and you know that productivity and harvest are the key to farming.
Once you gree, you will have a lot of harvest and profit.
She said by the time this kind of maize is ready to enter farmers, it would increase livelihood, money, plus the price of maize would come down.

LG polls: Protest over imposing candidates in APC
Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State have protested against how the party to adopt some consensus candidates in some local governments.
Spokesmen of the party have announced that the party will adopt consensus candidates in some local government areas and conduct direct and or indirect primary voting to make candidates.
The protesters who entered the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), in Ogun State, were accused of some leaders of APC in Abeokuta South LGA of importantly importantly controlling t

One of the party leaders who led the protest, Balogun Ololade, said Governor Dapo Abiodun should intervene in the matter to save democracy in the country from jeopardy.
Between DSS and people who want to separate in some regions
DSS has put hands in ear for groups and people who speak and do things that could provoke and distrupt the ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonous co-existence.
A lingering question about who or which person and group the security agents said was promptly vapourized into the heated rhetorical outbust of the nation.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
It became clear for all of us that this is the group of people who have continued to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements and acts to take set countrys people.
Interestingly, not in the major suspects in the exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence in some parts of the country could be categorised as categories of ethno-religious v
They chorused the same conviction that the DSS knew the responsible persons, only differing in the direction of pointing them accusing fingers.
AS Afenifere said these people knew the ones responsible for the acts, but couldn't be touched because of their connect, PANDEV again about many people.
Since the DSS knew them and they are satanists, they should be taken action to deal with them.
The NEF sounds like a person who is not convinced with if there are people who push the country enter deep crises and know them, they should be treated according to the law.
You don't need to be a spook to know what the DSS knows about these flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics in Nigeria or to understand why they all know that they are yet to be inspired by the DSS.
The truth is that these champions of ethnic politics do not know any better solution to the problem Nigeria is facing than making them sectional enclaves and chiefs are looking for sectional enclaves
They are desperate and unscrupulous to pursue their inordinate ambitions that they agitate absurdly and frequently to break Nigeria up.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate their geographical consciousness to reduce all its takes to excising the territorial contours of their enclaves with the frenzied ease of communication.
To put it simple, to break up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of people or groups under the country.
These groups are a major block to the steady attainment of unity and living together in peace Nigeria has laboured for since flag of independence.
For as long as they continue to parade the political terrain as ethnic champions, it is for so long that Nigeria will be regarded as an entitlement for their ethnic stake in the population.
Whenever they meet, the agenda is not to make Nigeria for progress and develop, unless the leadership is handed firmly, otherwise is all about hecking and jostling around.
Whether it is ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, their existence and activities will oppose the quest of Nigeria for unity, peace and development.
Another indicment that cannot be denied for these regional separatists is that all of them are sel-styled political pressure groups which pretend like representatives of various ethnic and political
From the membership, it is plain to see that they consist of ex-this.
Ironically, this political deficiency gave them the ginger to come together, desperate to remain relevant in a democratic system where elected representatives run through.
There is only nasty nuisance value the geo-ethnic groups have in our democratic setting as they continue with mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion intended to continue with mischief, sabotage
This is why frequent meetings are causing security alerts!
With such predator-politicians who are waking ariund the perimeter of power with dubious intents and undermining governments they are elected just because they are not interested.
There is a double danger to describe the trying situation of the Buhari administration as they have to handle such nombers of formidable enemies unleashing many assaults on nation.
To that extent, only two groups of politicians can be: those who participate with positive minds in the democratic dispensation as partners in moving the country forward.
By what they do and what they do, we all know them!
At the end of the day, the majority of Nigerians are ordinary citizens who are conditioned to survive not follow or depend on where they come from.
They struggle every day to make living follow their submission to the will of one God even as their faith is different.
Nigeria is a fatherland put by destiny, and they remain loyal, following and praying, because they know that they don't have any other country to call them own, to any other country to call them own,
They are also known that Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) have been using inciting, unguarding and unguarding
The remaining prayers in the poor mans mouth are:
GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS, GOD IS

Second U.S. congresswoman tests positive for COVID-19 after Capitol crisis
Pramila Jayapal, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said she contacted the Coronavirus (COVID-19) after it was locked in the same room with some Republican laws.
I just received a positive COVID-19 test after me was locked down in a secure room in the Capitol where several Republicans who were not wicked not to wear masks but were locked down in a secure room
Earlier on Monday, U.S. Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman said she also contracted COVID-19 with possible exposure during the time of the lockdown in the Capitol.
Jayapal, a member of the Democratic Party, accused lawmakers from the Republicans of causing COVID-19 spread and said they should be punished.
Any member who refuses to wear a face mask should be held accountable for putting our life in danger because he is an idiot.
I am calling for every member who refused to wear masks in the Capitol to be fined and removed from the floor, she said in a post on Facebook.
It is not clear if the two congresswomen were in the same room during the lockdown in the Capitol.
Jayapal was unhappy as U.S. President Donald Trump failed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S and vowed to do everything in her power to remove it from office.

Why National Assembly cannot impeach Buhari Senator in Oyo
The Senator representing Oyo North Senatorial District, Fatai Buhari, has said the National Assembly has not seen reasons to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari.
Senator said this while paying Salahs visit to former governor of Oyo State, Rashidi Ladoja, saying there is a process to impeach the president.
Senator Buharis submission came one day after Senator Yusuf Abubakar (APC Taraba) and Cahir of the Senate committee on special duties said to leave President Buhari would not be able to return to the
People call for President Buhari to resign or impeach him as insecurity in the country.
But Senator Buhari has asked those who want to break the country to not create problems that are not easy to solve.
There is a process to impeach a president.
Anyone who calls for impeaching the president gives a better reason to do impeachement.
We have not seen reasons to impeach the president.
If there is need, we will table it, discuss it, and the two houses must come together.
To impeach the president is not what a person will just wake up one day and say.
It has a procedure.
Why do you want to cause a problem including confusions that you cannot solve?
That was he asked.
On the security problems of the country, the lawmaker said: We have no other country than Nigeria.
Nigeria is our country and home.
We should try to do internal security.
Let us play our own part; not leave everythimg to the government alone.
We should put local police to know all the places.
No matter how it is, we know each other.
In the early 80s, we were traveling in the night.
But at the level of insecurity now, somethimg is missing.
He said the 9th National Assembly had discussed security more than 59 times.
We have discussed security issues more than 30 times in the 8th Assembly, and this 9th Assembly has discussed it more than 50 times.
Everyone should be vigilant, despite changing service chiefs many times, it won't solve the security problem, the senator said.
Ranchers support CBN to put forex restrictions on import of dairy
The Commercial Ranchers Association of Nigeria (CODARAN) has shown support for the restrictions on foreign exchange of dairy products.
Remember that the Central Bank of Nigeria has issued a circular over one year now on companies restricted from foreign exchange to import milk.
But during a visit to the governors of the CBN recently, the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said the European Union would have been interested in the
In a statement issued by the CORAN, in a statement by Dianabasi Akpainyang, the CORAN said Nigeria has the potential to take harvest dairy products that would provide jobs and create jobs.
The CBN governor is right.
Truely, Nigeria has the potential to meet, plus sustain the dairy requirements.
Akpainyang said the milk grounded for collection and processing is not near that figure for now, but he noted that since it is likely, it is necessary for everyone to put legs.
While citing a report from the CBN that Nigeria spends $1.5 billion yearly to import dairy products, he said the figure would increase as demand increases.
He also mentioned issues such as poor productivity of local cows, cow nutrition, animal disease management system, as there is no better organised system to produce milk, as there is no better organi
However, he said the Advancing Local Dairy Development in Nigeria (ALDDN) programme running presently in four states Adamawa, Kaduna, Kano and Plateau has already been implemented.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has disclosed that it has registered 2.5m members in Lagos for its nationwide and revalidation exercises.
Chaiman of the APC Registration Supervisory Committee in Lagos, Dr. Muhammad Bashiru, said during the closing of a recommendation letter to the supervisor that about 2.5 per cent of the registration
But the People Democractic Party (PDP), the leading opposition party, has described the figure as false and fake.
PDP said APC has a habit of cooking figures to make people believe they are popular, PDP said.
The PDP spokesperson, Taofik Gani, in a chat with Daily Trust described the APC as a party fulled by liars, saying the party is not popular.
This is not the first time figures are carried out.
Even in the last election, the total number of votes by APC was around 600,000.
He said the claim that they have 2.5 million is false and fake.
Our correspondent reports that APC candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu won the governorship election in 2019 with 739,445 votes while President Muhammadu Buhari had 580,825 votes.
The state chairman of the National Conscience Party (NCP), Comrade Bayo Ogunleye, has described the claim by the APC as the greatest lie in the century.
But the spokesman of the APC, Seye Oladejo, told our correspondent that the party would prove nombers for the local government election on July 24.
FG says Geographical Indications will promote diversification of economy
The Federal Government has stressed that Geographical Indications (GIs) will help in promoting diversification of the economy and also support participation on the African Continent.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono said this in the capacity building workshop on GIs for public sector /policymakers in the country.
Nanono, represented by the Deputy Director of Irrigation and Crop Development, Hajia Sugra Mahmood, noted that if the initiative was effectively used, would support the preservation of the agricultur
According to him, it can assist in commercializing the products of food culture and other cultures and enable actors in the value chain to benefit from commercialization.
Therefore, this workshop happens at a crucial moment when this administration is working tirelessly to diversify the economy away from hydrocabons by other sectors like the environment.
This kind of initiatives promoting GIs will help to fast track the process of diversification of the economy and also support our participation in the African Continental Forum.
Gis can cause a revival of the economy in rural areas as we have seen it in the case of some properly branded products such as Ofada rice, kilishi, Dudu Osu.
It will also make it the documentation of our indigenous knowledge which is sad as we lose over time.
The current administration is ready to partner with all relevant stakeholders both local and foreign in biding to preserve the natural and bio-cultural endowment of the country.
Earlier, the Minister of Satte Industry, Trade and Investment, Haija Mariam Katagum, in her welcome address said the workshop was designed to specifically train public sectors in the country.
She said we cannot avoid as the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) comes into effect, which puts responsibility on the people making decisions to be made.

Korda breaks through in Parma clay
On the eve at Roland Garos, a 20-year-old American scored a career breakthrough when he beat Italian Marco Cecchinato 6-2, 6-4, in Parma in a first.
Korda, the son of the former world
No 2 and Australian Open winner Petr Korda, who has not entered the ATP tour final before the event in Parma, has never won consecutive matches on clay.
Cecchinato, who won all his three titles on clay, comes from Brescia, 90 kilometres from Parma.
The fans allowed to enter the event for the first time were supporting the local boy.
Today I played a tough opponent and that was not easy, Korda said.
They continue to cheer him on, but I am proud for myself.
And how I handled it.
Although his father is from Czech, Sebastian Korda, who was born in Florida, decided to represent the US.
The victory made him the first American player to win a clay court tournament since Sam Querrey in Belgrade after 11 years.
This is something that has been in my dreams, Korda said, adding he expected to win the title soon as he named an event in Florida in January.
I really thought I would do it at Delray Beach, and it broke my heart small.
What not should be weared in public: Negating Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Is it a pure coincidence that, as troubles were smelling in Kwara State recently, there was a solution to it in the lower House of the National Assembly of the state.
The trouble in Ilorin is as the refuse of some Christian faith schools to allow Muslim students to wear hijabs in school.
The solution for this predicament is the debate on Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention).
RDPP Bill, 2021, ridiculating Hijab Bill in a section of media in Nigeria.
Both events spark heated arguments and often emotional debates which, at the bottom of everything, threaten to negate the multicultural identity and reality of Nigeria.
The whole idea in Kwara of the proprietors of schools as they ban Muslim students wearing hijabs and their sympathisers could be reduced to what they should not wear.
This is another major part of the concerns of the RDPP Bill before the House of Representatives the humiliation and denial of opportunities.
What females in Nigeria are facing because of what they wear in public.
It is clear that the former clearly breached the fundamental human right of the Muslim students to take express their faith without discrimination; even though the school could get the right to expre
The latter tries to assert this right not only for Muslims alone but also for Christians whenever they are threatened with discrimination because of their fauth.
To run through the argument proposed by the proprietors of Christian faith schools in Kwara, it is easy for one to understand the pragmatic appeal of the argument that Muslim children should be educa
The problem of the death argument is many.
First, saying Muslim students should go to another place unless they agree to the rule of the school on uniform does very little to promote inclusiveness, which is the bedroom of the school.
Secondaly, the position asks a moral question: Can we justify to base rules in schools on the Christian majoritarians of the school?
Then, the third one, the argument will elsewhere appear to have ignored the difficulties in changing school for a child.
The inconveniences are so many.
When changing schools for their children, education psychologists will tell you that it interferes negatively with not just emotional but academic development too.
Finally, the christian faith schools by themselves risk what they call ghettorization by concentrating students with the same religious beliefs in particular schools.
The social cost of this thing will have for society plebty.
The Commissioner of Education, Kemi Adeosun, argued, while speaking with a press conference, that the government is convinced that the policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear clothes in th
In a country that guarantees freedom of religion, which signs the Declaration of International Human Rights, the basic question is: how justifiable is to deny children?
It is a great concern because Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
The UDHR insists that all human beings are free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
It contains 30 articles on rights and freedom including, among others, the right to life, free speech and privacy.
It includes economy, social and cultural rights, such as the right to get health and education.
I saw articles 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to the issue in consideration and we quoted them below:
Everyone has the freedom to believe what they want, including religious beliefs.
We have the right to change our beliefs or religions any time, and the right to practice our religions in public or private, alone or with others.
Everyone should have a right to education.
Primary schools should be free.
We should continue our studies as far as we have the wish.
In school we should help us develop our talents and teach us how to respect everyones human rights.
They also should teach us how to get on with others whatever their ethnicity, religion, or country.
Our parents have the right to choose which school we will go.
All these laws are the instruments that give Muslim women like Ilhan Omar the equality to sit in the House of Representatives in the US and she stated that she stated.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omarna is an American politician who served as the U.S. Representative in the 5th Congregation of Minnesota District since 2019.
The Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Finance matters, representing Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Niger State, was sponsored by the Deputy Chairman of the House
Saidu Musa Abdullahi.
The bill is to address discriminatory conducts, including prohibiting discrimination on religious matters when it concerns religious matters when it concerns religious matters when it concerns religi
It will stop qualifying and proffesional collaborations, education institutions, people of employment and other sectors to discriminate against a person, student or person in the country.
When passed, the law will bury issues such as what we saw in Kwara for good; when passed, the law will bury issues like what we saw in Kwara.
It will also address the bigot behaviour of executives who carry prejudice enter public office and allow them to cover their sense of judgement.
The law should be welcomed.
After all, it is only to expand and expatiate the provisions in the Nigerian constitution and in UDHR documents as we are above.
It follows line with similar laws in the country to tackle social problems and cultural practices harmful the law that prohibits violence.
As disability is trying to eliminate any discrimination facing people with disability, VAPP faces domestic plus other gender violence across the country.
One by one, people representing us in the legislative chambers have been using legal instruments to tackle all social challenges facing our country.
They address all these social roughness not only because there is no law to address them, but they want to carry everythimg together for not allowing them to finish.
While there is no instrument to take enforce it and there is no instrument to take enforce it, the RDPP law and other laws resembling it are grounded to carry punishments and offer offers.
While contradicting the views of critics, as far as the RDPP Bill is concerned, there is no proven that they want to put a state of religion on any state that can domesticate the country.
It does not go against Section 10 of the Constitution in Nigeria which supports that the Government of a Federation or a State cannot adopt any religion as State Religion.
To push the argument, because the bill calls for the general public to respect the rights of women who are Muslims who wear Hijab in public places, that it is only to quench the right of women who we
In the final analysis, it goes against our multicultural pretenses to deny any Nigerian be it male or female religios freedom.
It is against equality, and basic human rights in the constitution of Nigeria and the legal document of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
A bill to make such decisions on religion become criminal, like the RDPP bill will have a welcome nod.

Three just born children die in fire incident in Indian hospital
Ten new children were killed on Saturday in a fire in a state-running hospital in western Idia, officials said.
There were 17 new children in the unit when the fire broke on Saturday at the Bhandara District General Hospital in Maharashtra State.
Seven new children died as smoke choked and three died because of fire, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.
Nurses and ward staff rescue seven babies
The age of all the new children is from few days to three months, as the health district official in Bhandara said.
The government has ordered to probe in the incident and conduct a safety audit in a unit taking care of new people in the country.
Initial reports indicate that the fire may have occurred because of one of the short circuits in one of the incubators, Tope said.
The staff said a lot of black smoke filled the ward quickly, as the minister added.
The legal requirements have been waived and the childrens bodies have been taken to their families, Tope said.
Families of the victim will get compensation of 500,000 rupees (up to 6,814 dollars) for each family.
Police pursue newspaper sellers for reports on IPOB
Police harass newspaper sellers and readers in Abia State.
Daily Trust reports that since the weekend police from the Aba Area Command have been arresting sellers of newspapers and readers concerning reports on the incident.
Residents said there was fear at Ama-Ogbonna Junction in the commercial city when police raided the place on Sunday.
A spokesman on his eye said residents were running to safety, as police personnel were shot anyhow, while trying to arrest sellers of newspapers and printers.
The sellers of newspapers of the story were accused of containing the sit-at-home order given by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, who was in his eyes, urged the state government and igbo leaders to call the police authorities to call the police authorities for not causing incidents in the country.
The kind of people we are putting in police makes me wonder whether we want anything good to from this country.
How will someone pursue newspaper sellers in Aba, in the morder world?
If you stop people from reading a hard copy of a newspaper, do you still stop them from reading the same story on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram, etc.
What kind of old police style is this?
They caused panic on Sunday as they shot and made noise.
The whole neighbourhood is chasing kidnappers.
It was later discovered that a vendor and readers were arrested, who gathered at his newspaper stand.
How will police follow newspaper sellers?
Which kind of problems can a paper cause that social media cannot cause time 20?
These people are not normal,he said.
Micheal Anorue, another resident, said almost all the sellers of newspapers he visited in Aba, said almost all the sellers of newspapers he visited in Aba.
They are empty on Tuesday.
We heard on Saturday and Sunday that the newpaper carried stories concerning the sit-at-hom order to honour heroes in Biafra matter, he said.
The early political leaders in the South East, remind these reckless police officers that Biafra bigger than IPOB, the better for them.
Does the proscribing of the IPOB mean that Biafra has also been proscribed?
We are Biafrans.
On the 30th of May, the World Igbo Congress (WIC) held a zoom conversation, discussing the fallen hero in Biafra.
Why do police do not go to Youtube, Zoom and other social media that carry the matter on air?
All they do is to come on the street and begin making unnecessary troubles.
I wish the leader of Igboland to warn these reckless police officers to not allow these reckless police officers to enter Aba because it would be worst for everyone.
Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, denied that police were arresting newspaper sellers and readers.
NAMA frowns face as air traffic controller laments poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) in Nigeria on Sunday cried out concerning the dilapitated navigational equipment at most airports in the country.
The ATCs under the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) say the situation is a threat for air safety.
They also said the International Airport in Kaduna had a control tower that could help aircraft to navigate without problems.
President of the NATCA, Yomi Agoro, in a chat with newsmen on the weekend, said the things at Kaduna airport were a watchroom of other aviation personnel.
He also said other airports in the country did not have the equipment necessary to navigate without problems.
He explained that some airports did not even have functional equipment.
Even Kaduna has no control tower.
What is used there is a watch room (for firefighters), and it is not for that purpose, and we are calling the government to do somethimg.
We enter into Sokoto, if rain falls, controllers will take an umbrella to sit in the control tower, and what happened, some of the attached control towers were attached to the terminal.
We all follow terrestial radio frequency fights, communication here and there.
Calabar is here; there is no airport today that works up to 80 per cent.
NAMA recently employed and trained 40 new controllers, but NATCA said the number was too low to meet the shortfall.
However, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, told Daily Trust that the claims are not true.
He said the federal government has put huge investments in improving navigational aids and to help safe flight operations.
It is mere politics, he said.
Government has spent much not too long to improve aviation infrastructure.
I don't just say this because I am a MD of NAMA.
If you want to hear the true story, my suggestion is always, ask people on the street, ask people for NAMA, they will tell you, they have never seen good like this under this administration.
It is painful that people say this.
We have no Category Three (CAT3), this government has put two on ground, another two still coming.
Government spends N1.7bn on mobile control tower
Also the revitalisation of the safe tower is also ongoing.
We are reconstructing the TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Other sectors should be jealous.
E-commerce in Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospects
E-commerce refers to the use of communication technology especially the internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
The internet has brought a fundamental shift into economies near each other because of brier entering ross-border trade and investment, which distance far, time zone and language.
E-commerce fosters direct access to nearer markets and promotes globalisation and commercial activities plus eliminates the distinction between domestic and foreign markets.
E-commerce is not limited to buying of products alone, it includes e-mail, plus other communication platforms, all the information or services that a company can offer to customers on.
The major significance of commerce is in the fact that it encourages a single world system of trading which is accessed through electronic means to take good and profitable decisions.
Most of the statues on ground in Nigeria lag behind towards the development and growth of e-commerce in particular and the whole ICT.
In Nigeria, many legal researches and studies have been conducted.
Many in the study carry opinions that the legal system in Nigeria is lagging behind in legislation involving ICT and that the statutory laws have been grounded.
These issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment systems and inevitably trans-border issues, among others.
Therefore, there is a need to bring out proper legal and regulatory measures to govern the new regime.
It has been said that in Nigeria, significant efforts to regulate e-commerce-related activities are still at the stage of the Sraft Bill before the National Assembly.
It is important to know that, despite the passage of this bill into law, Nigeria may still face new legal issues in this area that call for legislative intervention.
With the speed the internet takes work on commercial transactions in Nigeria, especially in the banking and communication sector of the economy, the best that delivers the commercial transactions is
To achieve this, the National Assembly should pressure the National Assembly to take pass bills concerning electronic commerce as top priority so that they will be enacted into law as quick as possib
For a small time, our courts should take a giant step to interprete the grounded traditional laws in a liberal way to cut gaps in order to make the laws they have.
Indeed, they argue that legislation is not the only means that electronic transactions and attendant documentation can be legal.
The court can also adapt to recognise electronic transactions in the absence of legislation or private contracts.
According to former Justice Bungham, the common law is in the hands of judges the same facilities [as law merchants] to adapt to the needs of the general public.
We are hoping that the government will adopt this activism of Nigerian judges in the judiciary, Supreme Court judges also involve, expectially in areas where our existing legislations are included.
This will set a better precedence to ensure e-commerce consumers have protection, bringing investors and bringing economic development plus stability in the country.
The issue of contracts in e-commerce is documentation and signature.
The provision in Section 4 of the Statute of Fraud, 1677 or the Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and our various statutes on real property and landed instrument development, as well as our vario
The question now is whether electronic sign-off constitutes a valid sign-off contract by email or by binding?
Many of these issues have not been settled even in the UK although some decisions are favouring towards interpreting electronic signatures.
So marks in emails that satisfy the traditional requirements of writing and due execusion.
E-commerce transactions are transactions that do not involve paper through magnetic materials like tapes or disks.
This is a contradiction to the transaction that is embodied in permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures.
Such transactions cannot be altered without altering the face of the document.
As it concerns signature, the provision in section 93 (2)(3), Evidence Act 2011, electronic signature related to a data message will conveniently satisfy any requirement that should be made available
The provision in article 7 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law for e-commerce 1996 is equally trite on this issue.
Thus, for the purpose of establishing proofs of electronic signatures.
Using passwords, identifications, user names etc may suffice.
Hence one can safely say that an electronic signature for purpose of execution is admissible for evidence provided that it is certified and incorporated in electronic communication.
Also, other legal challenges affecting e-commerce include the formation of contracts.
The elements for better formation of a contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relations.
The question is, at which point can offers be made with regard to electronic business transactions or now to differentiate between invitations to treat and offers electronic businesses?
E-commerce requires confidence and trust the satisfaction that transmits an order or invoice does not have any matter and comes from whoever it appears to be.
There is a need for a guarantee concerning level of privacy/confidenciality in information.
Lastly, the alarming rate of cybercrime in Nigeria, including a high level of illiterate.
No doubt that electronic transactions are an aspect of commercial transactions in Nigeria and has come to stay this time.
The government should go pass to making laws, activate as they use the electronic platform for their commercial interaction and delivery of government services.

Chad passes new chartes as Debys son president
Chad has passed a charter that declares Mahamat Idris Deby as president, despite rumours on social media that he has died.
Mahamat took over to replace his father, Idriss Deby, who was killed this week.
The charter said the 37-year-old, a son to a late war veteran, was named transitional leader quickly on Tuesday as head of the military council after his death.
The charter repealed the preceding constitution and would be implemented as the basic law of the republic, according to the templates in it.
The young Deby has also been named as the supreme head of the armed forces, he said.
Debys son overseed the security of his father when he was the head of the elite presidential guard and often appeared along with his father.
The best known Mahamat Deby is a top commander of the forces in Chad who helps United Nations peacekeeping mission in the restive north of neighbouring Nigeria.
He signed a decree on Tuesday as he set out a military council including himself and 14 others known to be loyal to the late president.
The task given to the council is to move into free and democractic elections within 18 months.
Mahamat Idris Deby is the chair of the military transition council, the Council of Ministers, the Council of Superior Committees of National Defence, according to the charter.
The new head of state will declare legislation adopted by 69 members of the national transition council, named by Mahamat.
The Transition Charter, which contains 95 articles, also guarantees freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
There is a transition government, which will be named by the new president.
The charter says all members of army called to the transitional government have been freed from all military work.
Law in Chad
The killed leader, who ruled with strong hands for more than 30 years, gave to wounds he had when he visited a battlefield where Chad soldiers were fighting rebel groups in the country.
Calling for calm, the army also announced a curfew at 6pm and closed the borders in the country, suspending the constitution and dissolving the National Assembly.
However, opposition politicians in Chad have rejected the army appointment of President Idris Deby's son to take over following his death.
Experts say under the law in Chad, the speaker of parliament should have acquired power after Debys death, not his son.
What the constitution states if the president is dead or dies, then the speaker of the parliament will take charge of the country for 40 days and so transition will be put into place.
But] the military announced that they had dissolved the legislative assembly and dissolved the constitution, so what they did is replace the constitution with their own constitution.
Chelseas points can be returned after the brawl with Leicester.
Chelsea are facing a deduction of points from the FA for the team following failure to control their players, Mirror reports.
In seven years, the team has been able to show hot temper to opponents seven times.
The recent brawl in a match on Tuesday night Leicester marked the seven encounters Chelsea had with Premier League teams.
It marked the match last week between Chelsea and Leicester among players of both teams.
With the same offence in the past, the FA decided to punish Chelsea.
Leicester also face charges for their roles in the brawl involving players and coaches as Ricardo Pereira challenged Ben Chilwell.
In 2016, Chelsea were also charged for indiscipline, after appealing against a 375,000 dollar fine for the part they played in a burst-up during the match.
If it affects them, the leaving point will affect their season very well as they enter the final campaign to get a spot in the top four.
US Africom in Nigeria? No!
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
That is the resentful and contemptuous opinion many British people have for the thousands of American GIs who stationed in several military bases in Britain during the Second World War.
The gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising soldiers from America frequently get into dangerous pub fights and knife fights that cause bad health.
And this is the pattern that American soldiers have been taking behaving everywhere at the hundreds of American military bases oversea from Okinawa in Japan, Stuttgart in Nigeria, Stuttgart in Nigeri
That was why I was upset, like many Nigerians, that a virtual meeting last week with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, was reported.
We are thinking that with this kind of call, President Buhari is making way for Nigeria to host Africom.
In the first place, it was a breach of protocol for President Buhari to have that meeting with the American Secretary of State.
The meeting was supposed to be held with Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who carried the details to meet president later.
Yes, America is a superpower and all, but protocols are protocols and should be followed strictly in every circumstance.
We understand that Nigeria is facing a huge internal security challenge which is likely to be more than the best efforts by the government and security establishments in the nation.
Terrorist insurgencies were not tired by the North East banditry, kidnapping in the North West, farmers/herders clashed all over the country and targeting and killing farmers/herders.
But even at that, the call to host Africom on Nigerias siol when we consider it against various issues and implications of this move to Nigeria is difficult to justify.
Africom is one of nine of these commands established by the American military to serve Americas strategic interests around the world.
By their rules and ways of operation, these commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, were not set up primarily to concern themselves with security and transportation.
They only do so when such issues affect the interests of America directly in the area and in such situation, they are not mandated to yield them modus operandi and share in them.
If Africom is set up in Nigeria for instance, it will be an island on its own as it will restrict access to Nigerians of all categories and establishing a jurisdiction withing the territory.
As it is usually happening with American military bases outside America, Africom will be a forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and will source for activities in the United S
In this particular case of Africom, part of its original concept is to control how the strategic influence of Nigeria is growing in West Africa and Africa as we get successful.
The before Africom was the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) set up by the Clinton administration to take counter the strategic interests of Nigeria in institutions.
The Secretary of State for President Clinton, the dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, has visited a number of African countries secretly to sell the idea.
But because Nigeria is the target, he pointedly left him from his itinerary.
Senegal, which is not far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, is supposed to be the coordinating base of the ACRI and though its initiatives to facilitate assistance of America to the country.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to the idea from France, which was averse to seeing the Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence.
In the review, which draws the expertise of the American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions that the American Congress carried out to discuss the challenges
Thus, to follow on the recommendations of experts who gathered, which formed all angles of political and security establishments in America, the Bush Junior Administration was adopted by the Bush Jun
As US Central Command (USCENTCOM) takes to the Middle East and Asia, so Africom will be to Africa, as it based in Florida, European Command (EUCOM), based in Stuttgart, and the European Command (EUCO
The presence of French military has surrounded Nigeria already as they are in Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin.
The Americans also have drone bases in Niger.
To add Africom to the mix in Nigeria will amount to a complete capitulation of our strategic interests to both France and America.
As we mind that our strategic interests plus profiles in Africa do not always follow with those in France and America, to host Africom in Nigeria will be the same.
There is nothing in the insecurity challenge facing a country that our armed forces cannot cope with.
This was after the military forces that eventually secured Liberia and Seirra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents who were well-entrenched and organised in the country.
It is regretable that the Nigerian military, having fallen from high standards they are known, struggling now to cope with the activities of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, the military in Nigeria still has the capacity and capability to defeat this threat to our national security if they have the right leadership.
We need all the assistance and cooperation the American people can give us if they want us.
But as we have been held in hand to host Africom with our circumstances in view of its antecedents and implications to our strategic interests, on our soil.
Upon facing a challenge, Plateau target 7m metric tons of Irish potato
In Nigeria, Irish potato is planted in nine of the 17 local government areas of the state.
The Potato Value Chain Support Project of the African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative is Plateau as a state with 90 per cent of the potato production in the country.
The large potato production in Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, a leading source of information on the global potato industry, has made Nigeria the nombar three in the world.
However, farmers said lack of reach and bad road networks, plus as the cost of fertilizer and other farming inputs continue to stand as major setbacks for the production.
Other challenges that contribute to low yield and loss of harvest to the potato value chain include diseases such as blight and bacterial wilt, including poor seedlings.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State is among the ten poorest states in Nigeria with a poverty rate over 70%.
However, the state has a comparative advange to boost economic activities by improving the competitiveness of the potato commodity value chain.
The Project Coordinator of the Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, said despite the visibility of the tuber crop is evident in nine local government areas in the country.
Potato is produced more than any LGA across the country.
However, Muopshin said adaptability research indicates that the remaining eight LGA in the state can also plant potato, that would make all 17 LGA in Plate.
However, the Association of Potato Farmers (APF) in the state, said unless they address the challenges facing the value chain, increase production and export of potato to the country.
Chairman of the APF in Plateau State, Lazarus Makut, in an interview with Daily Trust, said the inadequate small dam, especially in remote areas where they have been developed, was caused by inadequa
He said the cost of mechanised farming that can increase production quickly has become expensive as the majority of farmers are small scale producers who are unable to afford affordable production.
Another farmer, Martha Mamgup, who plants potatoes in Ampang town in Mangu LGA, said lack of water during the dry season affected potato farmers and harvesters.
Because of this, the majority of farmers searched for the location of a borehole to farm to access irrigation water for their farms.
Martha also explained that the high cost of fertilizer prevents many farmers from improving quantities plus quality of yield, adding that when fertilizer is not available, it affects farmers.
The cost also prevents many of us from expanding the business.
So, getting fertilizer is not easy for us.
She said the construction of more dams including a borehole for irrigation would lead to increased production of potatoes.
If the watre is not available for the crop, it will dry and later die and that is why some farmers who have the resources prefer to dig boreholes in Mangu for irrigation because they have the resourc

Production to reach 7million metric tons after completion of lab
With potato production in Plateau State which has jumped from 1,656,650 metric tons in 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons in 2020, the establishment of the Potato Value Chain Support Services (PVCSS) has
The officer who Monitors and Evaluates the state's Potato Value Chain Support Project in the state, Baleri Yakubu, told Daily Trust that the state is expected to start production.
However, Yakubu said the state government should tackle other challenges facing farmers, especially the one of fertilizer as well as dam and road networks as expected.
Our correspondent learnt that the tissue culture lab, intended to improve potato yield in the state by providing clean seeds that are resistant to pests and other diseases.
Yakubu said it is certain that the advent of the lab will improve income for farmers and revenue for the state government and will also help food security in the country.
Farmers in Plateau State, however, believe that the tissue, if fully equipped, will reduce the cost of treatment for the crops when diseases affect them.
They also hope that better quality seeds will be available at affordable prices.
FG yet to return £4.2m Ibori loot to Delta Accountant General
The Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) reavealed on Wednesday that the Federal Government has not returned the £4.2 million loot recovered from former governments.
The funds are still waiting for the funds after they resolve the issues with him before any further action.
For now, any funds have been returned to Delta State, according to a statement from the office, said the director of information, Press and Public Relations, Henshaw Ogubike.
The statement said the issue of the £4.2million was yet to be resolved.
In a previous comment made by the Accountant General of the National Assembly that the loot has been returned to the government of Delta, Henshaw Ogubike said: The Agf is only getting the loot to the
The three Super League strongheads did not gree against UEFA coercion.
Super League three Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus insisted on Wednesday that they are remaining committed to modernising football despite threats to discipline the clubs.
UEFA opened a formal disciplinary campaign on Tuesday against three clubs who did not greet to give up on the aborted Super League projects.
In a joint statement, Juventus in Italy, and the two Spanish sides said they were remaining committed to modernising football through an open dialogue with UEFA.
FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express absolute rejection of the insistent coercion mentained by the UEFA towards the three relevant institutions.
This attitude reached to raise alarm constitutes a breach of the decisions made by the courts of justice, which have made a clear statement to warn UEFA to stop taking any actions that have been made
Therefore, as UEFA takes disciplinary proceedings are incomprehensible and is a direct attack against the rule of law that we, who are citizens of the European Union, have built up.
China gives reach 140 million COVID-19 vaccines
China has administered 139.97 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of April 4, 2021, according to the National Health Commission (NHC) of the country.
China is working to ensure vaccination efforts in major areas and key sector industries based on the overall plan of the country, inoculating the eligible population.

So far, China has approved COVID-19 vaccines produced by five enterprises for conditional marketing or for emergency use.
Phase III of three unactivated vaccines and an adenovirus vaccine showed that they efficacy met the requirements of the National Medical Products Administration for the country.
Phase II trials for the recombinant protein subunit vaccine appoved for emergency use have shown that the vaccine is safe and can cause strong immune response.
All the COVID-19 vaccines adopted by China have gone through clinical studies according to relevant standards, approved by the national drug regulatory organization.
All vaccines should be monitored and recorded from time to time to ensure that they meet requirements on temperature environment and transportation.
Li added that the health regulators in China have also enhanced efforts in the training of health workers, requiring them to obey operating instructions, so that they will be able to comply with the

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang
Twelve months ago, Ramoni Abass (37 years), known as a hushpuppi was arrested in June 2020 in Dubai allegedly for doing money laundering from business email compromises.
The total money he made was $435 million after he defrauded 1,926,400 victims.
After a year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also arrested Abidemi Rufai (Sandy Tangâ), Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Abidemi Rufai, Senior Special As
The funds were relief money for the pandemic designed by Washington State for people who may have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The fraud happened during the lockdown and the investigation bureau began tracking the alleged fraudsters making laws in the Nigeria Federal House of Representatives if they were allegedly making law
The fraud was done by stealing identities of more than 100 Washington residents as they filled false claims with the Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment.
They created new e-mail accounts for each stolen identity to identify the claims with different people to escape the automatic fraud detection system.
After that, over $288,000 were paid for his bank account in America between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime is a global threat to people, organisations and countries.
Nigeria loses over $128 billion to cybercrimes annually.
By the end of 2021, the world will have lost a total of $6 trillion.
Till date, over 40 Nigerians have been investigated for complicity in fraudulent scams.
The alleged unemployment benefit fraud by Rufai will be under what I have called COVID-19 fraud in Nigeria.
This is a scam that uses loopholes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to scam people, government pr organizations.
During the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria, cybercriminals were doing frauds along the interventions from government and private sectors and scammed many and some of the scammers were alleged to have be
Domino pizza fraud, federal government cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among others.
When there are cyber-criminality outside Nigeria, some youngsters are doing it in Nigeria.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is arresting them and trying to convict them.
Understanding the culture that sustains cyber-criminality can help a serious government to fight the crime.
The family is the larger world in the larger society.
It is the place where normal human beings should be nutured in the society.
Apart from the fact that many families in Nigeria are in the dungeon of poverty and it is hard to take care of their children, some of the children have become breadwinners, among others.
Ethical behaviour training in many houses is a challenge as parents and children gathered for cyber-criminality.
In some other places, yahoo boys mothers are forming associations to celebrate their childrens successes and justify the criminal things they do.
In the religious setting, pastors, alfa and traditionalists make home and benefit from yahoo-boyism.
Moral teachings have come for materialistic Pentecostalism to enter.
It has a viral video where some boys were spraying money while shepherds in a white garment church were enjoying the captive the moment, members of the church.
The children born in 1999 when Nigeria entered democracy again are 21 years now.
Sadly, they grow to appreciate lies as a way of life from politicians their mouths (and in many cases from home) who decieve people to vote for them and in many cases from home that decieve people to
Lying is also the foundation of the sociology of hushpuppism.
Youths socialise daily in corruption by public officers.
They are seeing how the system gives farmers soft landing (in public or private).
Do they ask how many fraud and corruption allegations have been investigated and discharged with punishment when the accuse is guilty?
The majority of cases ended with off-the-mic like the Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case as the Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case ended like a family affair.
The youths are seen as celebrating flamboyant lifestyle in dirty.
They are seeing how poor political aspirants become millionaires within months of entering office.
They see how traditional institutions have become cash and carry when giving chieftancy titles.
Tertiary educational institutions, with few exceptions, award undeserving honours in exchange for money.
All of those who mismanage money have soft landing.
To add to this list of cultures that nuture cybercrime is the lyrical glamour that some Nigerian musicians present cybercrime as work and presenting cybercrime as work.
If a fraud person is elected as a legislator, will he make laws against the involved crimes?
The process that party leaders are taking to give party nominations to the highest bid needs to be reviewed if we want to stop importing problematic tokunbo things into ourselves.
It is unfortunate that the critical reasonings of party leaders go low when shown money.
They provided a platform for dubious characters to cover up and the society was worse with their actions.
Greed also causes cyber-criminality.
The FBI agent incestigating Rufai, Donald Voiret said greed is a powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, the greed alleged by these defendants is affecting all taxpayers.
To move forward, we cannot live in sin, expecting grace to abound.
Nigeria should sanitise its anti-coruption system and implement accoutability policies to track lifestyle with material accumulation.
We must give youths in Nigeria hope by creating employment opportunities, reducing poverty and reviewing reward systems.
The EFCC needs to invest in technology and expose detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
The commission needs to complete investigation before the arrest of suspects as the FBI did before the arrest of huspects and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless they tackle the culture of sustaining cybercrimes in Nigeria with social social engineering, cyber-criminality will continue to spread.

New challenges in Lagos PDP concerning LG polls
A new issue is gathering in the Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) concerning the release of guidelines for the conduct of the local government.
Engr Doherty, who has been in battle with many of his colleagues at the State Working Committee (SWC), which led to his suspension recently, released the guidelines on Friday.
It can be remembered that the State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has released the timetable for the elections held on Saturday, July 24, 2021.
In the lingering internal strife in the State PDP, the Chairman released the guidelines, which as we heard was not good in the eyes of most of the executive members who spoke to the party.
A member of the state executive said the chairman planned the timetable unilaterally and did not involve other executive members.
We later heard that the other factions of the party opposed Doherty could counter the embattled Chairman this over the guidelines.
The executive member who spoke under condition to be anonymous said the positions of the vexed members would enter public this week, insisting that key members of the committee would be sidelined by
How it feels to be born in the pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
When news of death are everywhere, a new life brings happines and hope.
On January 1, 2020, a new morning, two red lines changed my life.
I have a belle and I am happy.
It is a mamzing start to a new year.
It was the most remarkable year of my life.
All of a sudden, everythimg changes.
My daughter Roshomon Tara was born at the end of the first lockdown in Dhaka, Bangladesh; she is now nine months old.
She was the reason I became mother in the middle of the global crisis.
Not only her was born, but also a new me, mama Tara, who spent the whole pregnancy in lockdown at home and born the children in emergency conditions in the emergency.
Tara has seen the world with masks and isolation.
Her grandma are also fearing to touch her or come near her without wearing a mask.
If there is no pandemic, my journey to enter motherhood was different.
This Mothers Day was very special as my children were in my front, looking at me and smiling.
On the last mothers day, she was growing in me.
The only thing that doesnt change, meanwhile, is the pandemic.
It was 16 weeks belle in me when the pandemic happened and the world entered lockdown.
I am struggling to survive the pandemic with my hormonal and physical changes.
The 22 weeks are like war.
My husband, Sina Hasan was a musician, and all his concerts were cancelled at that time.
I have been a freelance journalist since January 1, 2021.
So we are depending on what I have saved already, and we spend all my savings.
Our parents and two journalists associations came forward to help at the main time.
I am fearing everythimg.
Most of the time, it is like it is dead.
They are knocking on our doors.
I am adapting to a new life where we click on and deliver our things or home-delivery.
I have to wait for a week to deliver groceries as day.
I even feared to send the only family member who lives with me, my husband to leave to buy food storage.
So, I don't eat.
Besides, I couldn't go for my antenatal check-up as they gave me time.
And I am not sure if my children are growing well or if timely development takes place.
I am sorry for my unborn child that I am bringing him into a world that is as different from him.
Tele-medication helped me pass some hard times in the last three months.
I forget the face of my gynaecologist.
I cannot imagine she would take a look if she doesnt wear PPE.
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I can get emergency medical help.
A lot of information is flowing around.
In this informate situation, mothers who had experienced my mother, and my mother-in-law could only support me and not because they met me for someone when I was getting believed.
Traditionally, experienced mothers and mostly older women in the family will help new mothers with their experiences and observations.
I have had many panic attacks because I don't have information and understanding.
So I have a great experience of mothers who gave birth during this time.
I see social media as a lifeline.
I read several exciting experiences on social media when I was following a group consisting over 100,000 women with belle and giving children breasts to support.
Different media groups on the platform helped over 100,000 belle women and those giving children breasts by sharing experiences and information during the lockdown.
One of the groups helped me find a health care facility to do emmergency ultrasound after a heavy bleeding fir in the lockdown.
Another group helps to stop anxiety and the depresion following childbirth.
I cannot meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share the joy of welcoming a new member in the family.
My daughter was born on August 25, 2020, at the same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, where I was born decades ago.
And she met another child one one when she was four months old on December 31, 2020, when Tara and her father went to the rooftop with me to see the fireworks.
Another fimily with two babies, who were my first neighbour for the first time, would also be there to say byebye in 2020.
Every day is, and still a gift, to consider the recent statistics of increased COVID-19 cases.
When news about death is full everywhere, the new life brings happines and hope.
For mothers, it is not different from winning a war as they born children in the pandemic and caring for the new children alone, to confirm the highest safety for them.
Socially, emotionally, and physically, this can challenge someone.
Thanks to the light that shines in the eyes of the babies.
Thank you my children, my daughters, for who I am my mother and a successful fighter who survived this pandemic.

The national question, insecurity and the declaration in Asaba.
By Segun Tomori
Recently, governors in southern Nigeria met in Asaba and made some resolutions on the state of the nation, known as the Asaba declaration.
The meeting comes on the matter as insecurity in the country has been worse, agitation by some kind of ethnic jingoists and as the matter of murderous herdsmen menace is generated.
Indeed, the bi-partisan nature of the meeting and the unanimity of the 17 governors showed that they mean serious business.
Restructuring in the context of true federalism and the ban of open grazing form the characteristics of the declaration.
Major lights follow are to bring state police, devolution of power, review revenue formulas to favour federating units plus the need for a national dialogue to take discussions on discrimination and
They should condemn the way governors are taking dragging legs on financial autonomy in state legislatures and judiciaries and does not follow the spirit of true federalism which has been condemned b
One will expect that the leading light in the APC will take advantage of the bipartisan nature of the Asaba declaration, and the support of the major opposition parties to take business in the countr
Instead, we saw attempts to take play to the gallery and in some quarters, subtle censure of the governor.
The El-Rufai committee has recommended devolution of power, resource control, state police, local government autonomy and review in revenue framework in favour of federating unions.
President Buhari has given support for local government, state legislature and judiciary autonomy since, backing amendments in the statutes and issuing Executive Orders.
As the state of the nation is, where security and economic have become a huge challenge, these two sectors should be given the untimate attention together.
Despite being rated as the country with the highest GDP in Africa, we have still not made better efforts to translate it to improve standards of living.
For instance now, our annual budget of $35 billion, is very inadequate to cater for the needs of 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa with about 58 million people has a national budget of $75bn in 2019 and its Social Protection Programme reached 17m of its population.
The effort by the Buhari administration, though it is a new way and commendable, is just a drop into the ocean and is not adequate to make required impact.
This is here the devolution of power and resource control.
Solid minerals and natural resources have no business to stay more than one day in the Exclusive list.
Almost all the states in the country have natural resources that can be sold to explore to create wealth and generate the foreign exchange of the country.
The present system where states go to Abuja to get federal allocations within the country is breeding indolence, not following the principle of true federalism.
Just as the El-Rufai committee proposed, the revenue formula should be reviewed to favour states since they add more responsibilities to them.
On the state police, it is understandable that they are fearing that governors will abuse it, but according to Richie Nortondon, To escape fear, you have to go through it, not a statement.
For too long, we have been waking round the fear of abuse of state police, we have turned a blind eye to the centralised Nigeria Police Force which has been overstretched and has become the centralis
According to Vice-President Osinbajo some years ago, State Police was an idea that had come.
We have to address our fears and overcome it.
One of the ways is to enact legal instruments to establish the State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), along with constitutional amendments that will permit state police regulatory commissions to
It will be in similar functions with the Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but has a wider power to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
The ban on open grazing restated by the governors is not a thing, it is part of the fulcrum of the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) adopted by the National Executive.
The International Crisis Group (ICG) has put the NLTP as the most comprehensive effort Nigeria has made to date to overhaul the inefficient and grosly underperforming Nigerian economy.
On the core, it is a strategy to curb migratory or open grazing and thus lower the risk of conflict between herders and farmers, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic strategies would have been
The federal and state governments should move very fast to fully implement this new plan so that we can put this farmers-herders clash behind us.
The convocation of a National Dialogue, which is a major demand of the Asaba declaration, may not be necessary since reports from the 2014 National Conference and recommendations of the Committee of
The two reports are making far reaching recommendations that the elected governors and their legislators in the national assembly can agree on, instead of making them wanted to be agreed on instead o
On the issue of separatist agitations, they should bring modalities to do a referendum as it is in the constitution.
It is almost certain that many majorities of Nigerians want to live together without minding our differences.
To do this will take the sail out of the wind of divisive elements, which fan the fire of hate and discord.
The Southern Governors have affirmed their commitment to a United Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness and equity, so that every patriotic Nigerian should be patriotic Nigerian.
Though we have challenges like every other country, we must listen to ourselves as US President Joe Bidden often said.
Tomori lives in Abuja.

NEPC, Commonwealth collaborate on production of professional service export data

Kidnappers take two women into Abuja council
Two women, Christiana Isa Attah and Favor David, have been kidnapped by two women, Christiana Isa Attah and Favor David, behind Anguwar Kpokpolobi community in Naharati, Abaji Area Council, FCT.
Mother of the two victims, Mrs. Ruth Attah, a retired school teacher, told our reporter at her house that the incident happened around midnight on Saturday.
She said she was sleeping and the children were in the room when the kidnappers entered the house after jumping a fence.

He said no security man came here when the kidnappers were shot into air for more than one hour.

We also gathered that the daughter of the woman, a class teacher in the area, was prepared to have a wedding next month.
The spokesman of the police command in FCT, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not pick a call or reply a text message sent to her phone to confirm the latest.

There are 22 mummies of Pharaoh paraded in Egypt
Twenty-two mummies of Pharaoh walked on the street of Cairo on Saturday evening in a stunning royal procession from Egyptian Museum on Tahrir Square to the new National Museum.
The event marked the launch of NMEC officially.
Against the backdrop of fireworks, the mummies“ 18 kings and four queens“ travelled in order of age on purpose-built gold-colored pharaonic chariots, equipped with an air conditioning system.

The spokesman of NCoS has debunked the rumours, describing them as baseless.
Daily Trust reports that the 100-year prison located in Kurmawa area, behind Palace of Emir in the metropolis is the biggest custodial centre in the state.

Elections in Uganda: President Museveni early lead, rivals say fraud
President Yoweri Museveni took early lead in the periodic periodic elections in Ugand, according to results first entered from the electoral commission on Friday morning.

A new wave of pandemic hits more in Japans prefectures.
Japan has ready to expand the present state of emergency to cover three more prefectures, according to the government.
This is following as the infection of coronavirus has been wide in the country ahead of Tokyo Olympics in summer.
The prefectures in Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima are likely to get the measure from Sunday to the end of May, as Economic Revitalisation Minister, Yasutoshi Nishida, said.
A panel of experts endorsed the proposal, as Nishimura, in charge of the coronavirus response by the government, said.
The northern island of Hokkaido reported a record of 712 new infections on Thursday while the western prefecture of Hiroshima also saw a record of 219 new cases on Wednesday.
Hiroshima and Okayama cancelled torch relays for nest week on their public roads.
International Olympic Committee President, Thomas Bach, was supposed to participate in the torch relay event in Hiroshima on May 17.
However, local organizers said Bachs travel to Japan was postponed before the games.
The postpone was as the government extended the state of emergency in Tokyo including three other prefectures until the end of May, and added two more regions which are Abuja and Nigeria.
The government declared the state of emergency in the four prefectures in April, requesting bars and restaurants to stop serving alchohol and not dye of them.

Farmers will benefit from mechanised farms in Jigawa
The Malam Alu Agro Allied Company, which is a farm on a 100-hectare of land in Faru village, along Maiduguri road, Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of Jigawa State.
When the farm was established almost five years ago, as we gathered, it was a direct response to the call by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari saying that Nigeria should return to the
Each cattle has a nomba tag attached to it in the ear.
Founder of the company, Farouk Adamu Aliyu, a former member of the House of Representative, keyed into it, the GGM added.
We are doing greenhouse farming.
We have a 10,000 square-metre fully automated soilles greenhouse, where we produce tomato.
We also have two 250 square-metre greenhouses where we produce other greenhouse vegetables, including another 500 square-metre greenhouse, which we are using as a nursery.
These greenhouses are all foreign-oriented, which we have installed to produce varieties of vegetables.
Only tomato is produced in the 10,000 square automated soilless greenhouses; and we produce an average of 10 to 11 tons of tomato every week.
We have another 10,000 square-metre locally fabricated greenhouse.
We also have a livestock section, where we have over 300 herds of cattle, some camel, goat and sheep, he said.
Daily Trust learnt that the farm also has a fishery unit, with about 50,000 fish in the pond.
Similarly, a forty-ton per hour fertilizer blending plant installed in early part of the year, according to us, has been producing reaching 300 loads of NPK fertilizer for the year.
We have imported equipment that can install 120,000 capacity in poultry systems.
We hope to produce reach between 3,000-4,000 crates of egg in a day, Mansur said.
He said the farm, also has a diary plant, which produces 2,000 litres of milk daily, adding that they also have about 150-200 hectres of land elsewhere.
Masur said the major buyers of the tomato are premium customers, notably, large hotels in Abuja and Lagos, plus some other locations.
He confirmed, however, that the main market for the product was mainly in the eastern part of the country like Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri.
However, he admitted that apart from the small customers in Kano, tomato products were not seen in the local market for some kind of reason.
First is the fact that the tomato produced is a special specie and the second reason is the fact that Jigawa is a major area of producing tomato.
You know that tomato is a common product here, so our prices are higher than what is in the open market.
So, essentially, people do not actually look at our side, fell apprehensive with what we have because they believe it costs.
And when you have products available everywhere, it is sure that people will buy the cheapest.
The fish were fed by a farm hand.
When asked about the average lifespan of their tomato products, he said, If you give the tomato everything you take, it means that nutrional supplements you take as much as you feed it as a result of
But even without it, it will last at a minimum of one week, not in refrigeration, not in presure and a lot of heat.
It can be put on a table where there is good ventilation.
It can last at average of 10 days, but if provided as required (every nutrient) it can last up to one month.
We have experimented it, but then, it is not as you are always wanting.
The farm is a source of employment for over 200 people in the village where it was located.
He also said the company had some people to train the youths in the area on information technology skills.
He further said most of the equipment used for the farm was from Turkey, except the fertilizer-blending machine, imported from China.
He said even the farming method is like in Turkey, because they have Turkish partners who help them to maintain the standard, but quickly added that the company has been able to maintain the standard
Reflecting on the effects of COVID-19 on the operations of the company, Mansur said, Malam Alu, as other corporate entities in the country, suffered from devastation.
For Mansur, youths in Nigeria have no excuse to remain unemployed with the opportunities provided by agriculture, noting that the people looking for white-collar jobs are looking for white-collar job
He believes Nigeria has been doing long time before, noting that if the country takes this step, they would have cornered the present economic problem.

Three Africans, no Nigerians, as City, Chelsea are contesting UEFA Champions League final.
No doubt that football fans in Nigeria are waiting eagerly for the 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals tonight where two English clubs are Manchester United and Manchester City.
With view of the fact that UEFA Champions League is one of the biggest football competitions only next to FIFA World Cup and the Olympic football event, levels of expectations are high.
Without winning a Champions League title before, Chelsea won their first and only title in 2012.
Therefore, despite winning premiership number seven this night, Chelsea will enter into the contest with good credentials.
They are former champions.
However, as Thomas Tuchel, leading the technical crew in Chelsea, has not won the Champions League, his opponent in Manchester Citys dugout, Pep Guardiola has won the title.
He won it with Barcelona in 2009 and 2010.
Therefore, there is much to expect from the actors who will leave the field at the Estadio.
Dragao in Porto and the men who will take charge of the technical area.
Interestingly, despite both contestants having only three African players in Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morocco, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (Manchester United).
Senegal, Chelsea) the interest of Africa in the final has dropped.
In Nigeria here, where Chelsea and Manchester City enjoy many followers from passionate football fans, expections have been causing fever and leading to international interests.
Fans of the other clubs that have left the other stages of the Champions League can re-align themselves with either Chelsea or Manchester City as they interest to diverse.
The consequence is that the final is one of the most popular topics in sports at the moment and fans of the premiereship club have continued to predict as the final.
However, as almost everyone is waiting to savour the football artistry that can be displayed, some pundits are as nombers of African players in the final of the season.
If we follow history in the UEFA Champions League, only 24 African footballers have contested and won the trophy with their European clubs.
It was sad that African football legends like Liberia's George Weah, who was voted as World Footballer of the Year in 1995, were voted as World Footballer of the Year in 1995.
Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria, Mohamed Aboutrika of Egypt, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of China.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) were at the big stage when Liverpool won their 6th UEFA Champions League title when Liverpool won their
He achieved the feat with Liverpool in 1984.
It was won by Algerian legend Rabah Madjer who won it with FC Porto in 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) in 1993 with Olympique Marseille, before Nigeria.
The duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lifted him with Ajax Amsterdam in 1995.
It is also recorded that Geremi Njitap of Cameroon was the first African to win the title twice in 2000 and 2002 with Spanish giants Real Madrid, Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon and Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon
Other Africans who won the highly coveted trophy were Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana).
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote dIvoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote dIvoire), Didier Drogba (Cote dIvoire) who won it with Chelsea in 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco).
To come close to home, the last time Nigerian won the trophy was 2012 when Mikel Obi was among Africans who lifted the trophy with Chelsea at the expense of Bayern Munich.
After that achievement by the former captain of the Super Eagles, Nigeria also saw other talented players rising, like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Abdullahi and
But none of them have featured in the final of the biggest club competition in Europe.
The reason is not clear.
The top five clubs in Europe Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool dominate the competition.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players have failed to enter highly rated clubs in Europe.
It is hope of Nigerian football stakeholders that very soon the new generation of players will break the barrier and begin to play for clubs with potential to win the UEFA Championship.
If this one fails, then the football fans in Nigeria will continue to live with the agony of watching the finals of the UEFA Champions League coming and going, without doing it.
Nigerians are waiting for the next Super Eagle player to rise to the top of the European club competition the way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu did it with Ajax in 1995 and 1996.
At the end, there will be a victory for the Manchester club hunting for their first title other Londeners primed in the second itle and the football league watching.

While the away side had full control of the game, they had more confidence and that left the hosts to scramble to get back into the game as the first end of the 1-0 in favour of Nigeria.
As the restart of the second half, Ifeanyi Ubah continued to press for the second goal and got the deserved reward when Saidu Adamu got his brace after getting Awazie Abubakar.

Farmers are apprehensive as planting season begins with erratic rain.
With the beginning of the wet season for most parts of the season, farmers begin palpiting with fear as rain is erratic and could threaten production.
Rain is unsaturable in Benue, Nasarawa, Niger, Kaduna and parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), with many farmers have planted crops.
In the 2019/2020 wet season, erratic rain in the north and mid-season draught in the south-west made farmers losses due to crop failure.
Musa Yohana and Halima Thomas, farmers in Doma and Lafia, Nasarawa State, said they had planted maize, groundnut and other crops such as casava and yam but fear of fear.
I lost my yam last year due to too much heat because there was no rain.
This year, we have been in the second week of May but there is no rain.
And I have already planted 15 measures (about 20kg) of groundnut.
If it continues like this for another week, I can loss all the seeds, Mr Yohana said.
Like them, many farmers around the FCT have planted, but they have a huge fear of crop failure as experienced last year.
In Benue State, our correspondent reproted that farmers have beginned to cultivate land and plant crops because of rainfall.
Some farmers who have prepared their farms earlier in the tear said they couldn't begin planting until one week ago, while others just begin to clear land at the wake of the rain.
A farmer in Otukpo, Ada hyacinth, said the ground is still too strong to cultivate because the rain is not frequently falling.
Another farmer, Felix Tor, in Makurdi said he just planted melons and maize on his farm despite no consistent rain.
Tor however expressed fear that the nature of the rainfall could affect the well-being of the crop.
He prayed that the yield would do better in the end.
But Vitalis Tarnongu, who has been clearing his 1,000 hectares of farmland at the Federal University of Agriculture, in Makurdi (FUAM), said due to the falling rainfall this year, the rain is falling
Tarnongu said a plant breeder in the University has advised him to wait until May 20 to start planting his maize because the nature of the rainfall since the season began.
The second chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Aondongu Saaku, described farming as a business that should be taken risk on.
Saaku said farmers who see it as a business have taken the risk to many of their crops already because without such risk they would not reap at the end of the day.
Meanwhile, Dr Teryima Iorlamen, a seed system specialist at FUAm, said farmers could go ahead to plant root and tuber crops as it follows the predictions of rainfall.
Iorlamen said the period expected for farmers has passed, stressing that the prediction of NIMET on the rainfall pattern in Benue State, which is expected to be expected for farmers, was expected to
We can now assure farmers that rain has stabilised, according to predictions made by NIMET.
Anything different now will be a dry spell.
I have advised farmers to check water logging capacity in their fields so that they can plant their crops as they are supposed to grow.
Rice likes a lot of water, so there is no time to plant it.
But farmers can enter roots and tubers now, including yam, cassava, maize and melon.
We believe the rain has stabilised.
