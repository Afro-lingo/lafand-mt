Di wahala wey dem dey write na di tin wey dem no suppose allow some of dia students make dem wear di schools wey dem dey go school.
Di solution to this one be say e be say na im be di suspension (PP).

Na this one still be the major part of the RPPE wey dey follow the House of the House of Representatives and e dey carry body down .
Dem dey face some of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former na also prove say di important of di rights of di Muslim student dem dey express dia faith wit dia faith; even if dem no get di school, dem fit get position for dat kind position.
Di latter na to dey patient as dis right no be say Muslims no be only for wia e dey threaten dem wit information wey dey affect dia faith for dia faith.
Make we no follow di arguments of di propriary of di schools wey dey Kwarae school, wey be say make dem understand di arguments of di classmate of di school school, if dem want make pipo go school.
Di problem wey we dey face na di argument
Firstste to say Muslim student suppose dey unless the school wey dem dey wear, make dem promote di very very very very little to promote little, wey be di tin wey we dey do and wey dey use for awa society
Number one, di position dey beg the question: E good make e no easy for person to dey rule for school because of major Christian ?
Then, third thing be say, di argument dey vex for di mata wey dey change for school.
Di shut down na huge
Di act of change for school, pikin wey go dey grow for education, e go tell you say make dem no too much, but na only say e dey feel di development.
At last, di association wey dem get for dia schools na wetin dem dey callhettoror na hin dey call on top di students wey dey follow for school.

Dem dey tok say dem no dey address dis ill illegal law wey dem dey chop but dem need to get more information bikos say dem need more dan one room wey no reach.
While UII wey be like say, no be like say, no be just di point of di R PPPPPP, and odas suppose send am to punishment for odas.
Pipo wey dey look di view of hin critic, as di RPPP wey dem dey tok, nothing wey dem dey do to show for di state wey dem dey find for di state wey dem dey find for di state.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian goment tok say di Federation of di Federation of di state no go adopt any any religion wey dey inside State
To wear di argument, becos of di public bill na to di public to respect of di Muslim women wey dey wear di space for publics wey dey always go
