By Ibrahim die
Shey pure coins wey dey live for trouble, as dem just dey grow for Kwara state recently, a kind solution to di House of di National Assembly for Abuja?
Di trouble wey dey for Ilorin na becos of di faith of some pipo wey get faith to allow dia students make dem wear di schools wey dey di schools.
Di solution to dis enemy dey debate on di suspension for di absence (PPP) family, Probation).
RPPPP wey dey Bill, 2021, don dey taiveive for one part of di Nigerian media media media media
Both events wey dey heat and heat and down, tok say for di bottom of di bottom of it, make dem threaten di wich dey for Nigeria identity and reality wey dem
Di whole idea for Kwara propritors wey dey sell di schools of di schools wey dey sell-adisters and dia student dem fit reduce, make dem no reduce wetin dem dey wear for public public in di public in
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RPPP wey dey follow di House of APC House of Representatives and to dey raise opportunity for opportunity
female pipo dey face bikos of wetin dem wear for public
Di former clear na to secure di important rights of human rights of di Muslim student to express dia faith witout dia faith; even though say dem get di school, dem fit get position for taking position for dat kind position
Di latter na to dey try as dis right no dey right for Muslims, but also di wiaeva dey threaten dem wit discrimination for dia faith.
Make we no follow di arguments of di propritors wey be di faith of Kwara schools for Kwara state, make dem understand di firms of di arguments wey dey give pipo to oda schools, if dem no want make dem dey go school.
Di problem wey we dey face with dis argument
First, to say Muslim student suppose dey go any place wey dem go follow make di school start to promote very very very very very littleness wey we dey use use and to promote different different different group of our society
secondly, di position dey beg di question: E dey good to get justifiable school because of major Christian rule bikos of di school?
Then, thirdly, di place wey dey go on top argument go dey change di school for school
Di centre dey big huge
Di act of change for school, education and education wey go get moni for education, go tell you say make dem no do am wit only, but na only dia development development.
At last, di faith faith wey dey dia schools wey dem dey call ghetororor na hin dey call on top student dem believe and particular schools wey dey di same schools.
Di social cost cost na on di society
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemdeununun, tok say wen dem dey tok, make di goment dey sure say di goment dey sure say di goverment policy to allow dia school dem make dem wear dia schools wey go allow di public schools wey no go dey allow dem dey wear di schools and property for fruits.
For a kontris wey guarantee freedom of religion, di declaration of di International Marwa, di basic question na: di basic question dem dey ask ourself: how to deny anoda pikin make dem access to di school?
E dey great concern becos Nigeria na sign wey dem dey call Nigeriatory to di Declaration Rights (NU).
Di UDHs insist say all human being dey free and e dey free, sake of say e dey free and religion.
Dem contain 30 articles on on top rights and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political rights, like di right life, to free and pvvacy and pvvacy
E also include economic, social and ones wey get right, like di right to get health and education
I dey find topic and 26 of URRRRRRRRR very relevant to consider di issue and explainin for dem:
Article 18: don get freedom to think wetin dem believe or wetin dem believe, including di right to oda religious belief
We get di right to change our religions beliefs or any time for any time, and di right to di public or to choose awa religion practice, wit odas
E get di right to education
Primary school suppose dey free.
Make all dey able continue to dey continue our study as we dey wish as we dey get
For school, make we dey help awa talent, and make we dey teach talent and make everybody dey respect everybody.
Make we still dey teach to get on top oda things wey dey dia religion, religion, or kontri kom from
awa parents don get di right to choose wetin we go do to school
Dis types of laws na di laws wey dem dey do na hin dey use ghanhan wey I go sit for di House of Representatives dey use for di US Hibibi wey no fit wear any form of her moation or discrimination or discrimination or
Ihanhan Abdullahi Omarship wey be one American man wey dey serve as di U.Sspent for Minnesota United since 2019.
Dem dey sponsor bill by di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives on Tuesday and represent member wey dey represent/Gba-Katcha and di constituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi don
Di bill dey dey dey find on top to address discriminatory and religious concern wey dem dey allow dia hiririn or reinitment, terms of employment
E go dey kontinue dey do/professional bodis, education institution institution, association and oda sector, and oda sectors of dem wey dey against, student, or na part of dia religious belief or part of hin belief or e go dey important.
Wen dem pass, di law go bury di mata as we see wetin be for Kwara for Kwara.
E go kom address di big of some of some employer, or those pipo wey wan take di public and allow di office make dem allow am make dem do wetin dem go do.
Di law suppose welcome a development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatatate di provisions of Nigeria constitution constitution constitution and di UHRRRRI explain.
E dey in line wit laws wey pass pass, for di kontri dem wey dey operate to tackle social social men and make dem tackle di practice, di Law wey dem no get, Probture (PP).
While dis dis no dey seek to all form of discrimination wey pesin don dey tok on top di person wey get na im be di domestic and oda violence for di kontri.
One time wey we get di representatives wey dey di association for chambers nah di social men block awa kontri as dem dey build di kontri.
Dem dey tok say dem dey address dis social ill illegal mata bikos say dem no fit cover dem but dem no get more information bikos dem need more dan more room.
While UD fit be like dat, wey no be just just just wit di document, and di RPPP, make dem provide am to punishment for pipo wey wan punish am
Think to di view of hin critic, as far as di RPPP wey dem dey do, na to show dem di attempt wey dem wan use for di state start to dey find any oda religion on top di state so dat di state fit even for di state.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian constitution wey dey tok say di goment of di Federation or make dem adopt any religion wey dem no adopt any religion as he dey show.
Todr argument dey tok, becos di argument dey call on top di general public to respect di Muslim women wey dey wear di right of publicbi for public spaces of Islam.
For di final wey dey final, analysis to Nigerian male or female or hin female ne wey dey use dia freedom for awa wich too much.
E dey ne of di targets of di basic equality and human right as human beings for Nigeria, and di constitution wey Declaration for legal document wey we get for legal document document.
One bill go tok say criminal go dey ciate on media, wey dey di RPPP, like RPP, na to welcome development.
