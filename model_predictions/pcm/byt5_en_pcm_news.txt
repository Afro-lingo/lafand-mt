MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, tok am for one statement on Sunday
Dis follow a warning wey PFN issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoing constitutional review wey dey don dey do.
PFN and oda Christian group dey fully aware say Shariah dey di South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842

Di Ede Shariah Court dey operate up till 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem move am go Agbongbon area for 1914

Dem dey use both fair and foul means to achieve dia objective
We call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours
Like all aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence

E tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims in perpetual slavery
Muslims for di region dey wake up and dey ask for freedom
We dey demand halt to di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law
We dey demand civil Shariah, no be criminal Shariah wey involve di cutting of hands but civil Shariah wey go regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs
E no get anything to do wit Christians

Di driver wey drive late Ahmed Gulak and one co- victim wey survive don identify di dead bodi of di IPOB/ESN members positively as dia attackers and also identify di dead bodi of di IPOB/ESN members
Durin di encounter, dem riddle two of di police armored personnel carriers (APC) wit bullets but dem survive di gun battle
One video clip on di aftermath of di attack show Gulak for pair of Jean trousers and blue T-shirt wey dey lying for pool of hin own blood, besides di car wey dem abandon
Gulak na di chairman of di controversial Imo All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary election wey produce Hope Uzodinma as di parti's flagbearer
Dem also tok say dem don remain close to di governor wey dey visit di state frequently
Why hin dey Owerri
Though Gulak dey tok say hin be regular visitor to Owerri since di ascension of Uzodinma, hin last trip na to attend di public hearing of di constitution review

Nigerians don knock FG, political actors say dem dey kil dem
Nigerians on social media berate di federal goment and political actors for hin kilin
One commentator for di Facebook link of di story wey Daily Trust publish, Ifeanyi Maduako, wen e dey describe Gulak death as distasteful, link di incident wit politics
Dis kilin dey very distasteful to me
E dey appear political and dose wey dey behind am make dem unravel dose wey dey behind am
Di kilin go expose pipo wey dey behind di current insecurity for Imo State
Who invite am and why dem kil a northerner for Imo state
I dey very afraid wetin fate go await innocent Imo State pipo for di coming days for di hands of northern controlled security agencies.
Anoda commentator for di thread, Oloruntobi Micheal Omo, tok say: Di police report prove say dis kilin na political and hence call for in-depth investigation
Police I guess get some question wey dem go answer
For hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write, di soul of awa innocent pipo dey more important pass dis scam wey dem call Nigeria unity
Dis illiteracy no go dey acceptable to us, enough be say we be peacemakers
But dose dey push us go di wall say dis peacemaking no fit sustain again
I dey warn say awa retaliation go dey worst
Buhari you fail us woefully, I dey urge Imo police make dem confront di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write say, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent Fulani herders & now turn to northern goment officials & prominent politicians
Di IPOB wey dey outlawed, for one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, fault reports wey dey link am to di murder of Gulak, noting say di assassination of politicians no dey good.
We, derefore, state witout equivocation say IPOB no know about di assassination
For di first place, wetin threat di late Gulak constitute to awa kause to warrant hin elimination?
We no get anything wey dey common wit am and we no fit kill am
Pointing accusing fingers at IPOB for dis barbaric act na only mean to divert attention away from di real masterminds
Dis na di same way terrorists wey dey security uniform commit various atrocities for South East and dem turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global republic.
Dis na smokescreen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans
Instead of di security agencies to properly investigate di incident and possible factors, dem switch to accuse IPOB of crime wey we no know about
Shey IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak say dem don waylay am for di airport?
Di group tok say security agencies suppose first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, as well as hin political opponents to establish dia possible involvement
Dose wey dey behind Gulak murder no go unpunished

Make I warn say nobodi or group of pipo wey dey engage for dat kind act suppose expect to go free
We go deploy all resources wey we dey awa disposal to ensure say dem bring dat kind callous and criminal elements to justice
Gulak dey kil unacceptable Akeredolu
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu describe di news of di assassination as very shocking and disturbing
For one statement wey di governor sign personally, hin tok say na one murder too many, hin describe di action as senseless and wicked
Di perpetrators of dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri
Dis contrivance dey mean to mislead, confuse and destroy
E bear di unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists wey dey bent on setting di kontri on di path of conflagration.
Dem no go allow dis criminals succeed
We wan use dis medium to express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma
We admonish am and oda governors for di South Eastern States make dem brace up, and confront di current security challenge to put an end to di bloodbath wey dey di land
Di enemies of di pipo dey always use di weapon of fear to create disaffection for di polity
Dis cowardly act dey calculate to instigate Nigerians against each oda, particularly Northerners, against di Igbo wey dey live outside di South East
We need confront di enemies of di pipo wit a view to neutralise dem
Dis no be di time for political correctness
Make dem no allow banditry subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all levels.
We call all security agencies make dem collaborate wit a view to unveil di criminal elements wey dey sponsor and dey undertake terrorist acts.
Dem must punish dem severely

Osinbajo neva declare interest for presidential race
Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo don describe di speculation say hin go contest di 2023 presidential election as distraction
Dem don confirm report say Osinbajo dey eye di highest office for di land
For one statement wey Laolu Akande, hin tok-tok pesin, issue on hin behalf on Monday, di vice-president tok say e no dey true say hin don declare interest for di race
Dem don draw di attention of di Office of di Vice President to one website
Supportosinbajo.ng wey dey call on Nigerians make dem join volunteer group wey dey mobilize support for Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, ahead of di 2023 presidential election.
Details of dis website and di solicitation of di group dey currently trend on WhatsApp wit suggestion say Prof. Osinbajo don quietlydeclare interest for 2021.
Di Office of di Vice President no dey connected to dis website or di group wey dey behind am and dey consider dat kind enterprise as unnecessary distraction
Prof. Osinbajo neva declare any interest whatsoeva for di 2023 election, but e dey rather focus on working for hin capacity as Vice President for di current administation.
Therefore, we ask pipo desist from dat kind unhelpful permutation while we all deal togeda wit di challenges wey dey confront us as Nigerians, and resolve dem for di future.

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom an ever dominating topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
Ending Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: Di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement one National Livestock Transformation Plan wey seek to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and to curb di movement of cattle across
As di Plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about hin purpose, budgetary constraints wey dey aggravated by di COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of personnel wey get di expertise wey dey available
If di Plan fail as previous initiative to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Approved by di National Economic Council for January 2019, di Plan represent di most comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming economy.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers
E dey animate by di hope say ova a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reservations.
By di end of 2028, authorities go aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all di states wey dey participate, wey go create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processing and
President Muhammadu Buhari administration kom up wit di Plan afta wave of violence between herders and farmers, particularly surge for related violence afflictions wey dey related to di violence affl
Di federal goment, wey don commit to fund 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey dem submit by di states wey dey participate, don take preliminary steps toward programme for di programme wey
Several states don reactivate di grazing reserve wey dem demarcate before, open office and set up steering committee wey go administer di Plan
Authorities don also hold workshops and don do oda works to explain di benefits of livestock reform to plenti audience
But two years into di 10-year plan, di first new ranch neva build, and di obstacle dey plenti
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plan benefit to pastoralists, hinder reform efforts
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land between herders and farmers, notwitstanding peacemaking and military efforts wey dey apun.
Federal and state budget don pinch, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri no get sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing.
For plenti states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey scare away potential criminals.
Unless dem address, dis and oda problems fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, leaving di kontri vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit dey vulnerable to an escalation of herder-
Tackling dis challenges require concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about di kontri.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey go ask dem make dem change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately doubt di Plan promise about availability wey dey available
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Plenti pipo for di Middle Belt and southern states dey deeply suspicious of di Plan long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, di plan dey create privileges fo
Wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment go need build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production, and dairy production.
Federal and state goment suppose also up budgetary commitment, hasten di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working wit di government to ensure accountabili
Addressing rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities wey dey adversely affected by earlier violence for participating states dey vital
Plus, authorities go need consider climate changes likely impact and reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross into Nigeria seasonally suppose or suppose suppose suppose suppose suppo
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plan proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis
Less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If di Plan na to survive di change of government wey go follow, politicians fit need to produce clear proof of hin benefits (Afta dem serve two terms, President Muhammadu Buhari wey don serve two ter
Ideally, by di time wey campaigning dey heat up for late 2022, di Plans backers suppose point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reservations wey dem don construct
Nobodi of dis no go easy, but di Plan dey worth di effort
As e dey far from perfect, e offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit a strategy wey dey address di need of both herders and small-scale farmers.
About 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity ovaall at di same time dat e go take big step toward resolving one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts wey dey dangerous for di kontri
As di clock dey tick down to 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quickly to make visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create visible mark no go dey visible.
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how we go hasten am implementation, wey di International Committee of Agriculture (ICAA) publish
Di kind problem wey I get wit di king
Shey una no agree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na smallholders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dem hold back from participating more actively in commercially oriented agriculture programmes.
No energy for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own/ mine
Dis bring me to di conclusion say evrione dey evil
Dem don characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey generally small, dem dey hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey for marginal or risk-prone environment
Yield dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase yield
We dey tok life and prosperity to dis day
Send your account number
Di emphasis now na on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farming as an enterprise
I know evrithin
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yield wey smallholder farmers dey get dey profitable
Na wetin una dey kom?
Dis challenges wey dey emerge lead many smallholder farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower-risk and lower-yielding agricultural activities.
Shey una be witch?
I dey go sabo market go buy some food stuff
Make I call my papa
As developing kontris population grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go occur in rapidly changing agri-food value changes for di world
How far wetin dey up, suppose I dey on my way?
Dis development dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodologies
Di loan sharks dey on hin neck
Dis kind thing
I dey on errand from my place of work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers dey plenti battle for 2020
For plenti farmers and oda stakeholders for di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst year for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics for di agro sector.
Di agricultural sector dey confronted wit plenti challenges wey range from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey dey exacerbate by di global COVID-19 pandemic
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crops and wet season farmers dey about to commence cultivation.
Many farmers no fit access dia farms while for odas dem dey get labourers to harvest dia farms since mechanization na huge challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem wey dem dey get
Movement restrictions wey dem introduce to curb di spread of di coronavirus locked-down markets don disrupt di rural economy
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce to enable dem buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor service
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer bikom so high say many smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go as high as N13,000 for a 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 no rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no ground
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some parts of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandits activity no only deny dem access to dia farm but leave plenti killers
Dem raze plenti farming communities down
Dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
Many pay large sum of moni or surrender large portion of dia harvest to di bandits
Plenti villages for dose states don dey desolate
Di agric sector sef witness one of di worst disaster wen floods wipe out over 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields wey dem estimate at N3.5 billion across Kebbi.
Dem neva compensate plenti of di farmers wey dey affected as dem destroy dia livelihood
Di flood dey di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal cities and flood-prone areas killing pipo and washing away farmlands.
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey confront wit drought
For two months, farmers watch helplessly as dia investment for crops witer away
Make u no disguise
Anoda subsector wey dey badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds
Di scarcity of maize from di beginning kos price don increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria make dem send save awa soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric tons of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers in addition to dey grant some of di moni wey dem get for di kontri
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean don struck, wey make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go reduce di production of soyab
Di scarcity result in serious feed crisis for di industry as price don reach record high for its history rising from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now

For December, most farmers no fit sell dia broilers bikos di cost of production dey high pass wetin average Nigerian fit afford

So we really need goment intervention to save di current 10million jobs for di poultry value chain of awa economy

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy dey trend for di public domain, wit Southern governors dey slam ban on am during dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association (FEA), tok say dem go
Recently, di Southern state governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda forms of criminalities
Wetin be your take on di heated controversy wey dis decision generate?
Evri human being get right to tok action and opinion
But di thing wey important pass be say once you take your action, you suppose know di consequences
You suppose consider di advantage and disadvantage
I no be one of dose wey tok say e dey good or bad
As a Nigerian, you get di right and liberty to live anywia for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association
On dis basis, I no go tok say e be good thing
But as a leader for di North Central, I go tok say e be good thing, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefit for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herders, no mata di number wey fit troop from di South into di North Central
Wetin be your position for open grazing?
I no be one of di propagators of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practise as individual
I believe say if we take go ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching
Dis move fit make di North Central cattle hub wia pipo fit get access to cattle and all di allied products
And den e bikom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern states no get
Look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herders and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey di Fulani herders pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on hin advantage
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem need dey well educated to embrace ranching
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia nearly all di families get ranch and you no see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no dey call for ranching and for di federal goment make dem kom in
Wetin dem dey simply tok be say di herders don bikom problem to us and make we go away
Dem tok say di herders suppose apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don ask dia indigenes make dem apply for land like di herders?
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programmes, especially for di agricultural sector and hin value chains, why some goment policy dey fail to realise di reason wey some government d
Firstly, no administration wey don touch di lives of individuals like President Muhammadu Buhari administration wia you fit conveniently sit and dey conveniently sit am
Di targeted credit facility dey wey dem also call COVID-19 loan
Plenti Nigerians don get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house witout even go office
Also, wit SMEs dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two sides of pipo wey go believe in you and pipo wey go criticise you
So, for dose wey no believe for Buhari's administration, notin dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am

Afta dem read am for di Third Time for both chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, wey dey target at strengthening and re-invigorating national frontiers in di fight wey dey fight
Wit di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly wey dey under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbaja wey be di leader of di
And dis also attest to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great delight and deep sense of gratitude wey I write dis, wey don put togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know about di world.
Afta di passage of dis Bill by di Senate, and in view of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, under di supervision of di President
Femi Gbajabiamila, di hon
Speaker, follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021
As you fit know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di viciously vicious bills for Nigeria.
Sadly di attack kom from dose wey suppose be partners in progress for di fight against endemic corruption in Nigeria, but don rather designate demsef as enemies
Good dey good e no get substitute so e dey bad
No mata how long e take, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness remain constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e apun for di National Assembly
Interestingly, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na hin dem first pass into law by di 9th Senate on top di case of corruption and
E dey very important for di public to know say (CIFIPN) no be just one noble bodi but one novel one for Nigeria wey dey target to bridge di gap wey don exist long time.
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria don dey at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-government activities wey dey differen
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national efforts wey dey geared for di kontri.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, kom for a time wey Nigeria dey dire need of legislation
Dat go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe.
As we all know, crime generally, don assume new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century.
Therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging problems.
E dey apposite to state say di journey, wey culminate into di passage of dis Bill, begin for di 8th National Assembly wia dem sponsor awa Bill.
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers for di 8th National Assembly, dem conduct all-inclusive public hearing by di relevant pipo wey dey relevant to di public
Thereafta and in spite of opposition from stakeholders wey dey di minority, led by di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), di National Assembly present di statement wey dem get for d
Aftaward, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey no give before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019
E dey on di strength of dis, say dem re-introduce di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, dem sponsor am
We dey constrained to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors propel say dem reject awa Bill by di 8th National Congress.
Also worthy to mention be di fact say dem don mistake awa Bill for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di Senate and di House of Representatives recently.
Dis Bills, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say na merely duplication of di intent and purport of awa Bill
Dem suppose stress say none of dis Bills dem introduce for di 8th National Assembly, oda dan awa Bill
As such, we be di first to ever kom up wit Bill of dis magnitude,(Forensic)
Afta we see di urgent need to establish dat great institute
Dem take di decision to establish di Institute afta a painstaking study of how di Institute dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how well dem don help for crime defence.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don exist since 2019
And ova di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey dey target to inculcate di requisite skils and acumen for di pragmatic and pragmatic approach.
Forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, weda error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and communication tools.
You go agree wit me say for today's world, di conventional ways of investigating crimes, wit a view to fighting e don bikom obsolete
As such, for us as a nation to do something wey meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and emerging innovations, wey dey targeted at di world.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say dem conceive di idea of establishing dis Institute wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption programme.
Time no go permit me to highlight all di objectives of di Bill here
Howeva, I wan crave your indulgence to highlight a few of di objectives of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follow:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field, through special training programme
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in di usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques for di investigation
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners wey dey di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and as well develop professional developmen
To fill di big vacuum wey dey exist for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of unique operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri
To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminal Assistants and oda professio
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and e go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms, through di provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey also pertinent to reiterate say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and maintainment of criminal informati
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, include but no limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics; and digital forensics.
Accordingly, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity wit international best practices.
Dis concept dey far beyond di reasoning of those wey myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia senses of reasoning, bikos of narrow-mindedness and narrow-mindedness.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be source of concern for all di pipo wey dey play now.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and afta we see di overwhelming and accelerated legislative support, awa Bill don receive di overwhelming and accelerated le
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN hold di view say make any institute oda dan dias to regulate di practice of foreign studies.
Your answer dey good as mine
I wan also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), no dey comot for dis funny theatrical episode
Just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don also introduce Bill for di House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Professionals (CIFCP).
I decide to bring out all dis facts so dat Nigerians and even di international communities go understand di extent to which some pipo fit go in order to achieve success.
Howeva, we no dey perturbed by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin dey right
Di known practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN for reason wey dey obvious
Dem engage plenti bystanders to write frivolous petitions some even target at di leadership of di Senate wit a tone of blackmail
Afta dem fail woefully for di senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all manner of publication
Yet again, dem fail
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill wey dem don pass by di Senate go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observations dey
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and on di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Charter National Association (CNA) wey dey
ICAN don register hin Bill for di House of Representatives wey title (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICAN ACT
Dis ICAN new Bill get full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice.
Dis sound so strange for one kontri wey dey full of enlightened pipo
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
No mata di level of corruption derein
We don already challenge di passage of di bills by di House of Representatives
Make we note say, awa challenging di bill no be out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey certain say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential election.
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians make dem deceive dia antics
You go remember how ICAN vehemently oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of im sponsored publication by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey be di Association of professional Bo
Olumuyiwa Alade for di 24th May, 2019 make frantic effort to tok say ICAN under its laws wey dey enable to practice Forensics and derefore for CIFIPN Bill make CIFIPN Bill dey apun
Di question na, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey now seek for dia re-enactment
As always, while we no dey oppose to any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for hin law, we dey concerned say bodi no try to perpetuate itself.
ICAN and hin cohort don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
So dem wan get bodi wey dey inside diasef
Wetin dem dey scare of na check and balance, dem no go want anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di pipo.
How dem fit be judge for dia own case
Dis sound so strange
On dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly make dem beware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit dey tok from both side of dia mouth and make dem expect di National Assembly.
We wan appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly in ensuring say dem pass di Bill, di Nigerian pipo dey more dan ever before convinced of di reason.
We dey confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate to assent to dis Bill as soon as e go get hin desk
We dey call all Nigerians make dem kom and be part of di Forensics Profession
Di profession dey open for all professionals for different field of endeavours
Training arm of di institute dey wey go studiously guide you and equip you
I wish to thank you all and to also reiterate awa resolve and commitment to uphold ethical standards in line wit global best practices, in rendering our professional professional professional service
I wan appeal to all stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore us all make frantic efforts so dat collectively, we fit support all of us.

Between DSS and regional separatists
Repeated warnings by di DSS to persons and groups wey dey utter and activities wey dey persistently constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and di ethno-religious environ
Di question wey dey linger about who or which person and group wey di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourized in di heated rhetorical outbursts of di nation's security agency
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF)
E den dawn on all dat indeed na di persons and groups wey don continue to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens.
Interestingly, none of dis prime suspects in di exploitation of some fault lines to kos ethno-religious violence for some parts of di kontri fit categorically discriminate di police.
Dem choruse common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, differing only for di respective direction of dia accusing fingers
While Afenifere retort say dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but e no fit touch dem bikos of dia connection, PANDEV rehash im grouse about many pipo wey dey responsible for dis act
Since DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive in dealing wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crises and dem know dem; make dem treat dem according to di law
You no need be spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all of dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say dem no know am
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics no know of beta solution to Nigeria's myriad problems pass for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord am over dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to
So desperate and unscrupulous dey in pursuing dia inordinate ambitions say dem absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria
Ambition-powered mind games dey intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all wetin e take to excise di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied earthquake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups wey dey restlessly under di political contro
Dis regional groups actually constitute major hindrances to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag independence.
For as long as dem continue to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long dem go regard Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake for di population.
Weneva dem meet, di agenda no be for Nigeria's progress and development, unless hin leadership dey firmly inside dia grasp, odawise e dey all about heckling and jostling.
Weda na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and justice.
Anoda undeniable indictment of dis regional separatists be say dem be all self-styled political pressure groups wey dey masquerade as representatives of various ethnic groups.
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consist of ex-dis
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to remain relevant for democratic system wey dey run by elected representatives.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem dey persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly internationally internationally
Na why dia frequent clandestine meeting dey trigger security alert
Wit such predator-politicians wey dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent of undermining an elected government just bikos dem no dey involved, e dey bikos say dem no dey involved
Double jeopardy dey aptly describe di predicament of Buhari administration wey need contend wit such array of formidable foes wey dey unleash incessant assaults on national security.
To dat extent, only two group of politicians fit be: those wey dey positively participate for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward
By dia utterance and activity, we all know dem
For di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens wey dia condition of survival no dey determined by and no dependent on di geography of dia origin.
Dia daily struggle to eke living dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of difference of faith
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland wey dem remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get oda kontri wey dem call dias, knowing say dem no get oda kontri wey dem call dias, collectiv
Dem too know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to inciting, unguarded, unguarded and unguarded

Wetin no to wear for public: Negating Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Na pure coincidence say, as trouble dey brew for Kwara State recently, dem dey consider solution to its kind for di lower House of di National Assembly for di state.
Di trouble for Ilorin na ova di refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow dia Muslim students wear hijab to di school
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tag Hijab Bill by section of di Nigerian media.
Both events spark heated and often emotional debates wey, for di bottom of all, threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.
Di whole idea for Kwara of di proprietors of di schools wey dey ban hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathisers fit reduce to wetin no to wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Dem dey face female Nigerians bikos of wetin dem wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human rights of di Muslim students to express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get dia fundamental human rights for di scho
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians werever or weneva dem dey threaten dem wit discrimination based on dia professed faith.
As dem dey run through di argument of di proprietors of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, person fit understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children dey different.
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument be plenti
First, to tok say Muslim students suppose go elsewia unless dem conform to di school's rule on uniform do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of our society.
Secondly, di position beg di moral question: is e justifiable to base school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Den, thirdly, di go elsewia argument dey appear to ignore di difficulties wey dem go use change school for a pikin
Di inconvenience dey big
Di act of changing schools for a pikin, educational psychologists go tell you, dey interfere negatively wit not only im emotional but academic development too
Finally, di Christian faith schools by demsef risk wetin dem call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate students wey get di same religious belief for particular schools
Di social cost wey dis exact on di society dey enormous
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di government dey convinced say im policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to dey study for school wey dey will
For one kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e dey to deny a Nigerian pipo wey dey Nigerian
E dey great concern bikos Nigeria be signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR)
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion
E contain 30 articles on rights and freedoms wey include, among odas, civil and political rights, like di right to life, free speech and privacy
E also include economic, social and cultural rights, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to di issue wey dey under consideration and quote dem in full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get freedom to think or believe wetin dem want, including di right to religious belief
We get di right to change awa belief or religion for any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa chosen religion, alone or wit odas
Evribodi get di right to education
Primary schooling suppose dey free
Make all of us fit continue awa studies as far as we wish
For school, dem suppose help us develop awa talents, and dem suppose teach understanding and respect for evrione's human rights
Dem suppose teach us say make we get on wit odas whateva dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri wey dem kom from
Awa parents get di right to choose wetin kind of school wey we go to
Dis type of laws na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for di House of Representatives for di US wearing her Hijab witout any protection.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance sponsor and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Nigeria
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conducts and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors make dem discriminate against persons, students or personnel wey dey professional
Wen dem pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or dose executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am to becloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welkome development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document wey dem explain above
E dey in line wit similar laws wey dem pass recently for di kontri wey dey seek to tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Pipo (VAP).
As disability wan eradicate all form of discrimination based on person disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One at a time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social menaces wey dey bedevil awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no be bikos say prior generic law no cover dem but bikos say dem need address more comprehensively so dem go fit address dem more comprehensively make dem address dem
While UDHR fit seem like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like am dey provide to allocate punishments for offenders
Contrary to di view of hin critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, notin dey wey go show attempt to seek di enthronement of state religion on any state state.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di government of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State Religion
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public space smack of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female hin or her religious freedom negate awa multicultural pretenses
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right wey dey enshrine for Nigeria constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Right legal document
A bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimation based on religious ground, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation pose threat to air safety
Dem also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go aid safe aircraft navigation
Di President of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey exist for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and na watch room wey dem dey u
Hin also tok say oda airports for di kontri no get di necessary equipment for seamless navigation
Hin explain say some airports no get functioning equipment
Even Kaduna no get control tower
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey no dey built for dat purpose, and we don dey call on di goment make dem do something
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controllers go go look for umbrellas to sit for di control tower, and wetin be e, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di territory wey dey attached to di te
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there
Calabar no dey; no airport wey you go go today wey you go say things dey work 80 per cent
NAMA don employ and train 40 new controllers recently, but NATCA tok say di number dey too low to meet di shortfall
Howeva, di Managing Director of di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest hugely in improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations
Hin tok say na mere politics
Di goment don spend plenti for di recent past to improve aviation infrastructure
I no dey tok am bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always be, ask di pipo wey dey di street, ask di pipo wey dey NAMA, dem go tell you, dem neva get am so good untop di street.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two in place, two odas dey kom
Goment just spend N1.7bn for mobile control tower
Also di revitalisation of di safe tower dey ongoing
We dey revamp di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system
Oda sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communications technology particularly di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, wey dey isolated by di international economy wey
E-commerce equally foster direct access to distant markets and promote globalisation and commercial activities and blur many of di current distinctions between domestic and foreign markets.
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of a product, e include e-mail, and oda communication platforms, all information or service wey company fit offer to customers wey dey customers
Di major significance of E-commerce na di fact say e dey encourage single world trading system, wey dey facilitated by access through electronic means to go buy
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey lag behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Dem don conduct plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system lag behind ICT-based legislation and say di existing statutory laws dey quite inadequate to address di legal system.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and many more
Derefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime
Dem don tok am plenti time say for Nigeria, significant efforts at di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of draft bills before di National Assembly go pass di National Ass
E dey important to note say, even wia dem pass dis bills into law, Nigeria fit face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Given di speed wit which di internet dey permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best solution for di transaction wey
To achieve dis, di National Assembly suppose pressurise di National Assembly into passing bills wey dey about electronic commerce, wey be di top priority so dem fit enact dem into law as quick
For di interim, awa courts suppose take giant stride to dey interpret di existing traditional laws liberally so as to bridge di gaps therein in order to make dat kind laws apun
Indeed, dem argue am say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit facilitate electronic transaction and attendant documentation legally
Di court fit adapt to recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract
As di then Justice Bingham once put am thus: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility [as di law merchant] to adapt emsef to di changin needs of di community.
Dem dey hope say dis judicial activism go dey adopted by oda Nigerian judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive, especially for di areas wia awa legislation don exist, especially for di areas wey awa
Dis go set good precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di german issue wey dey regard to contract for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statutes on real property and landed instruments, all of di statutes on real property a
Question den be say electronic mark or sign go be valid sign-off of a contract by email and be binding?
Many of dis issues still no dey quite settled even for di UK although some decisions dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
So marks for emails as satisfying di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transaction na paperless transaction wey dem make through magnetic material like tape or disk
Dis dey in contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dey embodied for permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures wey dem usually authenticate by di authority.
Dem no fit alter dat kind transaction witout an alteration on di face of di document
Wit respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey dey relate to data message dey conveniently satisfy any requirement wey dem get
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
Thus, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures
Di use of password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
Hence person fit safely posit say electronic signature for di purpose of execution dey admissible in evidence provided dem don certify and incorporate am for electronic communication.
Also, oda legal challenge wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contract
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation
Di question na for what point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic business
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction say order or invoice wey dem transmit no don alter and emanate from whoever dem appear to be from
Di need to guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce no doubt be aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom stay for dis time
Di government suppose go beyond creating laws, to activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for dia commercial interactions and for delivery of government services.

Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat
Di Transition Charter, wey contain 95 articles, dey guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
Dem don set up transition goment, wey di new president name di members wey di new president name
Dem discharge di members of di army wey dem call to di transition goment from all military duties, di charter tok

Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for nearly 30 years, succumbed to wounds wey hin suffer durin a visit to di battlefield for di kontri's north wia Chadian soldiers dey soldiers.
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders, while dem dey suspend di constitution and dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over in di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose take power afta Deby death and no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case hin die, den di speaker of di parliament go take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so all di constitution go take charge of
But di military announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and dem don dissolve di constitution, so wetin dem dey do be say dem replace di constitution.

Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by hin FA for di team's failure to control dia players, Mirror report.
For seven years, dem don find di team pants down for seven hot-tempered rows wit opponents
Di recent brawl during a clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League teams
Last week match between Chelsea and Leicester dey marred by skirmishes between di players of both teams
As dem dey cite similar offenses for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea
Dem don charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff afta Ricardo Pereira challenge on Ben Chilwell

US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpay, oversexed and over here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion wey plenti British pipo kom to get of di thousands of American GIs wey dem station for different military bases for Britain during di military time.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers frequently go into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up a feeling of disdain for di soldiers.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldiers evriwia for di hundreds of American military bases ovaseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany and Stuttgart for Germany
Na why I dey perturbed, like plenti Nigerians, dat for one virtual meeting last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President of di United States of America
Dem presume say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State
Di meeting suppose dey wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go transmit di details aftawards to di president
Yes, America na superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and suppose dey follow strictly for all circumstance
Understandably, Nigeria dey face wit gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best effort of goment and di nation's security establishment.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all ova di kontri and di targeted kilin of security pipo for di kontri.
But even at dat, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigerian soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria is hardly justified.
Africom na one of nine command by di American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interest around di world
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis commands, particularly dose outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security mata.
Dem only do am wen dat kind issue dey directly affect American interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no go mandate dem yield dia modus operandi and share interest
If Africom dey set up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island wey go restrict access to Nigerians of all categories and establish jurisdiction witin di kontri.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of security.
For di particular case of Africom, part of hin original concept na to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa following awa intervention.
Africom's precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria's strategic interest for Africa
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make plenti secret and open visit to plenti African kontris to sell hin products.
But bikos Nigeria be di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no dey far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, go be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem tout am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance for di ACRI and though dem tout
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into area wey e consider im exclusive sphere of information
For di review, wey drew di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di American congress midwife for second time wey di American congres
Based on di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of American political and security establishments, dem set up Africom
Africom go be to Africa wey US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey base for Florida, na to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey Stuttgart, Germany, na to di Middle East and Asi
Nigeria don surround by French military presence for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans also get drone base for Niger
Adding Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America
As we dey bear in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no always cohere wit dose of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent to dey host Africom for
Nothin dey for di present insecurity challenge wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for dose kontris from all ova di world.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, afta dem fall from di high standards wey dem know of am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internationally.
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military get di capacity and capability to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, di right leadership, di right leadersh
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dem dey willing
But despite awa circumstances dey arm-twisted into hosting di Africom in view of its antecedents and implications to awa strategic interests, on awa soil

E tok say di cost of mechanised farming wey fit rapidly increase productivity don bikom expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to produce small scale producers
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water during di dry season dey affect potato farmers and lead to annual low production of potato.
Bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey search for borehole location to farm to access irrigation water for dia farms
Martha explain also say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent many farmers from improving quantity and quality of yield, adding say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di productivity of di agricultu
Di cost also prevent many of us from expanding di business
So, to get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes
If di water no dey sufficient for di crop, e go dry and eventually die and na why some farmers wey get di resource prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu purposely

Di fraud dey perpetrated as dem steal di identities of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem dey file falsified claims wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for payment wey dem no get.
For each identity wey dem steal, dem create separate e-mail account so dat di claim go associate wit different pipo and e fit escape automatic fraud detection system.
Afta, dem pay more dan $288,000 into hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisation and kontri
Nigeria don lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes annually
By di end of 2021, di world go lose a total of $6 trillion
Till date, more dan 40 Nigerians don dey or dey dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai's alleged unemployment benefits fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on di loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisations
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia frauds along di interventions from goment and private sectors and scammed many and some of di pipo wey dey intervene from goment and p

As pipo dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngsters do am for inside Nigeria
Dem dey regularly arrest, try and convict dem by di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
Understanding di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment to fight di crime
Di family na di microcosm of di larger society
Na di place wey dem suppose nurture normal human being for di society
Apart from di fact say many Nigerian families dey di dungeon of poverty and can hardly take care of dia pikin, some of dis children don bikom breadwinners
Challenge dey wit ethical behaviour training for plenti houses as parents dey arrest alongside dia pikin wey dey involve in cyber-criminality.
Elsewia, mothers of yahoo-boys dey form associations to celebrate dia sons success and justify dia criminal behaviours
For di religious setting, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalists create house and dem benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
One viral video dey wey dem show some boys dey spray moni while dose wey appear to be shepherds for white garment church enjoy di moment while di pipo wey appear to be shepherds for white garment chu
One pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy now 21 years old
Sadly, dem grew up to appreciate lying as a way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many cases from house) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and dem no fulfil dia way of life.
Lying am na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism
Dem dey socialise youths daily to corruption and fraud by dose wey dey hold public office
Dem see how dia system provide soft landing for fraudulent pipo (public or private)
Dem ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don dey fully investigated and discharged wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty
Di majority of di case end wit off-the-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as family affair
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyle wey dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how once poor political aspirants dey transform into millionaires witin months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institutions don bikom cash and carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, dey award undeserving honours in exchange for moni
Dem provide all dose wey mismanage funds wit soft landing
Add to dis list of cultures wey dey nurture cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work wey dem dey work.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, dem go make laws against di crime wey dem dey involve in?
Di process of giving parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need dey review if we go stop importing problematic tokunbo products into awa already existing market
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni dey dangle for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for dubious characters to cover up dia tracks and awa society dey worse off through dia action
Greed also nurture cyber-criminality
FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and expect grace to abound
Nigeria must sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey dey track lifestyle wit material accumulation
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria to dey create employment opportunities, reduce poverty and review reward systems
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures
Di Commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspect as di FBI do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang
Unless dem tackle di culture wey dey sustain cybercrime for Nigeria through social engineering, cyber-criminality go kontinue to fester

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make some far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem dey famously refer to as di Asaba Declaration
Di meeting dey kom on di heels of insecurity wey dey worse for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending menace of murderous herdsmen generate nationwide conflict.
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meeting and di unanimity wey di 17 governors display show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring witin di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing form di core of di declaration
Major highlights include di clamour for state police, devolution of powers, review of revenue formula in favour of federating units and di need for national dialogue wey dey apun.
While di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and dey run contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dey apun for Nigeria.
One go expect say di leading lights of APC go take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parties for Nigeria.
Instead, we see attempt to play to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of powers, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federation
President Buhari don since give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order for di Nigeria.
Given di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose grave challenges, dis twin sectors suppose receive di utmost attention, concurrently.
Despite di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make sufficient effort to translate dat to improve standards of living for di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Af
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di need of an estimated 220 million Nigerians
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes wey dey reach 17m of dia population.
Di effort of Buhari administration, even say dem dey novel and commendable, still represent drop for ocean and dem no dey adequate to make di impact wey dem need
Na wia devolution of power and resource control kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business staying a day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercially viable natural resources wey dem fit exploit to create wealth and generate di needed foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wia states kom cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey breed indolence, dey contrary to di principle of true federalism.
Just as El-Rufai committee propose, make dem review di revenue formula for favour of states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem
For state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excesses by governors dey understandable, but like Richie Norton tok say to escape fear, you need go through am, no go around around di state.
For too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force
Like Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea who time don kom
We need address awa fear and overkom am
One of di way wey dem fit do na to enact legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments.
E go dey similar for functions to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e get wider power to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban on open grazing even say di governors restate no be new and dey form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Commission approve by di National
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system wey dey underperform
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us
Di convocation of National Dialogue, one major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of di report of di 2014 National Conf
Both report make far-reaching recommendation say awa elected governors and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of wasting scarcity and scarcity.
On di issue of separatist agitations, make dem convene referendum wey dem spell out for di konstitution
E dey almost certain say a vast majority of Nigerians wan live togeda, awa differences, notwitstanding.
Doing dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian
Even say we get challenge like evri oda kontri, we must listen to awasef, like US President Joe Biden don tok
