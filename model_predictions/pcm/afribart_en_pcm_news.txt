Federal and state goment dey struggle to implement National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey seek to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict
While di Plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges
Di lack of political leadership wey popular misperception about di purpose, budgetary constraints wey COVID-19 pandemic get, lack of personnel wey get di experience to carry am out and widespread insecurity wey dey all di insecurity wey dey progress
If di Plan fail as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management don do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate

For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmer
E dey animated by di hope say over 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastors dem go dey persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wer breedingg farms and oda mechanised livestock management practices dem go dey improve di sector productivity.
By di end of 2028, authorities go aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all participatin states, wey go create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processin and marketing chains.
Muhammadu Buhari administration administration, wey dey follow a wave of violence between herders and farmers, particularly a surge in violence wey dey afflicting rural dwellers in 2018.
Di federal goment, wey don commit to funding 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey di states submit, don take preliminary steps toward putting di Plan into practice, includin providing technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like to dey help wit field surveys and site mapping.
Plenti states don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, dem open office and dem set up steering committees wey go administer di Plan.
Authorities don hold workshops and do oda work to explain di benefit of livestock reform to larger audience
As two years don pass for di 10-year plan, di first new ranch neva dey built, and di obstacles dem dey plenti.
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plans benefits to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.
distrusty widespread for di Middle Belt, which don be scene of violent disputes over land between herders and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts wey don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget dey pinch, partlyly todadadadadamics economic fallout, and di kontri lack sufficient technical expertise to managing ranches and grazing reserves.
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and e dey scarce potential investors
Unless dem address am, dis and oda problems fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, leaving di kontri vulnerable to herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
dis challenges need effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors.

Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey go change one century old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately doubt di Plan promise about available pasture.
But many farmers dey fear too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
for Middle Belt and south states dey suspicious of di Plans long-term goals, which dey see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, di Fulani.
wit Abuja and oda partner support, state goment must build expertise and technical capacity, especially managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.

To dey address rural insecurity, to dey stop impunity and to dey rehabilitate communities wey be victims of earlier violence for participating states dey important
plus, authorities go need consider climate changes likely impact and make dem reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey dey cross into Nigeria seasonally suppose or should not benefit from di Plan.
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plans proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible result for a relatively short-term basis.
Na two years wey remain, di kontri go hold general election.
If di plan to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians go need to dey produce clear proof of hin benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors no dey compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
By di time wey di campaign go dey heat up for late 2022, di Plan backers suppose dey able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
No go easy, but di plan dey worth di effort
As e no perfect, e dey offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of both herders and small-scale farmers
About 70 per cent of Naija workforce dey earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity ova di same time dat e takes big step to resolve one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts.
As di clock dey tick down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quickly to make visible mark, make dem no go tink di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity be lost.

Farmers dey battle for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders wey dey di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers go contend wit.
Di agriculture sector don face plenti challenges, from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey Covid-19 pandemic dey bring, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions apun for di time dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crop and wet season farmers dey about to start cultivation.
farmers no access to dia farms while for oda getting labourer to harvest dia farms since mechanization na huge challenge and harvest is manual, na di problem.
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus lockdown market don disrupt di rural economy
farmers wey no sell dia produce,yy dey buy seed and fertilizer, pay labourer/tractor services.
Even wen dey lift di lockdown for agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer don dey so high dat plenti small-scale farmers no fit afford am
For some place, di price go as low as N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti place and areas wia r dey di price don rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places
for farmers for Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto state, bandit activities no dey only deny access to dia farms but leave plenty farmers for dia farms.
Dem raze plenti farmin communities down
dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
Many pipo don pay large sum of moni or surrender large portions of dia harvest to di bandits.
Many villages for those states don dey desolate
Diric sector sef witness one of di worst disasters wey floods out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields wey wey estimate at ova N3.5 billion acrosskebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Dem neva compensate plenti of di affected farmers as dia livelihood don destroy
Di flood been di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Naija's coastal cities and flood-prone areas kilin pipo and washing away farmland
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey confronted wit drought.
For two months, farmers dey watch helplessly as dia investment for crops don slink away
no dey disguise
Anoda subsector wey dey badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos why prices increase
E kom force di Poultry Association of Nigeria make dem send save awa soul to di Federal goment for urgent attention
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers in adition to granting some of di big players license to dey import about 222 metric ton of maize to increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean don struck, making di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut down completely.
Di scarcity na em make di industry dey serious as di price don reach a record high for im history as e don drop from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now.
Di poultry industry wey dem estimate say dem lose N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem projecte to reach 10 million by January 2021 wia di loss for investment na conservatively estimate am at about N1.5 trillion.
While di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey dey face di subsector, di crop farmers despite di hard challenges wey confront di sector durin di 2020 farming year, don buyers kom right up to dia farms even before harvest to make bulk purchase arrangements.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains don dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, wey fit bring fear of hunger and di call for di borders make dem open, wey go allow influx of smuggled products pass di kontri's porous borders.

Recently, di Southern states governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminality.
Na wetin you take on top di heated controversy wey dis decision generate
na evri human being get right to opinions and opinions.
But di one wey important pass na say wen una take una action, make una dey aware of di consequences
Una suppose dey consider di advantages and disadvantages.
I no be one of dose wey dey tok say e good or bad
As a Nigerian, you get di right and freedom to live anywhere in di kontri, in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
On dis basis, I no go say na good thing
as leader for North Central zone, I tok say na good thing, especially for di North Central zone, due to di potential economic benefits for us and di nation.
Di ban be advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am a real venture and make moni from am
luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herders, no mata di number wey fit troop from di South into di North Central

I no be one of di propagators of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practise as a pesin.
I believe say if we take to ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central Governors suppose accommodate di national programme for ranching
One move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo go always get access to cattle and all di oda products
Na economic empowerment for di North Central pipo be dat
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get.
look atkogi, Niger, Kwara and odas.
we fit accommodate di herders and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey Fulani herders dey pose no be be say dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on di advantages wey dem get
dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem suppose dey well educated to embrace ranching.
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia almost all di family get ranch and you no see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for be dat?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no dey call for ranching and for di federal goment to kom in
wetin dem dey tok be say di herders don bikom problem for us and make we go away
dem tok say make di herders apply for land wey dem claim say na private business.
But don dey ask dia indigenes say make dem apply for land like di herder dem?
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programme, especially for di agricultural sector and its value chain, why some goment policy fail to realise dia objectives and wetin be di way out?
First, no administration wey don touch di lives of pipo like President Muhammadu Buhari administration whereby you fit sit for your house and apply for facilities and you get dem
Di target credit facility wey dem also know as COVID-19 loan
Plenti Naija pipo don get am for convenient use for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house witout going to office.
, with SMEs de expanded like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and oda.
Di challenge be say we get two side dem wey go believe in you and those wey go criticise you
For dos wey no believe in Buhari administration, nothing dey beneficial
for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for it.

National Assemblyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy fight against corruption.
National Assembly of Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th.
May 2021 for House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 for di Senate floor of law, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.B.C.C.C.C.C.615 and HB.C.C.615 for HB.
afta wey dey read for di Third time in both Chamber (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly patriotism and direct response, wey dem target to strengthen and re-invigorating national frontiers in di fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, wey don sit deep inside di fabric of awa nation.
wit di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly, im ardent resolve to carry out im legislative functions in line wit di provision of di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.
And dis also attest to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of Government wen dem dey fight against corruption.
E dey with great delight and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dey join togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on board in oda in oda to complement national efforts in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di passage of dis Bill by di Senate, and in view of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbabiamila, na di hona.
follow and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As u fit know, di Bill to establish di Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di bill wey dey viciously attack and antagonise bill for di National Assembly for recent time.
Sadly, di attack kom from those wey suppose be partners in progress for di fight against corruption wey dey endemic for Nigeria, but dem don instead design demsef as enemies of di general good.
Good no get any substitute so e go also dey bad
No mata how long e take, gud always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light over darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e all apun for National Assembly
Interestingly, The Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) wey dem first pass into law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dem don follow di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 di bill no dey gree pass by Nigeria Senate bikos dem don consider di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no dey wit plenty series of thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop at any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful for assisting di Buhari administration to fight corruption no dey see di light of di day but di senate stood firm and saw it through.
E dey very important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but na novel one for Nigeria wey dem dey target to bridge gap wey don dey for di forensics space
Today, di journey to get one standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-goment bodies wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di nid to further strengthen all national efforts wey dey geared towards di fight against corruption, wey donhinder development for evri aspect of awa national lives.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, as e dey kom for time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
wey go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive, due to di rising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe
As we know, crime generally, don assume new dimension, due to advancement in science and technology for di 21st century
So, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging global realities and e dey ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey apposite to also state say di journey, wey make dem pass dis Bill, begin for di 8th National Assembly whereby, dem sponsor awa Bill, by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen him be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration..
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers durin di 8th National Assembly, dem conduct awa public hearing by di relevant Committee for di respective Chambers.
Afta and in spite of opposition from stakeholders wey dey in di minority, led by di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), di National Assembly pass di Bill, due to di significance and di part wey e go play for di fight against corruption.
aftaward, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
Na on di strength of dis, say dem re-introduce di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, dem sponsor am by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, wey be di current Leader of di Senate, in view of di importance wey dey attached to am.
We dey constrained to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propelled dat dem reject awa Bill by di 8th National Assembly.
wey besay our Bill nay dey mistaken for similar Bills, wey dey recently introduce for both di Senate and House of Representatives Chambers.
upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem dey merely duplication of di intent and purports of awa Bill
We suppose stress am say no be dis Bill dem wey dem introduce for di 8th National Assembly pass awa Bill
So, na first ever wey kom up wit Bill wey dey dis magnitude,( forensic)
Afta we don see di urgent nid to establish dat kin Institute.
Di decision to establish di Institute na afta a painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdictions and how well dem don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey so tey 2009.
And ova di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go target at inculcating di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis use eliminate material misstatement, weda error or fraud dey cause am; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cyber security; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc..
Una go agree wit me say for today world wey we dey, di conventional way of investigating crimes, wit a view to fight am don obsolete
As such, make we as a nation do wetin dey meaningful for dis regard, we dey paramount say make we align awaselves wit di global trend and emerging innovations, wey dem target to fight corruption.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say di idea to establish dis Institute dey conceived wit a well-structure laudable objective wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill for here.
Howeva, I wish make you do your work, make you highlight a few of di objective of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;.
To provide platform for trainin and re-training of intending professionals in di usage of Forensic Science and technology tools and techniques in di investigation of frauds in both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners wey dey di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and to develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di existing huge vacuum for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science wey go help di kontri from expending its scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates dem to do forensic investigations for Nigeria;
base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base base
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and.
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanism,throughdi provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas.
From di foregoing, e dey show say di role of dis Institute dey strategic and important
E dey important to reiterate say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards.
Di branch of di scope and focal point of di Institute, include but e no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditin; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accountin; forensic nursin; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordin to me, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, unique concept of crime detection and investigation in comliance wit international best practices
Dis concept dey beyond di reasoning of dos wey don get myopic view about di purports of our Bill don becloud dia senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wish make evribodi dey notice di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, na source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Di Institute offorensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria wey dey di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) dey out vehemently to oppose im passage, because im be unnecessary duplication of functions already wey dia Institute dey do.
upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and having seen di overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports wey awa Bill get, from di two Chambers, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce a similar Bill wey dey before House of Representatives, dey fail woefully for dia attempts to stop di passage of our Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN dey hold di view say there shouldn't be Institute wey go dey regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as mine
I suppose inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no dey part of dis Funny theatrical episode
just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don introduce Bill for House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey dem initiate and dey don promote by ANAN
Na me decide to bring out all diz facts so Nigerians and even di international communities go understand di extent to which some pipo fit go in oda to achieve dia aims.
wey no dey perturbed by dis developments because we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do weyy dey right and no allow dem dey manipulated in any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as e no sweety of di entire thing.
Di ICAN wey we know practical and antagonist for dis Bill don remain ICAN for reason wey don dey show am now.
Dey engage several bystanders dem to dey write frivolous petitions some even target for di leadership of di senate wit tone of blackmail
Afta he don fail for di senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystander wey dey write all manner of publication.
again, dey fail
By legislative procedure, bill wey dem just pass by di senate go need di concurrence by di house safe for wia dem dey tok dia own
for di Cordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordinordingegegegegepapapapapapapapapapapapapapapa
ICAN don now register im Bill for House of Representatives wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Dis ICAN new Bill dey full of provision for practice of forensic, and e dey also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria wey nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead dat kain person go some years imprisonment.
Dis one dey strange for kontri wey full of enlightened pipo.
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level of corruption for therein.
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives.
Make dem note say, to dey challenge di bill no dey out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di main koko for dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of say similar legislation dey existence.
We no go allow awaselves and Nigerians to deceive us by dia antics
You go rememba how ICAN strongly opposed dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of its sponsored publications by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey led by Engr.(Chief)
Alade on di 24th May, 2019 make very efforts to say ICAN under its enabling laws dey empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to be passed e go dey duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present hin ACT to becey re-enacted with di inclusion of Forensics in di new law.
Di question na, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey seeking for its re-enactment.
As always, we no dey opposed to any group wey dey propose make dem inclusion of forensics for hin laws, we dey however concerned say make di bodi no try perpetuate itself.
ICAN and cohort don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so dem go wan get bodi inside itself
wey fear ofsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsin.
How dey wan be judge for dia own case?
Dis one dey strange
On dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly make dem deyware of di acrobatics wey dis groups dey do, make dem no dey tok from dia mouth say dem wan cajole di National Assembly.
We want appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly in ensuring say dem pass di Bill, di Nigeria pipo dey more than ever before convinced of di readiness of dis administation to fight corruption through evri possible means and e go even encourage legislation wey dey for achieving dis goal.
We dey confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate in assenting to dis Bill as soon as e reach im desk.
We dey call on all Nigerians to kom and be part of di Forensics Profession.
Di profession dey open for all professionals wey dey various field of endeavours
Training arm of di institute go guide you and equip you
I wish thank you all and to also reiterate awa resolve and commitment to upholding ethical standards in line wit global best practices, in rendering awa professional services and trainings wey go bring about innovative ways to fight corruption and financial crimes, generally.
I wish appeal to all stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore us all make we make effort so we go fit surmount di menace of corruption, di plethora of security challenges, across di kontri and oda crises wey dey associated

between between DSS and regional separatist.
Di warning wey DSS give person and group wey dey utterances and activities don constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and dey threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, don dey monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience push di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.

Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E den dawn on all dat truly na di pipo and groups wey don dey kontinue to dey tok, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts wey dem dey do to pit citizens against one another in order to apparently inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as DSS don dey charge for one of its warnings.
Interestingly, nobodi of dis prime suspects for di exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance itself from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency dey detected
Dem use common conviction say DSS no know those wey dey responsible, differing only for di respective directions of dia accusing fingers
As Afenifere don torchlight say pipo wey dey responsible for dis acts but dey no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehashed e grouse about many pipo wey dey feel say dem dey alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, dey ask who dem be for pipo?
so tey di DSS don know dem and dia satanic mission, make dem dey proactive in dealing wit dem.
Di NEF don sound unconvinced wit if pipo wey dey push di kontri to deeper crises and dem don know; make dem dey treat dem according to di law.
Una no need to dey spook to know wetin DSS know about each and all of dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS know dem yet dey insist to dey pass di buck outside their cliques.
Di truth be say all dis champions of ethnic politiks no know of beta solution to Nigeria myriad problems dan for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord am over di rest of di kontri. No be leaders
So desperate and unscrupulous dem in pursuing dia inordinate ambitions wey dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria
Ambition power mind game intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all e take to dey excise di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
To dey simple as say dem don break up or out of Nigeria as ultimate politikal panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of pipo or groups wey dey restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners to dey endure peaceful coexistence, e dey easy say dem no go do am.
Dis regional groups dey veri important hindrance to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey struggle for since since dia flag don dey independence
So long as dem continue to dey parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long will dey regard Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake in di population, to be claimed or seized and, if all else fail, dem go dey deconstructed and disowned as failed state.
Wen dey meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless e leadership dey firmly on dia grasp, otherwise, e go all about hecklin and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
na ACF,enifere, Ohanaeze, or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda indictment wey dis regional separatists get na say dem all be self-style political pressure groups, wey be representatives of different ethnic groups.
from dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consist of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di impetus to come togeda, dem dey desperate to remain relevant for democratic system wey elected representatives dey through registered political parties wit legislative and executive institutions wey dem constitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratik setting as dem dey persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, wey dem get brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey often threaten and attempt, so dat, perchance, dem go fit regain political relevance if not control.
Na di reason why dia frequent clandestine meetin dey trigger security alert
Wit such predator-politicians wey dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent to undermine an elected goment just because dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say must be convergence of interest wey dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, wey dey join to make Nigeria ungovernable.
double jeopardy perfectly describe di predicament of di Buhari administration wey go contend wit such array of formidable foes wey dey unleashing incessant attacks on national security in a time of unprecedented economic adversity.
To dat extent, two groups of politicians fit dey: dose wey dey positively participate for di democratic dispensation as partners for moving di nation forward against all odds and dose wey dey negatively engaged in sowing seeds of discord and disorder to dey scatter di kontri.
By dia utterances and activities, we all know dem
For di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens wey condition of survival no dey determine by and e no dey depend on di place dem wey dem dey live for.
Diir daily struggle to eke a livin dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith.
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland wey dem go love to dey loyal, law abidin and prayerful, knowing say no oda kontri dey to call dias, and to show how citizenship dey breed true patriotism
Dem too know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey tok tins wey dem no suppose guard, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one oda in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambitions of dia leaders.
Soso di poor man's prayer go remain:
GOD dey,
NIGERIA GO BETTER!

Wetin no suppose wear for public: Dey Negate Nigeria multiculturalism
by Bashiririririrairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairairaira
Shey na coincidence say, as trouble dey brew for Kwara state recently, dem dey consider solution to im kind for di lower house of di National Assembly wey dey di capital Territory of Abuja?
Di trouble for Ilorin na becos of di refusal of some Christian schools make dem allow dia Muslim student hijab wear to di school
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, wey dem call Hijab Bill, by some part of di Nigerian media
Di two events don bring up heated and often emotional debate wey, for di bottom of it all, dey threaten to negate Nigeria multicultural identity and reality
Di whole idea for Kwara wey di proprietors of di schools dey banning hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathimer dem fit reduce to wetin dem no fit wear for public
wey concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities.
Dem dey face female Nigerians bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Clearly, di former dey breach di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence for taking such position.
Di latter dey try assert say dis right no be only Muslims but also Christians wia e dey or weneva dem dey threaten dem wit discrimination based on di faith wey dem dey professe
If we luk di argument wey di proprietors of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, we fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children go oda schools for Kwara if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument plenti
First, to dey tok say Muslim student dem suppose go elsewhere unless dem don follow di school rule on uniform dey very small to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: is it justifiable to base school rule bikos of christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Den, third time, di go elsewhere argument dey unda di difficulties in changing school for a child.
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act to dey change school for your child, educational psychologists go tell you say e dey affect negatively wit no be only im emotional but academic development too
Finally, di Christian faith schools dem fit risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate students wit di same religion belief for particular schools.
Di social cost dis exacts for di society big
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goment don dey convinced say im policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey dey anchored on mutual respect and understanding.
For kontri wey dey guarantee freedom of religion, we sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question wey dem dey ask na: how justified im to give Nigerian child access to school wey e fit choose on di basis of di religion wey e show
Na great concern becos Nigeria dey signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR don insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of di colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 article on rights and freedom wey include, among odas, civil and political right, like di right to life, free speech and privacy
E kom include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey relevant to di issue under consideration and quote them in full below:
Article 18: Evri pesin get di freedom to dey think or believe wetin dem want, plus di right to make religious belief
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa religion, alone or wit odas.
Everyone get di right to education

Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors from discriminating against persons students or personnel based on dia religion belief or its manifestation.
pass, di law go bury issues like we wey we see for good.
E go also address di bigotry of some employer, or dos executives wey dey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am to deycloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welcome development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria constitution and UDHR document as we don explain above.
in line wit similar laws wey pass Pass recently for di kontri wey dey won tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP).
While disability dey seek to eradicate all form of discrimination based on persin ability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for a time, awa representatives for di legislative chamber dey tackle di social threat wey dey apun for awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no becos prior generic laws wey cover dem no dey but bikos dem need to address dem more comprehensively to leave room for opacity.
While UDHR fit lyk like far, distant document witout instrument of enforcement, the RDPP Law and odas like it dey provide to allocate punishment for offenders
Contrary to di view of hin critics, as far as di RDPP Bill is concerned, nothing dey show attempts at seeking di enthronement of a state religion on any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually
Section 10 for Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di goment of di Federation or of a state no go adopt any religion as State religion
To dey peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di right of muslim woman wey dey wear Hijab for public space wey dey smack of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female im or her religious freedom dey negate awa multicultural pretenses
E dey negate di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey for Nigeria constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document
One bill wey go criminalize such decimation base on religious grounds, like di RDPP bill, na welkom development

How person fit dey chase newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you make pipo dey read hard copies of newspaper, you go also stop dem to dey read di same tin for facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, among odas?

NAMA don kick as air traffic controllers dey lament poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Naija on Sunday cried out ova dilapidated navigational equipment for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs, under di sponsorship of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation dey pose threat to air safety.
Dem still claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get kontrol tower wey go aid for safe aircraft navigation.
Di president of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for di chat wit newsmen at di weekend, tok say wetin dey exist for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and e no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controllers.
Im also tok say oda airport for di kontri don lack di necessary equipment for seamless navigation.
E explain say som airports no get functioning equipment.
Even Kaduna no get kontrol tower.
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we don dey call on di goverment to do sometin.
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controller go go look for umbrellas wey go sit for di control tower, and wetin is it, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings na hin dey ceed FAAN, while doz wey dey stand alone dey with NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication for here and dat

NAMA don recently employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall.
Howeva, di Managin Director for di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true.
Hin tok say federal goment don invest hugely in improving navigational aids and in aiding safe flight operations
Hin tok say na mere politics
Di goment don spend plenti time for di past to dey improve aviation infrastucture
I no dey tok dis one bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion na, ask di pipo wey dey street, ask di pipo wey dey NAMA, dem go tell you say dem neva get am so good under dis administration.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two for place, two odas dey kom

Also revitalisation dey ongoing for di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.

E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communication technology particularly di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, wey dey isolated by distance, time zone and language and e dey isolated by di national differences for goment regulations
E-commerce sef foster direct access to distant markets and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and e dey blur many of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to an extent say e dey practically impossible to determine di origin of di products.
E no dey limited to di purchase of a product, e include e-mail, and oda communication platforms, all information or service wey a company fit offer to customers over di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
Di major significance of E-commerce na di fact say e dey encourage single world trading system, wey dey access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey exist behind dey towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Plenti legal research and study don conduct on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis study dey of di opinion say di Nigeria legal system dey lag for ICT-based legislation and say di existing statutory law dey inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issue include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenty more.
Need dey make dem map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, wey go govern di emerging regime
Dey don tok am plenti time say for Nigeria, significant efforts still dey ground for di regulation of e-commerce activities, even say dem dey still di stage to present Bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say, even for wia dem don pass dis bill into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Sake of di speed wey di internet dey use do commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best tin wey dem fit suggest na say, di legal issues and problems wey dey face e-commerce for di kontri suppose address dem directly and expeditiously, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To achieve dis, di National Assembly suppose dey pressuriSed into passing bills wey dey concern electronic commerce, a top priority so dem go fit enact am into law as e possible
For di interim, awa courts suppose take giant stride by interpreting di existing traditional law liberally so as to bridge di gaps therein in order to make such laws wey dey amenable to electronic transactions, particularly for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
For true we go argue say legislation no be di only means by which electronic transaction and documentatube dey facilitate legally
Di courts fit also recognise electronic transactions wen di absence of legislation or private contract.
As di Justice Bingham don tok am thus: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility as di law merchant wey dey adapt e sef to di changing needs of di general public; principles no change, but old rules dey apply di change, and new rules spring into existence.
Dey hope say oda Nigerian judges go join hand for dis judicial activism, Supreme Court justices inclusive, especially for areas wey awa legislation no dey adequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advancements.
Dis go certainly set good example to ensure say di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di German issue wey dey regard to contract for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statute on real property and landed instrument, wey require say certain contracts suppose dey in writing and executed duly
di question be say, electronic mark or sign go constitute valid sign-off of contract by email and go dey binding
Many of dis issue neva settle even for UK although some decisions dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
so dem mark am for inside emails as e dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution.
E-commerce transaction na paperless transaction wey dem dey make through magnetic material like tapes or disks
Dis dey contradictinction to di paper-based transactions wey dem dey embodied for a permanent form and dem dey typically express for words and figures wey dem dey authenticate by signatures
We no fit change dat kind transaction witout di face of di document.
wit respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey dey relation to data message conveniently satisfy any requirement for a handwritten signature, so far as e dey surely identify electronic record of di individual
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
Thus, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures
Di use of password, identification, user name and evri oda fit suffice.
So tey, e fit posit say electronic signatures for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence provided e dey certified and e dey incorporated for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenge wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation
Di question be say for what point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for wetin point dem fit tok say dem get intension to enter legal relation?
E-commerce require confidence and trust say transmitted orders or invoices neva change and e dey emanate from whoever dem appear to be from
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
e no doubt aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time.
Di goment suppose go beyond to create laws, make e activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for e commercial interaction and for delivery of goment services

Na dat bin di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo kom get of di thousands of American GIs wey dey station for different military bases for Britain durin di Second World War
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers dey frequently enta pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up a feeling of disdain for di yanks among di locals.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldiers evriwia for di hundreds of American military bases overseas from Okinawa inside Japan, Stuttgart inside Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for Philippines.
Na di reason why I dey perturbed, like many Nigerians, say for one virtual meeting wey I do last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari bin don ask di United States if dem wan relocate di African Command (Africom) wey dey its military wey dey presently based for di southern German city of Stuttgart go Africa.
E dey presume say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meetin wit di American Secretary of State
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go transmit di details aftawards to di president
Yes, America na superpower and e plenty evrithing, but protocol na protocol and e suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances.
We know say Nigeria dey currently face internal insecurity issues wey defy di best efforts of goment and di nation security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnappin for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all ova di kontri and di target kilin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians join togeda wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, wey be di cocktail of insecurity now wey dey ravagin di kontri.
Di call for hosting of di Africom on Nigeria soil wen consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria dey hardly justified.
na one of nine command wey America establishment to exclusively serve America strategic interests around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, particularly those wey dey outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues for dia area of coverage.
Dem no go do am wen dat kind issue affect America interest for di area, and for dat kind situation, dem no go mandate dem to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies.
if Africom set up for Nigeria, e go be island of e own restricting access to Nigerians of all category and establishing jurisdiction within di territorial area of di base that go dey virtually limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na actually to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa following awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa sterling records of peace kipin around di world
com's precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey dey up by di Clinton administration to counter Nigeria's strategic interests for Africa.
Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher,yyyy secret and open visits to a number of African countries to sell di idea.
But sake of say Nigeria be di target, hin comot am for hin itinerary
wey be like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like like
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, wey be averse to seeing di Americans dem trying to butt into area wey e consider say na im be di exclusive sphere of influence, di ACRI concept na hin dey review
For di review, wey draw di expertise of America military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by di American congress for secret sessions, di Americans consider and realise di nid to set up African command to add to di oda command wey dey don dey ground coverin di various continents of di world.
Basin di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey kom from all facets of American politikal and security establishment, Africom was set up by di Bush Junior administration wit a wider mandate, wey no go just contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on di growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.

If we elect fraudster dem as legislators, go dem make law against di crime wey dem dey involve in?
Di process to give parti nomination to di highest bidders by party leaders need to be reviewed if we are to stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products into awa already morally bankrupt political system.

her grandmothers dey fear to dey hold am or kom closer to am witout wearing mask
If pandemic dey, my journey to motherhood go be completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter don dey front of me, she dey smile and dey star at me.
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
di only thing wey no change be dat
I be 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic start, and di planet go lockdown.
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes.
di 22 weeks no less dan war
my husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts for dat time
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
so, we dey depend on wetin I save ova di years, and I spend all my savings.
awa parents and two journalist association kom forward to help for di time being.
I dey fear evriwia.
Most of di time, e dey like death

I dey adapt to online life wey we go dey click and go dey deliver awa things home
I wait for one week to get groceries delivered this way
I even dey fear say make di only family member wey dey live wit me make I go outside kom buy food for storage
Thus, I dey chop less.
Besides, I no fit go for my antenatal check-ups
I no know say my baby dey grow healthy or if all development dey take place on time.
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring am inside a world wey dey more different than ever
Tele-medication help me pass some hard times during the last trimister.
I forget my gynaecologist face.
I no remember how she look witout di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help.
Plenti information dey float around
Inside dis chaos of information, experienced mothers, my mother, and mother-in-law fit only help me by supporting me and no meeting me for person wen I dey pregnant
traditionalally, experienced mothers and mostly older women for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get plenti panic attack becos of lack of information and understanding.
So, I dug for di experience of new mothers wey give birth durin dis time
I see social media as my lifeline.
I dey read plenti exciting experience for social media as I follow a group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic.
Different media groups for dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers make dem share dia experience and information durin di lockdown.

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
Segun Tomoriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiriiri
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and dem make som far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem dey call Asaba Declaration
As di meeting dey kom on top di heels of insecurity wey dey di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoist and di unending menace of murderous herdsmen don generate nationwide attention.
Indeed, di bipartisan nature of di meetin and di unanimity displayed by di 17 governors show say dem mean serious business
sesinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsinsin.
Major highlight include di love for state polici, devolution of power, review of revenue formula wey dey favour of federatin units and di nid for national dialogue wey go discuss di national question.
While di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and e dey contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem dey clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions na actually di cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on True Federalism make far-reaching recommendations.
One go don expect di leading lights of APC take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempts at playing to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors.
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommended devolution of powers, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula wey dey favour of federating units among odas.
President Buhari don give support for local government, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
To say di state of di nation wey security and di economy don face grave challenges, make dis twin sector receive di utmost attention, concurrently.
Even as di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Afrika, we neva make sufficient effort to transalate dat to improve standard of living for di majority of awa citizens
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion no dey adequate to cater to di need of ova 220 million Nigerians
South Africa wey get 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programmes reaching 17m of its population
The efforts of di Buhari administation, wey be novel and commendable, still represent drop for ocean and dey no reach di required impact
Na dere devolution of power and resource control kom in.
mineral and natural resources no dey available.
almost all states for di kontri get natural resources wey dem fit use create wealth and generate di needed foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wia states dey follow hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey indolence, e dey contrary to di principle of true federalism.
just as di El-Rufai committee don propose, make dem review di revenue formula in favor of states since more responsibilities go dey added to dem
For state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excesses by governors dem dey understandable, but as e tok am, To escape fear, you go through am, no go dey around am.
For too long we don dey fear say dem go abuse di state police, we don try turn blind eyes to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force that don bikom no only overly inefficient, but largely a conundrum.
Like Vice-President Osinbajo tok some year ago, State police na idea wey don kom, whose time don kom
We suppose address awa fears and overkom am
One of di ways wey we fit do na to use legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendment wey go allow State Police.
similar in functions to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but dey get wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban wey dey restate by di governors no be new and e dey form di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve.
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) don tout di NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
Di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and e dey lower di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmers It, therefore, beggars belief say some myopic, sef-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Di federal and state goment make dem do swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.
National Dialogue no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of Gov. El-Rufai APC committee on top True Federalism
both reportyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy recommendaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryaryary
On di issue of separatist agitation, we suppose get modalities wey go dey for convening a referendum wey go dey out of di constitution.
E dey sure say plenti Naija pipo want make we live togeda, awa differences, no witstandin
To do dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Southern Governors donfirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Even say we get challenges like evri oda kontri, we need listen to awaselves, like US President Joe Biden dey tok am

E confirm say di main market for di product na for di eastern part of di kontri, like Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri
Hin admit say apart from di small customers wey dem get for Kano, dem rarely see dia tomato products for local market for some reason
Di first na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na of special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producing area
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey high dat wetin dem dey obtain for open market
So, essentially, pipo no actually look at us, dem no feel apprehensive of wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen u get product wey dey commonly available, pipo go surely go for di cheaper brand

Asked of di average lifespan of dia tomato products, hin tok say, if you give di tomato di tin wey e need, I mean nutritional supplement wey you feed am wit wen e dey grow, if you give am all those things, dis tomato fit last for three weeks post-harvest.
But even wit dat one, e go last for minimum of one week, no go dey for any place, but surely no go dey under any kain pressure and heat.
You fit keep am for table wia you get good ventilation
E fit last 10 days, but wit evritin wey dey need (all nutrients) e fit last one month.
Dis we don experiment, but den, una no get am as una dey always want am

Even di farmin method wey dem model afta di Turkish style of operation bikos we get Turkish partner wey dey help us maintain di standards, e tok, but e quickly add say di company dey conscious of di need make Nigerians run di technical aspect of its operations.
Reflecting on di effect of COVID-19 on di operations of di company, Mansur tok say Malam Alu, just like oda corporate entity for di kontri, don suffer from di devastating effect of di virus.
For Mansur, youths for Nigeria no get any excuse to dey unemployed wit di opportunity wey agriculture dey provide, e dey tok say those wey dey wan secure white-collar job make dem adjust to di reality and make dem go back to agriculture.
E believe say Nigeria don dey do wetin e suppose don do long time ago now, dey tok say if di kontri don take dis step, di current economic crisis no go apun again.
