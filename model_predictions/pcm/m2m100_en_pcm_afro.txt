Constitution review: Shariah dey southwest before Christianity MURIC
Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don tell di Pentectual Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) make dem mind im business and make dem stop dey oppose di Muslims right to dey operate Shariah.
Prof. Ishaq Akintola wey be MURIC Director tok am for one statement on Sunday
Dis follow one warning wey di PFN issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoing constitutional review wey di Senate dey do.
PFN and oda Christian groups dey fully aware say Shariah na for di South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842.
Dem practice Shariah for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, one Muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court dey operate till 1913 for Agbeni area of di town
Dem move am to Agbongbon area for 1914.
Dem apply for Shariah for Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey die for 1906.
Even di seventh Akirun of Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (deed 1912), institute Shariah for Ikirun for 1910.
Dis na just examples of di existence and spread of Shariah for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and dey impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.
E add say di PFN and oda Christians dey equally aware of di tide of Islamic awareness wey dey rise for di same South West and say dem dey only fear say di sleepin giant dey wake up to take back wetin belong to am
Hin tok say awa Christian neighbours know well say Shariah na di fundamental human right of Muslims wey Allah give
But dem dey determined to deprive us of am using unorthodox methods
Dem believe say dem dey war wit Muslims and to dem, evritin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and fake means to dia goal
We dey call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours.
Like all di aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last more dan a century, dem dey determined to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeat to dem
Dem dey determined to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drive dem
Di Constitution Review Panel tell Nigerians say make dem forward dia opinion about wetin dem want for di konstitution.
Evri group suppose submit hin needs
But instead of tell di panel wetin di Christians want, PFN don go ahead to say wetin dem no wan make Muslims ask for
Na attempt to beat Muslims for South West and e no go work
Hin tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery
Muslims for di region dey wake up and dey ask for freedom
We demand say dem stop di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law
We dey demand civil Shariah, no be criminal Shariah wey involve di cut of hand but civil Shariah to regulate Muslim marriage, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anythin to Christian
We go use evri peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to dis goal, e add

One commentator for di Facebook link of di tori wey Daily Trust publish, Ifeanyi Maduako, wen e describe Gulak death as distasteful, link di incident wit politics.
Dis kilin dey very distasteful to me
E dey political and pipo wey dey behind e suppose dey unraveled
Di kilin go expos those wey dey behind di current insecurity for Imo state
Who invite am and why kil one northerner for Imo state
I dey very afraid wetin fate dey wait innocent Imo State pipo for di coming days for di hand of northern kontroled security agencies, e write.
Anoda commentator for di thread, Oloruntobi Micheal Omo, tok say: Di police report don prove say dis kilin na politikal and e dey call for detail investigation.
Police I suppose get som question wey I go answer
For hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write, Di soul of awa innocent pipo dey more important pass dis scam wey dem call Nigeria unity
Dis illiteracy no go dey acceptable to us, e dey enough say we be peacemaker
But those dey push us to di wall say dis peaceemaking no fit sustain again.
I dey warn say awa retaliation go dey worst
Buhari una fail us woefully, I dey urge Imo police make dem face di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent Fulani herders & now dem turn to northern goment officials & prominent politicians
Di outlawed IPOB, for one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, faulted reports wey link am to di kilin of Gulak, noting say di kilin of politicians no be part of im agenda.
We, therefore, state witout equivocation say IPOB no sabi anythin about di kilin wey dem tok
For di first, wetin threat make di late Gulak constitute to awa cause to warrant say hin dey eliminate?
we no get anythin wey dey common wit am and we no fit kill am for any way
To dey point say dem dey accuse IPOB of dis barbaric act na only to divert attention away from di real masterminds.
Na di same way terrorists wey dey inside security uniform do different atrocities for South East and dey turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global reputation.
Dis na only smok screen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans.
Instead of di security agencies to properly investigate di incident and possible factors, dem switch to accuse IPOB of a crime wey we no know about.
IPOB get di routeary of di late Gulak to get waylaid am for airport?
Di group tok say security agencies suppose first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, and hin political opponent make dem establish dia possible involvement

Make I warn howeva say no one or group of pipo wey dey engage for dat kind act suppose dey expect say dem go free
We go deploy all di resources wey we get to ensure say dem bring such callous and criminal elements to justice.
Akeredolu wey dey unacceptable for Gulak kilin
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu describe di news of di kilin as very shocking and disturbing.
For one statement wey di governor personally sign, e tok say dis na one murder too many, e describe di action as senseless and wicked
Di pipo wey dey do dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri
Dis contrivance na to mislead, confuse and destroy
E dey carry di un mistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnist wey dey wan put di kontri on top di path of conflagration.
Dem no suppose allow dis criminals succeed
We wan use dis medium to express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma.
We admonish am and oda governors for di South-Eastern States make dem brace up, and face di current security challenge to put an end to di bloodbath for di land.
Di enemies of di pipo dey always use di weapon of fear to create disaffection for di polity
Dis cowardly act dey calculate to instigate Nigerians against each oda, especially Northerners, against di Igbo wey dey outside di South East.
We suppose face di enemies of di pipo wit a view to neutralise dem
Dis no be di time for politikal correctness
Dem no suppose allow banditry to subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all levels.
We dey call on all security agencies make dem join hand wit a view to unveil di criminals wey dey sponsor and dey do terrorist acts.
Dem suppose punish dem, seriously.

Di attention of di Office of di Vice President don draw to one website:

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom topic wey dey dominate for all news platforms for Nigeria
End Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigerias federal and state goment dey struggle to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan wey wan curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict
While di Plan don get di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenge
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about hin purpose, budgetary constraints wey di COVID-19 pandemic aggravate, lack of personnel wey get di expertise wey go carry am out and insecurity dey widespread, dey hinder progress
If di Plan fail as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management don do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Wey di National Economic Council approve for January 2019, di Plan represent di comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, reduce di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmers
Dem animate am wit di hope say ova 10 years, dem go persuade nomadic pastoralists to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breeding farms and oda mechanized livestock management practices na to boost di productivity of di sector.
By di end of 2028, authorities dey aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all participating states, wey dey create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processin and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buhari administration kom up wit di plan afta a wave of violence wey dey between herders and farmers, a rise of violence wey dey related affect rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don commit to fund 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participating states submit, don take preliminary steps toward putin di Plan into practice, plus provide technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like help wit field surveys and site maping.
Several states don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, office wey dem open and set up steering committees wey go manage di plan
Authorities don also hold workshops and dem do oda works to explain di benefits of livestock reform to a larger audience.
But two years inside di 10-year plan, dem neva build di first new ranch, and di obstacle dey plenti
Di opposition, partly among herders, mainly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plans benefit to pastoralists, dey hinder reform effort
distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land wey dey between herders and farmers, even as dem dey make peace and military effort wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget dey pinched, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri no get enough technical expertise to manage ranches and grazing reserves.
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey scare away potential investors
Unless dem solve, dis and oda problems fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, wey go make di kontri vulnerable to escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To dey tackle dis challenges require concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors.
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey dem go ask make dem change one nomadic lifestyle wey be century old, and wey legitimately doubt di Plans promise about di pasture wey dey available
But plenti farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Many for Middle Belt and Southern states dey deeply suspicious of di Plans long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privileges for herders, and more widely, di Fulani.
wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing
Federal and state goment suppose also up budgetary commitment, accelerate di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, work wit donors and investors as necessary.
To dey address rural insecurity, to dey prevent impunity and to dey rehabilitate communities wey previous violence affect dey important for participating states
plus, authorities go need consider climate change wey fit impact and make dem reach a decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross into Nigeria seasonally suppose or make dem no benefit from di Plan.
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plans proposers suppose focus on to deliver concrete, visible result on a relatively short-term basis.
less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to be able to produce clear proof of hin benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors are ineligible to compete, meaning say change dey sure.)
ideally, by di time wey campaign dey hot for end 2022, di Plans supporters suppose dey able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitment, and di first cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
No one of dis go dey easy, but di Plan dey worth di effort
As e no dey perfect, e dey offer important opportunity to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di needs of both herder and small-scale farmers
About 70 per cent of Nigeria's workforce dey earn income through agriculture
To dey modernise di livestock sector fit boost di prosperity of di kontri as e dey take a big step towards solving one of Nigeria's most dangerous conflict.
As di time don tick down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quick to make a visible mark, let di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity don lose.
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to speed im implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kind problem wey I get wit di king
una no agree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na small holders wey dey consume di majority of dia farm output and dem dey hold back from participating more actively for commercial oriented agriculture by different constraints.
No energy for anybodi wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own
Dis dey bring me to di conclusion say evribodi dey evil
Dem don characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey small, dem dey always hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey marginal or risk-prone environment
Di yield dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase di yield
we dey tok about life and prosperity to dis day
send your account number
Di emphasis now dey on top agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as enterprise
I know eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yield wey smallholder farmers dey get dey very profitable
una dey kom
Dis challenges wey dey apun lead plenti smallholder farmers to pursue livelihood strategy wey involve low-risk and low-yield agriculture activities
You be witch?
I dey on my way to sabote market to buy some food stuff
Make I call my papa
As di population of developing kontri dey grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go apun for quick change agri- food value chain
Wetin dey up, make I dey on my way?
Dis developments dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodology
di loan shark dey on hin neck
dis kind thing
I get mistake from my place of work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers plenti battle for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders wey dey di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst year for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers need contend wit
Di agriculture sector don face plenti challenge ranging from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time wey dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crops and wet season farmers dey about to start cultivation
Plenti farmers no fit access dia farm wen odas get labourers to harvest dia farm bikos mechanization na big challenge and harvest na manually, na di problem
Movement restriction wey dem introduce to prevent di spread of di coronavirus locked down market don disrupt di rural economy.
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so dem go fit buy seed and fertilizer, pay workers/tractor service
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer dey so high dat plenti smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go high as N13,000 for 50kg bag wey dey Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise to N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell to farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia r dey di price don rise to N7,000 and e dey high pass dis for some places
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activities no only deny dem access to dia farms but kom leave plenti pipo wey dem kil for dia farms.
Dem raze plenti farming community
Dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
Many pay plenti amount of moni or surrender plenti portion of dia harvest to di bandit
Plenti villages for dose states don dey desolate
Di agric sector also see one of di worst disasters wen flood out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize field wey dem estimate say na ova N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Plenti of di farmers wey dey affected neva get compensation as dem destroy dia livelihood
Di flood na di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreak havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal cities and areas wey flood-prone kil pipo and dem wash away farmlands.
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey face drought
For two months, farmers dey watch wit help as dia investment for crops don comot
Make u no disguise
Anoda subsector wey dey badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos price increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria to send save awa soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention.
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric tons of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers plus to give some of di big players license to import about 2022 metric tons of maize to increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean hit, wey make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go close down completely.
Di scarcity kos serious feed crisis for di industry as price don reach high record for hin history wey dey rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now
Di poultry industry don lose an estimated N7 million jobs wit figures wey dem project to reach 10 million by January 2021 while di loss for investments dey conservatively estimated at about N1.5 trillion.
As di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenge wey marry di subsector, di crop farmers despite di daunting challenge wey face di sector throughout di 2020 farmin year, don buyers kom right up to dia farms even before dem harvest to make bulk purchase arrangement.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, kos fear of looming hunger and di call for di border to be reopen, wey go allow influence of smuggled products through di porous border of di kontri.

How North-Central goment fit optimise open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy dey trend for public domain, as Southern governors dey slam a ban on am durin dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN), and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, dey examin how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di governors of di Southern state meet for Asaba, Delta State, and ban open grazing to stem farmers-herder crisis and oda form of criminality.
Wetin dey una take for di hot controversy wey dis decision generate?
Evri human beings get right to actions and opinions.
But di thing wey dey important be say once you take your action, you suppose dey aware of di consequences.
You suppose dey able to consider di advantages and disadvantages
I no be one of dose wey tok say e dey good or bad
As Nigerian, una get di right and freedom to live anywia for di kontri wit good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
On top dis basis, I no go tok say e be good thin
But as a leader for di North Central, I go tok say e be good thin, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefits for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap inside am and see how we fit make am real business and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herder dem, no matter di number wey fit troop from di South to di North Central
Wetin be una position for open grazing?
I no be one of di propagator of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as pesin
I believe say if we take ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme on top ranching.
dat kind move fit make di North Central cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products
and den e bikom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herder dem and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey Fulani herders dey pose no be say dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on top hin advantages
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem suppose educate dem well to embrace ranching
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia all di family get ranches and una no see open grazing despite di large number of cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey do case for?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no dey call for ranching and make di federal goment kom in
Wetin dem dey tok be say di herder don bikom problem to us and make dem comot
Dem tok say di herder dem suppose apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don tell dia indigenes make dem apply for land like herder dem?
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programme, especially for di agriculture sector and im value chains, why some goment policies dey fail to realize dia objectives and wetin dey di way out?
First, no administation wey fit touch di lives of pipo like President Muhammadu Buhari administration wia you fit conveniently sit inside your house and apply for facilities and you get dem.
Dem also get di target credit facility wey dem also know as COVID-19 loan
Many Nigerians don conveniently get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia homes witout even go office
Also, wit SMEs dem dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two side of those wey go believe in you and those wey go criticize you
For dose wey no believe for Buhari administration, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we dey thank God for am

And dis sef testify to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great joy and a deep sense of gratitude say I write dis one, wey don put togeda as platform for us to allow Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on board in order to complement national effort in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and cyber-crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di Senate don pass dis Bill, and bikos of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di House of Representatives wey dey ready and resilient, under di leadership of hin Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di Hon.
Speaker, follow di suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday, 19 May, 2021.
As u fit know am well, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di bill wey dem viciously attack and against for di National Assembly for recent time.
Sadly di attack kom from those wey suppose dey partner for progress in di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don designate demsef as enemies of di general good.
Good na good e no get replacement so e dey bad
no matter how long e take, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light ova darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e apun for di National Assembly
Di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional of Nigeria ( Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate pass am first for law on di 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dem undergo di rigour of legislative process of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and finally for its 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 di bill pass am unanimously by di Nigerian Senate afta dem consider di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no dey without series of thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop for any length to see say any legislation wey go help di Buhari-led administration fight corruption no see di light of di day but di senate stand and see am through.
E dey very important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but novel for Nigeria wey dem dey aim at bridging di gap wey don long dey for di forensics space.
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey top and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-government bodi wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national effort wey dey aimed at di fight against corruption, wey don hinder development for evri aspect of awa national life.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chamber of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, kom for time wey Nigeria dey seriously need legislation
Wetin go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di increase spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di world
As we all know, crime generally, don take new dimension, bikos of advance for science and technology for di 21st century
So, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging global reality and e dey ready to enact legislation wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey appose tok say di journey, wey culminate for di passage of dis Bill, start for di 8th National Assembly wia awa Bill dey sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen e be Senate Leader, bikos of hin strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chamber durin di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings dey conduct by di relevant committees of di respective Chamber
Afta and even wit di opposition from stakeholders wey dey di minority, wey di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead, di National Assembly pass di Bill, bikos of di significance and di part wey e go play for di fight against corruption.
Afta, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
E dey on top di strength of dis, say dem reintroduc di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, dem sponsor am by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current leader of di Senate, bikos of di importance wey dey attached to am.
We dey constrained to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on top di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propel say awa Bill was rejected by di 8th National Assembly.
Also worthy to mention na di fact say awa Bill don dey mistake for similar Bills, wey dem introduce recently for both di Senate and di House of Representatives Chamber
As we look at dis Bill, we discover say e be merely duplication of di purpose and purport of awa Bill.
We suppose stress am say dem no introduce any of dis Bill for di 8th National Assembly, unto awa Bill.
So, we be di first to kom up wit a Bill of dis magnitude(Forensic)
don see di urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
Di decision to establish di institute na afta dem do bad study of how di institute dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how dem don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution
E dey instructive to note say awa institute don dey since 2009.
And ova di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey go aim at inculcatin di skills and acumen wey dey required for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, whether na mistake or fraud kos; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cyber security; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacity, preparation of forensic report, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
You go agree wit me say for today world, di conventional ways to dey investigate crime, wit a view to fight e don apsolete
For us as a nation to do somethin wey dey meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and innovations wey dey emerge, wey dey target to fight corruption
E dey in line wit dis reason say dem conceive di idea of establishing dis Institute wit a well-structure laudable objective wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
Time no go allow me highlight all di objectives of di Bill here
Howeva, I wan crave una indulgence to highlight some of di objectives of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional for Nigeria in order to develop and train professionals for dis special field, through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di skills wey dey required for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals for di use of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques for di investigation of fraud for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standard, ethics and etiquette among practitioners for di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and also develop mechanism for fraud prevention, as proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di kontri make e no spend its scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigation for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programme wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, wey involve professionals like Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposal of cases in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms,through di provision of a legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey important to reiterate say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di access and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standard.
Di wide spectrum of di scope and focus point of di institute, include but no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
According to wetin dem tok, una go agree wit me say awa institute dey bring on board, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation in accordance wit international best practices
Dis concept dey far beyond di reasoning of dose wey dia myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don turn dia sense of reasoning, bikos of small minds and inordinate desire to monopolise system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On top light note, I wan draw di attention of evribodi to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out strongly to oppose hin passage bikos according to dem, e be unnecessary duplication of functions wey dia Institute don already do.
Howeva, upon di reintroduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and afta we see di overwhelming and accelerated legislative support, awa Bill don receive from di two Chamber, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce one similar Bill wey dey present now before di House of Representatives, as dem fail woefully in dia attempt to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN hold di view say no institute wey oda pass dia to regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as mine
I wan inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), no dey comot for dis funny theatrical episode.
Just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don introduce a Bill for di House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey ANAN initiate and dey promote.
I decide to bring all dis facts out so dat Nigerians and even di international community go understand di extent wey some pipo fit go to dia goals.
Howeva, we no dey perturbed by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin dey right and make dem no allow demsef manipulate for any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so we no go make di whole thing mockery.
Di known practical and opposition of dis Bill don remain ICAN bikos say e don dey obvious now.
Dem engage several bystanders to write voluntolous petition some even targeted for di leadership of di Senate wit a tone of blackmail.
Afta dem fail woefully for di senate, di opponent shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all form of publication.
again, dem fail
ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill wey di Senate don pass go only require competency by di House safe for wia observation dey
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di opponent fight di passage of di bill until di truth prevail and for di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professional of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to be achieved by persons wey dey seek to be Registered Members and Qualify to practice as Forensic and Investigative Professional; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) dem pass to law by di House of Representative.
ICAN don register im Bill for di House of Representatives wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Dis ICAN new Bill get full provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish one Forensic University for Nigeria and without which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead dat kind person to some years in prison.
Dis dey strange for kontri wey dey full of enlightened pipo
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no matter di level of corruption wey dey der
We dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives
We suppose note say, awa challenge di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to stop presidential assent under di guise of di existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians to dey deceive by dia antics.
You go remember how ICAN strongly oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of di publication wey di Association of Professional bodies of Nigeria dey sponsor wit Engr(Chief)

Dem carry placards wit different inscriptions like We Say No To Money Bags
For Abeokuta South and
Make Party Members pick who dem want, kom tok say dia preferred aspirant na Farouk Akintunde.

Between DSS and regional separatist
Di warning wey di DSS don repeat to pipo and groups whose utterances and activities dey always constitute provocative disruption of di ethno-religious environment and threaten di harmful coexistence of di majority common pipo of dis kontri, dey start to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
As dem dey ask questions about who or which persins and groups di security agency dey refer to na dem vapourise soon for di heated rhetorical outburst of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Ghana Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E kom wake on all say indeed dis na di persons and groups wey don continue to dey use inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against each oda so dem go clearly inflam di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS charge for one of im warnings.
Interestingly, no one of dis prime suspect for di exploitation of some fault lines to kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distancesef from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency detect
Dem choro common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, wey dey different only for di respective directive of dia accusation finger
As Afenifere dey retort dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV rehash im grouse about plenti pipo wey dem feel alienated and ACF finish ignorance, dey ask who be di pipo?
Since di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive in dealing wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crisis and dem dey know dem; dem suppose treat dem according to di law.
You no suppose be a spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say di DSS know dem yet dem insist on top pass di buck outside dia cliques.
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics know say no beta solution to Nigeria's myriad problem pass for dia sectional enclave and chiefs to Lord am ova di rest of di kontri as rulers, no be leaders!
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous so dem dey pursue dia inordinate ambition wey dem dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce evritin wey e take to excisin di territorial contours of dia enclave wit di frenzied ease to cut dia part of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to inordinate ambitions of persin or group wey dey restlessly underminin the aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, e dey easier say dan do.
Dis regional groups constitute major hindrance to di steady attainin of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey work for since flag independence.
As long as dem continue to parade di political ground as ethnic champions, for so long dem go consider Nigeria as a right for dia ethnic stake for di population, make dem claim am or seize am and, if all oda fail, make dem deconstruct am and make dem disown am as a failed state.
whenever dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless im leadership dey firmly for dia grasp, otherwise e dey about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down Syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Weda na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda indeniable indication of dis regional separatist na say dem be all self-styled political pressure groups wey dey masquerade as representatives of different ethnic groups.
from dia membership, e dey clear to see say dem consists of former-this
ironically, dis political lack give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to remain relevant in a democratic system wey representatives dey run entirely through political parties wey dem register wit legislative and executive institutions wey dem constitution establish to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey often threaten and try, so, perchance, dem fit regain political relevance if dem no get kontrol.
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetin trigger security alerts
wit dat kind predator-politicians wey dey run around di perimeters of power wit dubious intention of undermining a goment wey dem elect just bikos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say there must be a convergence of interest wey dey link dia overt activities and di covert crime of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combined to make Nigeria ungovernable
double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of Buhari administration say make dem contend wit dat kind array of formidable foes wey dey unleash incessant attack on national security in a time of unprecedented economic adversity.
To dat extent, only two group of politicians fit dey: dose wey dey participate positively for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward against all odds and dose wey dey negatively engaged in planting seed of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
By dia utterances and activities, we know dem all
At di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians na ordinary citizen wey dia condition of survival no dey determined by and no dey depend on top di geography of dia origin.
dia daily struggle to eke life dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of di difference of faith
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland wey dem dey loyal to, dem dey follow law and dem dey pray, knowing say dem no get any oda kontri wey dem go call dia own, collectively showing how citizenship dey spread true patriotism.
Dem also know say Afenifere, Quran Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey use inciting, hallarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against each oda in order to inflam di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambitions of dia leaders.
Na why di poor man's prayer remain:
God Dey,
NIGERIA Go BETER!
Manzo Reuben na youth leader for Lokoja
Dem kill 10 as terrorists dey try attack army formation

Wetin we no go wear for public: negating di multiculturalism of Nigeria
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Na pure coincidence say, as problem dey break for Kwara State recently, solution to hin kind na hin dem dey consider for di lower House of di National Assembly wey dey di capital territory Abuja
Di problem wey dey Ilorin na ova di refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow dia Muslim students wear hijab go school
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on top di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, dey derisively tag hijab Bill by part of di Nigerian media
Both events spark hot and often emotional debate wey, at the bottom of all, threaten to deny Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.
Di idea wey dey Kwara of di school owners wey dey ban Muslim students wey dey follow hijab and dia sympathis dem fit reduce to wetin dem no go wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunity
female Nigerians dey face am bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former clearly dey breach di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence for taking dat kind position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians wherever or wenver dem dey threatened wit discrimination based on dia professed faith.
As dem dey run through di argument of di owners of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, one fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children suppose go oda schools for anoda place if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument dey plenti
First, to tok say Muslim student suppose go oda place unless dem comply wit di school rule on uniform dey very little to promote inclusion, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Second, di position dey ask di moral question: make e justify to base school rule bikos of di Christian majority nature of di school?
Den, for third, di argument wey dey go elsewia don seem to ignore di difficulty wey dem dey use change school for pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of changing school for a pikin, educational psychologists go tell you, dey interfer negatively wit e no be only emotional but academic development too.
Finally, di Christian faith schools by demsef risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate students wey get di same religious beliefs especially schools.
Di social cost wey dis exacts dey on top di society dey huge
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, tok, wen hin dey tok to di press, say di goment dey convinced say hin policy to allow willing Muslim school girls wey dey wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey dey anchored on top mutual respect and understanding
For one kontri wey dey guarantee freedom of religion, dem sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question wey dem go ask na: how justifiable e be to deny Nigerian pikin access to school wey e choose on top di manifestation of hin religion?
E dey great concern bikos Nigeria na signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion
E contain 30 articles on top rights and freedoms wey include, among odas, civil and political rights, like di right to life, free speech and privacy.
E also include economic, social and cultural right, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to di issue under consideration and quote dem in full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get di freedom to think or believe wetin dem want, including di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to practice awa religion wey we choose publicly or privately, alone or wit odas
evribodi get di right to education
Primary school suppose dey free
We suppose continue awa studies as we wish
For school dem suppose help us develop awa talents, and dem suppose teach us understanding and respect for evribodi human right
Dem suppose teach us to dey follow odas weda dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri dem kom from.
awa parents get di right to choose di type of school wey we go go
Dis type of law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for House of Representatives for di US wey dey wear her hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019.
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance sponsor and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi.
Di bill dey seek to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination wey dey concerning hirein or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment
E go ban qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors make dem no discriminate against persin, student or personnel based on dia religious belief or dia manifestation.
Wen dem pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employer, or dose executive wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am becloud dia sense of judgment.
Di law suppose be welcome development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document as dem explain am above.
E dey in line wit similar laws wey dem pass recently for di kontri wey dey seek to tackle social threats and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability wan eliminate all forms of discrimination based on persin disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One at a time, awa representative for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social threat wey dey bedeviling awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no be say dem no get any generic law wey dey cover dem before but bikos dem need address dem more comprehensively so dem no fit leave room for opacity.
While UDHR fit look like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like am dey provide to allocate punishment for offender
contrary to di view of di critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing wey go show attempts to seek di enthronement of state religion on any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di goment of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State Religion.
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear hijab for public spaces wey just dey smoke of Islamophobia
For di final analysis, to deny Nigerian man or woman hin religious freedom don deny awa multicultural pretension
E dey deny di concept of equality, and basic human right as e dey guarantee for Nigeria's constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
Bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimation based on religious grounds, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development

Police go follow newspapers ova report on IPOB
Police don dey harass newspapers and readers for Aba, wey be di commercial hub for Abia state.
Daily Trust don gather since di weekend, policemen from di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspapers and readers ova report on di Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents tok say tension dey for Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raze di place on Sunday.
One eyewitness tok say residents scamp for safety, as police officers shoot sporadically, as dem dey try arrest one newspaper seller and readers.
Dem accuse di sellers say dem dey distribute newspapers wey get stories on top di sit-at-home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, beg di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so e no fit create crisis for di city.
Di kind pipo wey we put inside police dis days make me wonder if we really wan anything good out of dis kontri wey dem call Nigeria.
How pesin fit dey chase newspapers around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo make dem no read hard copy of newspaper, you go also stop dem make dem no read di same story on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, among odas?
How primitive policein be dis?
Dem kos panic for Sunday bikos of dia shooting and noisein
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey chase kidnappers
Na later we discover say police kom arrest one seller and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspapers dem?
Di type of problem wey paper fit kos wey social media no fit kos 20 times pass
E tok say dis pipo no dey normal
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident, tok say almost all di seller stands wey hin visit for Aba
for Tuesday dey empty
Hin tok say, we learn say dem dey tok for Saturday and Sunday say di newspapers get stories on top di sit-at-home order in honour of Biafra heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit am
Di early political leaders for South East, dey remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra big pass IPOB di beta for dem
So proscribing IPOB mean say Biafra don proscribe too?
We be Biafrans all
For di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold zoom conversation, wey dey tok about Biafra fallen heroes.
Why police no fit go YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey release am
All wey dem do na to kom to street and start to dey find trouble wey no dey necessary
I wish di leaders for Igboland go warn di police officers wey no dey reckless make dem no allow wetin dey apun for Imo state enter Aba, bikos e go dey worst for evribodi
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), don deny say di police arrest newspapers and readers for Aba.
NAMA don kil as air traffic controlers dey lament poor tool
Air Traffic Controlers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don cried out ova dilapidated navigational equipment for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controlers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation dey threat to air safety.
Dem also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go help safe aircraft navigation
Di president of NatCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda airline personnel dey use and e no be kontrol tower wey dey exclusive for air traffic controlers.
E tok say oda airports for di kontri no get di necessary equipment for seamless navigation
Hin explain say some airports no even get equipment wey dey work
Even Kaduna no get control tower
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we don dey call on di goverment make dem do somethin
We go Sokoto, once e dey rain today, kontrolers go go find umbrella wey go sit for di kontrol tower, and wetin be dat, some of di kontrol tower wey dey attached to di terminal buildings dem ceded to FAAN, while those wey dey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey fight land radio frequency, communication here and der
Calabar dey there; u no get airport wey you go go to today say u go tok say things dey work for 80 percent
NAMA don recently employ and train 40 new controlers, but NatCA tok say di number dey too low to meet di shortfall.
Howeva, di Managing Director of di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true.
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest plenti for improving navigational aid and to dey help safe flight operations
E tok say na mer politics
Di goment don spend plenti for recent past to dey improve Aviation infrastructure
I dey tok am no be say I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always dey, ask di pipo wey dey di street, ask di pipo wey dey NAMA, dem go tell you say dem neva get dat good under dis administration
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two in place, two odas dey kom
goment don just spend N1.7bn on top one mobile control tower
Also, e dey continue to dey revitalize di safe tower
We dey revamp di TRACON (T Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
oda sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenge and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communication technology di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by di national difference for goment regulations.
E-commerce sef dey promote direct access to distant market and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and dey blur many of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e no dey possible to determine di origin of di products.
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communication platforms, all information or service wey company fit offer to customer ova di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support
Di major significance of e-commerce na for di fact say e dey encourage one single world trading system, wey dem dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services wey kom from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey back towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole.
Dem don do plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system dey behind ICT-based legislation and say di statutory law wey dey exist dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrime, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenti more.
There dey, therefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime.
Dem don tok am seriously say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of Draft Bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say, even wia dem pass dis bills into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Sake of di speed wey di internet dey permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sector of di economy, di best wey dem fit suggest be say di legal issues and problems wey dey present face e-commerce for di kontri suppose dey address directly and speedyly, for di interest of di population of Nigerian consumers.
To dis one, make dem pressure di National Assembly make dem pass bills wey dey relate to electronic commerce, one priority make dem fit enact dem into law as soon as possible.
For di time, awa court suppose take big strike as dem dey interpret di traditional laws wey dey exist freely so dem go fit bridge di gap wey dey there so dem go fit make dat kind laws available for electronic transactions, especially for di trend wey dey emerge for di present-day information age.
Indeed, dem argue say legislation no be di only means wey e fit facilitate electronic transactions and documentation wey dey attend legally.
Di courts fit adapt to recognise electronic transactions in the absence of legislation or private contract.
As di Justice Bingham don put am one time: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility wey dem go fit adapt to di changing needs of di general public; principles no dey change, but old rules wey go dey apply di change, and new rules don spring into existence.
Dem dey hope say oda Nigerian judges go adopt dis judiciary activism, including Supreme Court justices, especially for areas wey awa current legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advances.
Dis go set a good precedent to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di German issue wey relate to contract for e-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contact) Law and awa various statutes on top real property and landed instrument, wey all require som contract make dem write and make dem do am well
di question be say electronic mark or sign go constitute valid sign-off of contract by email and e go dey binding
Many of dis issues still no dey solve well even for UK although some decision dey favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
so e mark for email as satisfying di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transactions na paperless transactions wey dem do through magnetic materials like tapes or disks
Dis dey contrary to di paper-based transactions wey dey embodied in permanent form and dey typically expressed in words and figures wey dey usually authenticated by signatures
Dem no fit change dat kind transactions witout make dem change di face of di document.
Regarding di signature, by di provision of Section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, an electronic signature wey dey related to data message conveniently meet any requirement for handwritten signature so tey e dey sufficiently identify an electronic record to di individual.
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on top dis issue
So, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signature
Di use of password, identify, user name etc fit dey enough
Dem fit assure pesin say electronic signature for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence if dem certificate am and dey incorporate am for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction
Also, oda legal challenges wey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element wey dey for valid forming of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter legal relationship
Di question na for wetin point dem fit make offer concerning an electronic business transaction or how dem fit differentiate between invitation to treat and offer an electronic transaction, for wetin point dem fit tok say dem get intention to enter legal relationship?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction wey dem send order or invoices neva change and emanate from evribodi wey dem appear to be from
need dey for a guaranteed level of privacy/confidentiality regarding information
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrime for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce no dey doubt say one aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom stay for dis time
Di goment suppose go beyond creating laws, to activate use of di electronic delivery platforms for hin commercial interaction and for delivery of goment services

Chad don pass new charter wey dem name Deby son president
Chad don pass charter wey dey declare Mahamat Idriss Deby president, even as rumors say hin death dey trend on social media
Mahamat take over for hin father, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey for Tuesday quick name transitional leader as head of military council afta hin father death, go occupy di functions of di president of di republic and e go also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter dey repeat di constitution wey dey before and dem go implement am as di basic law of di republic, according to e terms.
E tok say dem don name di younger Deby as di supreme head of di armed forces.
Deby's son don oversee hin father's security as heads of di elite presidential guard and e dey always appear beside am
Mahamat Deby dey well known as a top commander of di Chadian forces wey dey assist a United Nations peacekeeping mission for di restive north of neighbouring Mali.
Hin sign a decree on Tuesday wey dey set up a military council wey get 15 generals, including hinsef and 14 odas wey dem know say dey part of di late president's circle of loyalists
Di council dey responsible for 18-month transition to free and democratic election
According to di charter, Mahamat Idriss Deby sef dey chair di military transition council, di council of ministers, di council and superior committees of national defence.
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey Mahamat dey name am directly
Di Transition Charter, wey conta 95 articles, dey also guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
Dem don establish transition goment, wey di new president name hin members
Di charter tok say dem discharge di members of di army wey dem call to di transition goment from all military duties.
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey dey rule wit iron fist for almost 30 years, suffer wound wey hin suffer durin a visit to di battlefield for di kontri north wia Chadian soldier dey fight against a rebel group, di military announce on Tuesday
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders, as dem dey suspend di konstitution and dem dey dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army appointment of President Idriss Dby son to take over afta hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose take power afta Deby die and no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say if di president no dey, or if e die, den di speaker of di parliament take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so a transition dey put in place until election dey hold, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am earlier on Tuesday.
But di military announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and say dem don dissolve di konstitution too, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di konstitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea face possible deduction afta brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by hin FA for di team failure to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, dem don find di team pants down for seven hot-tempered rows wit di opponent
Di recent brawl durin a clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter Chelsea had wit Premier League teams.
Last week match wey dey between Chelsea and Leicester na hin dey marry by skirmishes wey dey between di players of di two teams
As dem dey quote similar offenses for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea.
Dem don accuse Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff afta Ricardo Pereira challenge for Ben Chilwell
For 2016, dem also charge Chelsea for indiscipline say dem suppose warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part in a mass bust-up durin a match against Tottenham.
If affected, di point deduction go significantly affect dia season as dey go final campaign for top four spot
US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and ova here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion wey plenti British pipo kom get of di thousands of American GIs wey dey several military base for Britain durin di Second World War
Di gom-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and feminin American soldier dey frequently kom into pub brawls and dangerous knife fight wey create a feeling of disappearance for di yanks among di locals
And dis don be di pattern of behavior among American soldier evriwia for di hundreds of American military base overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for Philippines.
Na why dem dey torture me, like plenti Nigerians, say for one virtual meeting last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari dem report say dem don ask am say di United States dey consider to relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey currently based for di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
Dem suppose say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken's Nigerian opposition number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go send di details later to di president
Yes, America na superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and dem suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances
understandably, Nigeria don face internal insecurity issue wey seem to defy di best effort of goment and di nation's security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnappin for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all di kontri and di target killing of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians togeda wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity wey dey destroy di kontri now.
But even for dat one, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigeria soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria no dey justified.
Africom na one of di nine of dat kind command by di American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational mode, dis command, especially those wey dey outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues wey dey dia area of coverage.
Dem only do am wen dat kind issue directly affect America interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no get mandate to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies
If Africom dey set up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island of im own restricting access to Nigerians of all categories and to establish jurisdiction inside di Territorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off borders to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
As e dey always apun for American military base outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di case of Africom, part of hin original concept na to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement effort for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa sterling record of peace keeping around di world
Di precursor of Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria's strategic interests for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di California attorney wey dey face door, Warren Christopher, make plenti secret and open visit to a number of African kontri to sell di idea.
But bikos Nigeria na di target, e pointedly leave am out from hin routeary
Senegal, wey no dey far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, go be di coordinating base of di ACRI and although dem tok am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, hin secret protocols dey un mistakably military and strategically targeted for Nigeria
bikos of unisguised hostility to di idea wey kom from France, wey dey averse to see di Americans dey try butt into area wey e consider hin exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di ACRI concept
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di American congress midwifed for secret session, di Americans consider and realize di need to set up African command to add to di oda command wey already dey place wey dey cover di various continents of di world.
So based on recommendations of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom na di Bush Junior administration set up wit a wider mandate no be only to contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on di growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey Florida, na to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey Stuttgart, Germany, na to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), wey also dey Florida, na to Latin America and di Caribbean.
French military presence don already surround Nigeria for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans also get drone base for Niger
To add Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.
Make we remember say awa strategic interests and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent to letin in di wolf into di chicken cooper.
Nothing dey for di insecurity wahala wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed forces no fit cope wit.
Dis na afta all di military force wey finally secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-trained and organised army of insurgents for dat kontri from a long logistical supply line of thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but a few of di plenti gallant Nigerian soldier wey distinguish demsef for dat operation.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, as dem fall from di high standard wey dem know, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internally.
But inside and essence, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capacity to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di help and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dem dey so willing
But even as awa circumstances dey arm-twisted to host di Africom in view of im precedent and im implication to awa strategic interest, on awa soil.
Even as di challenge dey, Plateau go target 7m metric tons of Irish potato
Plateau State na Nigeria number one grower of Irish potato wit di tuber wey dem dey produce for nine of di 17 local goment area wey dey di state
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative peg Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri wit kontri like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and odas wey dey receive plenti supply of potato from Nigeria.
Di large potato production wey kom from Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, wey be one of di leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth largest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say dams and road networks dey inadequate, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to pose a major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export.
oda challenges wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial lets as well as poor seedlings
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 poorest states for Nigeria wey get ova 70% poverty rate.
Di state, howeva, get comparative advantage to boost economic activities by improving di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain.
Thomas Muopshin wey be di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project tok say although di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment areas of Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di potato hub of di state.
Dem dey produce more potatoes pass any LGA for di kontri
Muopshin, however, tok say adaptability research show say di eight LGA wey remain for di state dey equally viable to produce potato; e dey make all of Plateau's 17 LGA potential to produce di tuber, especially durin di dry season.
Di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state, however, tok say unless dem address challenges wey dey affect di value chain squarely, increase production and export for potato go continue to elude di nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for interview wit Daily Trust, tok say small dams wey dey inadequate, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor roads and high cost of farm inputs, dey continue to affect potato outputs.
Hin tok say di cost of mechanised farmin wey fit increase productivity fast don dey expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers wey no fit afford mechanization
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water durin di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield
bikos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dey find borehole place to farm make dem fit access irrigation water for dia farms.
Martha kom explain say di high cost of fertiliser dey prevent plenti farmers from improving quantity and quality of yield, e kom add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output
Di cost dey also prevent plenti of us from expanding di business
To get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes

Di statement read say FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid FC wan express dia absolute rejection of di insisting coercion say UEFA don dey maintain towards three of di most relevant institutions for di history of football.
Dis alarming attitude constitute a flagrant breach of di decision of di court of justice, wey don already make a clear statement warning UEFA make dem no take any action wey fit penalise di founding clubs of di Super League as di legal proceedings dey on.
So, di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and e be direct attack against di rule of law wey we, di citizen of di European Union, don build democratically, as we dey constitute lack of respect to di authority of di court of justice demsef

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem know as hushpuppi na hin dem arrest for June 2020 for Dubai for alleged money laundering from business email compromise fraud and oda scam wey target firms and one English premier league club
E make a total sum of $435 million afta e defraud 1,926,400 victims.
Afta one year, Abidemi Rufai (wey dem also know as Sandy Tangâ), Senior Special Assistant for Special duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun dem arrest by di Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for John F Kennedy Airport, New York bikos of criminal complaint wey dem defraud Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di moni wey dem stole na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State designed for pipo wey fit suffer job loss as a result of di COVID-19 pandemic
Di fraud incident apun durin di lockdown and di investigation bureau start track di alleged fraudster wey go don be for Nigeria's Federal House of Representative to make laws if e no lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Di fraud na as dem steal di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem dey file false claim to di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem stole, dem create separate e-mail account so dem fit associate di claim wit different pipo and e fit escape automatic fraud detection system
Afta, dem pay more dan $288,000 for hin American bank account between March and August 2020.
cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisation and kontri dem
Nigeria don lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrime evri year
By di end of 2021, di world go don lose a total of $6 trillion
To date, ova 40 Nigerians don dey or dem dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai alleged unemployment benefits fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Dis na fraudulent scam wey dey leverage on top di loopholes wey di COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisation
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia fraud along di intervention from goment and private sector and scam plenti and some of dis schemes still exist till today.
Domino Pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promote sales fraud among odas
While pipo dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some young pipo dey do am for inside Nigeria.
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey arrest dem, trial dem and convict dem regularly.
understanding di culture wey dey sustain cyber-crime fit help serious goment in fighting di crime
Di family na di microcosm of di larger society
Na di place wey dem suppose nurture normal human befor di society
Apart from di fact say plenti Nigerian family dey di dungeon of poverty and e no fit take care of dia pikin, some of dis pikin don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegitimate
challenge dey wit ethical behaviour trainin for plenti house as parents dey arrest wit dia pikin wey dey involve for cybercrime
For oda place, mothers of yahoo boys dey form association to celebrate dia sons success and justify dia criminal behavior
For di religious environment, pastors, alfa and traditionalists wey dey deprived create house and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teachin don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Video wey dey viral dey wia some boys dey show say dem dey spray moni while those wey appear to be shepherds for one white garment church don report di moment wen di captive members of di church, wey dem lead by dia female youth wing record di scene wey dey shameful.
A pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don dey 21 years old
Unfortunately, dem grow up to appreciate lying as a way of life from di mouth of politicians (and in many cases from house) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and dem no fulfill or jettison di campaign promise.
Lyingsef na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Dem dey socialise youths evri day to corruption and fraud by those wey dey hold public office
Dem see how dia system dey provide soft landing for fraudulent persin ( public or private).
Dem dey ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don dey fully investigate and discharged wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty
Di majority of di case don end wit off-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case don end as family affair.
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyle dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how one time poor political aspirants turn into millionaries within months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institutions don bikom moni and dey carry for awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary education institutions, wit few exceptions, award undeserving honours for exchange for moni
All those wey mismanage moni dey provide wit soft landing
Added to dis list of cultures wey dey nurture cybercrime na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrime by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cybercrimeality as work and game wey evribodi dey involved in and no be crime.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, dem go make laws against di crime wey dem dey involve
Di process to dey give party nomination to di highest bidders by party leaders suppose dey review if we suppose stop to dey import tokunbo products wey dey problem inside awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen moni dey dangerous for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for di character wey dey doubt to cover up dia tracks and awa society dey worse out through dia actions
Greed dey also nurture cyber-criminality
FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem claim to dis defendant dey affect all taxpayers
As we dey move forward, we no fit live for sin and dey expect grace to abound
Nigeria must sanitise im anti-corruption system and replace accountability policy wey dey track life wit material accumulation
We must give di youth hope for Nigeria by creating employment opportunity, reduce poverty and review reward system
Di EFCC need invest for technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures
Di commission need conclude investigation befor dem arrest suspects as di FBI do befor dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless di culture wey dey sustain cybercrime for Nigeria dey tackle through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester.

How e feel to give birth durin di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red lines change my life
I dey pregnant and dey hapi
E be amazing start to new year
Na di year wey dey remarkable pass for my life
All of a sudden, evritin change
Dem born my daughter Roshomon Tara for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she now dey nine months old
Na di reason why I bikom mother for di middle of global crisis
Na no be only her wey dem born, but na new me, mother of Tara, wey spend all di pregnancy for lockdown for house and give birth for emergency condition inside di emergency
Tara don see di world wit masks and isolation
her grandmothers also dey afraid to hold am or kom closer to am witout wey dem dey wear mask
If di pandemic no dey, my journey to motherhood go dey completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey very special as my daughter don dey before me, she dey smile and dey star on me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
Di only thing wey no change, meanwhile, na di pandemic
I dey pregnant 16 weeks wen di pandemic hit, and di planet go lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my Hormonal and physical change
Di 22 weeks no less dan war
My husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concerts for dat time
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2020.
So, we dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and we dey spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalists association kom forward to help for di time
I dey afraid of evritin
Most of di time, e dey like death
she dey knock for di door
I dey adapt to one new online life wia we click and get awa thins home-delivered
I suppose wait for one week make dem deliver groceries dis way
I even dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me husband go outside kom buy food for storage
So, I dey chop less
Besides, I no fit go for my Antenatal check-ups wey I plan
And I no dey sure if my pikin dey grow healthy or all development dey apun timely
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring am go different world pass ever
Tele-medication don help me pass some hard time for di last trimister
I forget my ginecologist face
I no fit remember how she look witout di PPE
I need information about risk, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help
plenti information dey float around
Inside dis lack of information, mother wey I get experience, my mother, and mother-in-law fit only help me as dem dey support me and no meet me in person wen I dey pregnant
Traditionally, mothers wey get experience and mostly women wey dey old for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get plenti panic attack bikos of lack of information and understanding
So, I dey back for di experience of new mothers wey give birth for dis time
I find social media as a lifeline
I read plenti exciting experience on social media wen I follow a group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lacting mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic
Di various media group wey dey dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lacting mothers by sharing dia experience and information durin di lockdown

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make some far-reaching resolutions on top di state of di nation, wey dey now popularly refer to as di Asaba Declaration.
Di meetin wey kom on top di heels of worsening insecurity for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoist and di unending threat of murderous herdsmen generate attention nationwide
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meetin and di unanimity wey di 17 governors show show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for inside di context of true federalism and di ban of open grazing form di core of di declaration.
Di major highlight include di clamour for state police, devolution of power, review of revenue formula for favour of federating units and di need for national dialogue to discuss di national question.
While di foot- dragging of di governors on top financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and dey contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamor to, di bulk of dia resolutions na cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on True Federalism make far-reaching recommendations.
One go expect di leading lights of APC to take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempt to play to di gallery and for some quarters, subsequent censure of di governors.
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of power, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federating units among odas
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
Sake of di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose serious challenges, dis two sectors suppose receive di maximum attention, togeda
Even as Nigeria dey rank as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make enough effort to translate dat to improve standard of living for di majority of awa citizens.
awa annual budget wey dey about $35 billion, for instance, dey grossly inadequate to meet di needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wey get about 58 million pipo get National budget wey get almost $75bn for 2019 wit im Social Protection Programmes wey reach 17 million of im population
Di effort of Buhari administration, though new and commendable, still represent a drop in ocean and no dey adequate to make di required impact.
Na wia devolution of power and resource kontrol kom in
solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey dey stay one day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercial viable natural resources wey dem fit exploit to create wealth and generate di foreign exchange wey dem need for di kontri
Di present system wey states kom cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey bread indolence, dey run contrary to di principle of true federalism.
As di El-Rufai committee propose, dem suppose review di revenue formula in favour of states since dem go add more responsibility to dem.
On state police, di fear of abuse and excesses wey governors envisage dey understandable, but as Richie Norton tok say To escape fear, you suppose go through am, not around am.
For too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di apparently overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria police force wey don bikom no be only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum.
As Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey hin time don kom
We suppose address awa fear and overcome am
One of di way wey dem fit do na by enacting a legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), wit constitutional amendment wey go allow State Police.
E go dey similar for function to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but get wider powers to dey exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban on top open grazing though wey di governors restate no be new and e form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tok say NLTP be Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and thus reduce di risk of conflict between herders and farmers E, therefore, dey beg di belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to Lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis new plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herder clashes behind us
Di call of a National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since a report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendations of di Gov. El-Rufai-led APC committee on True Federalism dey
Both report don make far-reaching recommendation say awa governors wey dem elect and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of waste scarce resources on anoda jamboree.
On top di issue of secessionist agitation, suppose dey Modalities for convening a referendum wey dem do for di konstitution
E dey almost sure say a large majority of Nigerians wan live togeda, awa difference, even though.
To do dis go take di sea out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on top di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so every patriotic Nigerian must.
Even say we get challenge like Evri oda kontri, we must listen to awasef, as US President Joe Biden dey always tok
Tomori dey live for Abuja

E admit, howeva, say beside di few customers wey dem get for Kano, dem rarely see dia tomato products for di local market for some reason.
First na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na of special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producin area
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey high pass wetin dem dey obtain for di open market
So, basically, pipo no dey look us, dem feel apprehensive of wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen una get product wey dey commonly available, pipo go for di cheaper brand
One farm hand dey feed di fish
Wen dem ask am about di average lifespan of dia tomato products, e tok say, If you give di tomato all e dey need, I mean say nutritional supplement you dey feed am wit wen e dey grow, if you give am all those things, dis tomato fit last till three weeks afta u harvest am.
But even witout dat one, e last for minimum one week, no dey under any refrigeration, but no dey under intense pressure and heat
You fit keep am for table wia you get good ventilation
E fit last an average of 10 days, but wit evritin wey dem provide as e dey need (all nutrients) e fit last up to one month

3 Africans, no Nigerian like City, Chelsea compete for UEFA Champions League final
Without doubt, enthusiastic football fans for Nigeria dey eagerly wait tonight finals of di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals wey dem go compete between two English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea for di Estadio do Dragao, Porto for Portugal.
Sake of di fact say di UEFA Champions League na one of di world biggest football competition only next to di FIFA World Cup and di Olympics football event, expectation dey increase as di giants of di English Premier League don dey ready to tussle for di prestigious diadem.
While Manchester City neva win di Champions League title, Chelsea win dia first and only title so far for 2012.
Therefore, even say football pundits don tipped City wey just win dia seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea go kom into di competition wit beta credentials.
Na former champion dem
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead di Chelsea technical team neva taste Champions League victory, hin opponent for di Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two-time winner
E win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
So, plenti thing wey we go expect from di actors wey go dey out for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Interestingly, even say di two contestants dey parade only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) Africans interest for di final don drop
Here for Nigeria wia Chelsea and Manchester City enjoy a big follow from passionate football fans, expectations don reach feverish point, leading to interesting re-alignments.
fans of dose European clubs wey dem eliminate from di Champions League for different stage don re-align demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City based on different interests.
As a result, di finals na one of di topics wey dem dey discuss for sporting circles for Nigeria for di moment as fans of di Premiership club continue to predict wetin go be di final result.
Howeva, while almost evribodi dey wait to sabour di football artistry wey dem fit show, some pundit dey worried say di number of African players don decline for final of one of di biggest football competition for di world.
As dem dey follow di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don compete and win di trophy wit dia European clubs.
Sadly African football legends like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt fail to win di Champions League despite dia football prowess.
Even say Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Gu Guinea) dey big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African to win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
E don di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool.
Dem follow am by Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria
Duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995.
E dey also record say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon na di first African to win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am three times wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan.
Di oda African winner of di trophy wey dey highly coveted na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), as Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
As dem kom closer home, di last time a Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quarteret of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta dat achievement by di former captain of di Super Eagles, Nigeria don see di rise of oda very talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and later Victor Osimhen
but no one go appear for final of Europe's biggest club competition
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched
Di competition dey dominated by di top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don fail to enter dis highly rated European clubs ova di years.
Na di hope of Nigerian football stakeholders say in no distant future di new generation of players go break all barriers and begin to play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to live wit di agony of watching final of di UEFA Champions League kom and go witout di presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club finals dey a few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey find dem first title or di Londoners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
