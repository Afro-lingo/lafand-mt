The herders-farmerbs of Nigeria has been turning a lot of news now.
To end Nigeria-farmers: The Livestock equipment
Nigerias state and state government is struggling to implement one National Livestock/formation to control cattle movement throughoutout the country to turn and farmers farmers to turn a farmer.
Many state government has endorsed him, but it is a problem.
Politically, the leadership of his purpose, perception about his purpose,tccurts, which increases the COVID-19 pandemic, has not been in the work of the COVID-19 pandemic, and insecurity that are blocked.
If the plan failed as the other plans to modernise management, the farmer and herders fight.
It is the Economic Council for January, the plan is to represent the efforts of the effort to examine the livestock system that is not well.
The main part of the strategy is to control where they can be held, they can reduce the fight to farmers between herders and farmers.
The movement has a hope that after 10 years,herders who are here and mainly to put up their mainly to put their cattle in ranches and sacked public in public within public farms, where others livestock production and other to management to produce the produce the produce.
By the time at 2028 the authority would have been to build a points to have a 119 ranch for all the state ranches, such as two million to create two millions of jobs in the livestock production, processing and market.
President Muhammadu Buhari administration has been able to make a plan after a period of herders and farmers fight, while the fightrlarly affecting the fight and he is affected by 2018.
The Federal Government has a mind to drop money like 80 percent of the Transformation of the Transformation proposal, which is involved in the first thing to be involved, which include the first thing to include them to support for the state, prepared and started to be able to started to be able to be able field.
Many States have reacted reacting to grazze sacked, which they are open up to office, also set up to steer the committees to manage the plan.
The authority has been done to work and others who are working with the benefits of the benefit of livestock production.
As two years have left the 10-year-year-year-year-year-old plan, they have not built any ranches and their ranches many people.
The opposition of herders, however, was from the Fulani people, and it is still more, without the farmers who wanted to enjoy the pastolist them, including the benefit of the plan of the skills.
This isn't many in the Middle governor, which was fight between farmers and herders so many of landaking, even though the landaking and efforts have been reduceding since 2018.
Shortage is the federal and state government budgets, with a part of the economy because of the pandemic, and the country has a major experts to take the manage, which has to manage the manage and grazz and grae grainining and graor.
In many states, especially in the North-West, the way the gangs and group of criminal criminally growing in order to access access to grazing through grazing reserves.
Unless they do something about it, this is a problem and other ones that can be delayed or make the plan of the country, which it will help the fight between farmers and herders to turn away from ethnic region, which could be turned into and by political regions.
To tackle this issue, it is important for the Federal and authority to hand hand hand, with authority and investors.
First, Abuja and other states very support for its political leaders, which should be grown in order to increase their opposition with public opposition, so they can be allowed to ensure that people of the plan
This is a common number of farmers in the country, which they should be made to change their life, which amaicly life was able tournnies, which is no doubt about the promise of the right plan.
But many farmers are fearful that their land will be lost in land.
Many people in the middle Belt and other states in the South-ter was still deploying the country, which was seen as opportunity for herders and the Fulani people.
Witing the support from Abuja and other partners, state governments must find people to know, which is technically aspect of thimgs, especially there will be the manageing thing to manage the manage the dairy meat and farming meat.
Lets the State and government also increase their budgets, released the funds and create financial transparency to ensure financial nationwide to ensure everything is accounting for, there are working in works, with investors.
It is important to deal with with those insecurities in rural area, to curb his rehity and to relitate the fight towards communities in the states who participate in the state.
Auorororeities will be considered a matter, to change herders from other countries or also benefited from the country to benefit from the
As some of this step will take time, the people who plan is focused on how to bring a result, which can be able to see how people who can see a lot of time.
No two years from now, the country will hold a general elections.
If the plans will survive the government of government, Politians need to bring clear that it is clear that it can be a proof of (CCinin is certain, the presidents may not be served as two governor can have compete.
By the time, the cannabis in the elections have been shot in the end of 2022, the people should be able to show some of the plan of the ranches or to build, to their lives of professional items, to investors.
Noth in this thing is easy but the plans is worth the effort.
No one is that, but it brings a important chance to change, to Nigerias livestock system with both herders-sles and ethnic farmers to address what farmers
About 70 percent people are working at Nigerias money from Agriculture.
Tons modernise the Livestock sector will boost the country and in the same time, it is a big way to solve one of Nigerias dangerous to be dangerous.
According to the time to the 2023 election, both federal and state leaders need to be quick to see what they will be done, or someone is to create these kinds of opportunity to guarantee this moment of opportunity.

March 2021, in the Senate made history when the Chartered Institute, the Chartered Institute of Inenensical and Instiative Professional Professional Professional Nigeria (SBB.
791 after read it was read in the Third Times in both both Chambers (SFF), &AEF RPEEP).
This act is a statement of the patriotis and direct response to the National Assembly, who took targeting targeting, including strengthening and rescvis with nationals across the fight against the fight against government, government has been able to enter our country.
According to this bill, the 9th Assembly under the distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ibrahim Lawans, PhD, CDs RNON and Rbam has shown that it has showed that a legislative head of the 1999 Constitution as the Republic came into the constitution.
And this also attested to the fact that the National Assembly has made the performance to the performance of members with other arms in the fight against corruption.
It is happy with the deep sense of gratitude, that I writes this, which has been putting together as a platform to keep Nigerians and indeed the whole world to let the world know what the Charteredens of the solution in Nigerias and other national crimes in Nigeria's are bringing communities.
After the Senate in the Senate, and often views, Le-camekisising, the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives, we are ready and resilient, the able leadership of its leadership under Rtyyy.
Femi Gidado, the Hon.
The brother also followed what he was done and was on Wednesday on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you have learnt, during the Chartered Institute of Fors Institute of Forsics and Inenensalaligative Professional Professional Professional Professionals (CFIP) has been said among the bill in the National Assembly.
The sad thing is that people should be put up to the fight against government in Nigeria's attack, has turned the bill to turn the common bill in common ‚Äùs.
Gud a good thing, it does not have to have as a bad thing, not.
No matter as it takes a long, good will always prevail over bads just as the lights are infneted and unnetion of unnequemable.
It is important for us to see how to happen in the National Assembly.
It is interested that, the Chartered Institute of Inensics and Internaligative Professionals of Nigeria (CIF) through 2021), 2021 is the first passing it into the Senate through the first law in March 2021, which it will not be allowed to be a dig down the processes from which affairs from 2nding solution.
It is very important for public to know that (CIFIP) not just any body but a new body is not a newbleble but a new body to target the ports has been targeted for the gaps in the space.
Today, the I am to have a standard body to reenens of the practices of Nigeria in its peak and to Nigeria to make a few-go body to the anti-go body who intends to scage this step.
This bills that National Assembly has demonstrated that they are demonstrated that the need for patriotic and the need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, which has been blocked for all national lives.
This is a good step in in legislation; the two Chamber of the National Assembly, was historic and historic sgic, it is at a time at a time to welfels.
That would be given a good way for its anti-corruption as the spate of criminal and governments goes across the globe.
As we know, crime have entered another level as another level and technology has improve on 21st century.
Therefore, as the bill is here and it happened in a good time, including a better time, including flexible and respive legislation that is the thing to happen in the world, which they held in the world, which will meet with the bills.
Let us also say the journey within the bill in order to turn the bill in turning law since the 8th National Assembly, where the National Assembly where this National Ibrahim where there is the ongoing CDC.
For a better understand, when we introduced our bill in the twoth scored during the 8th Assembly, they do the public hearing every public along without everyone.
Thereafter, and on the crop has been identified by the Institute of Chaterterure of Nigeria (IF)) led by the National Assembly, the National Assembly, within the bill and takes of its belief in the country against corruption.
Afterward, the bill given the ‚Äù Presdo, to put up to hand, but it is not handed before the 8th Assembly in June 2019.
This is on this stygnbed the bill abck in the 9th National Assembly, this is the Diseuting Senatorial Yahaya, in the current Leader of the Senate, as it took important.
We have pushed to make this clarification in order to order to clear the air on the cheapness of using people that the 8th Assembly has revealed that the bill.
Also, we should say the fact that our bill has been in abother bill them just about both the Senate and the House of Representatives and Houses and House of Repative Chambers.
This bills, as we have failed toutize with them, we discovered that it is just as a sense of our bill in our bill.
It should be learnt that the bill was not introduced to any of the bill in 8th Assembly, only our bills.
As such, we are the first to carry a bill like this (Foreicsic).
As we have seen that it is very urgent to establish the Institute of agricultural Institute.
They took the decision to establish the Institute of the Institute after studying the Institute of the Institute, and how they had taken to help crime crime, and investigation and prosecution.
It is a part of our Institute to know our Institute that has been since 2009.
And over the years, and the years, we have trained professional Nigerians to know sensic science, targeted at in in eculampe skills for the requisite areas in the pragric areas of oil and management to management, with:
They can take inenens analysis of self-state issues, whether voices fraud; voiceness; rapprinital analysis; digitalenens; digital investigation; digital scenes of oils and social scenes of democracy.
You will speak to me that in the obo world that we are today today today, the normal way to investigate crime, and stop it's old.
As such, we should be able to do somethimg for the matter of this matter, it is Sumounted that we are going to follow global and news, they putting the grounds to take corruption.
This is kind of way we took to establish this Institute, which is one of the relevant to the anti-cruption agenda of this administration.
There is no one of me to say about everything in the bill here here.
However, I want to make me to allow me to mention a few of what to do, in the purpose of this is, as it
We should be established in Chartered Institute of Inensics and Instigative Professional in Nigeria, to develop and train professional in collaboration with this field, with their professional and system, which would be give
To provide a platform to train and re-trainers of people who are still to be professionals on the use of Inenenensic information and Technology can be used to investigate both fraud in the economy, as well as they do the economy.
To promote a high professional standards, itics and ethic techniques that are the, in the, in a bid to cut fraudu and corruption dul corruption, as well as well-chanchanmeism in develop.
To take the huge vacuum in our normal system in our investigations that weution of a unique investigation with the introduction of a unique operation inenen science to help the country from the country from the foreign exchange exchange to hire and their foreigns in Nigeria to do so.
To develop-based me-based mechanism and training programmes to cut across all investigations, in our correspondents, invving professional professionals as Cinvyers, Cyers, Cinstcics, subsparnurs, Eadion Court, Eadion Officer and Reile Court
This will be enhanced in effectiveposition of these cases as they take it on it globally; and.
To take anti-fraud mechanism in Nigeria through the provision of a legal framework of professional development and discipline for professional development inenens and investigating professionals in Nigeria, among others.
From the foregoing President, he has showed that the role of this Institute, strategicc and important.
It is also important to say foreen scienceics are very wide and wide and more than many others, it requires effective and efficient regulation to sustain and sustain professional level and its high standard.
The absconds of the scope and use of the Institute, includes the Institute, but not only forensic totenens; there is no investigation; for for foreicicsicics or digital oils; digensicsics or digenialensicates.
According to him, we will agree that our Institute has unique concepts of crime and investigation on international practices.
The concept of my people were taken tokk very thing about our bills, due to narrow-miningness and in miningness to monate and to monise monolise a lot of system, which has been passed to monolised and operation.
On a light at a light, I wanted to draw the attention of everythimg to play up, which is now playing out of now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all better source of people.
When the Chartered Institute of Forens of Forsics and Instigative Professionals of Nigeria through the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Nigeria, the Institute of Nigeria (IFF), which has been accused out of able to have, according to have been blming Institute.
However, they have took our bill again again in this 9th National Assembly, and we have seen the overwhelming legislatives and accelerated legislative support to the two Chambers of our bill, I have given us, and say that we have been able to beyond the practice as we have been able to grounded as we have been able to goed by the field, we have gone.
One can ask, what has happened between now and the past, where I was the viewed to any Institute of the research Institute of practices inenen science ?
Your answer is the same thing with my own.
I was also like you informed that the Association of National Account of Nigeria (ANAN), also part of this is part of this episisisising.
According to him, a initiated and promoted by ANAN. Just as I was also introduced by a policy in the House of House of Representatives for Repative the same structure with the same structures of Research Institute of Ctntuders and promote Nigeria to initiate Nigeria.
I decided to say all the fact to have Nigerias people to understand the extent in international community to which some people can make them to achieve their aimed for them.
However this development has not an disturbed us at all, because we believe in the National Assembly and ability of the National Assembly and also in the Presidency to take the right thing, they won any way in any way, within any way of the whole is yet to do.
I am & I was the best and antagonist for this bill and we have seen the reasons.
There are severally engages bystanders to write a bad petition, they were even the leadership in the Senate, and sounded blecks.
According to them, the Senate, the antagonist shift attention to the House of Representatives with the same crpative by the same publications as well as many publications.
and again.
Ordaily according to a legislative procedure, Senate in its needs only concururr by the House but when the House is osveration.
But in the case of the CIFIP After, the people fight against him until 19 to win it in the day of May 19, 2021, which House of House of House of House of House of Representatives, 2021, 2021, and Inpicicicicgped Agriculturalfyance (Hygin Nigerias All
I won't register in the House of Respative crpatives that were crpativedatives (NPEEE), & RPIF), O's 2008 IF.
The new recently IsAn't have contained a provision to take practices inens, including university, including university in Nigeria, without established no matter, without it could not practice foreeeeeeeeics and attained some years.
This is wanting to be at the end of a country in the country.
But, who made me apiion that Nigeria is not the Banana Republic.
No matter, the level of coruption is.
We have been a challenge as House of Representatives.
We should note that, as we are not challenge to the bill; but there is no matter, but that the purpose of the bill is to stop because the bills as presidential under the disguises has been addressed.
We are not going to deceive us and Nigeria with the people.
You will remember how I IAnn'll take off the CIFIP and in a pubedbebedbed by sponsoring of the Association of professional professionals by Nigeria (Chief.
Oluyiwa Ahi on 24th May, May 2019 to tell us the law to enable us to do it to do it inen &Isicsss to do up to do with the CNFFicate them just as it is just as the present law made for the present law made a new law.
The question is, what has changed?
The same law I ASP I asked the public onens he has to be seekens to seek reenenspenism, he said.
As always, we are not interested in any group that include in the proposedal law, which it requires a body should be the lawed to perpetuate.
I ASP and cohorts has realised inability to stop the passenger of CIFIP.
So they want to have a union for themselves.
It is checks and balances of fears, they don't wanted to ensure another professional activities because they are doing the economy.
How is they wanted to investigate themselves by their case?
This is sound-wel.
On this regard, we are called on the National Assembly to beware of the group of the group, which is not talking from both sides, they should be expected to be expecting it to use it, National Assembly.
Once again, we want to appreciate the 9th Assembly to put to ensure that they are passing the north, Nigeria administration has been ready to fight corruption by all means that they will also encourage them to help.
We have been aware of his Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari has not been able to put back to hand in the table as it entered into the table.
We are calling to Nigeria to take part in Forens, Professicicics.

According to the Part of the Parti of the Parti to pick who was preferred, said.
One of the party led to the protest, Bununun Oloun Ololade, said the Goves to Goves in the matter the matter to save the matter, the matter to save democracy.
Beween DSS and people who wanted to her region.
As DSS have puts a place in the group and others, they cang aggggg and thisthgrrigious environment and threatening coerous environment and threatening the common majority of the majority of the country, which has been forced to be allowed.
The Questions have been well-led or which persons and group are the security agent on various heats of various heats in the heatortivehetorts of the nations geo-ethnic agitation.
Afenifere, Aave Consultative Forum (ACAC), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) sacks Forum (NEF) Ken Delta Forum (PAN).
It comes into all of us that this is the group of people who continue to drive incis, uncoting, uncoed, uncoed statement and acted to take countries against their political and trial to put on the head of the D√Ésting as the DSSs of the cast.
Interestingly, in the major suspect was in the exploitation of some faultation of some faultation was to take it ethigious violence in some parts of the country can be part of the country distances from the subgation of the subibdive issues and subolary activities.
The same conviction was said the same conviction that the DSS are responsible for the people, only benefited by the principles that are accused and accused out.
Daily Trust reports that the people who are responsible for the acting in the act, but they could not be deployed because of the there is nobody to connect from PNN said to abscond about many people AC that should be able to be ?
Since the DSS knows, they know and they are going to take action, to take action with them.
The NEF person who is not convinced that if the people are pushing the country to push the deep-up and know they are treated to treat the law.
You dont need to know to know what the DSS is know about this flagss of geo-ethnic politics in Nigeria or to understand why they understand why they know why they know they know that they want to be in the rode down the buckol.
The truth is that there is a lot of ethnic politics without any solution to the problem than than than being enmeated by the sectional sections of the country as the Cvevevees of the country, noting the country as the country.
They are desperate and unscrupulous to keep upsate ambitions that they are agitating a agitate and agitated to break Nigeria.
Sibition-powered games inxal of their geographical consciousness to reduce it to Churinging the UNtisising the strategies of their enmeours with their enmesves within the fring of their quarters of the electedrists.
To put it a simple, to break up or out of Nigerian political political parties as a ultimate panatory opportunity to achieve in artory opportunity to achieve ambitions of people or group that generates the majority of the majority-zoooooodence in closeer to eing coerist, it is significanter to be easy.
All these group is a major blocking to attainmentments of unity and to live together in peace in Nigeria as Nigeria has been labour for independence since independence.
In long as they continued to continue to the political, the political as ethnic champions, it would be in Nigerias regard to the Nigeria as it is regarded to an ethnic stake in the population, to the population, to the claim or failed to be decutrunud, and that has failed to him.
Whenever they met, the agenda is not in Nigeria't progress and developing, unless the leadership is handlessly, other firmly are all about all about, it it is the barestlingling to deploy the Nigerians of the Nigerian umbe-negin the Nigeriansum in the economy.
Whether it is a AC, Ohanaeze Phan, PANDAND or Northern Elders, they will celebrate the existence of Nigeria and peace in Nigeria, peace and development.
Another incment that we cannot deny for this regional separist, saying all of them was selled by political pressures by political pressures of various ethnic groups.
From the membership, Eaching to see that the consitist of ex-thistis.
Ironic, this defiture has given the political defials to come together, desperately electronic representative in democratic system which elected representative in democratic political partys without established executive oil and dispensable constitutions of democracy.
It is only a nuising the value chain that the geo-ethnic groups have been set in our democratic set, which it continues to continue with misils, black, black and subcesards that have been able to make the attempts.
This is why yountques have been able to cause security!
Wites these predor-ptictictictics were left to goridund the perter of power without of power in the government and destroyed generated because of the government is quite because they are not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to beyondyondyyyyyyyyond the interestyyyyyond the terrorists, it, the terrorists
This is doubled the dangerous situation of the Buhari administration as they have to handle such as to handle such enemies inmidable allegations on national prices of nationals in the time within the economy.
To that extent, only two groups of politicians can be participate in the positive minds with democratic dispensation in the country where they have partnered in the country against all the country against it bringd all who brings this negatively and takes in the which the country to the country.
By what they are said, and what we are doing, we knows!

What they did not need to wear public: Nega Nigeria's Memorialism.
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Shes is a purcdence that, as a trouble in Kwara State recently, they were smelling to it at it in the National Assembly in the National Assembly in Abuja?
There is a deal in Ilorin, which was refused to have refused to take faith in the Muslim schools to wear the hijab of the school.
The solution in this predicament is on Saturday, These Discrius Discrihi (Probition, Prook).
RPP Bill, 2021, as they ridd up the Hijab through a section of media in Nigeria.
Both event is a spkk heat and arguments of its debate debate, at the bottom of every bottom, threatening to be necultural identity and reality of Nigeria.
The whole ideas can be used by Kwara of the prorietor of schooliety as the Muslim Muslim Muslim students were moved to wear nders to reduced to what they can not wear.
This is another major part of the RDP followed by the House of Representatives after the Repative crescent the denial of the denial and denial of opportunities.
We have a female in Nigeria are faced because of what they were wearing in public.
It is clear that the formerly breaching the human rights of the Muslims to take faith without discrimination; even discrimination; though the school can be achieved.
The latter are expected to be in the righter not in Muslim alone but also in the area of Christians where they reacted with discrimination because of the fuation of the fau with the fth of the f
To abscond from the arguments of Christianietor of faith in Kwara schools, easy to understand the body of the pragya bean appeals to other school to other schools if they should be kept.
The problem with many arguments.
First, to say by Muslim students of another place to rule the schoolless of the school on the little uniform to promote a very very very very littleness, which is promoters of our Memorial and breeding society.
Secondly,, the position should be asked: Is we can justify based on education on school on the major major major of the Christianarianitarian of the school?
Then, the third thing, the arguments will have been denied the difficulty the difficultyy the difficultying school in a child.
The in Abeokuta.
According to a school for children, people, within education is telling you, there is no interfger that it is not just a interfgeeeee but no longer.
Finally, the unristian faith by school by what we were called for what wetor by conurtization by conrating the same religious belief in the same schools.
The social cost this thing to have a society in society.
The Commissioner of Education, Kemos Adeunun, argued that when she spokes, the government is convinced that the government policy policy policy can enable them to wear Muslim schoolls to wear in the lead in sustainable schools and build its understanding.
In a country that guarantees freedom of religion, which the declaration of Human Right, the basic question: how to ask: how it is it to deny a child for a child to access from Nigeria to the basis on the basis for the basis?
That is a great concern because Nigeria is the Universal Declaration of Human Right on Human Right (H).
The UDOH insists that all human human and equal, they are coloured or coloured or religions no matter.
It contained 30 articles on right and freedom, including, among others, like the rifify the rhalal of life, free and privacy.
It includes social and social rights, like the right to get health to get health and education.
I saw on 18 and 26 of UHRo very relevant to consideration and consideration for consideration and quotation below:
We all have the freedom tokk ourselves or believe what they want, including religions.
We are right to change our belief or religions; any time and the right to practice our religions in public prrrr, or other people.
We must have a right to education.

It's refers to the use of improvion technology, especially the internet, and market to buy, and markets goods to customers.
The indigenes have brought a fundamental plan to the economy which is not near each other because of briered ross investment and investments, within trade, distances and nationalregulation by local government.
It's fostering direct access to markets which is not nearly promote and commercial performance, including domestic activities between domestic companies and foreign companies to the extent that it would not be possible to know for the product from the product.

The major belief that it has been in the fact that it is encouraged by encouraged system of a single world, which access to electronic means to take good and services to take goods from different parts of the world.
Most of the statue in the ground for nigeria is laging behind the development and growth of its growth and particular-mers in the whole and the whole.
In Nigeria, there is a legal research and studying and studying.
Many in the study of the legal opinion that the legal system in Nigeria is lag behind a lag behind entrepreneurship and the statutory law made enough to address some of the issue that it is not affected by the legally issued by the legally
This issue is including electronic evidences, APCs and economic production, with production,-pamental system and ineviting issues, including other ones.
Therefore, there is a need to bring out legally and regulators to take proper, to the governor which is just the regime.
They have said many times in Nigeria, in Nigeria, significant efforts to take re-comce-related a activities of the stages of Srafters before the National Assembly.
It is important to know that, despite this bill into law, Nigeria could still face new areas in this area to call a legislative intervention intervention.
Witce the out that the internet work on the commercial transaction in Nigeria, especially in the banking sector and communicated to the economy, the best of the economy, the legal issues that they maybe be confronted with the comce of the country to the country and that it should address the able interested the country.
To achieve these pressures to the National Assembly to take advantages as electronic bills as topronic priority into law into law.
During a time, our court made our giant to interprete the traditional law which was grounded in a gberal way to cutting the gap in order to the laws to cutting the laws to electronic transaction, particularly for the difference in the emerging of these information.
Indeed, there is no legislation that is the only means that electronic transaction and his predecessors can be legally legally legally.
The court may also also also recognised to electronic transaction in the absence of legislation or private contract of legislation.
As former Justice Bngham, he said: The common law are the hand of the same facility as the same law can be the need to make it it a largest of the general public principle, but to the general principle is not considering, but to apply the new result.
We are hoped that the government would adopt this act of Nigerianisms as the Supreme Court, Supreme Court, Supreme Court, there are involved in the area where there are inadequate to exist, gross grossly taking legally lateing challenges in local challenges.
This is to set a good pre-cence to ensure that it-comce consumer consumer money, to bring up to investor economic development and brings economic development in the country.

The provision of 4 pers of the statute of Frad, 1624 or Lagos State Law Law Law Reformed (Cactactact) and our various statualties were on real land, and that they should write to be write by which they cannot write to be suspended.
The question is that she's electronic sign-off-off is valid sign-off by itmailed or by emailing or by by which are?
Many of these issues were not in the UK, even in the UK although some decision is favoured to interpret electronic signatures.
So marks in it emails that it was satisfied by rude requirement of till and dueeeeance.
It's transaction that is not involved in a paper paper paper-des of magneticeticetical or this.
This is one has been the transaction to the given the transaction that is set for its permanently form and expressed place in typically and expressed words and figures in typically that are used to authenticate.
They can not be an transaction without that was alterout the face of the document.
According to him, the provision of this section of the sections of the region (3)3)), 2011, electronic acted by signature, which would be adequate requirement for those who take up to sign such as well as an electronic recorded to identify the record the recorded by the recorded person.
The provision of 7 articles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Law (NCI),NCIAL) model law in e-mercece 1996 was tried on this issue.
Therefore, in the purpose of establishing electof of electronic signatures.
To beword, identification, users can be named, etc.
He added that a bank can be announced that electronic signatures are in a evidences and provide evidences for evidenceer and incor it it it in electishate for election during it.
Also, other challenges affecting its affecting the comce include the formation of contracts.
The elements of better formation and includes, acceptation, consideration consideration, minds to enter into legalness.
The question is, in which can be points to offer with electronic business or now electronic transactions or now to treat different areas and offered by electronic transaction, at which can be given that to enter legally ?
It requires confidence and trust the satisfaction of the enabling order or Saoices not only to be any matter and come from it.
There is a need for the level of privacy/conacy/coficial information for information.
Lastly, the alarm is the alarming rate of domestic in Nigeria, including high level of illiterate.
No doubt that electronic transaction is that of commercial transaction in Nigeria and has come to stay this time.
Let the government to make a law to make a law, to take use use the electronic platform on commercial interactions and commercial interactions in service delivery delivery delivery of government.

US Africom Nigeria?
Once, oversexs and over here.
That is the cryful and its opinions of many British Peoples in the thousands of Americans of GIss station in several military based based on the military based based during the Secon World War.
The gum-chewing, brad, hard-drking and womanising soldiers from Americas come into Americans and fight off pubdedey to fight room for the y of the very bad locals.
And this is the lead of America soldiers in the killing of the hundreds of American military based overseawas in London, Stuttgart in Japan, Stuttgart in Japan, 2018, Muliy and theciarkiy Nanany in Turkey.
This is why the most of them, like many Nigerians, is in virtual meeting with the Secretary of the United States of the United States of the United States, Antony Blinin, he said to report that the president of the United States would be considered to be considerable to considere in Africa.
We are going to say with this a call, Buharis President Buhari is to host in Nigeria to host Afriricom.
In the first place, it was due to breach of the President Buhari to do that meeting with the American Secretary of State.
They should do the meeting with Blinken Nigerian opposition, Geing numbers, Geoff, who comes to detailing the detailed president.
Yes, Americans are superpower, and all, but protocol is a procolll and sopired on every circum.
We understand Nigeria is a bigger internal challenge that it is the best efforts of the government and security establishments in the nation to take tackle it.
Terroristing insurgency in the North East banditry, kidnapping in the North West West farmers/hers clashers all over the country and was targeted over the country with law and other security personnel killed by other institutions in Nigeria as well as well as well as the state of the South East has joined the state.
But even at the call, the call to meet Afriricom on Nigerias siol when we consider against various issues and implication implications of this move to justify Nigeria.
Another nine of the commandng nine of the American military has been established that it was established to serve American strategic strategic interests around the world.
By them, and way of operation, these commands, particularly the ones in America Afri, they did not set up to set up to quality security and law to be involved in the issue of law.
It is only as such as a issue of the interests of Americaly for the area and in such situation, they dont mandated to yield mod to yield modiand and share the local security with the law that enforcement and the law.
If a set for Afrier up in Nigeria, it will be a police on his ownas to be allowed to access Nigerians to all categories and established the categories in the area of the terorororial across the control of Nigerian law and enforcement and law.
According to him, with America military is based on Americans, Afriricomers will be in disruptive-frice operations and it will source to act in the act of sfistage and destabilise hosting country.
In this particular case of Afriricomion, part of his immediate concept, the strategic influence of Nigeria is growing in Nigeria as Africa and we have successful peace in Africa as we are successfully enfement for using agricultural and seeking the world to keep our world.
The held before Afriercome the Africa Crisis Agency (ACACACACAC), the Cestnton of the Cntnton to take up up to take up the strategic interests in Africa.
The Secretary of State in the Cntonliy, the dour-faced chieftain attorney, War, was attorneyer, a group of African countries to sell the ideas to sell the ideas.
But because Nigeria is the target, he pointed him from hisineine.
Senegal, who was not far from tracking and Sierra Leone, should be the broadcast of the ACAC ACACACAC and even seen it is seen assistanceing as part of America human challenges, its targeting military and targeted to Nigeria.
There are mainly to undisguised to host the ideas to the ideas from France, which is seen to see the Americans to see the Americans area but it is trying to consider it.
In the review, which insuter of him, Military, Military, political institutions and political institutions and religious institutions comes to the American American sessions, the Americans and realised the need to be set up the need for other world to go and have the command.
Therefore, to follow the reccomation of experts who spoke with a form of all forms, and security establishments in America and security establishments in Americans, the Bushored by the Brifor without widely mandate in Nigeria but the strategicdcable to keep the strategic within the strategics.
US as US Central Command (USCOM), the Middle East and Asia, so it is to be the Afririer in Africa, as it is based based on Florian Command, Europeanan (EEEEEEEC), in Stuttgart and Southern East (NEEIIIIX) based on Europe.
The presence of French military has been arrested as Nigeria has been in Niger, Camun, Chad and Benin.
The Americans have also been crture in Niger.
To say Afrierer to produce in Nigeria will amount to a complete caps of our caps of our strategis to both strategics and America.
According to him, our strategic interests including profiles in Africa is always following the in France and the in France to host Afriri in Nigeria, to host the same thing should be allowed to enable cages.
Not in the insecurity cah without the country, our armed forces cannot cope without a armed forces.
This is a after the military forced eventually comes and Seirra against army against armed insurgents, which is well-renched and organised in the country from the country from a long-guicicic supply of the phoggins of the Fuzant soldiers to Kant soldier.
It is regretable that the Nigerian military, has falling from high standard of standard, they are struggling to cope with the activities of non-state actors internal growth.
But intringically and internationally, the military for Nigeria still the capacity and capability to defeat this nation to defeat this nations security if they get the right of the leadership, providing security as well as well.
We need all are all as representing and coopation that the Americas can be given us to give us.
But as they have held us at a host Afririer with our cirumumums in view of his views intecentent and implication to our strategic, our soil, in our soil.

She was the reason I was her mother in the middle of global crisis.
Not only she was born, but a new me, was also new me, who spent the whole pre in lockdown in home and children in the country.

Her grandma was also afraid of her or was left to her near mask.
If pandemic is not, my journeys would be taken to enter different practices.
This Mother Day is very special as my children have been looking for the front, and looking for me.
In the last mother, she was growing in a lot of me.
The only thing is not made, meanwhile, the pandemic, is the pandemic.
It was as a 16 weeks in the pandemic, when the world entered into lockdown.
I was struggled to survive the pandemic with my homal and physical changes.
The 22 weeks are like war.
My husband, Sianwinan is a lot, and all its concerted engineers in the time.
I am freeance since January, 2021, 2021.
So we have been depending on what I have already paid, and spent all my savings.
Our parents and two journalists were recovered to help forward to help in the main time.
I am fear; every fear.
Most of the time, it was like to die.
Our door is now.
I am a able to say a new life that is a online click and they deliver our things or home-de.

The national question, insecurity and the declaration in Asaba.
By Segun Tomo
Recently, governor, in the souther Nigeria has been able to meet in Asaba and some approval of the state, which is calling on the nations nations declaration.
The meeting also comes on the matter as insecurity in the country has been reduced by some ethnic agitations, and as the matter of murderoous herdsmen generates nationwide.
Indeed, the bipartisan nature of the meeting within the 17nimity that is considered the governor of 17 governor to mean business.
Rectucturing in the context of trueism and the federalism of open grazing.
The light is to bring the state police, devtion of power, to review revenuesss through favouring voteer unit in the national unit, including the need for the need to discuss the question.
As they should condemn the way tohassss of their financial legs in the state and judiciary in legislature and its spirit of true God which is not called on the federal government to call for them, plant in the ten million of the ruling Progressives of the ruling Government (MDAs).
One to expect the leading light in the APC to take advantage of the bipartisan nature of the Asaba, and the support of the major opposition party to begin the issue to address the issue.
Instead, we see attempts to take the gallery and in some quarter, in some quarter, subles of the governor.
The El-Rufai has recommended devtion of power, resources resources, state, local government, local government, reviews inutation for frmulaming revenue for frmulaer and among them.
President Buhari has given the support for local government, genocidery and judiciary in abutonomy since amendment in the statual issued by the statual Order and Executive Order.
As the state of the nation, the security and economic challenges have become a big challenge, this should be the two sector and getting attention together.
Despitee the rate as Nigeria as a country of Africa in Africa, we have not been able to be a better efforts to improve it and the most important standard of our nations or the majority of
For instance, our annual budgets which reached $35 billion, it is very very inadequate to take cateral to the need of 220 million people.
South Africa, who has about 12 millions of the National budgeting $75bn in 2019 and her Protection Programme to 17m Agency.
The efforts of the Buhari administration is to make, as a new way and it is to drop up in in in the ce and not to make adequate impact.
This is a devtion of power and resources resources to enter.
So absconds with domestics and natural resources are not more business to stay in the day.
A neutral all the state in the country has a natural resources that can sell market to explore market to takic wealth and generate the country.
The present system where state is in Abuja to be kept allocations in the countrys breeding in the country, it does not follow the principle of true true trueism.
Just as the El-Rufai in the proposed committee, said to review the revenue form of states since they are responsibilities to be more responsibilities.
On the state, it was undesratndable that governors are fearable that governors will be feared, but as they will escape, Nortrtde, to escape, you have gone through it.
In long, we have been able to go back to the state of the police, we have turned a blind eye to the Centralised Nigeria Force which has become overstststing and that has becomen a big problem.
As vice-President Osin Osba, some years ago, the Police Command has come.
We have to address our fears and overcome it.
One in the way is to enact Relations to the State Police Command of the State Police Proory Commission (SPRC), along with a constitutional amendment of the police police police.
It will be similar officials with the Federal Police Service (PC) but it will be a wider to take power to exercise by regulators including wheels.
Do the ban on open grazing in the governors are not only a nate thing, it is part of the National Livemmme (PPPP) which National Executive Council (TPP) for the National Executive Council
The International Crisissis Groups (IG) has put the &ITP as the most comprehensive efforts to date to take over ensuring overhaul over the inefficient and grosrosroly livestock system.
In the Forbes strategy, to take curbtory and open grazing and cannot lower the risk of herders, thereforerere, therefore such beliefs, appealed to some ethnic belief that my chooses, there's chooses to getting the ban-maoric.
Let us the federal and stae government moved to fully implement this new plan so that we can put this-hers clash-herders clash from time to time.
The convvocations of National Dialogue, which is a major demand of the Asaba declaration is not necessary since the 2014 2014 when the National Consference of recommendations of the Govt-Rufai is on the Federalism.
The two report was to be a faring that by the governor of the governor who elected and elected legtiss in the national assembly to agree on, instead of the national resources that is not on another jamboree.
On the issue of the separist, agitations, they gave a modalities to take a referendum as it is in the constitution.
It is even certain that many majority of Nigerias people wanted to live together, they didn't mind our issues.
To do this will take the sailo for the row of the divisive elem, which is now fannet, which is fan and thiscords.
The Southern Governor Governor Governor Governor's commitment to one Uniteds on the basis of justice, fairness and equity, as well as the Nigerian Nigerian Nigerian.
But we have a challenge like every other countries, we must listen to ourselves as President Joe President President Gdnnnnent, said.
