Constitution review: Shariah dey south west before Christianity MURIC
Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don ask di Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) make dem mind im business and stop opposing di Muslim right to operate Shariah.
MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, tok am for one statement on Sunday
Dis follow warning wey di PFN issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di ongoing constitutional review wey di Senate dey do.
PFN and oda Christian groups dey fully aware say Shariah dey South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842
Di Shariah dey practice for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, Muslim name) and
Di Ede Shariah Court dey operation up till 1913 for Agbeni area of di town
E dey move go Agbongbon area for 1914
Na under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey die for 1906.
Even di seventh Akirun of Ikrun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (died 1912), institut Shariah for Ikrun for 1910
Dis na just example of di existence and spread of Shariah for Yorubaland and di Christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and dem impose Christian common law, Akintola tok.
Hin add say di PFN and oda Christians dey equally aware of di rising tide of Islamic awareness for di same South West and say dem dey only afraid say di sleeping giant dey wake up to take back wetin belongs to am
Hin tok say, awa Christian neighbours know well say Shariah na di Allah give fundamental human right of Muslims
But dem decide say make dem deprive us of am using unorthodox methods.
Dem believe say dem dey war wit Muslims and to dem, evrithin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and foul means to achieve dia objective
We call Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours
Like all aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence
As di benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage wey last more dan a century, dem dey decide to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeath to dem
Dem dey decide to keep di Muslims for concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drive dem
Di Constitution Review Panel ask Nigerians make dem forward dia view regarding wetin dem want for di constitution
Each group dey suppose submit im needs
But instead of tell di panel wetin di Christians want, PFN don go ahead to tok wetin Muslims no wan ask for
E be attempt to gag Muslims for South West and e no go work
E tok say di claim of religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery.
Muslims for di region dey waking up and dey ask for freedom
We demand halt to di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law.
We demand civil Shariah, no criminal Shariah wey dey involve di cutting of hand but civil Shariah to regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anything to do wit Christians
He add say we go use evri peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to attain dis objective

During di encounter, two of di police armored personnel carriers (APC) dey riddled wit bullet but survive di gun battle
A video clip for di aftermath of di attack show Gulak for pair of Jean trousers and blue T-shirt wey dey lying for a pool of hin own blood, besides di abandoned car

Nigerians knock FG, political actors over killing
Nigerians on social media dey warn di federal goment and political actors for hin killing
A commentator for di Facebook link of di story wey Daily Trust publish, Ifeanyi Maduako, wen he tok say Gulak death as distasteful, link di incident wit politics
Dis killing dey very distasteful to me
E dey political and those wey dey behind e suppose unravel am
Di killing go expose those wey dey behind di current insecurity for Imo State
Who invit am and why e kill northerner for Imo State?
I dey very afraid wetin fate dey wait innocent Imo State pipo for di coming days for di hands of northern controlled security agencies.
One commentator for di thread, Oloruntobi Micheal Omo, tok say di police report prove say dis killing na political and hence e call for in-depth investigation.
Police I guess get some question to answer
On hin part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad write say di soul of awa innocent pipo dey important pass dis scam wey dem call Nigeria unity
Dis illiteracy no go acceptable to us, enough na enough we dey peacemaker
But di pipo dey push us to di wall say dis peacemaking no fit remain
I dey warn say awa retaliation go worst
Buhari you fail us woefully, I dey urge Imo police make dem confront di culprit
Nasiru Inuwa write, A wake up call to di northern elites, dem don start wit di innocent Fulani herders and now dey turn to northern goment officials and prominent politicians.
Di outlawed IPOB, for one statement by im secretary, Emma Powerful, fault report wey link am to di murder of Gulak, note say di assassination of politicians no be part of im agenda.
We, therefore, state without equivocations say IPOB know nothing about di assassination.
For di first place, wetin threat do di late Gulak constitute to awa cause to warrant hin elimination?
We get nothing for common wit am and we no fit kill am for any way
Pointing accusing fingers for IPOB for dis barbaric act na only to divert attention away from di real masterminds.
Dis na di same way terrorists for security uniform commit different atrocities for South East and turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global reputation.
Dis na smoke screen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for di Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans
Instead of di security agencies to properly investigate di incident and possible factors, dem switch to accuse IPOB of crime wey we know nothing about
IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak to have waylaid am for airport?
Di group tok say security agency suppose first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, as well as hin political opponents to establish dia possible involvement
Those wey dey behind Gulak's murder no go unpunished
President Muhammadu Buhari don tok say those wey dey behind di murder of Gulak and oda incident wey dey across di kontri no go scot free

Di president, wey express sadness ova di incident, tok say I dey repulsed by such premeditated and gruesome murder of Gulak by pipo wey dey determined to undermine di peace, unity and territorial integrity of awa kontri.
Make me warn however say nobodi or group of pipo wey dey engage in dis despicable act suppose expect to go free
We go deploy all resources wey dey awa disposal to ensure say dis callous and criminal elements dey bring to justice
Gulak's kil unacceptable Akeredolu
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described di news of di assassination as very shocking and disturbing
For one statement wey di governor sign, e tok say dis na one murder too many, describing di action as senseless and wicked
Di perpetrators of dis heinous act na enemies of dis kontri
Dis contrivance dey meant to mislead, confuse and destroy
E bear di unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists wey dey set di kontri on di path of conflagration.
Dis criminals suppose no succeed
We wan use dis medium to express awa solidarity wit awa brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma
We encourage am and oda governors for di South Eastern States make dem brace up, and confront di current security challenge to put end to di bloodbath for di land.
Di enemies of di pipo dey always employ di weapon of fear to create disaffection for di polity
Dis cowardly act dey calculated to instigate Nigerians against each oda, particularly Northerners, against di Igbo wey dey outside di South East.
We must confront di enemies of di pipo wit view to neutralise dem
Dis no be di time for political correctness
Banditry no suppose subvert di legitimacy of di current goment for all level.
We call on all security agency make dem collaborate wit a view to unveil di criminal elements wey dey sponsor and undertake terrorist act.
Dem suppose punish dem, severely
Fintiri don mourn
Di Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri described as shocking di gruesome murder of Gulak wey be former Speaker of di Adamawa State House of Assembly.

Herder farmer crisis for Nigeria don be one ever dominating topic for all news platforms for Nigeria
Ending Nigeria herder farmer crisis di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement National Livestock Transformation Plan wey seek to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict.
As di Plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges.
Di lack of political leadership, popular misperceptions about im purpose, budgetary constraints wey COVID-19 pandemic cause, lack of personnel wey get di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, dey all hinder progress.
If di Plan fail as previous initiative to modernise livestock management don do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
Approved by di National Economic Council for January 2019, di Plan represent di most comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers.
E dey animated by di hope say ova 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go persuade dem to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breeding farms and oda mechanised livestock management practices go bolster di sector productivity.
By di end of 2028, authorities aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operation for all participating state, make dem create ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processing and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buhari administration kom up wit di Plan afta a wave of violence wey dey between herders and farmers, particularly a surge in related violence wey dey affect rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don committed to funding 80 per cent of di transformation proposals wey participate states, don take preliminary steps toward putting di Plan into practice, include providing technical support to help states prepare for implementation, such as help wit field surveys and site mapping.
Several state don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, open offices and set up steering committees to administer di Plan.
Authorities don also hold workshops and do oda work to explain di benefits of livestock reform to a larger audience.
But two years into di 10-year plan, di first new ranch no dey build, and di obstacles dey plenti
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey dey resent di Plan benefits to pastoralists, hinder reform efforts.
Distrust dey widespread for Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land between herders and farmers, no be say peacemaking and military efforts wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed.
Federal and state budget dey pinched, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri no get sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.
For plenti state, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and scaring away potential investors.
Unless dem address dis and oda problems, dem fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, leaving di kontri vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To tackle dis challenges require concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors.
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispell misgivings and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey go ask make dem change a centuries old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately doubt di Plan promises about available pasture
But plenti farmers dey fear too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Many pipo wey dey Middle Belt and southern state dey deeply suspicious of di Plan long-term goals, wey dem see as create privileges for herders, and more broadly, di Fulani
With Abuja and oda partners support, state goment must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.
Federal and state goment suppose up budgetary commitments, getten di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, work wit donors and investors as necessary.
As e dey address rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities wey dey affected by earlier violence for participating states dey vital
Plus, authorities go need consider climate change wey dey impact and reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross into Nigeria seasonally suppose or suppose no benefit from di Plan.
As some of dis step go take time, di Plan proponents suppose focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.
less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
If di Plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to produce clear proof of im benefits (Having serve two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors dey ineligible to compete, meaning say change dey certain)
Na ideally, by di time campaigning dey heat up for late 2022, di Plan backers suppose point to at least handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
No be easy, but di Plan dey worth di effort
As far from perfect, e offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey address di needs of both herders and small scale farmers.
About 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce don earn income through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity overall at di same time wey e take big step toward resolve one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts.
With di clock ticking down to 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need move quickly to make a visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity lose
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to hasten im implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish.
Di kind of problem I get wit di king
Make you agree?
Dem dey responsible for very high proportion of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers na smallholders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dey hold back from participating more actively for commercially oriented agriculture by different constraints.
No energy for anyone wey no dey happy for me
Na my own/ mine
Dis bring me to di conclusion say evryone dey evil
Dis system don characterise as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey small, often dey hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dey in marginal or risk-prone environments.
Yields dey low and farmers no get di capacity to increase yields
we dey tok life and prosperity to dis day
Make you send your account number
Di emphasis now na on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farming as enterprise
I know eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey discuss
Di yields di smallholder farmers dey get dey really profitable
Are you kom?
Dis emerging challenges lead many smallholder farmers to pursue livelihood strategies wey dey involve lower risk and lower-yield agricultural activities.
Are you witch?
I dey go sabo market to buy some food stuff
Make me call my father
As developing kontris population grow larger, richer, and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go occur for rapidly change agri-food value chains.
How far wetin dey up, suppose i dey on my way?
Dis developments dey further shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important say we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodologies
Di loan sharks dey on hin neck
Dis kind of thing
I dey on errand from my place of work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers plenti battles for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders for di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst years for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduced new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers need contend wit.
Di agricultural sector dey confront plenti challenges ranging from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic cause, wey bring pain and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions don apun for di time dry season farmers dey about to harvest dia crops and wet season farmers dey about to begin cultivation.
Many farmers no fit access dia farms while for odas get labourers to harvest dia farms since mechanization na big challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem.
movement restriction wey dem introduce to curb di spread of di coronavirus locked-down market don disrupt di rural economy.
Many farmers no fit sell dia produce to enable dem buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services
Even wen di lockdown dey lift for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer don dey high say plenti smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some place, di price go high as N13,000 for 50kg bag of Indorama and Notori Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti place and area wia di price don rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some place
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some parts of Kebbi and Sokoto state, bandit activities no only deny dem access to dia farm but dey kill plenti pipo for dia farms
Many farmin community don raze down
Many pipo don kidnapped for ransom
Many pipo pay large sums of moni or surrender large portions of dia harvest to di bandits
Many villages for dat state don dey desolate
Di agric sector also witness one of di worst disaster wen floods wipe out ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields wey dem estimate for N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano state.
Many of di farmers wey dem affect don no compensate as dia livelihood don destroy
Di flood na di worst since di 2012 disaster wey wreaked havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal cities and flood-prone areas wey kill pipo and washing away farmlands
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey confronted wit drought
For two months, farmers dey watch helplessly as dia investment for crops dey shrink away
Make you no disguise
One subsector wey dey badly hit dis year na poultry and feed
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin cause price to increase
E also force di Poultry Association of Nigeria make dem send save awa Soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention.
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric tons of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers in addition to grant some of di big players license to import about 222 metric tons of maize to augment di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean struck, make di farmers express fear say by January 2021, di industry go shut down completely.
Di scarcity result for serious feed crisis for di industry as prices don reach record high for its history rising from N2,600 for February to about N5,500 now.
Di poultry industry don lose N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem project to reach 10 million by January 2021 whereas di loss for investment dey estimate conservatively at about N1.5 trillion
As di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marred di subsector, di crop farmers despite di challenges wey marred di sector throughout di 2020 farmin year, get buyers wey dey kom right up to dia farms even before harvest to make bulk purchase arrangements.
Dis na di first time wey di price of grains dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, wey dey spark fear of hunger and di call for di borders to dey open, wey go allow influx of smuggled products through di kontri's porous borders.

But di US firms don fight back, warning di law go make dem withdraw some of dia services

Odunsi tok say di importation go save di poultry industry from collapsing

E also urge di goverment, for di interim, make dem enforce ban on export of soya, seed and processed soya bean meal
Hin enjoin governors for di region make dem put as much effort to di cultivation of maize as dem don do wit rice
Odunsi tok say di need for strong collaboration among maize farmers for Nigeria, soya bean farmers and odas
E tok say acute scarcity and astronomical price of soya beans and maize go threaten additional five million poultry jobs for di short term if di goverment no intervene.
Today, maize dey sell for N210, 000/MT for most state of South-West, soya meal N240, 000/MT
For di importance of dis two items, di price of poultry feed don dey increase from N2750 to N3000 for April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now
For December, most farmers no fit sell dia broilers bikos di cost of production dey higher pass wetin average Nigerian fit afford
Presently, egg dey go out of di reach of average family wey get ideal price for N1, 300
So we need goment intervention to save di current 10million jobs for di poultry value chain of awa economy

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy trends for di public domain, wit Southern governors slamming ban on top am for dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN), and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, examine how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di Southern state governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminality.
Wetin be your take on di heated controversy wey dey generate by dis decision?
every human being get right to action and opinion
But di important thing na say wen you take your action, you suppose dey aware of di consequences
You suppose dey able to consider di advantages and disadvantages
I no be one of di pipo wey tok say e dey good or bad
As Nigerian, you get di right and liberty to live anywhere for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association
On dis basis, I no go tok say e be good thing
But as leader for di North Central, I go tok say na good thing, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefit for us and di nation
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herders, no matter di number wey fit troop from South into North Central
Wetin be your position on open grazing?
I no be one of di propagators of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as individual
I believe say if we take to ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching
Dis move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo fit always get access to cattle and all di allied products
and then e dey be means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern state no get
Look for Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit accommodate di herders and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey Fulani herders pose no becos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem na say dem no dey educate dem on dia advantages
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem suppose dey well educated to embrace ranching
We fit also adopt di Kenya method, wia nearly all di families get ranches and you no see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no call dem for ranching and for di federal goment to kom in
Wetin dem dey tok na say di herders don become problem to us and make we go away
Dem tok say di herders suppose apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don tell dia indigenes say make dem apply for land like di herders?
As one of those wey dey involve for youth empowerment programme, especially for di agricultural sector and its value chains, why some goment policy fail to realise dia objectives and wetin dey di way out?
Firstly, no administration wey don fit touch di lives of individuals like President Muhammadu Buhari administration wia you fit conveniently sit for your house and apply for facilities and you get dem
Na di target credit facility wey dey known as COVID-19 loan
Many Nigerians don get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house without even go office
Also, wit SMEs wey dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge na say we get two sides of those wey go believe in you and those wey go criticise you
So, for pipo wey no believe for Buhari administration, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe for Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am

Passin of forensic Bill by National Assembly e relevance to Buhari's fight against corruption
Di National Assembly of di Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th
May 2021 for di House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 for di Senate make history by pass into law, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB615 and HB).
791), afta e dey read for di Third Time for both Chambers (SENATE and House of RePRESENTATIVE).
Dis act na clear demonstration of di National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, targeted at strengthening and re-invigorating national frontiers for di fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, wey don eat deep inside di fabric of awa nation.
With di passage of dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD,CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly, im ardent resolve to carry out im legislative functions in line wit di provision of di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.
And dis also attest to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
E dey wit great delight and deep sense of gratitude wey I write dis, wey don put together as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey all about and di unique concept wey we dey bring on board in order to complement national efforts for hin quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda crimes wey dey related.
Afta di passage of dis Bill by di Senate, and in view of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di Hon
Speaker follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May 2021
As u fit well know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di most viciously attacked and antagonised bill for di National Assembly for recent times.
Sadly di attack kom from pipo wey suppose be partners for progress for di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dey rather designate dem as enemies of di general good.
Good na good e get no substitute so e dey bad
No matter how long e take, good dey prevail over bad just as di superiority of light over darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important for us to get glimpse of how e all apun for di National Assembly
Interestingly, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) first pass into law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone di rigour of legislative process of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for its 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 di bill unanimously pass into law by di Nigeria Senate having deeply consider di urgent need for dis noble legislation, of course dis no be without series of thunderbolts from detractors wey no go stop for any length to see say any legislation wey go help assist Buhari-led administration to fight corruption no see di light of di day but di senate stand firm and see am through.
E dey important for di public to know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but novel one for Nigeria wey dey target at bridging di gap wey don dey long for di forensic space.
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-goment bodies wey wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national efforts wey dey geared towards di fight against corruption, wey don hinder development for evri aspect of awa national lives.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, kom for time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
Dat go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe.
As we all know, crime generally don assume new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century
Di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging global realities and ever-ready to enact legislations wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey apposite to also tok say di journey, wey culminated into di passage of dis Bill, began for di 8th National Assembly wia, awa Bill dey sponsor by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD,CON, di current President of Senate wen e be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
For di benefit of hindsight, wen awa Bill dey introduced for di two Chambers for di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings dey conduct by di relevant Committees of di respective Chambers.
Thereafter and in spite of opposition from stakeholders wey dey minority, led by di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), di National Assembly pass di Bill, in view of im significance and di part e go play for di fight against corruption.
Afta, di Bill dey forward to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June 2019, 2019.
E dey on di strength of dis, say di Bill dey reintroduce for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, e dey sponsor by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A Yahaya, di current Leader of di Senate, in view of di importance wey dey attached to am
We dey constrained to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on top di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propelle say awa Bill dey reject by di 8th National Assembly.
Also worthy to mention na di fact say awa Bill don dey mistaken for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduced for both di Senate and di House of Representative Chambers.
Dis Bills, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem na merely duplications of di intent and purport of awa Bill
E must dey stressed say none of dis Bills dey introduced for di 8th National Assembly, oda dan awa Bill
As such, we be di first to kom up wit Bill of dis magnitude,(Forensic)
having see di urgent need to establish such great Institute
Di decision to establish di Institute na afta a painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdictions and how well dem don help in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey existence since 2009.
And over di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, targeted at inculcating di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit.
Forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, wey dey caused by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic report, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
You go agree wit me say for today's world, di conventional way of investigating crimes, wit view to fight am don become obsolete
As such, for us as nation to do something meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and emergin innovations, wey dey target at fight corruption.
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say di idea of establishing dis Institute dey conceived wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration
Time no go allow me highlight all di objectives of di Bill here
Howeva, I wan crave your indulgence to highlight few of di objectives of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field,through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills for di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals for di usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques for di investigation of frauds for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquette amongst practitioners for di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill di existing huge vacuum for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of unique operation of forensic science to help di kontri from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programme wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, wey include professionals like Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of case in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms,through di provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey pertinent to reiterate say forensic science na wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards.
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, include but no limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic linguistics; forensic
Accordingly, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity wit international best practices.
Dis concept dey far beyond di reasoning of those wey myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don cloud dia sense of reasoning, bikos of narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On one lighter note, I wish to draw di attention of evriwia to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill wey dem introduced for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out vehemently to oppose im passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem don undertake by dia Institute.
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and having see di overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, awa Bill don receive from di two Chambers, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduced similar Bill wey dey currently before di House of Representatives, having fail woefully for dia attempt to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN hold di view say e suppose no be any Institute wey dem go use regulate di practice of forensic science?
Your answer dey good as mine
I wish to also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), no dey out of dis funny diatrical episode
just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don also introduce Bill for di House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey dem initiate and dey promote by ANAN.
I decide to bring out all dis facts so Nigerians and even di international community go understand di extent to which some pipo fit go in order to achieve dia aim.
Howeva, we no dey perturbed by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency make dem do wetin dey right and make dem no allow dem manipulate dem for any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as we no go make a mockery of di whole thing.
Di known practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN for reason wey now dey obvious
Dem engage plenti bystanders to write frivolous petitions some even targeted for di leadership of di Senate wit tone of blackmail
Having failed woefully for senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all manner of publication.
Yet again, dem fail
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill wey dem don pass by di Senate go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia dem dey observe.
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and on 19th May 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skills to dey Attain by Persons wey dey seeking to become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB 791) pass into law by di House of Representative.
ICAN don register im Bill for di House of Representatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT of ICAN ACT).
Dis ICAN new Bill get plenti provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and without which nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead dis person to some years imprisonment.
Dis sound so strange for a kontri wey get plenti enlightened pipo
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no matter di level of corruption wey dey
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives
E suppose note say, awa challenge di bill no dey out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey certain say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of existence of similar legislation.
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians to deceive by dia antics
You go recall how ICAN vehemently oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of its sponsored publications by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade for di 24th May, 2019 make frantic effort to tok say ICAN under im enabling laws dey empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to dey pass e go amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN dey present im ACT to dey repealed and re-enact wit di inclusion of Forensics for di new law.
Di question na, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey seeking for im re-enactment
As always, while we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for im law, we dey however concerned say a bodi suppose no try to perpetuate amself
ICAN and im cohort don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
So dem wan get bodi wey dey inside eself
Wetin dey scared of na checks and balances, dem no go want anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation
How dem fit be judge for dia own case?
Dis sound so strange
On dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly make dem beware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit speak from both sides of dia mouth and make dem expect di National Assembly to dey cajoled
We wan again appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly in ensuring say di Bill dey pass, di Nigeria pipo dey more dan ever before convinced of di readiness of dis administration to combat corruption through evri possible means and e go at all times encourage legislation wey dey aim at achieving dis goal.
We dey confident say hin Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate to assent to dis Bill as soon as e dey go hin desk
We dey call on all Nigerians make dem kom kom and be part of di Forensics Profession

Tela Maize harvest show potential for 8 ton per hectare
Last Tuesday, di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, invited relevant stakeholders, including journalists, to witness third harvest of Tela Maize variety Confined Field Trials (CFT) under im Tela Maize Research Project wey di Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) fund.
Di maize variety derived its name TELA from di Latin word TUTELA wey mean protection
Di maize variety dey bred wit protection against insect pests and draught
Di Principal Investigator, Professor Rabiu Adamu and oda scientists wey conduct journalists round di harvest, tok say di idea of di research work na to produce maize varieties wey dey resistance or wey dey highly protected against two major insect pests stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm and additional protection against moderate draught.
Dis na all about producing crops wey dey high yielding under stressed conditions; di stresses na Fall Army Warm and stem borers, wey be major constraints to maize production.
If no kontrol, e fit cause up to 80 percent yield lost; and draught if you no manage moisture (rain) deficit very well, you fit no get any yield
We don do dis trial for di third time
We do di first trial under dry season for March, and for di rain season, we conduct anoda one from June to November
Dis na di third trial from November to April
So, for essence, dis na wetin we dey try showcase, di Principal researcher tok
wit di three CFT trials wey dey successful, researchers go need test and validate dem from di farmers field to show say wetin dem record from dia own research station equally perform well for di farmers fields on wide range of locations over wide ecological condition, beginnin from 2021 rainy season.
By di end of 2022, if all things work fine, Nigeria farmers go expect dis hybrids to dey wit dem
Dr Muhyideen Ayekunle, wey be maize breeder under di project, tok say from di last two trials wey dem conduct, di transgenic variety record yield advantage of 17 percent over non- BT despite heavy infestation.
Di varieties wey dey under trial dey infested three times unlike di previous ones to virtually look at di efficacy of di BT gene for di maize product.
With di outkom, researchers tok say di yield go dey increase above 17 per cent
So afta, we go analyze di data and make we prepare document wey go get approval for environmental release.
We go submit di dossiers to di National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and dem go review am.
Once we get approval say dis product, we fit kom out of di confinement
and then we fit get national performing trial
Di Director General/CEO of di National Biotechnology Development Agency (NBDA), Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, for di event, call on di scientists make dem continue to search for abiotic and biotic solutions to di challenges wey farmers dey face for di kontri.
We don test technology wey dey capable to provide solution to problems wey farmers face, make we take advantage of am and move forward
Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, di Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, tok say di impact go be plenti
Farmers go get yield increase of 17 percent and you know say farming na all about productivity and harvestable yield
Once you get yield, of cause you go get bumper harvest and profit

Between DSS and regional separatists
Repeated warnings by di DSS to persons and groups wey dey utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, dey start to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingering questions about who or which persons and groups di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outbursts of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E don dawn on all di persons and groups wey don continue to dey inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and act to pit citizens against one anoda in order to apparently inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS tok for one of its warnings.
Interestingly, none of dis prime suspects for di exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance amself from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency dey detect.
Dem choruse common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, dey different only for di direction of dia accusing finger
As Afenifere tok say dis pipo know di pipo wey dey responsible for dis acts but dem no fit touch dem bikos of dia connection, PANDEV rehash im grouse about plenti pipo wey dey feel alienated and ACF feign ignorance, ask who be di pipo?
As di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, dem suppose dey proactive in dealing wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if pipo dey push di kontri into deeper crises and dem dey know; dem suppose treat dem according to di law.
You no need be spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all of dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS know dem yet dem insist on passing di buck outside dia cliques.
Di truth na say dis champions of ethnic politics know no beta solution to Nigeria's myriad problems than for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord am over di rest of di kontri as rulers, not leaders.
So desperate and unscrupulous dey dem in pursuing dia inordinate ambitions wey dey absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all e take to excise di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups wey dey restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, na e dey easier to do.
Dis regional groups dey constitute major hindrances to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labouring for since flag independence.
For as long as dem continue to dey parade di politikal terrain as ethnic champions, for so long go dem regard Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake for di population, to dey claim or seize and if all else fail, deconstructed and disowned as failed state.
Wenever dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless im leadership dey firmly in dia grasp, odawise e dey all about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Phd, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether e be ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
One undeniable indictment of dis regional separatists na say dem dey all self-styled political pressure groups wey dey masquerading as representatives of different ethnic groups.
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem be ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem impetus to kom together, desperate to remain relevant for democratic system wey dey run entirely by elected representatives through registered political parties wit legislative and executive institutions wey constitutionally establish to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get nasty nuisance value for awa democratic setting as dem persist in act of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey often threaten and attempt, so dat, perchance, dem fit regain political relevance if dem no control.
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetings trigger security alerts
wit such predator-politicians wey dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent to undermine an elected goment just bikos dem no dey involved, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say e must be convergence of interest wey dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, wey dey combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.
Double jeopardy aptly describe di predicament of Buhari administration wey dey contend wit such array of formidable foes wey dey unleashing incessant assaults on national security for a time of unprecedented economic adversity.
To dat extent, dem fit only get two groups of politicians wey dey positively participate for di democratic dispensation as partners for moving di nation forward against all odds and those wey dey negatively engaged in sowing seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
By dia utterances and activities, we all know dem
For di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians na ordinary citizens wey no dey depend on di geography of dia origin.
Di daily struggle to eke a living dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of differences of faith
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland to which dem dey remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get oda kontri to call dias, collectively show how citizenship breed true patriotism
Dem too know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one anoda in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di political ambition of dia leaders.
E be say di poor man's prayer dey remain
GOD dey,
Nigeria go better
Manzo Reuben na youth leader for Lokoja

Wetin no to wear for public negating Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
As trouble dey brew for Kwara State recently, a solution to im kind dey considered for di lower House of di National Assembly for di capital territory Abuja?
Di trouble for Ilorin na ova di refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow dia Muslim students wear hijab to di school
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tag Hijab Bill by a section of di Nigeria media.
Both events spark heated and often emotional debates wey, for di bottom of it all, threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.
Di whole idea for Kwara of di proprietors of di school wey dey ban hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathisers fit reduce to wetin dem no go wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunity
female Nigerians dey face wit bikos of wetin dem wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human right of di Muslim students to express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get dia defence to take such position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians wey dey threatened wit discrimination based on dia professed faith.
Running through di argument of di proprietors of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, one fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children suppose go oda school elsewhere if dem no want to conform.
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument dey plenti
First, to say Muslim students suppose go elsewhere unless dem conform to di school rule on uniform no dey very little to promote inclusiviveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, di position beg di moral question: na e justifiable to base school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Na, thirdly, di go elsewhere argument appear to ignore di difficulties wey dey change school for a pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of change school for a child, educational psychologists go tell you, dey interfere negatively wit not only im emotional but academic development too
finally, di Christian faith schools by themselves risk wetin dem call ghettorization by concentrating student wit di same religious beliefs for particular schools.
Di social cost dis exacts on di society dey enormous
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, tok, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goment dey convinced say e policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey dey anchored on mutual respect and understanding.
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, signed di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na how e go justifiable to deny Nigerian child access to school of im choice on di basis of di manifestation of im religion?
E dey great concern bikos Nigeria be signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 article on rights and freedoms wey include, among odas, civil and political rights, like di right to life, free speech and privacy.
E also include economic, social and cultural rights, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to di issue under consideration and quote dem for full below
Article 18: Everyone get di freedom to think or believe wetin dem wan, including di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion for any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa chosen religion, alone or wit odas
E get di right to education
Primary schooling suppose dey free
We suppose all dey able to continue awa studies as far as we wish
For school we suppose help develop awa talents, and dey teach understanding and respect for evriwia's human right.
We suppose teach us to get on wit odas wey dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri wey dem kom from
our parents get di right to choose wetin kind of school we go go.
Dis type of law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for di House of Representatives for di US wearing her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019.
E be bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey seeking to address discriminatory conduct and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and condition of employment.
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors from discriminating against persons, students or personnel based on dia religious belief or im manifestation.
Wen dem pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or those executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am to becloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welcome development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria constitution and di UDHR document wey dem explain above
E dey line wit similar law wey dem pass recently for di kontri seeking to tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP).
As disability dey seek to eradicate all forms of discrimination wey dey base on person disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri.
One for one time, awa representatives for di legislative chamber dey tackle di social menaces wey dey bedevil awa kontri through legal instrument
Dem dey address dis social ills no bikos dem no get prior generic laws wey cover dem but bikos dem need address dem more comprehensively to leave room for opacity.
As UDHR fit look like far, distant document wit no instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like e dey provide to allocate punishments for offenders.
For di view of im critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing to show attempts to seeking di enthronement of state religion for any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian constitution wey tok say di goment of di Federation or of a State no go adopt any religion as State religion.
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim women wey dey wear Hijab for public spaces smack of Islamophobia only.
For di final analysis, to deny Nigeria male or female hin or her religious freedom negate awa multicultural pretenses
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right wey dey enshrined for Nigeria constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
A bill wey go criminalize such decimations based on religious grounds, like di RDPP bill, na welcome development.

Police go afta newspaper vendors over report on IPOB
Newspaper vendors and readers for Aba, di commercial hub of Abia State, dey currently harassed by di police
Daily Trust gather since di weekend, policemen from Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers ova report on di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).

One eyewitness tok say residents scampered for safety, as police officer shot sporadically, wen dem dey try arrest newspaper vendor and readers
Di vendors accuse di vendors of distributing newspapers wey get stories on top di sit-at-home order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr Elendu Ukoh, one of di eyewitness, appeal to di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so dem no go create crisis for di city.
Di kind pipo wey we put into police dis days make me wonder if we really wan anything good out of dis kontri wey dey call Nigeria
How someone fit dey chase newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo from reading hard copies of newspapers, go you also stop dem from reading di same stories on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, among odas?
Wetin manner of primitive policing na dis?
Dem caus panic on Sunday by dia shootin and noisemaking
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey chase kidnappers
Na later we discover say police kom arrest vendor and readers, wey dey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police fit fight newspaper vendors?

Why police no go to YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey air am?
All dey do na to kom to streets and start look for unnecessary trouble

SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), deny say di police arrest newspaper vendors and readers for Aba
NA kicks as air traffic controllers lament poor tool
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday cried out ova dilapidated navigational equipment for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation pose threat to air safety
Dem also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go aid safe aircraft navigation
Di President of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey for Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel use and no be control tower wey dey exclusive for air traffic controllers.
E also tok say oda airports for di kontri no get di necessary equipment for seamless navigation
E explain say some airport no get functioning equipment
Even Kaduna no get control tower
Wetin dem dey use na watch room (for firefighters), wey no dey build for dat purpose, and we don call on di goment make dem do something
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controllers go look for umbrellas wey go sit for di control tower, and wetin be dat, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings dey ceded to FAAN, while those wey dey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there
Calabar dey there; no airport you go go today say you go say things dey work 80 per cent
Na NAMA don recently employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number dey too low to meet di shortfall.
Howeva, di Managing Director of di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
E tok say di federal goment don invest hugely in improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations.
E tok say e be mere politics
Di goment don spend plenti for di recent past to improve aviation infrastructure
I dey tok dis no becos I be MD of NAMA
If you wan hear di truth, my suggestion don dey, ask di pipo for di street, ask di pipo for NAMA, dem go tell you, dem no get am so good under dis administration
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We no get category three (CAT3), dis goment put two for place, two odas dey kom
Government don spend N1.7bn on top mobile control tower
E dey ongoing revitalisation of di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Some sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria legal framework, challenge and prospect
E-commerce refer to di use of communications technology particularly di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by di national differences for goment regulations.
E-commerce equally fosters direct access to distant market and promote globalisation and commercial activities and blur plenti of di current distinctions between domestic and foreign companies to extent say e dey practically impossible to determine di origin of di products.
E-commerce no dey limit to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communications platforms, all information or services wey a company fit offer to customers over di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
Di major significance of E-commerce na di fact say e encourage single world trading system, wey dey facilitate by access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of di world.
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
So many legal research and studies on e-commerce for Nigeria don dey conduct
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system lags behind ICT-based legislation and say di existing statutory laws dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and plenti more
Na, therefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime.
E don state strongly say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities dey still dey stage of draft bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say even wia dis bills dey pass law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
For di speed wey di internet dey permeate commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best wey fit suggest na say di legal issues and problems wey dey presently confront e-commerce for di kontri suppose address directly and expeditiously, in di interest of di teeming population of Nigeria consumers.
To achieve dis, di National Assembly suppose pressuriSed into passing bills wey dey concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so dat dem fit enact dem into law as quickly as possible.
For di interim, awa courts suppose take giant stride by interpreting di existing traditional laws liberally so dem go fit bridge di gaps therein so dem go fit make such laws amenable to electronic transactions, particularly for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
Indeed, e dey argued say legislation no be di only means wey electronic transaction and attendant documentation fit facilitate legally
Di courts fit also adapt to recognise electronic transactions for di absence of legislation or private contract
As di Justice Bingham tok am, di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility [as di law merchant] for adapting eself to di changing needs of di general public; principles no change, but old rule of applying di change, and new rule spring into existence.
E dey hope say dis judicial activism go adopt by oda Nigerian judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive, especially for di area wey awa existing legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technology advancement.
Dis go certainly set good precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investor and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri.
Di German issues wey dey relate to contracts for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statutes on real property and landed instrument, all of which require certain contracts to dey write and dey duly executed.
why electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of a contract by email and be binding?
Many of dis issues still no dey settle even for di UK although some decisions dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
So mark for emails as dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution
E-commerce transaction na paperless transaction wey dem make through magnetic materials like tape or disk
Dem dey contradistinction to di paper-based transaction wey dem dey embodied for permanent form and dem dey express in words and figures wey dey usually authenticated by signatures.
Dis transaction no fit change without an alteration on di face of di document.
With respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature for relation to data message conveniently satisfy any requirement for handwritten signature in so far as e sufficiently identify electronic record to di individual
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue.
Thus, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures
Di use of password, identification, user name etc fit suffice
E mean say electronic signatures for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence provided e dey certified and incorporated for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenges wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation
Di question na at wetin point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, at wetin point dem fit tok say an intention to enter legal relation dey make?
E-commerce require confidence and trust say di satisfaction wey dey transmit order or invoices no dey change and emanate from whoever dey appear to be from
Na need for guaranteed level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce no dey doubt aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom stay for dis time
Di goment suppose go beyond create laws, to activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for im commercial interactions and for delivery of government services.

Chad pass new charter wey dey name Deby's son president
Chad don pass charter declaring Mahamat Idriss Deby president, even as rumours of hin death dey trending on social media
Mahamat take over for place of hin father, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey on Tuesday dey swiftly named transitional leader as head of military council following hin father's death, go occupy di functions of di president of di republic and also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter repeals di preceding constitution and go implement am as di basic law of di republic, according to im terms.
E tok say di younger Deby don also be supreme head of di armed forces, e tok.
Deby's son don overseen hin father's security as head of di elite presidential guard and dey often appear alongside am
Mahamat Deby na top commander of di Chadian forces wey dey assist United Nations peacekeeping mission for di restive north of Mali.
E sign a decree Tuesday setting out military council wit 15 generals, including himself and 14 odas wey be part of di late president's circle of loyalists.
Di council dey tasked wit 18-month transition toward free and democratic election
Mahamat Idriss Deby also chair di military transition council, di council of ministers, di council and superior committees of national defence, according to di charter.
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat
Di Transition Charter, wey get 95 article, also guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship
Di new president don set up transition goment, wey dem name by di new president
Di members of di army wey dem call to di transition goment dey discharge from all military duties, di charter tok.
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for nearly 30 years, survive to wound wey dem suffer for one visit to di battlefield for di kontri north wia Chadian soldiers fight against rebel group, di military announce on Tuesday.
Calling for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri borders, as dem suspend di constitution and dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army's appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over for di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose take power afta Deby death and not hin son
Wetin di constitution tok na say in di absence of di president or in case he die, di speaker of di parliament take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so transition dey put in place until election dey hold, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, wey dey report from di capital, Ndjamena, tok earlier on Tuesday.
But di military announce say di legislative assembly don dissolved and di constitution also don dissolved, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di constitution wit dia own set of rules.
Chelsea face possible points deduction afta brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible points deduction by hin FA for di team's failure to control dia players, Mirror report.
For seven years, di team don find pants down for seven hot-tempered row wit opponents
Di recent brawl wey dey during one clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter Chelsea get wit Premier League team
Last week match between Chelsea and Leicester dey marred by skirmishes between di players of both team
E dey cite similar offenses for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea
Leicester don charge for dia role for di brawl wey dey involve players and coach staff afta Ricardo Pereira challenge on Ben Chilwell
For 2016, Chelsea dey charge for indiscipline wey dem suppose warn, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part for a mass bust-up during a match against Tottenham.
If affected, di points deduction go affect dia season as dem go head into final campaign for top four spot
US Africom for Nigeria? Heck no
Overpaid, oversexed and over here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo kom get of di thousands of American GIs wey dey station for several military bases for Britain during di Second World War.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers dey frequently get into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up feeling of disdain for di yanks among di locals.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldiers everywhere for di hundreds of American military bases overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for di Philippines.
Na why I dey perturb, like many Nigerians, say for virtual meeting last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari don yarn say di United States consider relocating di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey presently based for di southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
E dey presumed say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, e be breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State
Di meeting suppose be wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go transmit di details aftawards to di president
Yes, America be superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and e suppose follow strictly for all circumstances.
Understandably, Nigeria dey face plenti internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best efforts of goment and di nation security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for North West, farmers/herders clashes all over di kontri and di targeted killing of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians coupled wit di destruction of institutional buildings for South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity wey dey ravaging di kontri.
But even for dat, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigerian soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria no dey justified.
Africom na one of nine commands by di American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis commands, particularly those wey dey outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern themselves wit di security and law enforcement issues of dia area of coverage.
Dem no dey do am wen dis issues directly affect American interests for di area and for dis situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies.
If Africom dey set up for Nigeria for example, e go be island of im own restricting access to Nigerians of all category and establishing jurisdiction within di territorial area of di base wey go be virtually off limits to Nigeria security and law enforcement agencies.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of act of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa follow awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa sterling record of peace keeping around di world.
Africom's precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria strategic interests for Africa
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make many secret and open visits to a number of African kontris to sell di idea
But bikos Nigeria be di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no dey far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na to be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though e dey tout as initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocols dey unmistakably military and strategically targeted for Nigeria.
E dey mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to see di Americans trying to butt into area wey dey consider im exclusive sphere of influence, di ACRI concept dey review
For di review, wey draw di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey dey midwifed by di American congress for secret session, di Americans consider and realise di need to set up African command to add to di oda command wey dey for place wey dey cover di different continents of di world.
Thus based on di recommendations of dis assemblage of experts wey dey from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom dey set up by di Bush Junior administration wit a wider mandate no just to contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on di growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom go be Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), based for Florida, na to Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), based for Stuttgart, Germany, na to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based for Florida, na to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Nigeria don dey surrounded by French military presence for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans get drone base for Niger
Adding Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America
Bearing in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent of lettin in di wolf into di chicken coop
Na nothing for di present insecurity challenges wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for dat kontri from long logistical supply line thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldiers wey distinguish dem for dat operation.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, wey fall from di high standards wey dem know, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military get di capacity and capability to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dem dey so willing
But even say awa circumstances dey arm-twisted into hosting di Africom in view of im antecedents and implications to awa strategic interests, for awa soil.
Despite challenges, Plateau target 7m metric ton of Irish potato
Plateau State na Nigeria's number one grower of Irish potato wit di tuber wey dem currently produce for nine of di state 17 local goment area.
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative peg Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri wit kontri like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin among odas wey dey receive large supply of potato from Nigeria.
Di large potato production from Plateau State, according to PotatoPROcom, wey be leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth biggest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say inadequate dams and road network, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farmin inputs continue to pose major setback for di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export.
Some challenges wey dey contributing to low yields and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wilt as well as poor seedlings
Accordin to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 poorest states for Nigeria wit over 70% poverty rate.
Di state get comparative advantage to boost economic activities by improving di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain
Di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say though di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment areas of Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di state's potato hub.
Dem produce more potatoes pass any LGA wey dey di kontri
Muopshin tok say adaptability research indicate say di state's remaining eight LGAs dey equally viable to produce potato; make all of Plateau's 17 LGA potential to produce di tuber, especially for dry season.
Di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state, however, tok say unless challenges wey dey affect di value chain dey address squarely, increased production and export for potato go continue to elude di nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for interview wit Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor road and high cost of farm inputs, continue to affect potato outputs.
E tok say di cost of mechanised farming wey fit rapidly increase productivity don dey expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers wey no fit afford mechanization
One farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water for dry season affect potato farmers and lead to annual low yield
She tok say, di majority of farmers dey search for borehole locations to farm to access irrigation water for dia farms
Martha explain also say di high cost of fertiliser prevent many farmers to improve quantity and quality of yield, adding say insufficient fertiliser affect di crop output.
Di cost dey prevent many of us from expanding di business
So, getting fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes
If di water no dey sufficient for di crop, e go dry and e go die and na why some farmers wey get di resources prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu purposely for irrigation bikos, without am, dry season farming dey difficult. She tok.

Production go reach 7million metric ton afta lab completion
With Plateau State's potato production increase from 1,656,650 metric tons for 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons for 2020, di establishment of di Potato Value Chain Support Project and di construction of di tissue culture lab dey expected to cause di tripling of production to over seven million metric tons by di end of 2021.
Di Monitoring and Evaluating officer of di state's Potato Value Chain Support Project, Baleri Yakubu, tell Daily Trust say di state suppose start production of six million metric tons of potato annually afta di tissue culture lab dey complete for di end of 2021 but e express optimism say production fit exceed seven million metric tons annually.
Yakubu, however, tok say di state goment suppose tackle oda challenges wey farmers face especially those of fertiliser as well as more dams and road networks while farmers dey expect to properly apply potato farming regulations to achieve di expected target.
Awa correspondent gather say di tissue culture lab, wey dey intended to improve potato yields for di state by providing clean seed wey dey resistant to pests and oda potato-related diseases, go begin operation fully for few months.
Yakubu tok say di advent of di lab go certainly improve income for farmers and revenue for di state goment while also dey aid food security effort for di kontri.
Farmers for Plateau State, however, believe say di tissue lab, if fully equipped, go reduce di cost of treatment for di crop wen dem dey affect any disease.
Dem also hope say beta quality seed go dey available for affordable price
FG no go return £4.2m Ibori loot to Delta Accountant General
Di Office of di Accountant General of di Federation (OAGF) reveal Wednesday say di Federal goment no return di £4.2 million loot wey dem recover from former Governor James Ibori to Delta goment.
Di moni still dey awaited afta which di issues wey dey around am go resolve before further action dey take
For now, no money don return to Delta State, a statement from di Office, wey dem sign by di Director of Information, Press and Public Relations, Henshaw Ogubike, reveal
Di statement tok say di issue of di £4.2million Ibori loot no dey properly resolved
On di previous comment of di Accountant General to di National Assembly say di loot don return to Delta goment, Henshaw Ogubike tok say di AGF no dey make general comment about recoveries wey dey relating to State goment
Hardcore Super League trio defiant against UEFA coercion
Super League trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus insist on Wednesday say dem remain committed to modernising football despite UEFA's threats of disciplinary action.
UEFA on Tuesday open formal disciplinary proceedings against di three club wey still dey refuse to give up di aborted Super League project.
For one joint statement, Italian's Juventus and di two Spanish sides tok say dem remain committed to modernising football through open dialogue wit UEFA.
FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express dia absolute rejection of di insistent coercion wey UEFA don maintain towards three of di most relevant institutions for di history of football, di statement read
Dis alarming attitude constitute flagrant breach of di decision of di court of justice, wey don already make clear statement warning UEFA say make dem no take any action wey fit penalise di founding club of di Super League while di legal proceedings dey ongoing.
Therefore, di opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA dey incomprehensible and na direct attack against di rule of law wey we, di citizens of di European Union, don build up, while dey constitute lack of respect toward di authority of di courts of justice themselves.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey be popularly known as hushpuppi arrest for June 2020 for Dubai for alleged money laundering from business email compromise fraud and oda scam wey target firms and English premier league club.
E make total sum of $435 million afta e defraud 1,926,400 victims
A year afta, Abidemi Rufai (also known as Sandy Tangâ), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun don arrest by di Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for John F Kennedy Airport, New York ova criminal complaint wey defraud Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di stolen fund na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fit suffer job loss as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau start to track di alleged fraudster wey go dey for Nigeria's Federal House of Representative make law if e no lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Di fraud dey perpetrate by stealing di identities of more dan 100 Washington residents by filing falsified claim wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem steal, separate e-mail account dey create so dat di claim go dey associated wit different pipo and e fit escape automatic fraud detection systems.
Dem pay more dan $288,000 into hin American bank account between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime na global threat to individuals, organisations and kontris
Nigeria lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes annually
By di end of 2021, di world go lose a total of $6 trillion
To date, ova 40 Nigerians don dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI.
Rufai's alleged unemployment benefit fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Dis na fraudulent scams wey dey leveraging on di loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisation.
During di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals pattern dia fraud along di interventions from goment and private sectors and scam many and some of dis scheme still dey exist till date.
Na Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among odas
As dem dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngsters dey do am for inside Nigeria
Dem dey regularly arrest dem, tried and convicted by di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
Understanding di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment in fight di crime
Di family na microcosm of di larger society
Na di place wey normal human being dey expect to dey nurture for di society
Apart from di fact say plenti Nigerian families dey inside di dungeon of poverty and dem no fit take care of dia pikin, some of dis children don become breadwinners, albeit, illegitimately
E dey challenge wit ethic behaviour training for plenti homes as parents dey arrest alongside dia pikin wey dey involve for cyber-criminality
E dey where, mothers of yahoo-boys dey form associations to celebrate dia son success and justify dia criminal behaviour
For di religion setting, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalists create house and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Na viral video wey dem show some boys wey dey spray money while di captive members of di church, led by dia female youth wing record di shameful scene
A child wey born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don be 21 years old
Sadly, dem grew up to appreciate lying as way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many case from home) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and no fulfil or jettison di campaign promises.
Lying eself na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism
Youths dey daily dey socialise to corruption and fraud by pipo wey dey hold public offices
Dem see how dia systems dey provide soft landing for fraudulent pipo (public or private).
Do dem ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don fully investigate and discharge wit punishment wen di accused dey find guilty?
Di majority of di case end wit off-the-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as family affair
Di youth see flamboyant lifestyle wey dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how poor political aspirants transform into millionaires inside months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institutions don become cash and carry for awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, award undeserving honours for exchange for moni
All di pipo wey mismanage funds dey provide soft landing
Added to dis list of cultures wey dey nurture cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work and game wey evriwia dey involve in and no be crime.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, go dem make law against di crime wey dem dey involve in?
Di process wey dey give party nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need review if we go stop importing problematic tokunbo products into awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey lower wen money dey dangled for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for dubious character to cover up dia track and awa society dey worse off through dia action
greed also dey nurture cyber-criminality
Donald Voiret wey be FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dis defendant allege affect all taxpayers
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and expect grace to abound
Nigeria must sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey track lifestyle wit material accumulations
We must give di youth hope for Nigeria by create employment opportunities, reduce poverty and review reward systems.
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di Commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspects as di FBI do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbas hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang
Unless di culture wey dey sustain cybercrimes for Nigeria dey tackle through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to fester

Fresh crisis for Lagos PDP over LG polls
A fresh crisis dey brew for di Lagos State chapter of di Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ova di release of guidelines for di conduct of di local goment election by di state Chairman, Engr Deji Doherty.

Di executive member wey tok on condition of anonymity tok say di position of di aggrieved members go dey public for di week, insisting say key members of di executive dey sidelined
How e feel to give birth for di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, new life bring happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, new morning, two red line change my life
I dey pregnant and happy
E be amazing start to new year
E be di most remarkable year of my life
All of a sudden, evrithin change
My daughter Roshomon Tara na hin born for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she na nine months old
She be di reason wey I become mother for di middle of global crisis
E no be only her wey be born, but e also be new me, mother of Tara, wey spend an entire pregnancy for lockdown for house and give birth for emergency condition inside di emergency.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
Her grandmothers dey afraid to hold her or kom closer to her without wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey into motherhood go dey completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter dey front of me, smiling and staring at me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
Di only thing wey no change, meanwhile, na di pandemic
I be 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic struck, and di planet go into lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical change
Those 22 weeks no be war
My husband Sina Hasan na musician, and all hin concerts dey cancel for dat time
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
So, we dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and spend all my savings
our parents and two journalist association kom forward to help for di time wey dey.
I dey afraid of evrithin
Most of di time, na death
Dem dey knock for di door
I dey adapt to new online life wia we click and get awa things home-delivered
I need wait for a week to get groceries delivered dis way
I dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me my husband go outside and buy food for storage
Thus, I dey eat less
Besides, I no fit go for my scheduled antenatal check-ups
And I no sabi if my baby dey grow healthy or all development dey take place timely
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring her into a more different world than ever
Tele-medication help me pass some hard time for di last trimister
I forgot my gynaecologist face
I no fit remember how she look wit di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help
plenti information dey floating around
For dis chaos of information, experienced mothers, my mother, and mother-in-law fit only help me by supporting me and no meet me for person wen I dey pregnant
Traditionally, experienced mothers and mostly older women for di family help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get plenty panic attack bikos of lack of information and understanding
So, I dug for di experience of new mothers wey give birth for dis time
I find social media as lifeline
I read plenti exciting experiences on social media as I follow group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic.
Different media groups for dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers by sharing dia experience and information during di lockdown
One of dis groups help me find health care facility wey go do emergency ultrasound afta heavy bleeding during di lockdown
One group help me curb my anxiety for pregnancy and post-partum depression
I dey upset say I no fit meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share di joy of welcoming new member for di family
My daughter na August 25, 2020, for di same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, wey I born decades ago
And she meet anoda pikin for person wen she be four months old on December 31, 2020, wen Tara and her father go go di rooftop wit me to see di fireworks
One family wey get two pikin, apparently my next-door neighbour wey I meet di first time, kom go there say goodbye to 2020.
E dey gift, considering di recent statistics of increased Covid-19 cases.
Wen news of death dey evriwia, di new life bring happiness and let hope thrive
For mothers, e no less pass win war by give birth to a child for pandemic and take care of di infant all alone, confirming di highest safety for dia child
Socially, emotionally, and physically, dis time fit dey challengin

thank my baby, my daughter, for whom I be mother and successful fighter wey survive dis pandemic

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make some far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dey now famously referred to as di Asaba Declaration.
Di meeting wey dey kom on di heels of worsening insecurity for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending menace of murderous herdsmen don generate nationwide attention.
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meeting and di unanimity wey di 17 governors show show say dem meant serious business
Di restructuring wey dey within di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing form di core of di declaration.
Major highlights include di clamour for state police, devolution of powers, review of revenue formula for favour of federating units and di need for national dialogue to discuss di national question.
As di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and dey contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions dey actually cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on True Federalism make far-reaching recommendations.
One go expect di leading lights of APC to take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti to kick-start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempts to play to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of powers, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula for favour of federating units among odas.
President Buhari don give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010
For di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose grave challenges, dis twin sectors suppose receive di utmost attention, concurrently.
Despite di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we no go make sufficient effort to translate dat to improve standard of living for di majority of awa citizens.
our annual budget of about $35 billion, for example, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di needs of 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programme wey reach 17m of im population
Di efforts of Buhari administration, though novel and commendable, still represent drop for an ocean and e no dey adequate to make di required impact.
Dis na wia devolution of power and resource control kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business wey dey stay a day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all state wey dey di kontri get commercially viable natural resources wey fit exploit to create wealth and generate di need foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wey state kom cap for hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey breed indolence, runs contrary to di principle of true federalism.
As di El-Rufai committee tok, di revenue formula suppose revise in favour of state since more responsibilities go dey add to dem
For state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excesses by governors dey understandable, but like Richie Norton tok say to escape fear, you need go through am, no go around am
For too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force wey no be only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum.
Like Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey time don kom
We need address awa fears and overkom am
One of di way wey fit do na by enacting legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments wey go allow State Police.
E go dey similar for functions to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but get wider power to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban on open grazing though di governors dey rest no new and form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey di National Executive Council (NEC) approve.
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tok say NLTP be Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and to lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers.
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so dat we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.
Di convocation of National Dialogue, one major demand of di Asaba declaration no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendations of di Gov. El-Rufai APC committee on True Federalism.
Both report make far-reaching recommendations say awa elected governors and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of waste scarce resources on anoda jamboree.
On di issue of separatist agitations, e suppose be modalities for convening referendum wey dem set out for di constitution.
E dey almost certain say plenti Nigerians wan live together, awa differences, notwithstanding
Doing dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evriwi patriotic Nigerian.
Though we get challenge like evri oda kontri, we must listen to awasef, like US President Joe Biden often tok
Tomori dey reside for Abuja
Two officers kill as IPOB militants set Anambra police station on fire
Baraly 24 hours afta di new commissioner of Police for Anambra, Christopher Adetokumbo Owolabi, resume duty, gunmen attack Obosi Police Station for Idemili North local goment area of di state and kill two officers

Na even as Nigeria express concerns ova di incidence of illicit financial flows from developin to develop economies of di world.

Jigawa's mechanised farm to benefit local farmers
Di Malam Alu Agro Allied Company, wey dey sit on 100 hectare land for Faru village, along Maiduguri road, Birnin Kudu Local Goment Area of Jigawa State, dey change di perception of mechanised farming for Nigeria, Mansur Dau Aliyu, di company Group General Manager (GGM) tok.
Di establishment of di farm almost five years ago, na direct response to di call by di President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for Nigerians to return to agriculture as di mainstay of di nation's economy, rather than relying solely on oil as di only source of revenue for di kontri.
Each cattle get number tag wey dey attached to im ear
Di company's founder, Farouk Adamu Aliyu, wey be former member of di House of Representatives key into dis, di GGM add.
We dey do greenhouse farming
We get 10,000 square-metre fully automatic soilless greenhouse, wia we dey produce tomatoes
We get two 250 square-metre greenhouses wey we dey produce oda greenhouse vegetables, and anoda 500 square-metre greenhouse wey dem dey use as nursery
Dis greenhouses dey all foreign-oriented, wey dem don install to produce variety of vegetables
We produce only tomatoes from 10,000 square automated soilless greenhouses; and we produce average of 10 to 11 tons of tomatoes evri week
We get anoda 10,000 square-metre locally fabricated greenhouse
He tok say we get livestock section, wia we get about 300 herds of cattle, some camels, goats and sheep
Daily Trust gather say di farm get fishery unit, wit about 50,000 fishes inside di pond
Similarly, a forty-ton per hour fertilizer blendin plant wey dem install earlier for di year, dem gather, now produce close to 300 loads of NPK fertilizer under di Presidential Fertilizer Initiative.
We don import equipment for di installation of 120,000 capacity poultry system
Mansur tok say we hope to dey produce between 3,000-4,000 crates of eggs daily.
Di farm, e tok say, also get diary production plant, wey dey for di production of about 2,000 litres of milk a day, adding say na about 150-200 hectares of land wey dey for open field farming for real cultivation of rice and oda crops.
Mansur tok say di major customer for di tomato na premium customers, notably big hotels for Abuja, Lagos, and oda locations
E confirm, however, say di main market for di products dey mainly for di eastern part of di kontri, like Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri
E tok, however, say apart from di few customers wey dey Kano, dia tomato products dey rarely see for di local market for some reason.
First na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na special species and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producin area
You know say tomato na common product wey dey around here, so awa price dey a little higher pass wetin we dey obtain normally for open market
So, essentially, pipo no dey look at us, dey feel apprehensive of wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen you get product wey dey commonly available, pipo go surely go for di cheaper brand
A farm hand feed di fish
E tok say if you give di tomato all e require, I mean nutritional supplements wey you feed am wit while e dey grow, if you give am all di things, dis tomato fit last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even without dat, e last for a minimum of a week, no under any refrigeration, but surely no under intense pressure and heat
You fit keep am for table wia you get good ventilation
E fit last 10 days, but wit all nutrients wey dem need, e fit last up to one month
Dis we don experiment, but then, you no get am as you dey want am
Di farm dey also source of employment for as many as 200 pipo for di village wey dem dey locate
E also tok say di company get some pipo wey go train di youth for di area on information technology skills
E further tok say most of di equipment wey dem dey use for di farm na from Turkey, except di fertilizer-blending machine wey dem import from China
Even di farmin method dey model afta di Turkish style of operation bikos we get Turkish partner wey dey help maintain di standards, but quickly add say di company dey conscious of di need to get Nigerians run di technical aspect of im operations.
Reflecting on di effect of COVID-19 on di operations of di company, Mansur tok say Malam Alu, just like oda corporate entity wey dey di kontri, suffer from di devastating effect of di virus.
For Mansur, youths for Nigeria no get excuse to remain unemployed wit di opportunity wey agriculture provide, note say those wey dey hope to secure white-collar job suppose adjust to di reality and go back to agriculture.
E believe say Nigeria don do wetin e suppose do long time ago, note say if di kontri don take dis step, di current economic crisis go don averted

3 Africans, no Nigerian as City, Chelsea contest UEFA Champions League finals
Without doubt, enthusiastic football fans for Nigeria dey eagerly wait tonights finals of di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals wey dem go contest between two English club, Manchester City and Chelsea for di Estadio do Dragao, Porto for Portugal.
For view of di fact say di UEFA Champions League na one of di world's biggest football competitions only next to FIFA World Cup and di Olympics football event, increasing level of expectations as di giants of di English Premier League get set to tussle for di prestigious diadem.
Manchester City no go win Champions League title, Chelsea don win dia first and only title so far for 2012.
Even as football pundits don tipp City wey don win dia seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea go kom into di contest wit better credentials.
Dem be former champion
As Thomas Tuchel wey lead di Chelsea technical crew no get Champions League victory, hin opponent for Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner
E win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
Therefore, e dey plenti to expect from di actors wey go dey out for di field of Estadio
Do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey charge di technical area
Interestingly, even as both contestants dey parade only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) African interest for di final don drop
Here for Nigerian wia Chelsea and Manchester City enjoy large following from passionate football fans, expectations don reach feverish point, leading to interesting re-alignments
fans of di European club wey dem eliminate from Champions League for different stage don re-align themselves wit Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interests.
Consequently, di finals na one of di most discussed topics for sporting circles for Nigeria at di moment as fans of di Premiership club continue to predict wetin go be di final result.
As almost evriwia dey wait to savour di football artistry wey go dey on display, some pundits dey worried by di increasing decline for di number of African players for di finals of one of di biggest football competitions for earth.
Going by di history of di UEFA Champions League, only 24 African footballers don contest and win di trophy wit dia European club
Sadly African football legend like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote World Footballer of di year for 1995
Nigeria Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt failed to win di Champions League even say dia football prowess.
As Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey on top di big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey don win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
E achieve di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
E follow am by Algeria legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
Duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995
E dey record say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon na di first African to win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan
Di oda African winners of di highly coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
Coming closer home, di last time Nigerian win di trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea for di expense of Bayern Munich
Afta dat achievement by di former captain of di Super Eagles, Nigeria don see di rise of oda talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
But none dey yet feature for di finals of Europe's biggest club competition
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched
Di competition dey dominated by di top five club for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool
Unfortunately, Nigerian players don over di years failed to get into dis highly rated European club
E be, therefore, di hope of Nigerian football stakeholders say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all barriers and begin to play for club wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, football fans for Nigeria go continue to live wit di agony of watching finals of di UEFA Champions League kom and go witout di presence of any Nigerian player
As Nigerians wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition di way find George, Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea's Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English club finals dey few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner
