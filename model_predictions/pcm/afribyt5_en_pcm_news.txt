We, derefore, state witout equivocation say IPOB no know anything about di assassination.
For di first place, wetin threat di late Gulak constitute to awa kos to warrant hin elimination
We no get anything wey dey common wit am and we no fit kill am
Pointing accusing fingers at IPOB for dis barbaric act na only suppose divert attention away from di real masterminds
Dis na di same way terrorists for security uniform commit various atrocities for South East and turn around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global republic.

To end Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: Di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement one National Livestock Transformation Plan wey go seek to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and e go fit curb di movement of cattl
As di plan don get di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges.
Deficient political leadership, popular misperception about hin purpose, budgetary constraints wey COVID-19 pandemic aggravate, lack of personnel wit di expertise
If di Plan fail as di previous initiative to modernise livestock management do, herder-farmer violence fit escalate
As di National Economic Council approve for January 2019, di Plan represent di most comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming economy
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers
E dey animate by di hope say over a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves.
By di end of 2028, authorities go aim to get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all di states wey dey participate, creating ova two million jobs for di livestock production, processing producti

Plenti states don reactivate early demarcated grazing reserves wey dem demarcate, open offices and set up steering committees wey go dey administer di Plan
Authorities don also hold workshops and don do oda work to explain di benefits of livestock reform to plenti pipo.
But two years inside di 10-year plan, dem neva build di first new ranch, and di obstacles dey plenti
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers wey resent di Plan benefit to pastoralists, hinder reform effort
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent disputes ova land between herders and farmers, notwitstanding peacemaking and military efforts.
Federal and state budget dey pinch, partly bikos of di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri no get sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey scare away potential criminals.
Unless dem address, dis and oda problems fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, leaving di kontri vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit dey vulnerable to an escalation of herder-
To tackle dis challenges require concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors
First, Abuja and supportive state goment suppose provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about Nigeria.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey go ask dem make dem change one century old nomadic lifestyle, and wey legitimately doubt di Plan promise about available life.
But plenti farmers dey fear say dem fit lose land to livestock producers
Many pipo for di Middle Belt and southern states dey dey deeply suspicious of di Plan long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, dem dey see di plan long-term
Wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment go need build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production, dairy production

Plus, authorities go need consider climate change wey dey impact and reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey cross inside Nigeria seasonally should or should or should or should or should
While some of dis steps go take time, di Plan proponent suppose focus on to deliver concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.
Less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election.
If di plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians fit need to produce clear proof of hin benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari wey don serve for two terms, Preside
Ideally, by di time wey campaigning dey heat up for late 2022, di Plan backers suppose point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated researches
Nobodi of dis go dey easy, but di plan dey worth di effort
As e dey far from perfect, e offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of both herders and small-scale farmers
About 70 per cent of Nigeria workforce dey earn income through agriculture

Subsistence farmers na smallholders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and dem dey held back from participating more actively in commercially oriented agriculture sectors.
No energy for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own/ mine
Dis bring me to di conclusion say evrione na evil
Dem don characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey generally small, dem dey hold under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey for marginal or risk-prone environment
Yield dey low and farmers no get capacity to increase yield
We tok life and prosperity to dis day

Di emphasis now na on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farming as an enterprise
I know evrithin

Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce so dem go allow dem buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor service
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for di agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer dey high so many smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some places, di price go high as N13,000 for a 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 go rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey reach N25,000

How North-Central goment fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy dey trend for di public domain, wit Southern governors dey slam ban on am durin dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association (FEA), tok say dem go
Recently, di Southern state governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminality.
Wetin be your take on di controversy wey dey generate by dis decision?
Evri human being get right to do action and opinion
But di thing wey important pass be say once you take your action, you suppose dey aware of di consequences
You suppose consider di advantages and disadvantages
I no be one of dose wey tok say e dey good or bad
As a Nigerian, you get di right and liberty to live anywia for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association
On dis basis, I no go tok say na good thing
But as a leader for North Central, I go tok say e be good thing, especially for di North Central Zone, bikos of di potential economic benefit for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am kom see how we fit make am real venture and make moni from am
Luckily for us, we get landmass wey enough to accommodate di herders, no matta di number wey fit troop from di South into di North Central
Na wetin be your position on open grazing?
I no be one of di propagators of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practice as an individual
I believe say if we take ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme for ranching
Dat kind move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo fit get access to cattle and all di allied products
And den e bikom means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
Look Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
We fit conveniently accommodate di herders and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey di Fulani herders pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di problem be say dem no dey educate dem on top dia advantages
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem need dey educated to embrace ranching
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia nearly all di families get ranch and you no see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey make case for?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regard
Dem no dey call for ranching and make di federal goment kom in
Wetin dem dey simply tok be say di herders don bikom problem to us and make we go away
Dem tok say make di herders apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But dem don ask dia indigenes make dem apply for land like di herders?
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programmes, especially for di agricultural sector and dia value chains, why some government policy dey fail to realise say dem no dey realise say
Firstly, no administration wey don touch di lives of pipo like President Muhammadu Buhari administration wia you fit conveniently sit
Di targeted credit facility wey dem target as COVID-19 loan
Plenti Nigerians don conveniently get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dia house witout even go office
Also, wit SMEs wey dey expand like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di wahala be say we get two side of pipo wey go believe in you and pipo wey go criticise you
For dose wey no believe for Buhari's administration, nothing dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am

As dem pass dis Bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbaja, wey be distinguished and able leadersh
And dis also attest to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of Government in di fight against corruption for di fight against corrupti
E dey wit great delight and deep sense of gratitude say I write dis, wey dem don put togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know say make we dey know
Afta di passage of dis Bill by di Senate, and in view of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, under di constitution of di legislatu
Femi Gbajabiamila, di hon
Speaker, follow di suit and pass di Bill for Wednesday 19th of May, 2021.
As you fit know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don dey one of di most viciously vicious pipo for Nigeria
Sadly di attack kom from dose wey suppose be partners in progress in di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but dem don designate demsef as enemies
Good no get substitute so e no get bad
No mata how long e take, good dey always prevail ova bad just as di superiority of light over darkness dey constant and unquestionable.
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e don apun for di National Assembly
Interestingly, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na hin first pass into law by di 9th Senate on top di forensic and Investigative
E dey very important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be noble bodi but novel one for Nigeria wey dey target to bridge di gap wey don dey exist long time
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria don dey at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge di few anti-government activities wey dey do foren
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national efforts wey dem gear for Nigeria.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, koming for a time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislative bold
Dat go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe.
As all of us know, crime generally, don assume new dimension, bikos of advancement for science and technology for di 21st century.
Therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey apt and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging economies
E dey apposite to also tok say di journey, wey culminate into di passage of dis Bill, began for di 8th National Assembly wia dem sponsor awa Bill
For di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers for di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings by di relevants of di relevants of di National Assembly
Afta and afta and in spite of opposition from stakeholders wey dey di minority, led by di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), di National Assembly present di statement of di Nigeria
Afterward, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give am before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
Na di strength of dis, say dem re-introduce di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, dem sponsor am by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Kanu.
We dey constrained to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors propel say dem reject awa Bill
Also worthy to mention be di fact say dem don mistake awa Bill for similar Bills, wey dem recently introduce for both di Senate and House of Representatives recently.
Dis Bills, upon awa close scrutiny, we discover say dem be duplications of di intent and purports of awa Bill.
Dem suppose stress am say none of dis Bills dem introduce for di 8th National Assembly, oda dan awa Bill.
As such, we be di first to eva kom up wit Bill of dis magnitude,(Forensic)
having seen di urgent need to establish dat kind great institute
Dem take di decision to establish di Institute afta one painstakin study of how di Institute dey operate for oda jurisdiction and how well dem don help for crime detention.
E dey instructive to note say awa Institute don dey since 2009
And over di years, we don train professionals for di field of forensic science and technology, wey dey targeted at inculcating di requisite skils and acumen in di pragmatic science.
Forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, weda na error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and communication technology
Una go agree wit me say for today's world, di conventional ways of investigating crimes, wit a view to fighting e don bikom obsolete
For us as a nation to do something wey meaningful for dis regard, e dey paramount say we align awasef wit di global trend and emerging innovations, wey dey targeted for di world.
E dey in line wit dis reasonin say dem conceive di idea to establish dis institute wit well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption programme wey dey relevant to di anti-
Time no go permit me to highlight all di objectives of di Bill here.
Howeva, I wan crave your indulgence to highlight a few of di objectives of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follow:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria so we go fit develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field, through studies wey dem dey specialize
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in di usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques for di investigation.
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners for di field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and as well develop strong professional standar
To fill di big vacuum wey dey for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of unique operation of forensic science wey go help di counterprofessional counterprofession
To develop broad-based mechanism and trainin programme wey go cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, wey go involve professionals like Lawyers, Criminal Association, Professional
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms, through di provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals.
From di foregoing, e dey apparent say di role of dis institute dey strategic and important
E dey pertinent to reiterate say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and di attainment of information
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, include but no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensic investigation; digital fo
Accordingly, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, one unique concept of crime detection and investigation wey dey conform wit international best practice for detection and invest
Dis concept dey far beyond di reasoning of those whose myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don becloud dia senses of reasoning, bikos of narrow-mindedness and di purport of awa Bill
On a different note, I wish to draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be source of concern for all of us.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountancy and Investigative Professional
Howeva, upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and having seen di overwhelming and accelerated legislative support, awa Bill don receive di overwhelming and accelerated le
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and past, wia ICAN dey hold di view say any institute wey dey oda than dias to regulate di practice of foreign medicine
your answer dey good pass mine
I wan also inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) no left out of dis funny theatrical episode
Just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don also introduce Bill for di House of Representatives wit di nomenclature wey di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Institute of Forensic and Certifie
I decide to bring out all dis facts so dat Nigerians and even di international community go understand di extent to which some pipo fit go in order to achieve dia goals.
Howeva, we no dey perturbed by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed di Presidency to do wetin dey right
Di known practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN bikos of reason wey dey obvious
Dem engage plenti bystanders to dey write frivolous petitions, some even target am for di leadership of di Senate wit a tone of blackmail
Afta dem fail woefully for di senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all manner of publication
Again, dem fail
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill wey dem don pass by di Senate go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observation dey.
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fight di passage of di bill until truth prevail and for di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Charter of National Association of Nigeri
ICAN don register hin Bill for di House of Representatives wey dem call (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICAN ACT)
Dis ICAN new Bill get full of provision for practice of forensic, and also say dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria and witout which nobodi fit practice
Dis sound so strange for a kontri wey dey full of pipo wey dey enlightened
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
No mata di level of corruption derein
We don already challenge di passage of di bills by di House of Representatives
Make we note am say, awa wey dey challenge di bill no dey born out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey certain say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential election.
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians make dem deceive dia antics
You go remember how ICAN vehemently oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of dia sponsored publication by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by di Association of professional B
Olumuyiwa Alade for di 24th of May, 2019 don make big effort to tok say ICAN under hin enablin law dey empowered to practice Forensics and derefore for CIFIPN Bill to be am.
Di question be, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dey now seek for im re-enactment
As always, while we no dey opposed to any group wey dey propose di inclusion of forensics for hin law, we dey howeva concerned say make a bodi no try to perpetuate imself
ICAN and im cohorts don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so dem wan get bodi within itself
Wetin dem dey scare of na check and balance, dem no go want anoda professional bodi make dem investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di state.
How dem fit be judge for dia own case
Dis sound too strange
On dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly make dem beware of di antics of dis groups, dem no fit dey tok from both side of dia mouth and make dem expect di National Assembly
We wan yet again appreciate di doggedness of di 9th Assembly in ensuring say dem pass di Bill, di Nigerian pipo dey more dan ever before convinced of di reason wey dem don pass di Bill.
We dey confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no go hesitate to assent to dis Bill as soon as e go get to hin desk
We dey call all Nigerians make dem kom and be part of di Forensics profession
Di profession dey open for all professionals for various field of endeavours
Training arm of di institute dey wey go studiously guide you and equip you
I wish to thank you all and to also reiterate our resolve and commitment to uphold ethical standards in line wit global best practices, in rendering our professional professional professional service
I wish appeal to all stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians make dem support dis noble course and make dem implore us all to make frantic efforts so dat collectively, we fit support dis noble course

Between DSS and regional separatists
Repeated warnings by di DSS to persons and groups wey dey utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and di ethno-religious environmen
Di question wey dey linger about who or which person and group wey di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourized inside di heated rhetorical outbursts of di nation's securities.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E dawn on all dat indeed na di persons and groups wey don continue to dey incite, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens
Interestingly, none of dis prime suspects for di exploitation of some fault lines wey kos ethno-religious violence for some parts of di kontri fit categorically disappoint
Dem chorus common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, different only for di respective direction of dia accusing fingers
While Afenifere retort say dis pipo know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but dem no fit touch dem bikos of dia connection, PANDEV rehash hin grouse about making dem dey tok about making dem
So tey di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, make dem dey proactive in dealing wit dem
Di NEF sound dey unconvinced wit if pipo wey dey push di kontri into deeper crises and dem don know dem; make dem treat dem according to di law
Una no need be spook to know wetin di DSS know about each and all of dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say dem dey all know say dem dey all know sa
Di truth be say dis champions of ethnic politics know of no beta solution to Nigeria's myriad problems pass for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs wey go lord am over all di years.
So desperate and unscrupulous are dem in pursuing dia inordinate ambitions wey dem absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria
Ambition-powered mind games dey intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all wetin e take to excise di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied earthquake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups restlessly under di political restlessly under
Dis regional group dey actually constitute major hindrance to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag independence.
For as long as dem dey continue to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long dem go regard Nigeria as entitlement for dia ethnic stake in di popular economy
Weneva dem meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria's progress and development, unless hin leadership dey firmly in dia grasp, odawise e dey all about heckling and jostling am.
Weda na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and democracy.
Anoda indictment wey dis regional separatists get be say na self-styled political pressure groups wey dey masquerade as representatives of various ethnic groups wey dey represent different ethnic gro
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consist of ex-dis one
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di impetus to kom togeda, desperate to remain relevant for democratic system wey dey run by elected representatives

Double jeopardy describe di predicament of di Buhari administration say dem need contend wit such array of formidable foes unleashing incessant assaults on national interest
To dat extent, only two group of politicians fit be: those wey dey positively participate for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward
By dia utterance and activity, we all know dem
For di end of di day, di majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens whose condition of survival no dey determined by and no dependent on di geography of dia origin
Dia daily struggle to eke living dey sustained by submission to di will of One God irrespective of difference of faith
Nigeria na dia destined fatherland to which dem remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing say dem no get oda kontri wey dem call dias, collectively show how civilisation dey dey for Nigeria
Dem too know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to inciting, unguarded pipo wey dey Nigeria
Na so di poor man's prayer remains:

Wetin to no wear for public: to negate Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Be e pure coincidence say, as trouble dey brew for Kwara State recently, dem dey consider a solution to its kind for di lower House of di National Assembly in the state of Nigeria.
Di trouble for Ilorin na ova di refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow dia Muslim students wear hijab go school
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tag Hijab Bill by section of di Nigerian media.
Both events don spark heated and often emotional debates wey dey threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.
Di whole idea for Kwara of di proprietors of di schools wey dey ban hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathisers dem fit reduce to wetin to wear for public
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Dem dey face female Nigerians bikos of wetin dem wear for public
Di former dey clearly in breach of di fundamental human rights of di Muslim students make dem express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get dia different different statement
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only for Muslims but also Christians wiaeva or weneva dem dey threaten dem wit discrimination based on dia professed faith.
As dem dey run through di argument of di proprietors of di Christian faith schools for Kwara, person fit understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children no get problem
Di problem wey dey dis argument dey plenti
First, to tok say Muslim students suppose go elsewia unless dem conform to di school's rule on uniform do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of our society.
Secondly, di position beg di moral question: is e justifiable to base school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature of di school?
Den, thirdly, di go elsewia argument dey ignore di difficulties wey dey change school for pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act to dey change school for pikin, educational psychologist go tell you, dey interfer negatively wit no be only em emotional but academic development too
Finally, di Christian faith schools demsef dey risk wetin dem call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate students wit di same religious belief for particular schools
Di social cost wey dis exact on di society dey plenti
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say dia policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to dey graduate for school wey dem go
For a kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, don sign di declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question wey we dey ask na: how e dey justifiable to deny Nigeria make dem deny Nigeria
E dey great concern bikos Nigeria be signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
E contain 30 articles on rights and freedoms wey include, among odas, civil and political rights, like di right to life, free speech and privacy.
E also include economic, social and cultural rights, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey relevant to di issue wey dey under consideration and I quote dem in full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get di freedom to think or believe wetin dem want, plus di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa belief or religion for any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa chosen religion, alone or wit odas
Evrione get di right to education
Make primary schooling dey free
Make all of us continue awa studies as we wish
For school dem suppose help us develop awa talent, make dem teach understanding and respect for evribodi's human rights.
Dem suppose teach us to get on wit odas whateva dia ethnicity, religion, or kontri wey dem kom from
Awa parents get di right to choose wetin kind of school wey we dey go to
Dis type of law na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for di House of Representatives for di US wear her Hijab witout any hand.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Nigeria
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey wan address discriminatory conducts and prohibit religious discrimination wey dey concern hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors make dem discriminate against persons, students or personnel wey dey professional
Wen dem pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good
E go also address di bigotry of some employers, or dose executives wey take dia prejudice to public office and allow am to becloud dia sense of judgment
Make di law be welkome development
Afta all, na only to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria's constitution and di UDHR document wey dem explain above
E dey in line wit similar law wey dem pass recently for di kontri wey dey wan tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against Pipo Law and di Violence Aga
As disability wan eradicate all form of discrimination wey dey based on person disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri
One at a time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social menaces wey dey bedevil awa kontri through legal instruments
Dem dey address dis social ills no be bikos say prior generic law no dey cover dem but bikos say dem need address dem more comprehensively to leave no security for di society.
While UDHR fit seem like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like am dey provide to allocate punishment for offenders.
Contrary to wetin hin critics dey concern, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, nothing wey go show attempt to seek di enthronement of state religion on any state pipo.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say di government of di Federation or of a State shall no adopt any religion as State Religion
To peddle dis argument, bikos di bill dey call on di general public to respect di rights of Muslim women wey wear Hijab for public space smacks of Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian  male or female  hin or her religious freedom negate awa multicultural pretenses
E negate di concept of equality, and basic human right wey dey for Nigeria constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document
A bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimation based on religious ground, like di RDPP bill, na welkome development

Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, appeal to di state goment and Igbo leaders make dem call di police authorities rein in on dia men so as no to create crisis for di area.
Di kind pipo wey we put into police dis days make me wonder if we really want anything good out of dis kontri wey dem call Nigeria.
How persin fit dey chase newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world
If una stop pipo from reading hard copies of newspapers, una go stop dem from reading di same tori for Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, and odas?
Wetin manner of primitive policing be dis?
Dem kos panic for Sunday bikos of dia shooting and noisemaking
Di whole neighborhood think say dem dey chase kidnappers
Na later we discover say police kom arrest one vendor and readers, wey gather am for hin newspaper stand
How police fit dey fight newspaper vendors?
Wetin manner of problem wey paper fit kos say social media no fit kos 20 times ova
Hin tok say dis pipo no dey normal
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident, tok say almost all di vendor stand wey e visit for Abaja
For Tuesday dem dey empty
Hin tok say, we hear say dem dey tok for Saturday and Sunday say di newspapers dey tok on top di sit-at-home order in honour of Biafran heroes and my question be say wetin dem dey honour for Biafra
Di early political leaders for South East, remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra dey big pass IPOB na di beta for dem
Shey proscription of IPOB mean say dem don proscribe Biafra too?
Na all of us be Biafrans
On di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold zoom conversation, dem dey tok about Biafra heroes wey dey fall
Why police no fit go YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey dey air am?
Wetin dem dey do na to kom street kom start find unnecessary trouble
I wish di leaders for Igboland go warn di leaders wey dey reckless police officers make dem no allow wetin dey apun for Imo state make dem enter Aba, bikos e go be worst for evribodi
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, wey be Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), deny say di police arrest newspaper vendors and readers for Aba.
NAMA don kick as air traffic controllers dey lament poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don cry out ova dilapidated navigational equipment wey dey dilapidated for most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di aegis of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation pose threat to air safety.
Dem also claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get control tower wey go aid safe aircraft navigation.
Di President of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey exist for di Kaduna airport na watch room wey oda aviation personnel dey use and no dey no dey use oda av
Hin also tok say oda airport for di kontri lack di equipment wey dem need for navigation seamless.
E explain say some airports no get equipment wey dey function
Even Kaduna no get control tower
Wetin dem dey use der na watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build am for dat purpose, and we don dey call on di goment make dem do something
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controllers go go look for umbrellas wey go sit for di control tower, and wetin be say, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di territory wey dey attached to
We still dey battle wit terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there
Calabar dey; no airport wey you go go today dat you go say things dey work 80 per cent
NAMA don employ and train 40 new controllers, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall
Howeva, di Managing Director of di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest hugely in improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations
Hin tok say na mere politics
Di goment don spend too much for di recent past to dey improve aviation infrastructure
I no dey tok am bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always be, ask di pipo wey dey street, ask di pipo wey dey NAMA, dem go tell you, dem neva get am so good untop di area
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok dis way
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two for place, two odas dey kom
Goment just spend N1.7bn for mobile control tower
Also revitalisation dey ongoing for di safe tower
We dey revamp di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Oda sector suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communication technology particularly di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by di different barriers to cross-border
E-commerce also foster direct access to distant markets and dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and dey blur plenti of di current distinction between domestic and agricultural economy
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communication platform, all information or service wey company fit offer to customers, all information or service wey co
Di major significance of E-commerce thus lies in di fact say e dey encourage single world trading system, wey dey facilitated by access through electronic means to go go fit go fit go
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria dey lag behind towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Plenti legal research and study on e-commerce for Nigeria don do
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system lags behind ICT-based legislation and say di existing statutory laws dey quite inadequate to address infrastructure
Dis issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues and many more
Derefore, di need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern di emerging regime
Dem don tok am plenti times say for Nigeria, significant effort for di regulation of e-commerce-related activities still dey di stage of Draft Bills before di National Commission go pass di National
E dey important to note say, even wia dem pass dis bills into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Given di speed wit which di internet dey permeat commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for di banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, di best option for di best option for di
To achieve dis, di National Assembly suppose pressurise di National Assembly into pass bills wey dey about electronic commerce, di top priority na so dem fit enact dem into law as quickly.
For di interim, awa courts suppose take giant stride as dem dey interpret di existing traditional laws liberally so as to bridge di gaps derein in order to make dat kind laws better.
Indeed, dem argue am say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit facilitate electronic transaction and attendant documentation legally
Di court fit adapt to recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract.
As di then Justice Bingham once put am thus: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility [as di law merchant] to dey adapt esef to di changin needs of di changing needs
Dem dey hope say oda Nigerian judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive, especially for di areas wia awa existing legislation don exist
Dis go set good precedence to ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for Nigeria.
Di germane issue wey dey regard to contract for E-commerce na documentation and signature
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statutes on real property and landed instruments, all of us dey for di state.
Question den be say electronic mark or sign constitute valid sign-off of contract by email and be binding
Plenti of dis issues still dey settle even for UK although some decisions dey incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
So mark for email as e dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution.
E-commerce transaction na paperless transaction wey dem dey make through magnetic material like tape or disk
Dis na in contradistinction to di paper-based transactions wey dey embodied for permanent form and dey typically express in words and figures wey dem usually authenticate by di authenticator
Dem no fit alter dat kind transaction witout an alteration on di face of di document
Wit respect to signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, an electronic signature wey dey relate to data message dey conveniently satisfy any requirement wey dem dey require
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
Thus, for di purpose of establish proof of electronic signatures
Di use of password, identification, user name fit suffice
Hence one fit safely posit say electronic signatures for di purpose of execution dey admissible in evidence provided dem don certify and incorporate am for electronic computer.
Oda legal challenge wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element for valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation
Di question na for what point dem fit make offer wit regards to electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic business transaction
E-commerce dey require confidence and trust di satisfaction say dem order or invoice wey dem transmit neva alter and emanate from whoeva dem appear to be from
Need to guarantee guaranteed level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information.
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrimes for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
Electronic commerce no doubt one aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom stay for dis time
Di goment suppose go beyond dey create law, make dem activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platforms for dia commercial interaction and for delivery of government services.

Chad don pass new charter wey dey name Deby's son president
Chad don pass charter to declare Mahamat Idriss Deby president, even as rumours of hin death dey trend on social media.

Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey on Tuesday dey named transitional leader as head of military council following hin father's death
Di charter repeal di preceding constitution and dem go implement am as di basic law of di republic.
Dem don name di young Deby as supreme head of di armed forces, e tok.

Di Transition Charter, wey contain 95 articles, guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship
Dem don set up transition goment, wey di new president name di new president.
Dem discharge di members of di army wey dem call to transition goment from all military duties, di charter tok.
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for nearly 30 years, don succumb to wounds wey hin suffer wen hin dey visit to di battlefield for di kontri's north wia Chadian soldiers dey follow Chadian sol
As dem dey call for calm, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri's borders as dem dey suspend di konstitution and dissolve di National Assembly.
Howeva, opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army's appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over in di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose take power afta Deby death and no be hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say in di absence of di president or in case hin die, den di speaker of di parliament go take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so am.
But di military announce say dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and di constitution also, so wetin dem dey do na make dem replace di constitution.
Chelsea don face possible point deduction afta dem brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible point deduction by hin FA for di team's failure to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, dem don find di team pants down for seven hot tempered rows wit opponents
Di recent brawl during a clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter Chelsea had wit Premier League teams
Last week match wey dey between Chelsea and Leicester na skirmishes wey dey between di players of both teams.
As dem cite similar offenses for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea
Dem don also charge Leicester for dia role for di brawl wey involve players and coaching staff afta Ricardo Pereira challenge on Ben Chilwell.
For 2016, dem also charge Chelsea for indiscipline say dem need warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part for one mass bust-up durin one match wey dem don dey match.
If dem affect, di point deduction go significantly affect dia season as dem head into a final campaign for top four spot.
US Africom dey Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and over here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion wey plenti British pipo kom get on top di thousands of American GIs wey dey station for different military bases for Britain during di war war
Di gum-chewin, brash, hard-drinkin and womanisin American soldiers dey frequently go into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up a feeling of disdain for di Americans.
And dis don be di pattern of behaviour among American soldiers evriwia for di hundreds of American military bases wey dey overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Stuttgart for Germany
Na why I dey perturbed, like plenti Nigerians, dat for one virtual meeting last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari wey dey di United State
Dem presume say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State
Di meeting suppose don dey wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go transmit di details aftawards to di president
Yes, America be superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and dem suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances.
Understandably, Nigeria dey face wit gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey seem to defy di best efforts of government and di nation's security establishment programme.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency for di North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clashes all ova di kontri and di targeted kilin of security pipo.
But even for dat, di call for di hosting of di Africom on Nigerian soil wen dem consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria dey hardly join.
Africom na one of nine command by di American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interest around di world.
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security issues.
Dem only do so wen dat kind issue dey affect American interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no get mandate to yield dia modus operandi and share interest for di area.
If Africom dey set up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island of im own wey go restrict access to Nigerians of all categories and establish jurisdiction witin di area.
As e dey always apun wit American military bases outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of security.
For di particular case of Africom, part of hin original concept na to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa following awa investigation.
Africom precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria's strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make plenti secret and open visit to number of African kontries to sell moni.
But bikos Nigeria be di target, hin pointedly leave am out from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no dey far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem tout am as initiative to facilitate American assistance
Bikos of undisguised hostility to di idea from France, wey dey averse to seeing di Americans try butt into area wey e consider hin exclusive sphere of information
Inside di review, wey drive di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di American congress midwife for sectors of di sectors of di
Based on top di recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facets of American political and security establishments, na Africom na hin dey set up by di Bush Junior.
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey Florida, dey to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey base for Stuttgart, Germany, dey to di Middle East and
Nigeria don already surround French military presence for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di Americans get drone base for Niger
To add Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America
Bearing in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no dey always cohere wit those of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equal opportunity.
Nothing dey for di present insecurity challenges wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents wey dey dose kontris from all di Nigeria.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, afta dem fall from di high standards wey dem know am, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non-state actors internationally and internationally
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military retain di capacity and capability to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, di right leadership, di right leade
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di Americans fit give us if dem dey willing
But despite awa circumstance dey arm-twisted into hosting di Africom in view of hin antecedents and implications to awa strategic interests, on awa soil.

Plateau State na Nigeria's number one grower of Irish potato wit di tuber wey dem dey produce for nine of di state's 17 local goment areas
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative dey peg Plateau as e dey account for 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri
Di large potato production from Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, wey be leading information source for di global potato industry, don make Nigeria di fourth biggest potato economy for di wo

Di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state, howeva, tok say unless dem address challenges wey dey affect di value chain squarely, dem go increase production and export for di kontri.
Lazarus Makut wey be Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wit Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams, especially for remote areas wia potato farming no dey viable as
Hin tok say di cost of mechanised farming wey fit increase productivity don bikom expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers unable to produce agriculture
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water durin di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low prices for potato
Bikos of dis, she tok say, majority of farmers dey search for borehole locations to farm to access irrigation water for dia farms
Martha explain also say di cost of fertiliser wey dey high dey prevent many farmers to dey improve quantity and quality of yield, she add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di productivity of di
Di cost also prevent many of us no dey expand di business
So, to dey get fertiliser no dey easy for us
She tok say di construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation go lead to mass production of potatoes
If di water no dey sufficient for di crop, e go dry and eventually die and na why some farmers wey get di resources prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu purposely
Irish potato for market for Jos

As Plateau State's potato production don increase from 1,656,650 metric tons for 2017 go 2,359,890 metric tons for 2020, di establishment of di Potato Value Chain Support Programme (PVCP) wey dem go
Di Monioring and Evaluating officer of di state's Potato Value Chain Support Project, Baleri Yakubu, tell Daily Trust say di state suppose start production of potato.
Yakubu, howeva, tok say di state goment suppose tackle oda challenges wey farmers face especially those of fertiliser as well as more dams and road networks while farmers dey face different challenge
Awa tori-pesin hear say di tissue culture lab, wey dem wan improve potato yield for di state as dem provide clean seed wey dey resistant to pests and other diseases.
Yakubu tok say di advent of di lab go improve income for farmers and revenue for di state goment while e dey also aid food security effort for di kontri
Farmers for Plateau State, howeva, believe say di tissue lab, if dem fully equip, go reduce di cost of treatment for di crops wen dem affect any disease.
Dem also hope say beta quality seed go dey available for affordable price

Super League trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus insist on Wednesday say dem still dey committed to modernise football even as UEFA threats of disciplinary action
UEFA on Tuesday open formal disciplinary proceedings against di three clubs wey still dey refuse to give up di aborted Super League project.
For one joint statement, Italian Juventus and di two Spanish sides tok say dem remain committed to modernise football through open dialogue wit UEFA
FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express dia absolute rejection of di insistent coercion wey UEFA don dey maintain towards three of di most relevant players of Europe
Dis alarming attitude constitutes a flagrant breach of di decision of di courts of justice, wey don already make clear statement warning UEFA make dem refrain from taking di match.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tanga
Twelve months ago, dem arrest Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi for June 2020 for Dubai for alleged moni laundering from business email wey dem dey compromise from business
E make total sum of $435 million afta e defraud 1,926,400 victims.
One year afta, Abidemi Rufai (also known as Sandy Tangâ), wey be Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun also
Di moni wey dem steal na pandemic relief fund wey Washington State design for pipo wey fit suffer job loss as a result of di COVID-19 pandemic
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau begin track di alleged fraudster wey go don be for Nigeria's Federal House of Representatives for di Federal House of Representative
Dem perpetrate di fraud as dem dey steal di identity of more dan 100 Washington residents as dem dey fill falsified claims wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for payment wey dem dey fill fal
For each identity wey dem steal, dem create separate e-mail account so dem go associate di claims wit different pipo and e fit escape automatic fraud detection for di system.
Afta, dem pay more dan $288,000 into hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisation and kontris.
Nigeria dey lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes annually
By di end of 2021, di world go lose a total of $6 trillion
Till date, more dan 40 Nigerians don be or dem dey investigate for dia complicity for fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai allege unemployment benefits fraud fall under wetin I don call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Dis na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on di loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisations.
For di COVID-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminals don pattern dia fraud along di intervention from government and private sectors and dem scam many and some of di products wey dem get
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among odas
As pipo dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngsters dey do am for inside Nigeria.
Dem dey regularly arrest dem, tried and convicted by di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
Understanding di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment for fighting di crime.
Di family na di microcosm of di larger society
Na di place wia dem suppose nurture normal human being for di society
Apart from di fact say many Nigerian families dey di dungeon of poverty and dem fit hardly take care of dia pikin, some of dis children don bikom breadwinners
Challenge dey wit ethical behaviour training for many houses as dem dey arrest parents alongside dia children wey dey involve for cyber-criminality.
Anoda place, mothers of yahoo-boys dey form association to celebrate dia son success and justify dia criminal behaviours
For di religious setting, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalists create house and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teachings don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
Dem dey viral video wey dem show some boys dey spray moni while dose wey appear say dem be shepherds for one white garment church enjoy di moment while di pipo wey dey suppose be white garment church
One pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy now dey 21 years old
Sadly, dem grow up to appreciate lying as a way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for plenti cases from house) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and dey no fulfil dia respect.
Lying eself na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism
Dem dey socialise youths daily to corruption and fraud by dose wey dey hold public office
Dem see how dia system dey provide soft landing for fraudulent persons (public or private)
Dem ask how many fraud and corruption allegations dem don investigate and dem discharge am wit punishment wen dem find di accused guilty
Di majority of di cases end wit off-di-mic like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case end as family affair
Di youths see flamboyant lifestyle wey dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how once poor political aspirants dey transform into millionaires within months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institution don bikom cash and carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, dey give undeserving honours for exchange for moni
Dem go provide all dose wey mismanage moni wit soft landing
As we add for dis list of cultures wey dey nurture cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cybercrimes as work
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, dem go make law against di crime wey dem dey involve in?
Di process to dey give parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need dey review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo products into awa already recently recently recently
E dey unfortunate say dem lower di critical reasoning of parti leaders wen dem dangle moni for dia eyes
Dem provide platform for dubious characters to cover up dia tracks and awa society dey worse off throughdia actions
Greed also dey nurture cyber-criminality
FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator
Unfortunately, di greed wey dis defendant affect all taxpayers
Moving forward, we no fit live for sin and expect grace to abound.
Nigeria must sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey go track lifestyle wit material accumulations.
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria as we dey create employment opportunities, reduce poverty and review reward systems
Di EFCC need invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di Commission need conclude investigation before dem arrest suspects as di FBI don do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang
Unless di culture wey dey sustain cybercrime for Nigeria dey tackle through social engineerin, cyber-criminality go continue to fester

How e dey feel to give birth durin di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, new life dey bring happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, new morning, two red lines change my life
I dey pregnant and hapi
E be amazing start for new year
Na di year wey I remark pass for my life
All of a sudden, evrithin change
Dem born my daughter Roshomon Tara for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she don dey nine months old
she be di reason why I bikom my mother for di middle of global crisis
No be only her wey dem born, but na one new me, mother of Tara, wey spend her entire pregnancy for lockdown for house kom give birth for emergency condition wit her health.
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
Her grandmothers dey also afraid to hold am or to kom closer to am witout wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey to my motherhood go dey completely different
Dis Mother's Day dey very special as my daughter don dey front of me, smiling and staring at me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
Di only thing wey no change, meanwhile, na di pandemic
I dey 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic struck, and di planet go lockdown.
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes
Dis 22 weeks no dey less dan war
My husband Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all hin concert for dat time
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
We dey depend on wetin I don save ova di years, and I don spend all my savings
Awa parents and two journalists association kom forward to help for di time being
I dey afraid of evrithin
most of di time, e be like death
Dem dey knock di door
I dey adapt to one new online life wia we click and get awa things home-delivered
I need wait for one week to get groceries delivery dis way
I dey even afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me and my husband make hin go outside kom buy food for storage
So, I dey chop less
Besides, I no fit go for my antenatal check-up wey I schedule
And I no dey sure if my pikin dey grow healthy or all development dey take place timely
I dey sorry for my pikin wey no born, say I dey bring am into a more different world pass evribodi
Tele-medication don help me pass some hard time durin di last trimister
I forget my gynaecologist face
I no fit remember how she look witout di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help
Plenti information dey around
Inside dis chaos of information, experienced mothers, my mother and mother-in-law fit only help me as dem dey support me and dem no dey meet me for person wen I dey pregnant
Traditionally, experienced mothers and mostly older women for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation
I don get plenti panic attack bikos of lack of information and understanding.

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and make some far-reaching resolutions on di state of di nation, wey dem don call am Asaba Declaration.
Di meeting don kom on di heels of worsening insecurity wey dey worse for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and di unending menace of murderous herdsmen generated nationwide
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature of di meeting and di unanimity wey di 17 governors display show say dem mean serious business.
Restructuring witin di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing na di core of di declaration.
Major highlights include di clamour for state police, devolution of powers, review of revenue formula in favour of federatin units and di need for national dialogue on top di state.
While di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and e dey contrary to di spirit of true federalism to which di government wey dey dey
One go don expect di leading lights of APC make dem take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition partisans dem
Instead, we see attempt to play to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommend devolution of powers, resource kontrol, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federational goment.
President Buhari don since give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order for di Ministry
Given di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose grave challenges, dis twin sectors suppose receive di utmost attention, concurrently
Despite di rating of Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Africa, we neva make sufficient effort to translate dat to improve standards of living for di pipo wey dey live
Awa annual budget of about $35 billion, for example, dey grossly inadequate to cater to di needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa wit about 58 million pipo get national budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit her Social Protection Programme wey dey reach 17m of im population.
Di efforts of Buhari administration, though dem novel and commendable, still represent a drop for ocean and dem no dey adequate to make di impact wey we need.
Na wia devolution of power and resource kontrol kom in
Solid minerals and natural resources no get business to stay for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercially viable natural resources wey dem fit exploit to create wealth and generate di need foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wia states kom cap for hand go Abuja go collect federal allocations for di kontri breed indolence, run contrary to di principle of true federalism
just as di El-Rufai committee propose, make dem review di revenue formula in favour of states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem
On state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excesses by governors dey understandable, but as Richie Norton tok say to escape fear, you need go through am, no dey around towards.
For too long we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force
As Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea whose time don kom
We need address awa fears and overkom am
One of di way wey dem fit do na to dey enact legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendment wey dey apun for di constitution
E go dey similar in functions to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e get wider power to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
Di ban on open grazing though di governors restate no be new and dey form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey dem approve by di National Export Agency (NEAC) wey dem ap
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system wey dey inefficient and grossly
For di core na strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and make dem lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmers. E, derefore, beggars belief say some myocards no get risk of conflict
Di federal and state goment suppose move swiftly to fully implement dis novel plan so we fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us
Di convocation of National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration no fit dey necessary since di report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of di National Conference and recomm
Both report don make far-reaching recommendations say awa elected governors and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead dem waste scarcity for di state.
On top di issue of separatist agitation, modalities go dey for convening referendum wey dey spelt out for di konstitution.
E dey almost certain say vast majority of Nigerians wan live togeda, awa differences, notwitstanding.
Doing dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord.
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to a United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian
Even say we get challenges like evri oda kontri, we need listen to awasef, like US President Joe Biden often tok
Tomori dey reside for Abuja
