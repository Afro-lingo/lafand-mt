The quarrel wey dem dey call Herder Farmers for Nigeria don turn to topic wey dey everywhere for Nigeria.
Land and farm crisis for Nigeria wey go end : The Livestock Reform Plan
Government for the federal and state wey dey Nigeria dey struggle to do National Livestock Transformation Plan wey go help people for the whole country no put hand for wetin dem dey do.
Even though sey the Plan don help many government for this world, e dey face serious wahala.
People no dey fit lead the government, people dey think sey wetin e suppose do bad well well, people dey put money well well because of the COVID-19 bad thing wey dey happen, people no too get work to do am, and people no too dey sure sey dem go fit do am.
If the Plan no be the same thing with wetin dem first plan to do to make sure sey people for this world dey control theirself, the fight wey people for this world dey do fit scatter.
The Plan wey the National Economic Council for January 2019 talk about na the best work wey dem dey do to remove Nigerias animal system wey no dey work well and wey no dey change well.
The main thing wey we go do na to settle the quarrel wey the farmer and the farmer get. This one go make the quarrel no too dey.
E dey sweet us sey, for ten years, the pastor dem go dey sure sey dem go put their cow for different different place. Dem go put the farm and other things wey dem go dey do to fit manage animal.
For the end of 208, government go get 119 branch office wey dey work for the different different country wey dem dey join. This one go make more than two million people work for the farm, the processing and the marketing chains.
For example, for 2018, people wey dey stay for the village suffer well well because of the fight wey the farmer and the farmer get.
The government for the federal government don contribute 80 per cent from the things wey government for the country sey make dem do. The government don do everything wey dem fit do to help the government prepare for the work. For example, dem dey use field surveys and - site mapping.
E get some state wey don reactivate the reserves wey dem dey call Grazing reserves before. Dem don open office and dem don arrange different different group wey go dey direct the Plan.
The government still dey do workshops and other things wey dem fit do to tell people about the better things wey we go gain if we change our house.
But two years before the plan reach 10 years, dem never build the first place wey dem dey call Branch Office.
Because people wey dey work for Fulani no dey support the plan, people wey dey work for pastor no dey support the plan.
Plenty people for Middle Belt don dey quarrel with the farmer and the farmer, even though sey dem dey do everything wey dem fit do to make peace. Since 2018, the army don stop the quarrel.
Because of the bad things wey happen for the country, the money wey the government dey contribute no go dey again. The money wey the government dey contribute no go dey again. The money wey the government dey contribute no go dey again.
For many country, especially for North West, the plenty group wey dey fight war and other group wey get gun dey scatter money and money wey people fit put.
If we no settle am, this and other problem fit spoil the Plan. This one fit make people for the country get problem wey fit make their family, their area and religion strong more more.
For this kind thing to happen, government and government need to arrange everything wey dem fit do to help people wey dey contribute.
The first thing be sey, Abuja and government wey dey support the government suppose dey direct the government well well and dem suppose dey preach well well to people wey dey plan wetin dem go do.
People wey dey do pastoral like this. Dem go tell dem sey dem go change how dem dey live their life. Dem still dey sure of wetin the Plan talk about the pasture wey dem get.
But many farmers still dey fear sey dem fit lose their land to people wey dey produce animal.
Many people for Middle Belt and south of the country still dey sure of wetin Plans get for mind to do for long - time. Dem dey see am as person wey go give pastor work, and Fulani.
For example, dem go need to know how to manage farm work and other things wey dem dey do. Dem go need to use am do farm work, to dey produce milk, and to dey process meat.
Government for the Federation and government for the state need to arrange their own money. Dem need to quick release the money quick quick. Dem need to give people money so that dem go know where dem suppose do reach. Dem need to work with people wey dey contribute and people wey dey contribute.
E still good make we settle the matter with people wey no dey sure of wetin dey happen for village.
Another thing be sey, government go need to think about the things wey the brothers and sisters for Nigeria go do. Dem go need to choose whether dem go gain from the plan.
Even though sey some of this things go take time, e good make dem put mind for wetin dem plan to do.
E no reach two years now wey dem go do the general election for the country.
If the Plan na to survive the government wey go soon change, some politician need to know wetin go gain from am ( Since two years don pass, president Buhari and many governor of the state no dey fit compete, wetin mean sey the change no dey again ).
The thing be sey, when the time reach for the end of 2022, the people wey dey give the plan go fit talk about some of the branch office wey dem build for there. Dem go still talk about how dem go take build the property wey dem build for there. Dem go still talk about strong contribution and how dem go take put money for the country.
E no go easy for person to do this one, but e no go hard am to do am.
Even though sey e no get sin for body, e still dey give chance to change the animal system wey dem dey call Nigeria.
About 70 per cent of people wey dey work for Nigeria dey use their farm take get money.
This one go make the country better pass other country. But, e go still help the country settle the quarrel wey big pass for Nigeria.
When the time reach 2023 wey dem go do the election, government and government go need to quick do the work wey dem don do to make sure sey the chance wey dem get no reach.
For this topic, we go talk about one report wey talk about National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP ) and how we go take do am quick, wey dey the International Crisis Group.

The first thing be sey, the COVID-19 lockdown and dem no gree do am when the farmers dey plan to plant their plant and the farmers dey plan to start the plant.
Many farmers no fit reach their farm. But other people dey work well well for dem to plant their farm because e no easy to arrange machine wey go help dem.
Dem stop the market wey dem dey call coronavirus. This one don spoil the money wey people dey do for the village.
Many farmers no fit sell their seed so that dem go fit buy seed, fertilizer, and pay people wey dey work for this farm.
Even when dem stop the work for the farm, the price of the caretaker come dey high sotey many farmers no fit buy am.
For some area, the price of one 50kg bag wey be Indorama and Notore Urea na N13,000.
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 when the federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey weak de sell for farmers for N5000 no de sell for plenty place and area where rise price de rise reach N7,000 and e high pass de sell for some place
For farmers wey dey Zamfara, wey dey call Katsina wey dey southern Kaduna, wey dey Kebbi and Sokoto state, the bad things wey dem dey do no make dem fit enter their farm.
Many of the people wey dey do farm work no easy.
Dem kidnap many people because of Jesus sacrifice.
Many of dem dey pay plenty money or dey give plenty things wey dem dey chop to the bad people.
Today, many village for that country don dey desolate.
For the country wey dem dey call Kebbi, wey dey Sokoto and wey be Kano country, the land wey dem dey call maize and rice plenty pass 450,000 hectare.
Many of the farmers wey dem suffer, still dey pay the money wey dem get because dem don destroy their house.
The heavy rain fall well well since 2012 when heavy breeze scatter many of the city wey far well well for Nigeria, and many of the place wey heavy rain fall, kill people and wash their farm.

For two month, the farmers do wetin dem no suppose do.
No deceive people
Another place wey people no like this year na poultry and feeds.
From the beginning of this world, the price of wheat no too plenty
E come still force the Poultry Association of Nigeria to send person wey go save us.
The government wey the Federation gree sey make dem collect 5,000 metric ton of maize from the country wey dem go use do military work. Dem still give some of the big farmers the right to buy about 222 metric ton of maize wey go make the food industry no too much.
But after three month, the farmers come dey fear sey for January 2021, the business go comot finish.
Because of this one, the price of the food wey dey inside the world come high well well. The price of the food wey dey inside the world come high well well from N2,600 for February to around N5,500 now.
For January 2021, N7 million people for the poultry industry come lose work. The number of work wey dem plan to do reach 10 million. But the money wey dem put for the poultry no reach N1.5 billion.
But even with the wahala wey the farm face for the whole 2020 farm year, the farmers still dey try to handle the problem wey the subsector get.
This na the first time wey the price of the seed no go fall as time dey go. Dem dey fear sey dem go hungry dem to go back to the place wey dem dey go. Dem go let the seed enter the place wey dem dey go.

This kind thing fit make the place wey dem dey call North Central be like cattle house.
And that one go help the people wey dey North Central come get money.
We get the land wey southern government fit no get.

The wahala wey Fulani herders dey face, no be because dem no want join hand.

Because of this one, dem go need to train dem well to sabi ranching work.
We fit still use Kenya style. E fit be sey everybody for our family get farm and you no go see open grass, even though sey the farm plenty well well.
But na wetin the governor for South Africa dey do?
Na so the governor dem still dey do.
Dem no want make the government for the Federation come.
The only thing wey dem dey talk na sey the elders don dey get problem for us and make we run comot.
Dem sey make the people wey dey work for the farmer talk sey the farmer na business.
But dem don tell their enemy sey make dem do like the pastor dem?
As one of the program wey dem dey do to help young people, especially for the farm and the value chain, why some government no dey do wetin dem get for mind and wetin dey happen?
The first thing be sey, government no fit kill people like President Muhammadu Buhari government wey fit help you sitdown for your house.
E still get one place wey dem dey call COVID-19 loan.
Many people for Nigeria don see sey na hundred thousand naira dem dey borrow from their house, and dem no even go office.
Small business like Bank of Industry (BOI ), Bank of Agriculture (BOA ) and other small business.
The problem be sey, we get people wey believe wetin you dey do and people wey talk wetin you no like.
So, for people wey no believe sey Buhari government dey, nothing go help dem.
But for us wey believe sey Buhari dey, we dey gain and we dey thank God for am.

The 9th Assembly wey dem dey call Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala, show sey dem ready to do the work wey dem dey do for the Republic of Nigeria for 1999.
This one still show sey the National Assembly still dey alive when e go use other government wey go join hand do the work wey dem suppose do to make sure sey dem no do bad thing.

Dem don arrange am together as platform for us to let Nigerians and everybody for the whole world know wetin the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey, and wetin we dey learn to fit do more for the country.
After Senate don arrange this Law, and because of the fact sey we dey use two - tribe legislature, the House of Representatives wey ready and wey get power well well, dey under His Excellency, Rt.
My name na Gbajabiamila, the Hon.
One brother wey im name na Speaker, follow the suffer, come give the Bill on Wednesday 19 May, 2021.
You fit don know sey the Law wey dem give the National Assembly ( wey dem dey call Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria, CIFIPN ) na one of the law wey people no like.
E pain us sey the people wey go join hand fight the bad things wey dey happen for Nigeria, come talk sey dem be their enemy.
Good thing na good thing and bad thing no be another thing.
No matter how e take reach, good thing dey always pass bad thing.
E good make we remember wetin happen for National Assembly.
For March 2nd, 2021, the 9th Senate ( CIFIPN ) first give the Law wey dem dey call The Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est ). Dem still give the Law for March 2nd Reading ( 1st Reading, 2nd Reading ) and the 3rd Reading ( 2nd Reading ) for March 2nd Reading ( 2nd Reading ).
E good make people know sey ( CIFIPN ) no be just noble body ( noble body ) but na one new body for Nigeria.
Nowadays, e no easy for Nigerians to get the normal body wey go control the bad things wey people dey do for Jehovah organization. Dem go come fight some government wey want stop the bad things wey dem dey do.
The Law wey the National Assembly give Israel people, show sey dem really like wetin dem dey do. E still show sey dem need to make sure sey everybody for the country do everything wey dem fit do to comot hand from the bad things wey people for this world dey do.
The two Chambers of the National Assembly don do wetin show sey dem really need law for Nigeria that time.
This one go make the bad things wey people for this world dey do, come dey strong more more.
All of us know sey the bad things wey people dey do don change because science and technology don dey change for the 21st Century.
Na im make e clear sey we get many things wey go happen for this world and we ready to do law wey go make sure sey everything wey we want do reach our hand.
We fit still talk sey the journey start for the 8th National Assembly wey dem dey call Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, wey be Ph.D, CON, wey be Senate President when e be Senate Leader.
For example, when dem put our Bill for the two Chambers for the 8th National Assembly, the different different committee for the respective Chambers dey do all the talk.
After, the National Assembly come give the Law because of the wahala wey people wey dey the matter get, wey dem dey call Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN ).
After, dem come give the Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent. Dem no give am before dem dissolve the 8th National Assembly for June, 2019.
Na im make the Law wey God give Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, wey be the Leader of the Senate wey dey heaven, dey support the Law again for the 9th National Assembly.
This one go help us know the kind lie wey people wey dey control us dey talk. Dem no gree make the 8th National Assembly talk wetin we talk.
We still need to talk about the fact sey our Bill dey make mistake for the same Bill wey dem just give for Senate and House of Representatives Chambers.
When we check all this things, we come see sey the things wey we talk about na double of wetin we talk about the Law.
Make we talk sey dem no put all this Bill for the 8th National Assembly instead of our Bill.
Because of this one, we be the first person to get this kind Bill (Forensic )
We don see sey we need to build this kind great institut.
After dem start to study how the institutes dey work for other area, dem come see sey the work don help dem know how dem take dey do bad things and how dem take dey suffer dem.
E good to know sey since 2009, our Institute don dey alive.
For many years now, we don train people for science and technology wey go help us know the kind work wey we suppose do to do for the matter wey concern the matter.
( 1 Tim. 3 : 1, 2 ) for this kind matter, dem go check whether na mistake or na mistake. Dem go check how dem go take know the matter. Dem go check how dem go take know the matter. Dem go check how dem go take know the matter. Dem go check how dem go take know the matter and how dem go take know the matter. Dem go check the matter and how dem go take do am.
You go gree with me sey for this world, the different different way wey we dey do bad things don pass before, so that we go fit fight the bad things.
If we want do something wey go make sense for this matter, e good make we dey do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no do wetin dey the bad things wey dey happen for this world.
This one show sey dem plan wetin dem go do to make sure sey dem build the Kingdom Hall.
Time no go allow me explain all the things wey the Law sey make we do for here.
But I want make you tell me some things wey concern the Law wey Jehovah give Israel people.
If we want build one Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria, we go fit train people wey go preach for this area. This one go help us know how to use science and technology wey go help us know where we suppose do reach.
We go fit use Forensic Science, technology and other things take train people wey dey do bad things for our country and for open place. This one go help us know how to do the bad things wey people for this world dey do.
E go help people wey dey do bad things for congregation know where dem suppose do reach. E go still help people wey dey do bad things for congregation know where dem suppose do reach. E go still help people wey dey do bad things so that dem no go do am.
For the whole world wey dem dey call Archaic and conventional research, we dey do special science work. This one go help the country make e no dey use the money wey people wey come from another country take hire stranger to do research about the matter for Nigeria.
We go learn many things wey go help us fit do the work wey Jehovah Witness people dey do. Some of dem na Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
This one go help us know where we suppose do reach. And e go help us know where we suppose do reach.
For example, dem need to arrange law wey go help dem know where dem suppose do reach. Dem need to arrange law wey go help dem know where dem suppose do reach. Dem need to arrange law wey go help dem know where dem suppose do reach.
From wetin we don learn, e clear sey the work wey Jehovah organization dey do, na big work.
E still good to talk again sey science dey plenty and e dey everywhere for this world. E still good make we know sey this kind science go help us know where we suppose do reach, where we suppose do reach, and where we suppose do reach.
For example, e get many things wey Jehovah Witness people dey do. Some of dem na : forensic toxicology ; forensic research ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic checking ; forensic
So, you go gree with me sey our Institute dey bring something wey go help us know the kind bad things wey people for this world dey do.
This one no be the same thing with people wey dey think about wetin we suppose do. Dem no dey think about wetin dem suppose do because dem no too dey think about wetin government talk and dem no too dey think about wetin government talk.
For one small topic, I want make everybody see the kind funny thing wey dey happen now. The truth be sey, e suppose dey worry everybody wey dey serve Jehovah well.
When dem put Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN ) come fight dem well well because dem believe sey the work wey dem dey do now na double.
But when we start to use the Bill again for the 9th National Assembly, dem come see sey the law wey dem dey give people plenty pass the one wey dem dey give the two Chambers. Now, the Law wey dem give the two Chambers come help dem know sey science na one special thing. And as we talk, dem don give the same Bill wey dey the House of Representatives today.
We fit ask ourself sey, wetin don change for our time and for our time? For the place wey dem dey call ICAN, we dey think sey dem no suppose get any other institution wey go dey direct science?
your answer good like my own.
I want still tell you sey the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN ) no dey comot for this fine drama part.
The name of the Bill na Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill.
I come tell dem all this things so that dem go know how some people go fit do wetin dem get for mind.
But, we no dey fear because we believe sey National Assembly and the way dem take dey lead us fit do the correct thing. And we still believe sey we no go fit control ourself anyhow because of all this things wey we no need.
People wey know sey this Law no dey, still dey support the Law wey Jehovah give Israel people.
Dem join some brothers and sisters wey dey support the war write some of the book dem. Dem even use blackmail give the people wey dey lead for Senate.
Because dem no do wetin dem fit do for the Senate, dem come dey write all the book wey dem dey call House of Representatives.
But dem still fail.
Anytime wey the Senate don give the law for the country wey dem dey call Assembly Hall, na only Assembly Hall go need to join for any matter wey dem talk am.
For May 19, 2021, dem come give the Law wey dem go give Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of what Standard Knowledge and Skills to Get by Persons wey want be Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals.
ICAN don register im Bill for the House of Representatives title (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
The Law still talk sey dem go establish one Forensic University for Nigeria. If dem no do this one, nobody go fit do forensic for Nigeria. If dem no do this one, dem go put the person for prison for some years.
This kind thing dey happen for one country wey plenty people sabi am well well.
I happy sey dem no be Banana Republic for Nigeria
No matter the kind bad things wey people for this world dey do.
E dey hard us to settle the matter with brothers and sisters for House of Representatives.
Make we no forget sey the law wey Jehovah give Israel people no concern us. But we dey sure sey na because the law wey e give dem, make dem stop the assembly because na so e still be for the assembly.
We no go let dem deceive us and our brothers and sisters.
You go remember wetin happen to one of the book wey dem dey call Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey dem dey call Engr.(Chief )
For May 24, 2019, one brother wey im name na Olumuyiwa Alade, do everything wey e fit do to talk sey na the laws wey dem give the ICAN give dem power to do Forensics, and that one mean sey the Law wey dem give the CIFIPN Law go reach two times one.
The question be sey, wetin don change?
Na so e still be with the law wey the government for this world dey talk.
Na true sey we no dey support any group wey talk sey make the law wey dem dey give for inside the law, but make we get am for mind sey nobody go try to stop the bad things wey dey happen.

Dem still dey talk wetin go make people vex. Dem still dey talk wetin go make people vex. Dem still dey talk wetin go make people vex. Dem still dey talk wetin go make people vex.
The truth be sey, for some area for this country, nobody fit dey think sey this kind thing fit cause trouble for people wey no be Jew.
Dem believe sey people wey dey DSS know the person wey dey cause the quarrel. Dem no believe sey na only dem dey talk wetin dem talk.
PANDEV talk sey many people no know who dem be because of the things wey dem dey do. E still talk sey dem no know who dem be.
Because DSS know dem and wetin dem dey do for Satan, make dem try well well to handle dem.
NEF people no dey sure sey if people dey cause serious wahala for the country, dem go treat dem the way the law talk.
You no need to be husband or wife to know wetin DSS know about all this people wey dey fight war for Nigeria or why dem know sey DSS know dem even though sey dem no dey force dem.
The truth be sey, the people wey dey support this tribe no know wetin better pass for dem to dey control the tribe for the whole country as people wey dey rule, no be people wey dey lead.
Dem dey put mind for wetin dem want do and dem no dey put mind for wetin dem want do. Dem dey put mind for wetin dem want do and dem no dey put mind for wetin dem want do.
Dem no know where dem suppose do reach. Dem no know where dem suppose do reach. Dem no know where dem suppose do reach. Dem no know where dem suppose do reach. Dem no know where dem suppose do reach. Dem no know where dem suppose reach.
E no easy to talk sey, if we comot for Nigeria, we go fit do wetin go make people mind come down. This one go make our mind come down. This one go make our mind come down.
( 2 Chron. 5 : 1, 2 ) Because dem no support any side for this area, dem dey do everything wey dem fit do to make sure sey dem continue to get one mind and peace.
Because as long as dem continue to dey put hand for politics, dem go see Nigeria as the right wey dem suppose get for their tribe. Dem go talk sey dem go kill dem or sey dem go kill dem, and if other people no gree, dem go deceive dem as bad state.
Anytime wey dem come meeting, dem no go plan wetin go help the government for Nigeria continue to dey rule and continue to dey rule, unless dem know sey the government for there dey rule.
Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, wetin dem dey do and wetin dem dey do no be the same thing.
Another thing wey dem fit talk about for this area be sey, all of dem na group wey government dey push dem to support different tribe.
From the time wey dem start to serve Jehovah, e clear sey na all of dem be like that.
The truth be sey, this one dey make dem fit dey gather together. Dem no go dey support any side for politics. Dem no go dey support any side for politics. Dem no go dey support any side for politics. Dem no go dey support any side for politics. Dem no go dey support any side for politics.
Dem no dey support any side for politics. Dem no dey support any side for politics, dem no dey support any side for politics, dem no dey support any side for politics, dem no dey support any side for politics, dem no dey support any side for politics, dem dey put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye, and dem dey put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye.
Na im make everytime wey dem dey go meeting dey make people know wetin dem go do!
If this kind people dey think sey dem no go fit control the government wey dem don choose, dem go need to join hand do the bad things wey dem dey do. Dem go join hand do the bad things wey kidnapers, insurgents, armed robber, bandit and other terrorists dey do so that dem no go fit rule for Nigeria.
For example, e mean sey the government wey dey Buhari government go fight with this kind big horse wey fit make people attack their country, even when things no too bad before.
That one mean sey na only two group of people wey dey do politics fit be : people wey dey support the government, and people wey dey support the government. Dem dey support the people wey dey support the government, and people wey dey put hand for things wey fit cause wahala for their country.
All of us know the things wey dem dey do and the things wey dem dey do!
For the end of this world, many of the people wey come from Nigeria no know where dem come from or where dem come from.
Dem dey try to live the kind life wey God want, no matter the kind faith wey dem get.
Because dem know sey dem no get any other country to call dem their own, dem dey gather together to show how their country take dey help people wey no be their own.
Dem still know sey the brothers wey dem dey call Afenifere, DAA Consultative Forum (ACF ), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum ( NEF ) and Pan Niger Delta Forum ( PANDEF ) dey talk wetin go make people vex.

The truth be sey, if dem put eye for their classmate, dem fit dey think about wetin dem believe, especially for school.
The money wey people dey spend for this world plenty well well.
The Commissioner for Education, wey im name na Kemi Adeosun, talk wetin happen to the press. E sey, the government dey sure sey if dem let the school girls wear their hijab for open school, peace go dey.
For country wey no want make religion dey again, the main thing wey we go ask na : ( 1 ) Why e no good to allow pikin wey be Nigerian pikin go school because of the kind religion wey e dey do?
This one dey worry us well well because na for Nigeria dem sign the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR ).
UDHR talk sey everybody dey free and get the same character, no matter the kind color, the kind person wey e be, or the religion wey e be.
E get 30 topic wey talk about the right and freedom wey people get. Some of dem na : the right to live their life, to talk or to talk wetin no good.
E go still show sey dem get money, money, and culture, like to go school, and to dey sick.
I dey find articles 18 and 26 for UDHR wey concern the matter well well.
Article 18 : Everybody get the right to think or believe wetin dem want, and dem still get the right to believe wetin Bible talk.
We get the right to change our faith or religion anytime. And we get the right to go preach for where we dey preach for where we dey preach for only us or with other people.
Everybody get right to go school.
E good make we dey free to do primary school.
Make all of us continue our study as we want.
For school, e good make we dey help people learn how to get better character. E still good make dem dey teach us how to understand and respect the right wey everybody get.
Make we still dey teach people wetin dem go do, no matter their tribe, religion, or their country.
Na our papa and mama suppose choose the kind school wey we go.
For example, e get one woman wey im name na Ilhan Omar. The woman name na Elhan Omar. The woman name na Elhan Omar. The woman name na Elhan Omar. The woman name na Elhan Omar. The woman name na Elhan Omar.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na politician for America wey dey do U.S. Representative work for the 5th district for Minnesota since 2019.
Na one law wey the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Finance and the member wey dey Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Niger State, Hon, dey support.
Na wetin happen to Saul be that.
The law go help us know where we suppose do reach. E go still help us know where we suppose do reach.
E no go allow people wey get work for congregation, school, work office, and other area to treat other people anyhow because of wetin dem believe sey dem dey serve Jehovah.
When this one happen, the law go bury the kind matter wey we see for Kwara.
E go still talk about some people wey dey work for congregation, or people wey dey direct work wey dey do partial for their work. This one go make dem no dey judge matter well.
E good make dem follow the law wey Jehovah give Israel people.
The truth be sey, na to build the new constitution for Nigeria and the UDHR paper wey we talk about before.
Na so e still be with the Law wey dem give the country, wey dem dey call Disability Law and Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP ).
E dey try to comot all the quarrel wey person get with who no be im husband or wife. E still dey try to comot all the quarrel wey people get with who no be im husband or wife.
One day, our brothers and sisters dey use law take handle the problem wey people dey face for our country.
Dem dey treat this sickness well, no be because dem no get law wey concern dem before. But na because dem need to treat dem well so that dem no go fit opacct dem.
For example, the Law wey dem give RDPP Law and other things wey dem give am show sey dem go punish person wey do wetin bad.
E no get any other thing wey RDPP Law talk about. E no get any other thing wey go show sey we want enter any state wey fit spoil the law.
This one no mean sey the Government of the Federation or of any State no go take any religion as State Religion.
This one na because the law sey make everybody for congregation dey respect the right of women wey dey wear Hijab for open place, like people wey dey call Islamophobia.
The last one wey we talk about, show sey we no dey support anybody for the congregation wey come from Nigeria.
For example, the Law wey Jehovah give Israel people talk sey make dem get the same right, and make dem no get the same right.
The law wey dem arrange go punish people wey no dey serve Jehovah because of wetin dem believe.

The ATC wey dem dey call National Air Traffic Controllers Association ( NATCA ), talk sey the airport no clean for God eye.
Dem still talk sey the place wey dem dey call Kaduna International Airport no get tower wey fit help us fit drive aeroplane well.
For example, e get one brother wey im name na Yomi Agoro, wey be president of NATCA. E talk sey the place wey dem dey call Kaduna airport na watch room wey other people dey use for the airport dey watch. And e no dey control tower only for people wey dey control the air traffic.
E still talk sey other airport wey dey the country no get everything wey dem need to use so that people no go fit enter the airport.
E sey some aeroports no get machine wey dey work.
Even Kaduna no get tower wey dem fit control.
Dem dey use watch room ( firefighters ) wey dem never build for there. We don dey call government make dem do something.
When heavy rain fall for Sokoto, the people wey dey control go meet us make we sitdown for the control tower. And what of that one be sey, dem give some of the control tower wey dey the front of the building to FAAN. Na only NAMA dey there, but we don go meet the two organization.
We still dey fight with radio frequency wey dey come from our place.
Calabar dey there ; no airport wey you go reach today, you go talk sey things dey work for 80 per cent.
NA 40 new controllers dey work for NAMA now, and dem train dem. But NAMA talk sey the number of controlers no too plenty to fit handle the matter.
But the Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency ( NAMA ), wey be Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust sey wetin dem talk no be true.
E talk sey the government for the federal government don put money well well for the work wey dem dey do to help brothers and sisters wey dey fly well.
E talk sey na politics be that.
E don tey wey government don dey use plenty time do more for the work wey dem dey do for this area.
I no dey talk this one because I be MD for NAMA.
If you want hear the truth wey dey Bible, wetin dey my mind na to ask the people for street, ask the people for NAMA, dem go tell you sey dem never do the correct thing before.
E pain well well sey people go dey talk like that.
We never get one topic wey be Category Three (CAT3), but na two government dey come.
Government don spend N1.7bn for one tower wey dem dey use control phone.
Another thing be sey, the safe tower still dey change.
NA TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria ) dey control us today.
Make we dey jealous other people.
E-commerce for Nigeria : Things wey fit cause wahala, and wetin fit happen
E good make we dey use Internet take dey buy, sell, and sell goods and other things to our customer.
Internet don make many country wey no dey too get money. Dem no dey too get money, dem no dey too get money, dem no dey too get money, dem no dey too get money, dem no dey too get money, dem no dey too get time, and dem no dey too get language.
E still dey make many of the business wey we dey do today different from other business. E still dey make many of the business wey we dey do for our country different sotey we no fit know where the business come from.
E no mean sey e get one website wey dem dey call e-mail, or other platform wey dem dey give message. E still get any information or service wey one company fit give our customer for internet.
E good make we dey use one world wey dem dey call Single World Trading. This one dey make e easy to use Internet take get goods and services wey come from different place for this world.
Many of the bad things wey dem dey do for Nigeria dey make e business, especially for ICT, dey grow.
Na im make dem dey do research and study about e - business for Nigeria.
Many of this people think sey the law wey government for Nigeria dey give people wey dey use ICT, no fit handle some of the matter wey concern e business.
E get some things wey fit help us know how to use computer do bad things. E still get some things wey fit help us know how to use computer do things.
So, e good make we arrange wetin we suppose do so that we go fit rule the new government.
Dem still dey do Draft Bill before National Assembly for Nigeria.
E good make we no forget sey, even for the country wey dem put this things for law, dem fit still get new matter for this area wey go show sey dem need to do wetin government talk.
Because internet dey spread business for Nigeria, especially for the banking and telecommunications area wey the country dey, wetin better pass be sey, make we settle the matter and the problem wey dey the country wey e - business dey, quick quick settle, to help the people wey dey preach well well.
If we want do this one, e good make the National Assembly dey push us to tell people about how to do electronic business. The number one thing wey we suppose do be that, na so that dem go fit quick enter law.
As time dey go, our court go start to use all their power interpret the laws wey dey this world, so that we go fit handle the things wey dey this world, so that e go fit start to use internet do business.
The truth be sey, dem argue sey law no be the only way wey dem fit use take make money and property easy.
The court fit still help the brothers know the kind transactions wey dem dey do for internet, even if law no dey.
For example, e get one time wey e talk sey people wey dey do business dey judge matter well like people wey dey do business. The law wey people wey dey do business dey change, and the law wey people dey do business dey change.
We get am for mind sey other brothers and sisters for Nigeria go judge matter well, especially for the area wey the law wey we get no reach to settle the matter.
This one go show sey e good make we first know sey e go protect people wey dey use e - business, people wey dey put hand for business, and people wey dey put hand for business.
The main thing wey German people dey talk about wetin dem go do for E-commerce na how dem go take write book and sign am.
The Law wey dey paragraph 4 of the Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract ) Law and the different - different statutes wey we get about property and landed things, all of dem mean sey dem go write some of the things wey dem suppose do.
question be sey na sign or mark wey dem dey call electronic sign go make dem sign the agreement for phone or phone?
Even for United Kingdom, many of this matter still no dey settle well, even though sey some of the things wey we don choose fit make us use phone take interpret our signature.
( Eph. 4 : 1 - 3 ) So, e good make person write letter for e mail so that e go fit kill person by mistake.
Transactions wey we dey do for e business na transactions wey we no dey use paper take make transactions.
Dem no dey support the transactions wey dem dey do for paper. Dem no dey support the transactions wey dem dey do for paper.
So, we no go fit change the way we dey translate am if we no change am for the front of the paper.
For signature matter, the thing wey dey paragraph 93(2)( 3 ) wey show sey na the signature wey dem take write the signature go reach to know the one wey dem take write the signature.
For this topic, na so e still be for United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL ).
So, make we get the mind to show sey we get signature for phone.
E fit be sey na only the number wey person fit use pass na to know who e be, to know who e be and to use another person name.
Na im make person fit talk sey the signature wey dem write for phone wey dem want kill person, fit be the same signature if the signature dey for phone wey dem write for phone wey dem want kill person.
Another thing be sey, e get other things wey go hard us to do when we dey do e business.
The main thing wey fit help person start the marriage na to give the person something, to accept am, to think about wetin e suppose do, to join the marriage.
The question be sey, wetin we fit do to show sey we get the mind to enter court matter?
E good make we dey sure sey the person wey we send our order or the person wey we send am no change. This one go make us happy with the person wey we send am.
E good make we know where we suppose do reach and where we no suppose do reach.
Last last, the number of bad things wey dey happen for this world for Nigeria plenty well well.
E fit be sey this business na part of the business wey dem dey do for Nigeria.
E no good make government dey give government law. E still good make government dey use platform wey dem dey use for Internet make dem dey do business together.
You fit talk about Abanikanda Happiness Wuraola for Twitter

Because Deby pikin be elite wey dey direct im papa work, e dey always dey with am.
E name na Mahamat Deby. Im na commander of the Chadian army wey dey help one United Nations work wey dem dey do to make peace dey the north side of Mali.
For example, e get 15 soldier wey dey follow imself and 14 soldier wey we know sey don join the circuit of people wey no dey serve Jehovah.
The advice wey dem dey give the congregation go reach 18 months before dem fit choose wetin good and wetin good.
E get one brother wey im name na Mahamat Idriss Deby. E still dey chair for the convention wey dem dey call Army Transition Council, the convention wey dem dey call Ministerial Council, the convention wey dem dey call Ministerial Council, the convention wey dem dey call Ministerial Council and the senior committee wey dem dey support the war.
The 69 member for the convention wey dem dey call Mahamat, go give the new head of state law wey dem go do.
The Transition Charter, wey get 95 topic, still dey give us freedom to talk about wetin we dey talk, to get conscience and to worship Jehovah.
E get one new government wey don start to rule. The new president come dey call the people for the new government.
The charter talk sey all the army wey dem dey call the government wey go change, no dey do any work wey dem suppose do for army.
Chadian law
The soldier wey dey lead Chadian people for almost 30 years, suffer well well when e go fight the war for north side of Chadian government.
The army still talk sey dem go curve the country and dem go close the country. Dem still talk sey dem go stop the assembly and dem go destroy the Assembly.
But people wey dey support the war for Chad no gree sey na president Idriss Dby pikin dem go take control when e die.
Some people talk sey for Chadian law, na after Deby die the person wey dey give talk suppose get power, no be im pikin.
E talk sey if president no dey, or if e die, the brother wey dey give talk go carry the country for 40 days. So, dem go fit change until dem go do the election, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan wey come from im capital, Ndjamena.
[ But ] the army talk sey dem don dissolve the assembly and dem don still dissolve the assembly. So wetin dem dey do na to use their own law take change the assembly.
After dem fight with Leicester, Chelsea fit stop to serve Jehovah
E get some things wey fit make am vex for Chelsea because dem no fit control their game.
For seven years now, dem don see sey their enemy get seven hot temper.
The time wey dem fight with Leicester for Tuesday night, show sey na the seventh time wey Chelsea start to fight with Premier League people.
For last week, dem marry one man wey im name na Chelsea and one man wey im name na Leicester.
Na so e still be for former time. The FA come talk sey dem go punish Chelsea.
Dem still talk sey na dem dey play the fight wey Brother Ricardo Pereira do for Ben Chilwell.
For 2016, dem come still talk sey dem go warn dem sey dem no dey correct dem. Dem sey na 375,000 dollar dem go pay dem for the match wey dem dey do with Tottenham.
If this kind thing happen to dem, the time wey dem go finish, go affect the one wey dem go win.
Heck No!
You dey overpaid, you dey overseer, and you dey pass here.
For the Second World War, many British people come see sey dem get many American GIs wey dey put for different different military station wey dey Britain.
Many times, the soldier dem wey dey carry shoulder, brash, drink well well, and women wey dey carry shoulder come dey fight.
And this kind thing don happen to American soldier for the different different place wey dem dey call Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for Philippines.
The secretary of State for United States, wey im name na Antony Blinken, na President Buhari. For one meeting wey dem do last week, dem tell me sey United States want make dem carry the African Command (Africom ) wey dey the city wey dem dey call Stuttgart wey dey south of Germany go Africa.
E fit be sey na because of this one, President Buhari dey tell people wey go stay for Africom for Nigeria.
The first thing be sey, e no easy for President Buhari to do that meeting with American Secretary of State.
E for be like sey na one brother wey im name na Geoffrey Elkarama wey be Blinken wey no be the same brother. The brother go later tell the president about the matter.
Na true sey America get power pass and na only that one be. But anytime wey dem do this one, dem suppose do wetin dem talk.
The truth be sey, government and the people wey dey protect the country no fit handle the matter.
For North East, people dey thief, dem dey thief for North West, people dey fight farmers and farmers for everywhere for the country, and dem want kill people wey dey put hand for police matter, people wey dey give law, and other people wey dey rule for South East.
But even with that one, e no easy for person to go where Africaicom dey stay for Nigerian soil.
E dey among the nine things wey the army organization for America sey make dem dey do only US military work for the whole world.
Their sense and how dem dey do things, fit be people wey no come from America like Africom. Dem no dey put hand for the matter wey concern the security and law wey concern their area.
Dem go do am only if the matter concern the area and if e be like that, dem no go gree give the brothers or sisters wey dey give law about the matter.
For example, if dem build Africom for Nigeria, e go be like island wey people wey come from Nigeria no suppose reach. And e go still be like island wey dem no suppose reach where dem go stay.
As e be for American army bazi wey dey outside America, na so e go still be for front.
For example, for one place wey dem dey call Africom, e get one place wey dem dey call West Africa and Africa wey dem dey call Nigeria. As we dey do everything wey we fit do to make peace dey the place wey dem dey call Liberia and Sierra Leone, we still dey keep peace for the whole world.
Dem dey call Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI ) wey government for Clinton dey give Africa people.
For example, one man wey im name na Warren Christopher, wey im name na Clinton’s Secretary of State, go preach for different country for Africa.
But because na the place wey dem dey call Nigeria, e leave am from the road wey e dey go.
Senegal, wey no far from where dem dey call Liberia and Sierra Leone, go be the coordinating base for ACRI. Even though sey dem use am as the main thing wey dem dey do to help people for Africa.
Dem come talk about this one because dem no like the thing wey dey France. Because of that one, the people wey come from America dey try to control only the area wey e dey.
For this topic, American people come see sey dem need to command African people to do other things wey dey cover different different place for this world.
Na im make the government wey dey Bush junior come arrange am well well so that e no go only enter Nigeria, but e still arrange am well so that e go continue to dey think about how many Chinese people dey enter Africa.
US Central Command (USCENTCOM ) wey dey Florida, dey Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM ) wey dey Stuttgart for Germany, dey Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM ) wey dey Florida, dey Latin America and the Caribbean.
Dem dey call Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin.
American people still get drone base for Niger.
If we join Africa comot for Nigeria, we go stop to do everything wey we fit do to support France and America.
Make we no forget sey people for France and America no dey always agree with wetin we want do for Africa. Na so e still be for Africom wey we go stay for Nigeria.
Today, we no dey face any problem wey our army no fit bear.
This one na after all the army wey come save Liberia and Sierra Leone. Dem arrange their army well well so that people no go fall for that country. The army wey Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe get far reach many miles.
E dey pain us sey the army for Nigeria don stop to do the work wey people wey no be government dey do, dey do now.
But the main thing be sey, the army wey dem dey call Nigerian army no dey fit and fit win all this wahala for our country because dem know wetin dem suppose do and wetin dem suppose do.
We need to do everything wey America people fit do to help us if dem ready to help us.
But even with the wahala wey we get, we still dey think about wetin happen to Africaicom before, and wetin go happen to our brothers and sisters.
Even though sey e no easy for Plateau, e want use 7 metric tons of Irish potato put for ground
Plateau State dey among the people wey dey cultivate Irish potato for Nigeria. The potato dey cultivate for nine area wey dey 17 area wey government dey.
The Potato Value Chain Support Project of the African Development Bank (AfDB ) wey dem dey call Plateau, talk about 90 per cent of the potato wey people dey produce for country like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and other people wey come from Nigeria.
PotatoPRO.com na one of the people wey dey direct the potato work for the whole world. The potato wey dey Plateau State, don make Nigeria the fourth country wey dey produce potato well well for sub -Saharan Africa.
But the farmers still dey talk sey dem no go fit put sand sand sand and road net, and the farmer no go too cost. Dem no go still dey produce plenty potato for the country and dem no go fit sell am.
Other things wey fit make us no get money, and wey fit make us no get money, na sickness, sickness, sickness, sickness, and poor seed.
National Bureau of Statistics talk sey Plateau State dey among the 10 country wey poor pass for Nigeria.
But the money wey this country get, better pass the one wey this country get. This one mean sey, the money wey people dey buy potato no go dey again.
One brother wey im name na Thomas Muopshin, wey be Project Coordinator for the Potato Value Chain Support Project, talk sey na nine area wey dem dey call Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGA, be the potato hub wey dey the state.
Dem dey produce more potato than any other LGA for their country.
But e get one man wey im name na Muopshin, e talk sey eight LGA wey remain fit produce potato. Plateau get 17 LGA wey fit produce potato, especially when season dry.
But the Association of Potato Farmers ( APF ) wey dey the state, talk sey if dem no settle any problem wey concern the chain of value, the people for the country go continue to produce and sell more potato.
For one interview with one brother wey im name na Lazarus Makut, wey be Plateau State Chairman of APF, wey im name na Daily Trust, e talk sey small grass no reach anything.
E talk sey e cost well well for many farmers wey no fit buy mechanic farm.
Another farmer wey im name na Martha Mamgup, dey grow potatoes for Ampang town wey dey Mangu LGA, talk sey water no reach when season dry.
Because of this one, e talk sey many farmers dey find land wey dem go chop. Dem dey find land wey dem go chop.
Martha still talk sey because of the high cost wey farmer get, many farmers no go fit get better result. E still talk sey if the farmer no reach anything, the result fit affect the plant.
This one still dey make many of us stop to do business.
So, e no easy for us to get belle.
The sister talk sey if dem build more dams and boreholes to irrigation, dem go come produce plenty potato.
E talk sey if the water no reach the time wey the plant go grow, e go dry and e go later die. Na im make some farmers wey get the money like to dig boreholes for Mangu because, if no be that time, e go hard for the farm to dey dry.
Irish potato for market wey dey Jos
After the laboratory finish, the production reach 7 million metric ton
Plateau State go produce potato from 1,656,650 metric tons for 2017 go reach 2,359,890 metric tons for 2020.

For the COVID-19 wey dem block for Nigeria, some people wey dey do bad things like government and other people wey dey do wetin dem no like. Dem still scatter many of this things and some of dem still dey today.
For example, dem lie about Domino pizza, government government lie about money and property, N20, 000 Dangote lie about money and other people lie about wetin dem dey sell.
Even though sey some of dem dey Diaspora, some young people still dey for Nigeria.
Dem dey always arrest dem, dey suffer dem, and dem dey suffer dem.
If we know the kind bad things wey people dey do, e fit help government to fight the bad things wey people dey do.
Many people for this world like this family.
Na the place wey people suppose take care of normal human being.
Apart from sey many family for Nigeria poor well well and dem no fit take care of their pikin well, some of dem don start to chop well.
For many house, e no easy to train papa and mama about the kind bad things wey dem dey do. Dem dey arrest their papa and mama with their pikin wey dey do bad things.

Dem value lie as people wey dey lead for politics ( and many times from house ) dey deceive people to vote for dem, and dem no de do wetin dem promise.
This one na the main thing wey people for this world dey learn about hushpuppism.
People wey dey do government work dey use am spoil people mind every day.
Dem dey see how their system take dey help people wey dey do bad things ( public or private matter ).
Dem dey ask the brothers sey, if dem talk sey dem lie about the matter, dem go punish am well well?

Young people dey happy as dem dey live their life well well for the place wey dem dey.
Dem dey see how poor people wey want put hand for politics take become millionaire before dem start to rule.
Dem dey see how people wey dey direct government take dey contribute.
Apart from that one, other school dey give people better things instead of money.
Anybody wey no manage the money, dem go get soft landing.
Another thing wey we don learn from this place be sey, some people wey dey music from Nigeria dey talk about cybercrime as work and game wey everybody dey do, no be bad thing.
If we choose people wey dey do partial, dem go give law about the bad things wey dem dey do?
E good make we check wetin we go do if we no want make people wey dey support Jehovah organization dey put hand for politics wey don scatter their property.
E dey pain us sey people wey dey lead for the party no dey talk bad about wetin dem dey talk.
Dem dey give platform wey go help people wey dey fear to copy their character. And the bad things wey dem dey do dey make our faith strong more more.
Greed still dey put eye for the bad things wey people dey do.
Donald Voiret wey be agent for FBI wey dey ask Rufai wetin happen, talk sey na serious wahala dey cause.
But wetin dem talk about this matter dey affect all the tax payers.
If we dey do like that, we no go fit dey sin and we no go fit think sey the grace go plenty.
Nigeria need to clean im system so that corruption no go dey again. E still need to put hand for politics wey go help people know where dem suppose do reach.
Make we make sure sey young people for Nigeria get work wey dem fit do. Make we make sure sey poverty no too dey, and make we change how Jehovah take dey bless dem.
IFCC need to put eye for things wey dey make people know the things wey dey happen. E need to put eye for things wey dey make people know the matter.
Before dem arrest Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang, the police need to arrange wetin dem go do.
If to sey dem dey use social engineer settle the bad things wey people for Nigeria dey do, e no go hard dem to stop the bad things wey people dey do.

How e be for person to born pikin when e dey sick By Dil Afrose Jahan
When people hear about death for everywhere, new life dey make person happy and get hope
For January 1, 2020, one morning, two red lines change my life.
I get belle and I happy.
We happy well well when we start new year.
This na the year wey better pass for my life.
As time dey go, everything come change.
My first daughter, Roshomon Tara, born for one place wey dem dey call Dhaka, for Bangladesh. E dey nine months now.
Na im make I come be mama when wahala full everywhere.
E get one sister wey im name na Tara. E get one sister wey im name na Tara.
For example, e get one sister wey im name na Tara.
Dem dey fear sey dem go hold am or come near am pass before, even if dem no wear any mask.
If bad thing no happen, my journey go different from my own.
My pikin don dey front of me now, e dey smile and e dey take care of me.
Last Mother’s Day, my mama dey grow inside me.
But the only thing wey e no change na the bad thing wey happen.
Na 16 weeks I get belle when the heavy rain fall and the earth come close.
E dey hard me to survive the bad thing wey happen to me when my hormone and body dey change.
That 22 weeks just be like war.
My husband wey im name na Sina Hasan na musician, and dem cancel all the concert that time.
Na since January 1, 2020 I be freelance journalist.
So, we dey put mind for wetin I don save for all the years, and we dey spend all the things wey I dey save.
Our papa and mama and two people wey dey preach together dey wait for the time wey dem go help us.
I come dey fear everything.
Many times, e just be like death
I dey knock door.
I dey learn how to live new life for Internet, and na there we come dey give people our property.
I wait for one week before dem comot my body from the bad thing wey dem do.
I even dey fear to send the only person for my family wey dey stay with me go buy food for house.
So I no come dey chop too much.
Apart from that one, I no fit go check -up for my plan.
And I no sure sey my pikin don grow well or sey everything dey happen when the time reach.
I dey pity for my pikin wey no get pikin, sey I dey bring am come another world pass before.
The time wey I reach the last trimester, I come dey face some of the wahala.
I forget wetin my gynaecologist talk.
I no fit remember wetin happen if e no come from the place wey dem dey call PPE.
I need to know wetin fit happen to person wey no be my husband or wife, wetin I go do before, and wetin I fit do to get hospital.
Many things dey flow for the whole world.
When I get this kind thing for mind, my mama, my mama, and my mama fit help me. Dem no fit help me when I get belle.
For example, papa and mama wey don old for their family don dey teach their pikin wetin dey their mind and wetin dey their mind.
E get many things wey don make me fear because I no know wetin I dey learn and I no understand am.
So, I come dey think about the kind new mama wey dem born that time.
I see the kind life wey I dey live for social media.
I dey read many things for social media when I dey follow one group wey pass 100,000 women wey get belle and wey dey give pikin, wey help each other to survive the wahala.
E pass 100,000 women wey get belle and wey dey born pikin. Their story don pass 100,000.
E get one of the group wey help me see one hospital wey dem dey call hospital.
Another group help me settle the wahala wey dey worry me for the time wey I get belle and when my pikin dey deceive me.
E pain me sey I no go fit meet my papa and mama, my family person, or my friend to welcome another person for my family.
Dem born my pikin for August 25, 2020, for the same hospital wey dem dey call Azimpur Maternity.
E come meet another pikin when e dey four month for December 31, 2020.
Another family wey get two pikin, wey be like sey na the first time wey I meet my neighbor near house.
Everyday, we dey think about the number of Covid-19 cases wey happen now.
When people hear sey people don die for everywhere, the new life come make person happy.
For mama to win the war, na to born pikin when wahala dey, and to take care of the pikin by imself, to make sure sey the pikin no get life wey no go end.
E no easy for us today because of how we dey do things with people, how we dey feel, and how we dey feel.
I dey thank the pikin for the light wey dem take dey shine.
I thank my pikin, wey be my mama and wey help am fight this wahala.
For example, e get one brother wey im name na Dil Afrose Jahan. Im name na National Geographic Society’s Emergency Fund for Journalists.
Na National Geographic Society dey support this work.
Asaba talk sey dem no know where dem suppose do reach, dem no know where dem suppose do reach and dem no know where dem suppose do reach
By Segun Tomori
E never tey wey government for Southern Nigeria come meet for Asaba. Dem don arrange many things about the state of the country wey people dey call Asaba Declaration.
The meeting wey dem go do, show sey dem no dey sure again for the country. Some jingo people for the country come dey fight dem and dem come dey threaten people wey go kill dem.
The truth be sey, the 17 governor dem no gree join the meeting and dem no gree join the meeting. This one show sey dem get serious business.
Na the main thing for this world be sey, the government want make dem change their country and make dem stop to use open grazing.
Some of the main things wey we fit learn na : the quarrel wey government go dey do, how people go take change their power, the form of money wey people go get for Federation, and why e good make we dey talk with each other about the matter for the country.
Even though sey the governor dem no dey support any side for government, dem no dey support any side for government, and dem no dey support any side for government. Their plan na one cardinal tenet wey dem dey call All Progressive Congregation ( APC ) wey dey rule, wey dem dey call Gov. El-Rufai wey dey lead the Committee on True Federalism.
One of dem think sey the people wey dey lead for APC go use wetin Asaba talk take support dem. This one mean sey the people wey dey lead for APC go support dem well well.
Instead, we come see sey we dey try to play for the gallery and for some quarters.
El-Rufai Committee don talk sey make dem change the power wey government get, how dem go take dey control the money, how dem go take dey police government, how dem go take dey control the money wey government get, and how dem go take dey check the money wey government get.
Since that time, President Buhari don dey support the government for the area, the government for the area, and the government wey dey judge matter well. Na this one make am change the statutes and give am ‘ Executive Order 010. ’
Because of the country wey security and the country wey money no too dey, e good make dem put all their mind for this two - tribe area.
Even though sey dem call Nigeria the country wey GDP high pass for Africa, we still dey do everything wey we fit do to change how we go take live better life for many of our people.
For example, the money wey we dey spend reach about $ 35 billion every year, no reach to take care of about 220 million Nigerians.
For South Africa, about 58 million people get budget wey reach $ 75bn for 2019. Their Social Protection Programme reach 17 million people for South Africa
Even though sey e no easy and nobody fit praise am, e still be like sey e no reach to control imself.
Na this place dem dey control their property and their power.
All this things wey we dey do, show sey we no get business again for Exclusive list.
Almost all the state for this country get money and property wey dem fit use do business.
For the country wey dem dey call Abuja government, people dey gather all the money wey government dey give dem. Dem no dey gree do anything wey dem fit do to make sure sey dem do am.
As El-Rufai committee talk, make we check wetin the government go gain because dem go still get more work for the government.
But, as Richie Norton talk, make you no run comot from fear, no be around am.
E don tey wey we don dey fear sey government go dey control people. E be like sey the police for Nigeria plenty well well and dem no too dey control dem.
As e be for some years now, na so e still be for the former vice president wey im name na Osinbajo.
We need to comot our fear and comot am.
One thing wey we fit do na to use law wey go help us get the State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC ).
Na so e still be for the Federal Police Service Commission (PSC ) wey dey do the work. But the power wey dem get to do more work for congregation and to dey direct matter well.
Even though sey the governor dem don restore open grass, e no be new thing. Na National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP ) wey the National Executive Council ( NEC ) sey make dem do.
International Crisis Group (ICG ) talk sey na NLTP for Nigeria dey do everything wey dem fit do to comot the animal system wey no dey work.
The main thing wey we go do na to make sure sey people wey come from another place go stay or open grazing. This one go make the quarrel between the farmer and the farmer no go dey again. So, we dey sure sey some people wey come from another place wey dem dey call myop and wey dem dey call myop and wey dem dey call myop and wey dem dey call myop and wey dem dey call myop and wey dem dey call myop.
The government for the country and the federal government go quick do the new plan, so that we go fit put all the farmers wey dey stay farmer hand for us.
For the 2014 National Conference and the advice wey the Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee give about True Federalism, na im make dem no need to call National Dialogue.
Two of dem talk sey, the governor dem wey dem choose and the people wey dem choose for National Assembly fit do wetin dem fit do to make sure sey dem no put money for another jamboree.
Why e be like that? Why e be like that? Why e be like that? Why e be like that?
Na true sey many people for Nigeria want stay together, even though sey we no dey as one.
This one go make the ship comot from the breeze wey dey make people hate each other and wey no happy with each other.
The governor dem wey dey Southern government don talk sey dem want do wetin dem want do for United Nigeria because dem dey judge matter well, dem no suppose do partial and dem no suppose do partial.
Even though sey we get problem like other country, make we listen to ourself as US President Joe Biden dey talk.
