Constitution review: Shariah dey di south west before christianity MURIC
Di Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) don tell di Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) say make e mind e business and make dem stop to dey fight di Muslim right to dey operate Shariah.
Prof. Ishaq Akintola wey be MURIC Director, tok am for di statement wey hin make on Sunday
Dis follow a warning di PFN don issue against di move by any group to introduce Sharia law to di South-West through di constitution review wey dey go on by di Senate.
PFN and oda Christian groups dey fully aware say Shariah dey South West decades before di arrival of Christianity for 1842
Dem dey practice Shariah for Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, Muslim name) and
di Ede Shariah Court dey operate till 1913 for Agbeni area for di town
Dem move am go Agbongbon area for 1914
dem dey apply Shariah for Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) wey kpeme for 1906
Even di seventh Akirun of Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (died 1912), institute Shariah for Ikirun for 1910
Dis na just example of how di existence and spread of Shariah for Yorubaland and di christian leaders no dey oblivious of di fact say na di British Christian colonialists wey stop Shariah for Yorubaland and dey imposte Christian common law, Akintola tok.
E add say di PFN and oda Christians sef dey aware of di rising tide of Islamic awareness for di same South West and say dem only dey fear say di sleeping giant dey wake us to take back wetin belong to am
E tok say awa Christian neighbours know say Shariah na di Allah-given fundamental human right of muslims
But dem don determine to deprive us of am using unorthodox methods.
Dem believe say dem dey war wit Muslims and to dem, evrithin dey fair for war
Dem dey use both fair and foul means to achieve dia objective
We dey call on Nigerians make dem understand di siege mentality of awa Christian neighbours
Like all aggressors, dem believe say attack na di best form of defence.
As di benefactors and inheriters of colonial rampage wey last more dan one century, dem dey determine to keep all di loot wey dia principal bequeathed to dem
Dem dey determine to keep di Muslims for one concentration camp wey di colonial masters dey drove dem
Di constitution review don ask Nigerians make dem forward dia view on wetin dem want for inside di constitution.
Each group suppose submit im need.
But instead of say dem go tell di panel wetin di christians want, PFN don go ahead to say wetin dem no wan ask for Muslims
Na attempt to gag Muslims for di South West and e no go work
Hin tok say di claim to say religious tolerance for di South-West na sham and mantra wey dem design to keep Yoruba Muslims for perpetual slavery
Muslims for di region dey wake up and dey ask for freedom
We want make dem stop di forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law.
We demand civil Shariah, no be criminal Shariah wey involve cutting of hands but civil Shariah make e dey regulate Muslim marriage, inheritance, family affairs.
E no get anythin to do wit Christians
He tok say; we go use everi peaceful and constitutional means wey dey available to attain dis objective.

Buhari you fail us badly, I dey urgin Imo police make dem confront di culprit

Di IPOB, wey Emma Powerful tok am, no fault report wey link am to di murder of Gulak, as she note say di assassination of politicians no dey part of im agenda
We, therefore, state witout equivocation say IPOB no know nothing about di said assassination
For di first place, wetin threaten di late Gulak constitute to awa kos to warrant hin elimination?
we get nothing in common wit am and we no fit kill am anyhow
To dey point finger at IPOB for dis barbaric act na only meant to divert attention away from di real masterminds.
Dis na di same way terrorists wey dey for sekuriti uniform dey commit different atrocities for South East and dey kom around to blame IPOB for dia crimes just to tarnish awa global reputation
Dis na purely smokescreen to justify dia long-awaited plan to declare anoda special military operation for Eastern region to kil more innocent Biafra
Instead di security agencies go investigate di incident and possible factors, dem go change IPOB to accuse IPOB for crime wey we no know about.
IPOB get di itinerary of di late Gulak make dem waylaid am for airport
Di group tok say security agencies suppose investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, and im political opponents to establish dia possible involvement.

Di pipo wey do dis kind act na enemies of dis kontri.

We dey encourage am and oda governor dem for South Eastern State say make dem brace up, and confront di current security challenge make dem put an end to di bloodbath for di land.
Di enemies of di pipo dey always employ di weapon of fear to use create disaffection in di polity

Herder-farmer crisis for Nigeria don bikom ever dominating topic for all news platforms for Nigeria.
Ending Nigeria herder-farmer crisis: Di Livestock Reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey seek to curb di movement of cattle across di kontri and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict
While di Plan don earn di endorsement of plenti state goment, e dey face significant challenges
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about hin purpose, budgetary constraints wey di COVID-19 pandemic aggravated, lack of personnel wey get di expertise to carry am out and widespread insecurity, dey all di insecurity wey dey stop progress
If di Plan fail as previous initiative to modern livestock management don do, herder-farmer violence go fit escalate
Di National Economic Council approve am for January 2019, di Plan represent di most comprehensive effort wey dem go use overhaul Nigeria inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system
At di core na strategy wey go curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower di risk of conflict wey dey between herder dem and farmers
E dey animated by di hope say over 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists go be persuaded to move dia cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, wia breedingg farms and oda mechanised livestock management practices na to boost di sector productivity.
As di end of 2028 dey end, authorities go need get at least 119 ranches wey dey operate for all di participatin states, wey go create more dan two million jobs for di livestock production, processin and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buhari administration kom up wit di Plan afta wave of violence wey dey between herder dem and farmers, particularly a surge in related violence wey dey afflict rural dwellers for 2018
Di federal goment, wey don commit to funding 80 per cent of di transformation proposal wey di participatin states submit, don take preliminary steps toward putting di Plan into practice, wey include providing technical support wey go help states prepare for implementation, like to dey help dem do field survey and site mapping.
Plenty states don reactivate earlier demarcated grazing reserves, dey open offices and set up steering committees wey go administer di Plan
Authorities don also do workshops and done oda works wey go explain di benefits of livestock reform to a large audience
But two years enta di 10-year plan, di first new ranch wey dem neva build yet, and di obstacles plenti
Opposition, partly among herder dem, predominantly from di Fulani ethnic group but also from farmers wey resent di Plans benefits to pastoralists, e dey hinders reform efforts.
Distrust dey widespread for di Middle Belt, wey don be di scene of violent dispute ova land between herders and farmers, even witstandin peacemaking and military effort wey since 2018 don reduce di bloodshed
Federal and state budget dey pinched, partly due to di pandemic economic fallout, and di kontri lack sufficient technical expertise wey dem go use manage ranches and reserves.
For many states, especially for di North-West, di proliferation of criminal gangs and oda armed groups dey cut off access to grazing reserves and dey scare away potential investors
Unless dem don address dis and oda problem, e fit delay or even scuttle di Plan, e fit leave di kontri vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, wey fit degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
To tackle dis challenges requires concerted effort by federal and state authorities, wit help from donors and investors.
First, Abuja and di state goment wey dey support be say make dem provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication so dem go fit avoid misgivin and misperceptions about di Plan.
Dis dey especially prevalent among pastoralists, wey go change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and wey go legitimately doubt di Plans promises about available pasture.
But many farmers dey fearful too, say dem fit lose land to livestock producers.
Many pipo for di Middle Belt and Southern states dey deeply suspicious of di Plan long-term goals, wey dem see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, di Fulani
wit Abuja and oda partners support, state goment must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processin.
Federal and state goment make dem up budgetary commitments, make dem hasten di release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working wit donors and investors as necessary.
To stop rural insecurity, curbing impunity and to rehabilitate communities wey don affect earlier violence for participatin states dey also important
plus, authorities go need to consider climate changes likely impact and reach decision about how di transhumant herders wey dey cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from di Plan.
As some of dis steps go take time, di Plan proponents suppose focus on to deliver concrete, visible result for short-term.
less dan two years, di kontri go do general election
If di Plan na to survive di change of goment wey go follow, politicians go need to produce clear proof of im benefits (If im don serve two terms, President Buhari and plenti state governors no go fit compete, wey mean say change dey sure.)
By di time wey dem dey campaign heat up for late 2022, di backers of Plan suppose dey able to point at least one handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and di first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
None of dis go dey easy, but di Plan dey worth di effort
As e no dey perfect, e dey offer important chance to reform Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address di need of herder and small-scale farmers.
About 70 per cent of Naija workforce dey earn an inkom through agriculture
Modernising di livestock sector fit boost di kontri prosperity overall at di same time dat e take big step toward resolving one of Nigeria most dangerous conflicts.
wit di clock ticking down to di 2023 election, federal and state authorities go need to move quickly to make a visible mark, lest di work wey dem don do to create dis moment of opportunity go lost.
Dis piece na executive summary of a report on top di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how dem go take hasten im implementation, wey di International Crisis Group publish
Di kind problem wey I get wit di king
Shey una no agree?
Dem dey responsible for plenti proportions of food and cash crop production
Subsistence farmers be smallholders wey consume di majority of dia farm output and wey dem hold back from participating more actively for commercially oriented agriculture by variety of constraints
energy no dey for anyone wey no dey hapi for me
Na my own/ mine
Dis bring me to di conclusion say evryone na evil
Dem characterise dis system as complex, diverse and risk-prone
Farms dey generally small, dem dey always hold am under traditional or informal tenure, and dem dey for marginal or risk-prone environments
Yields dey low and farmers lack di capacity to increase yields.
we dey tok life and prosperity to dis day
send your account number
Di emphasis now dey on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farmin as a enterprise
i sabi eveything
Akpos and hin friend dey tok
Di yield wey small small farmers dey get dey profitable
Shey you dey kom?
Dis new challenge wey dey apun dey make many small farmers dey pursue livelihood strategies wey involve lower risk and lower yielding agricultural activities.
Shey you be witch
I dey my way to sabo market go buy some food stuff
make I dey call my Papa
As developing kontri population dey grow larger, richer and more urban, di intensification of agricultural production go happun for rapidly changing agri-food value chains
How far wetin dey, make i dey my way?
Dis development dey shift di competitive advantage away from small farmers
E dey important make we find solution to di problem
Dis go require integrated approach of methodologies
di loan sharks dey e neck
dis kain thing
i dey errand from my place of work
Di water don flood di whole farm
Farmers plenty battle for 2020
For many farmers and oda stakeholders for di agro sector, di year 2020 go remain one of di worst year for di history of Nigeria bikos e introduce new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers go contend wit
Di agricultural sector dey confronted plenti challenges, from di climate change-related issues, conflicts and di complications wey di global COVID-19 pandemic bring pains and heartbreaks to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, di covid-19 lockdown and restriction apun for di time dry season farmers dey wan harvest dia crop and wet season farmers wan start to dey cultivate dia crop.
Many farmers no fit access dia farms while for odas, dem go get labourers to harvest dia farms since mechanization dey big challenge and harvest na manual, na di problem
Movement restriction don introduce to stop di spread of di coronavirus locked down market don disrupt di rural economy
Plenti farmers no fit sell dia produce to allow dem buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services
Even wen dem lift di lockdown for agricultural sector, di price of fertilizer don high so tey many smallholder farmers no fit afford am
For some place, di price go as high as N13,000 for 50kg bag of indorama and Notore Urea
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 wen di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti places and areas wia r dey di price don rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places
For farmers for Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some part of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandit activity no only deny dem access to dia farm but e also leave plenti pipo die for dia farm
Dem raze plenti farming communities down
dem kidnap plenti pipo for ransom
plenti pipo don pay large sum of moni or dem surrender large portion of dia harvest to di bandit
Many villages for di states don bikom desolate
Di agric sector also witness one of di worst disasters wen floods destroy ova 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields wey be say na N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Dem neva compensate plenti of di affected farmers as dia livelihood na hin dem destroy
Di flood be di worst since di 2012 disaster wey bring havoc across most of Naija's coastal cities and flood-prone areas wey dey kill pipo and destroy farmland
Meanwhile, as di flood dey put pain for di heart of farmers up North, farmers down South dey confronted wit drought.
for two months, farmers dem see helplessly as dia investment for crops don shy away
No dey disguise
Anoda subsector wey dem badly hit dis year na poultry and feeds.
Di scarcity of maize from di beginnin kos why di price of dem go increase
Poultry Association of Nigeria sef force di Federal goment make dem send save awa soul appeal to di federal goment for urgent attention
Di federal goment respond to di appeal and release 5,000 metric ton of maize from di nation strategic reserve to di farmers in addition to dey give some of di big players license to import about 222 metric ton of maize to use increase di shortfall for di feed industry.
Howeva, dis na just short-term solution as barely three months later, di scarcity of soyabean struck, making di farmers express fear say by 2021, di industry go shut down completely
Di scarcity na serious feed crisis in di industry as di price don reach a record high for hin history as e dey rise from N2,600 for February to N5,500 now
Di poultry industry lose an estimated N7 million jobs wit figure wey dem project say e go reach 10 million by January 2021, but dem estimate di loss for investment conservatively at about N1.5 trillion.
While di poultry farmers still dey struggle to deal wit di challenges wey marred di subsector, di crop farmers despite di daunting challenges wey confront di sector throughout di 2020 farming year, get buyers kom right up to dia farms even before dem harvest to make bulk purchase arrangements.
Na dis be di first time wey di price of grains don dey refuse to kom down for harvest time, wey go start hunger and di call for di borders to dey open, wey go allow smuggled products pass di kontri's porous borders.

How North-Central go fit optimize open grazing ban for South APC leader
As open grazing controversy trends dey for di public domain, wit Southern governors dem dey slamming ban on it during dia meeting for Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association for Nigeria (FEAN) and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum for FCT, Honourable Obaje David, examine how di North-Central governors dem go respond to di ban.
Recently, di Southern states governors meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and oda form of criminalities
Na wetin be your take on di heated controversy wey dey generate for dis decision
every human being get right to do actions and opinions.
But di important tin be say una suppose know di consequences wey dey happun wen una take una action
Una suppose dey able to consider di advantages and disadvantages.
I no be one of dose wey dey tok say e dey good or bad
As a Nigerian, you get di right and liberty to live anywhere for di kontri in good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
On dis basis, I no go yarn say na beta tin be dat
But as a leader for North Central, I go say e dey good, especially for di North Central Zone, due to di potential economic benefit for us and di nation
Di ban na advantage for us
We need tap into am and see how we fit make am real venture and make moni from am
Luckily, we get landmass wey plenty to accommodate di herders, no mater di number wey fit troop from di South into di North Central
Na wetin be your position on open grazing?
No be me be one of di propagators of open grazing
I believe more for ranching, wey I dey practise as individual
I believe say if we take to ranching, e go work out for us
Di North Central governors suppose accommodate di national programme on ranching
Dat kind move fit make di North Central a cattle hub wia pipo go always get access to cattle and all di allied products
and den e be means of economic empowerment for di North Central pipo.
We get di land, wey di southern states fit no get
look for Kogi, Niger, Kwara and odas
we fit accommodate di herder dem and ranching policy to awa advantage
Di challenge wey Fulani herders dey pose no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching
Di koko be say dem no dey teach dem on e advantages
Dem get nomadic culture
As a result, dem need dey educated well to embrace ranching.
We fit adopt di Kenya method, wia almost all di family get ranch and u no go see open grazing despite di large number of di cattle wey dem get
But na wetin di southern governors dey tok be dat?
Di governors no dey categorical for dis regards
Dem no dey call for ranching and for di federal goment make dem kom inside
wetin dem tok be say di herder dem don be problem to us and make we comot
Dem tok say make di herder dem go apply for land wit claim say herding na private business
But don dey tell dia indigenes say make dem apply for land like di herder dem
As one of dose wey dey involve for youth empowerment programmes, especially for agricultural sector and e value chains, why goment policies dem dey fail to realise dia objectives and wetin be di way out?
Firstly, no administation wey don fit touch di lives of pipo like President Muhammadu Buhari administration wey dey conveniently sit for your house and apply for facilities and you go get dem
Di target credit facility sef dey wey dem dey call COVID-19 loan
Many Naija pipo don conveniently get di loan for hundreds of thousands of naira from di comfort of dem house without even going to office
Also, as SMEs dey expanded like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and odas
Di challenge be say we get two sides of dose wey go believe in you and those wey go criticise you.
For pipo wey no believe in Buhari administration, there no be anythin wey dey beneficial
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit and we thank God for am.

And dis also attests to di fact say di National Assembly dey alive to di performance of im complementary role(s) wit oda arms of goment for di fight against corruption.
Na wit great delight and a deep sense of gratitude dat I write dis, wey dem don put togeda as platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed di whole world know wetin di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria dey about and di unique concept wey we bring on board in order to complement national efforts in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di passage of dis Bill by Senate, and in view of di fact say we dey operate bi-cameral Legislature, di ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, wey dey under di leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, di hon.
Speaker, follow suit and pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As u fit know, di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) don be one of di bill wey dey attack and dey antagonise plenti times in di National Assembly.
Sadly di attack kom from those wey suppose be partners in progress for di fight against endemic corruption for Nigeria, but have rather designated demsef as enemies of di general good.
gud dey good but e no get substitute so e dey bad
No mata how e take, gud always prevail over bad just as di superiority of light over darkness dey constant and unquestionable
E dey important make we get glimpse of how e all apun for di National Assembly
Di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na hin dey first pass into law by di 9th Senate on di 2nd day of March, 2021 afta dey don undergone di rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for its 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 di bill no dey without series of thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop at any length to see say any legislation wey go dey helpful in assisting di Buhari-led administration to fight corruption no see di light of di day but di senate stood firm and saw it through.
E dey important make di public know say (CIFIPN) no be just noble bodi but a novel one for Nigeria wey dem dey target to close di gap wey don dey exist for forensics space
Today, di journey to get standard bodi wey go regulate di practice of forensics for Nigeria dey at e peak and Nigerians go need rise to challenge di few anti-goment bodies wey go wan sabotage dis step.
Di passage of dis Bill by di National Assembly, no doubt, na clear demonstration of im patriotic zeal and di need to further strengthen all national efforts wey dey geared towards di fight against corruption, wey don stop development for evri aspect of awa national lives.
Dis legislative bold step, wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey quite historic and symbolic, wey dey kom for time wey Nigeria dey in dire need of legislation(s)
dat go give more bite to im anti-corruption drive in view of di raisein spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across di globe
As we know, crime generally, don take new dimension, sake of say advancement don dey in science and technology for di 21st century.
Therefore, di passage of dis Bill dey very important and timely and e don show clearly say we get flexible and responsive Legislature wey dey in tune and in touch wit emerging global realities and e dey ready to enact legislations wey go meet di yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
E dey very important to also state dat di journey, wey culminate into di passage of dis Bill, begin for di 8th National Assembly whereby, Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, di current President of Senate wen hin be Senate Leader, bikos of im strategic importance to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration..
for di benefit of hindsight, wen dem introduce awa Bill for di two Chambers during di 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearing na hin di relevant Committees conducted
Afta and in spite of opposition from stakeholders wey dey di minority, wey di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead, di National Assembly pass di Bill, bikos of im significance and di part wey e go play for di fight against corruption.
Aftaward, dem forward di Bill to Mr President for Presidential Assent, wey dem no give before di Dissolution of di 8th National Assembly for June, 2019
Na on top dis, say dem introduce di Bill for dis 9th National Assembly and dis time around, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya wey be di current Leader of di Senate, dey sponsor am in view of di importance wey dem attached to am.
We dey constrained make we make dis clarification so we go fit clear di air on di cheap propaganda wey awa detractors dey propelled say dem reject awa Bill by di 8th National Assembly.
Also worthy of mention na di fact say dem don mistake awa Bill for similar Bills, wey dem introduce for both Senate and House of Representatives Chambers recently
upon awa close scrutiny, we kon discover say dem na mere duplication of di intent and purports of awa Bill
Dey must emphasise say dem no introduce any of dis Bill for di 8th National Assembly, wey pass awa Bill
So, na we be di first person wey go ever kom up wit Bill of dis magnitude,(Forensic)
Afta we don see di urgent need to establish dat kain great Institute.
Di decision to establish di Institute na afta a painstaking study of how di Institutes dey operate for oda jurisdictions and how dem don help for crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
E dey important to note say awa Institute don dey so tey 2009.
And ova di years, we don train professionals wey dey for forensic science and technology, wey dem target at inculcating di requisite skills and acumen for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis make we fit eliminate material misstatement weda na error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cyber security; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
You go agree wit me say for today world, di conventional way of investigating crimes, wit a view to fight am don bikom obsolete
For us to do something meaningful for dis regards, e dey paramount say we align awaselves wit di global trend and innovertion wey dey evriwhere, wey dem target for fight corruption
E dey in line wit dis reasoning say di idea of establishing dis Institute na hin dem conceive wit a well-structure laudable objectives wey dey relevant to di anti-corruption drive of dis administration.
Time no go allow me highlight all di objective of di Bill hia
Howeva, I wish crave your indulgence to highlight a few of di objectives of di Bill, for di purpose of dis address, as follows:
To establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals for Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals for dis specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification wey go enhance di acquisition of di requisite skills in di use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;.
To provide platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in di usage of Forensic Science and technology tools and techniques in di investigation of frauds for both public and private sectors of awa economy, in line wit international best practices;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners wey dey for field, as a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and to develop mechanism for fraud prevention, as proactive measure against corruption generally;.
To fill di existing huge vacuum for awa archaic and conventional system of investigation wit di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di kontri from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates make dem do forensic investigations for Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and trainin programme wey cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, wey professionals like Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists dey involve
Dis go enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line wit global best practices; and
To enhance Nigeria anti-fraud mechanisms,throughdi provision of legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Nigeria, among odas.
E dey show say di role of dis Institute dey quite strategic and important
E dey pertinent to tok am again say forensic science na very wide and all-encompassing field, wey require effective and efficient regulation for di attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards.
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, include but no dey limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditin; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accountin; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
As I dey tok, you go agree wit me say awa Institute dey bring on board, a unique concept of crime detection and investigation wey dey comply wit international best practices
Dis concept don dey beyond di reasoning of those whose myopic view about di purports of awa Bill don beclouded their senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise system, wey dey outside dia jurisdiction and scope of operations.
As light dey, I wish draw di attention of evribodi to di funny scenario wey dey play out now, and as a mata of fact, e suppose be source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) kom out vehemently to oppose e passage bikos say, im be unnecessary duplication of functions wey dia Institute don already do.
upon di re-introduction of awa Bill for dis 9th National Assembly, and having seen di overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, awa Bill don received from di two Chambers, ICAN don now realize say forensic science na unique field of practice, and as we dey tok, dem don introduce a similar Bill wey dey currently before di House of Representatives, as dem fail woefully in dia attempts to stop di passage of awa Bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN don hold di view say make Institute wey no be dia own dey regulate di practice of forensic science?
your answer dey as good as mine
I wish inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), no dey show for dis funny theatrical episode
just like dia ICAN counterpart, dem don also introduce Bill for House of Representatives wit di nomenclature di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey dem initiate and ANAN promote
Na me decide to bring out all dis facts so dat Nigerians and even di international communities go understand di extent to which some pipo fit go in order to achieve dia aims.
Howeva, we no dey perturbed by dis developments bikos we believe in di credibility and ability of di National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do wetin dey right and not to allow demsef manipulate in any way, by dis unnecessary distractions, so as not to make mockery of di entire thing.
Di person wey dey know practical and antagonist of dis Bill don remain ICAN bikos say e don dey show now.
Dem engage several bystanders dem to dey write frivolous petitions some even dey target for di leadership of di Senate wit tone of blackmail
Afta dem fail for senate, di antagonists shift dia attention to di House of Representatives wit di same bystanders wey dey write all manner of publication join
Yet again, dey fail
By legislative procedure, a bill wey dem don pass by senate go only require concurrence by di House safe for wia observations dey
But for di case of CIFIPN Bill, di antagonist fought di passage of di bill until truth prevail and on di 19th May, 2021 di Bill for di establishment of di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin Standard Knowledge and Skils to be Attained by Persons wey wan become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) wey di House of Representative pass into law.
ICAN don now register im Bill for di House of Representatives wey dem title (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Dis ICAN new Bill get plenti provision for di practice of forensic, and also dem go establish Forensic University for Nigeria wey be say nobodi fit practice forensic for Nigeria, and violation of dis section go lead dat kind person to some years imprisonment.
Dis dey strange for a kontri wey dey full of enlightened pipo
My joy be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no mata di level of corruption therein
We don dey challenge di passage of di bill by di House of Representatives.
Make dem note am say, awa challenge for di bill no dey borne out of malice or ill will, but bikos we dey sure say di purpose of dis bill na to halt presidential assent under di guise of say e dey get similar legislation
We no go allow awasef and Nigerians to deceive dem wit dia antics
You go remember how ICAN vehemently oppose dis enactment of CIFIPN and for one of im sponsor publication by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria wey Engr.(Chief) lead

Di question na, wetin don change?
di same law wey ICAN don always tell di public say e get forensics dem dey seek for hin re-enactment
As always, while we no dey opposed to any group wey dey proposing di inclusion of forensics for im laws, we dey however concerned dat a bodi no suppose try to perpetuate esef.
ICAN and its cohorts don realise dia inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
so dem want get bodi for inside esef
Wetin dem dey fear pass na checks and balances, dem no go want anoda professional bodi dey investigate dia activities bikos dem sabi wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation

Nah between DSS and regional separatist
Repeated warnings by di DSS to persons and groups wey utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of di majority common folks of dis kontri, dey begin dey sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience force di prime suspects out of dia deceptive demeanour.
Lingering questions about who or which persin and group dem wey di security agency dey refer to dey promptly vapourized inside di heated rhetorical outbursts of di nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E kon dawn on all say na di pipo and group dem wey don dey kontinue to dey incite, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against one anoda in order to apparently inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS don dey charge for one of e warnings.
Interestingly, no one of dis prime suspects for di exploitation of some fault lines to kos ethno-religious violence for some parts of di kontri fit categorically distance itself from di treacherous and subversive activities wey di security agency detected.
Dem choruse a common conviction say di DSS know those wey dey responsible, di differing only for di respective direction of dia accusing fingers
As Afenifere torchlight dis pipo, dem know those wey dey responsible for dis acts but dem no fit touch dem bikos of dia connections, PANDEV don rehash e grouse about many pipo dem wey dey feel say dem dey alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, dey ask who dem be di pipo?
so tey di DSS know dem and dia satanic mission, make dem dey proactive in dealing wit dem
Di NEF sound unconvinced wit if som pipo dey push di kontri to deeper crises and dem dey know; make dem dey treat dem according to di law.
You no need to be spook to know wetin DSS know about each and all di flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why all of dem know say DSS know dem yet dey insist to dey pass di buck outside dia cliques.
Di truth be say dis champion of ethnic politics know of no better solution to Nigeria's myriad problems dan for dia sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord it ova di rest of di kontri as rulers, not leaders
So desperate and unscrupulous dem dey pursuing dia inordinate ambitions dat dem dey absurdly and dey frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all e take to excising di territorial contours of dia enclaves wit di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
As we fit tok am; breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups wey dey restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, dey easy to do.
Dis regional groups actually constitute major hindrances to di steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag independence
So tey as dem continue to dey parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long will dey regard Nigeria as an entitlement for dia ethnic stake in di population, to claim or seize and, if all else fail, deconstructed and disowned as failed state.
Wen dey meet, di agenda no dey for Nigeria progress and development, unless e leadership dey firmly for dia grasp, otherwise e dey all about heckling and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dia existence and activities go always dey different to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Anoda indictment wey dey undeniable for dis regional separatist na say dem bin dey self-styled political pressure group wey dey represent different ethnic groups.
From dia membership, e dey plain to see say dem consist of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di impetus to kom togeda, make dem remain relevant for a democratic system wey dem elect representative entirely from elected representatives through registered political parties wit legislative and executive institutions wey dem don establish to dey give good governance and dividends of democracy.
Di geo-ethnic groups only get a nasty nuisance value for awa democratik setting as dem dey persist for acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, wey dem no get brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey threaten and attempt, so dat, perchance, dey fit regain political relevance if dey no control.
Na why dia frequent clandestine meetings dey trigger security alerts
Wit dis kind predator-politicians wey dey lurk around di perimeters of power wit dubious intent of undermining an elected goment just bikos dem no dey involve, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest must dey link dia overt activities and di covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, wey dem join to make Nigeria no go governable.
double jeopardy describe di predicament of di Buhari administration having to contend wit such array of formidable foes unleashing incessant assaults on national security in a time of unprecedented economic adversity.
To dat extent, two groups of politicians fit be: those wey dey positively participating for di democratic dispensation as partners in moving di nation forward against all odds and those wey dey negatively engaged in sowing seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize di kontri.
As dia utterances and activities dey so, we all know dem
At di end of di day, majority of Nigerians be ordinary citizens whose condition of survival no dey determine by and no dey depend on di land of dia origin
dia daily struggle to make livin dey sustained by submission to di will of one God irrespective of differences of faith
Nigeria na dia fatherland wey dem get for mind to dey loyal, law abidin and prayerful, knowing say no get oda kontri wey dem go call dia name, togeda show how citizenship dey breed true patriotism
Dem too know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) dey resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one anoda in order to inflame di embers of tribal and religious discord for di politikal ambitions of dia leaders.
Soso di poor man's prayer na hin dey tok:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER!
Manzo Reuben na youth leader for Lokoja

Wetin no to wear for public: dey Negate Nigeria multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Was na coincidence say, as trouble dey brew for Kwara state recently, dem dey consider solution for di lower house of di National Assembly for di capital Territory Abuja
Di trouble for Ilorin na bikos some Christian faith schools no gree allow dia muslim student dem wear hijab to di schools.
Di solution to dis impasse na di debate on top di Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, wey dem tagged Hijab Bill by a section of di Nigerian media
Both events don spark heated and often emotional debates wey, for di bottom of it all, threaten to negate Nigeria multicultural identity and reality
Di whole idea for Kwara of di proprietors of di schools banning hijab-adorning Muslim students and dia sympathimer dem fit reduce to wetin no to wear for public.
Dis na di major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representatives di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Na wetin female Nigerians dey face becos of wetin dem dey wear for public
Di former dey clearly breach di fundamental human right of di Muslim student to express dia faith witout discrimination; even though di school fit get defence for say dem take dat kind position.
Di latter dey try assert dis right no be only Muslims but also Christians wia or wia dem dey threaten dem wit discrimination based on dia professed faith.
Running through di argument of di proprietors of di Christian faith schools wey dey Kwara, persin fit easily understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say Muslim children suppose go oda schools for anoda place if dey no wan conform
Di problem wey dey wit dis argument plenti
First, to tok say Muslim students suppose go anywhere unless dem don follow di school rule on uniform do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, di position dey beg di moral question: is im justifiable to base school rule bikos of Christian majoritarian nature di school
Den, thirdly, di go oda place argument dey appear to ignore di difficulties to dey change school for a pikin
Di inconvenience dey huge
Di act of changing schools for di pikin, educational psychologist go tell you, e dey interfere negatively wit no be only e emotional but e academic development too
Finally, di Christian faith schools by demself risk wetin dem dey call ghettorization as dem dey concentrate student wey get di same religion belief for different schools.
Di social cost wey dis exacts on di society dey enormous
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, wen e dey tok to di press, say di goverment dey convinced say e policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear dia hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey demchored on mutual respect and understanding.
For a kontri wey dey guarantee freedom of religion, wey sign di Declaration of International Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how e dey justifiable to deny a Nigerian child access to school wey e choice on di basis of di manifestation of hin religion
Na great concern bikos Nigeria dey sign di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR)
Di UDHR insist say all human beings dey free and equal, e no mata of colour, creed or religion.
E get 30 articles on rights and freedoms wey include, among odas, civil and policital rights, like di right to life, free speech and privacy
E also include economic, social and cultural rights, like di right to health and education
I find article 18 and 26 of UDHR wey dey very relevant to di issue under consideration and quote am in full below:
Article 18: Evribodi get di freedom to dey tink or believe wetin dey want, wit di right to religious belief.
We get di right to change awa beliefs or religion at any time, and di right to publicly or privately practise awa religion, alone or wit oda pipo.
All evrione get di right to education.
Make primary schooling dey free.
All of us suppose dey able to continue awa study as we wish
For school we suppose help develop awa talents, and be taught an understanding and respect for evribodi's human right
Dey suppose teach us to get on wit odas, weda dia religion, or kontri wey dem kom from
awa parents get di right to choose di kind school wey we go take go.
Dis kind laws na di instrument wey give Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar di equality to sit for di House of Representatives for US wey she dey wear her Hijab witout any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar na American politician wey dey serve as di U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019.
Na bill wey di Deputy Chairman of di House of Representatives Committee on Finance sponsor and member wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal konstituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi
Di bill dey wan address discriminatory conducts and prohibit religious discrimination wey dey concern hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment
E go prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and oda sectors from discriminating against persons, students or personnel wey dem dey based on dia religion belief or e manifestation.
Wen dem pass, di law go bury issues like wetin we see for Kwara for good.
E go also address di bigotry of some employer, or dose executive wey dey take dia prejudice to public office and allow dem to deycloud dia sense of judgment
Di law suppose be welcome development
Afta all, na to expand and expatiate di provisions of Nigeria constitution and di UDHR document as we don explain above
Na in line wit di same law wey dem pass recently for di kontri wey dey wan tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice di Disability Law and di Violence Against pesin Prohibition (VAPP)
While disability dey seek to end all form of discrimination wey dey based on a person disability, VAPP dey address domestic and oda gender-based violence for di kontri
One at a time, awa representatives for di legislative chambers dey tackle di social menace wey dey torment awa kontri through legal instruments
Dem dey address dis social ills no be say dem no get prior generic law wey go cover dem but bikos dem need to address dem more comprehensively so dat dem no go fit opacity.
While UDHR fit seem like far, distant document wey no get instrument of enforcement, di RDPP Law and odas like am wey dem provide to allocate punishment for offenders
Contrary to wetin e critics tok, as far as di RDPP Bill is concerned, nothing dey show attempts at seeking di enthronement of a state religion on any state wey fit domesticate di law eventually.
E no go against Section 10 of di Nigerian Constitution wey tok say Di goverment of di Federation or State no go adopt any religion as di State religion.
To peddle dis argument, becos di bill dey call on di general public make dem respect di rights of Muslim woman dem wey dey wear Hijab for public spaces wey dey slash Islamophobia only
For di final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female hin or her religious freedom dey negate awa multicultural pretenses
E dey negate di concept of equality, and basic human right wey dey for Nigeria constitution and di Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document
One bill wey go criminalize dat kind decimation wey dey based on religious ground, like di RDPP bill, na wetin dey welcome development

IBEDC don warn traders under power lines.
Di Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) don warn against trading under high-tension wire to avoid disasters
Chief Operating Officer (COO), Engr John Ayodele na im give di charge against di backdrop of di increasing trading activities under high tension wires.

Police don go afta newspaper vendors ova reports on IPOB
Police don harass newspaper vendors and readers for Aba wey be di commercial hub for Abia state
Daily Trust don gather since di weekend, policemen from di Aba Area Command don dey carry out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers ova reports on di indigenous pipo of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents tok say tension dey for Ama-Ogbonna Junction for di commercial city wen police raid di place on Sunday
One eyewitness tok say residents scampered for safety, as police officers shot dem sporadically, as dem dey try arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
Dem accuse di vendors say dem dey distribute newspapers wey get stories on top sit for house order by di Indigenous pipo of Biafra
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey be one of di eyewitness, don beg di state goverment and Igbo leader make dem call di police authorities make dem rein in on dia man so e go no go create crisis for di city.
Di kin pipo wey dey put into police dis days dey make me dey wonder if we really want anythin good out of dis kontri wey dem dey call Nigeria
How una fit dey chase newspaper vendors around for Aba, for dis modern world?
If you stop pipo to dey read hard copies of newspapers, you go also stop dem make dem no dey read di same story for Facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, among odas?
Na wetin be dis?
Dem kos panic on Sunday by dia shooting and noisemaking
di whole neighborhood think say dem dey kidnapper dem
Na later we discover say police kom arrest one vendor and readers, wey gather for hin newspaper stand
How police go fit fight newspaper vendors?
Wetin fit kos di kasala for 20 times?
Hin tok say di pipo no dey normal
Michael Anorue, wey be anoda resident yarn say almost di vendor stand wey hin visit for Aba
on Tuesday dey empty
He tok say we hear say dem dey tok on Saturday and Sunday say di newspapers get stories on di sit-at-home order in honour of Biafra heroes and my question na wetin dey wrong wit it
Di early political leaders for South East, make dem remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra wey big pass IPOB di beta for dem.
Shey proscription of IPOB mean say Biafra don dey proscribe too?
All of us be Biafras
On di 30th of May, di World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold a zoom conversation, dem dey talk about Biafra heroes wey die
why police no go to YouTube, Zoom and oda social media wey dem air am?
All dem do na to kom street kom start dey find trouble wey dey no dey necessary
I wish say di leaders for Igboland go warn those reckless police officers say make dem no allow wetin dey apun for Imo State make dem enter Aba, bikos e go be worst for evribodi
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna wey be Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), don deny say di police arrest newspaper vendors and readers for Aba
NAMA don kick as air traffic controllers dey lament poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) for Nigeria on Sunday don clash out ova dilapidated navigational equipment wey dey most airports for di kontri.
Di ATCs under di supervision of di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), tok say di situation dey threat to air safety.
Dem claim say di Kaduna International Airport no get kontrol tower wey go aid for safe aircraft navigation
The President of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, for one chat wit di newsmen for di weekend, tok say wetin dey exist for di Kaduna airport na watch room wey dem dey use oda aviation personnel and no be control tower exclusive for air traffic controllers.
He kom tok say oda airport for di kontri lack di necessary equipment for seamless navigation.
E explain say some airport no even get functioning equipment
Even Kaduna no get kontrol tower.
Wetin dem dey use be watch room (for firefighters), wey dem no build for dat purpose, and we don dey call on di goverment make dem do something
We go Sokoto, once e rain today, controllers go look for umbrellas wey go sit for di control tower, and wetin is it, some of di control towers wey dey attached to di terminal buildings were ceded to FAAN, while those wey stand alone dey wit NAMA, but we don approach di two organisations.
We still dey battle terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there.
Calabar dey; Airport wey you go go today no dey; you go say things dey work 80 per cent
NAMA don recently employed and train 40 new controller, but NATCA tok say di number too low to meet di shortfall
Howeva, di managing Director for di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim no dey true
Hin tok say di federal goment don invest hugely for improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations
E tok say na mere politics
Di goment don spend plenti for di recent past to dey improve aviation infrastucture
I dey tok am no be bikos I be di MD of NAMA
If una wan hear di truth, my suggestion don always be, ask di pipo for streets, ask di pipo for NAMA, dey go tell you, dem neva get am so good under dis administration
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok like dat
We neva get Category Three (CAT3), dis goment put two for place, two odas dey kom
goment just spend N1.7bn on top one mobile control tower
Also revitalisation go dey on top di safe tower
We dey revamping di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system
Oda sectors suppose dey jealous of us
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communications technology particularly di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers
Di internet don bring about a fundamental shift for national economies wey dey isolated from each oda by barriers to cross-border trade and investment,isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by di national differences for goment regulations
E-commerce sef dey foster direct access to distant markets and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities and e dey blur plenti of di current distinction wey dey between domestic and foreign companies to an extent saye practically impossible to determine di origin of di products
E-commerce no dey limited to di purchase of product, e include e-mail, and oda communication platforms, all information or service wey a company fit offer to customers over di net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support
Di major significance of E-commerce na di fact say e dey encourage single world trading system, wey access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of di world
Most of di statues wey dey exist for Nigeria don lag backward towards di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole
Plenti legal research and study dem don do on e-commerce for Nigeria
Most of dis studies dey of di opinion say di Nigerian legal system dey lay behind ICT-based legislation and say di existing statutory laws dey quite inadequate to address some of di legal issues wey dey affect e-commerce
Dis issue include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and many more.
Need dey, therefore, to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, wey go govern di emerging regime
Dey don state am plenti time say for Nigeria, significant efforts for di regulation of e-commerce activities dey still for di stage of draft Bills before di National Assembly.
E dey important to note say, even wia dem don pass dis bill to law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issues wey go call for legislative intervention.
Sake of di speed wey di internet dey permeatin commercial transactions for Nigeria, especially for banking and telecommunications sectors of di economy, wey we fit suggest be say make dem address di legal issues and problems wey dey presently confronting e-commerce for di kontri directly and expeditiously, in di interest of di teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To achieve dis, di National Assembly suppose pressuriSed into passin bills wey dey concern electronic commerce, a top priority so dem go fit enact am into law as soon as possible
For di interim, make awa courts take giant stride by interpreting di existing traditional law liberally so as to bridge di gaps therein in order to make dat laws amenable to electronic transactions, particularly for di emerging trend of di present-day information age.
Indeed, dem argu say legislation no be di only means wey dem fit use facilitate electronic transaction and documentation legally
Di courts fit also adapt to recognise electronic transactions in di absence of legislation or private contract.
As di Justice Bingham don put am before say: di common law get for di hand of judges di same facility as di law merchant for e dey adapt esef to di changing needs of di general public; principles no change, but old rules dem dey apply di change, and new rules spring into existence.
We dey hope say oda Nigerian judges go adopt dis judicial activism, Supreme Court justices go inclusive, especially for di areas wia awa current legislation dey inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of di emerging technological advancements.
We go get good precedence wey go ensure di protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability for di kontri
Di germane wahala wey dey regard to contract for E-commerce na documentation and signature.
Di provision of section 4 of di Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statute on real property and landed instruments, wey require certain contracts to dey write and dey duly execute
question den na would an electronic mark or sign constitute a valid sign-off of a contract by email and e go be binding
Plenti of dis issues still neva settle even for di UK, even say some decision dey favourable towards interpreting electronic signature
so marks for emails dey satisfy di traditional requirement of writing and due execution.
E-commerce transaction na paperless transaction wey dem dey make through magnetic materials like tapes or disks
Dis dey in contradict to di paper-based transactions wey dem dey embodied for permanent form and dem dey express am for words and figures wey dem dey usually authenticated by signature
We no fit alter dat kind transaction witout alteration on di face of di document.
for signatures, by di provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature for relation to data message conveniently satisfies any requirement for a handwritten signature in so far as e sufficiently identifies an electronic record to di individual.
Di provision of article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on dis issue
Thus, for di purpose to establish proof of electronic signatures
If dem use password, identification, user name etc go suffice
Derefor, one fit safely posit electronic signature for di purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence provided dem certify and incorporate am for electronic communication for di course of e-transaction
Also, oda legal wahala wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts
Di element wey make valid formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation
Di question na for wetin point dem fit make offer wey be say electronic business transaction or how dem go differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, for wetin point e fit be say dem don make intention to enter legal relation?
E-commerce require confidence and trust say person wey dey transmit order or invoce neva don alter and emanate from whoever dem appear to be from
Need dey for a guarantee level of privacy /confidentiality wit respect to information
last last, di rate of cybercrimes wey dey alarming for Nigeria, high level of illiteracy
E no be lie say electronic commerce na aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay for dis time
Di goment go beyond to dey create laws, make dem activate utilisation of di electronic delivery platform for hin commercial interaction and for delivery of goment services

Chad don pass new charter na hin dey name Deby son president
Chad don pass one charter declaring Mahamat Idriss Deby president, even as rumours of hin death dey trend on social media.
Mahamat take over in place of hin papa, Idriss Deby, wey dem kill dis week
Di charter tok say di 37-year-old son of di late war veteran, wey for Tuesday na hin be di transitional leader as head of military council afta hin father kpeme, go occupy di functions of di president of di republic and go also serve as head of di armed forces.
Di charter renew di constitution wey dey before and go dey implement am as di basic law of di republic, accordin to wetin e tok
Deby wey young don also be di supreme head of di army forces e tok
Deby's son don overseen hin father's security as head of di elite presidential guard and e don often appear alongside hin
Mahamat Deby wey dem know as di top commander of di Chadian forces wey dey assist a United Nations peacekeepin mission for di restive north of neighbouring Mali.
E sign one decree on Tuesday say make dem set out military council wit 15 generals, plus hin 14 oda pipo wey hin know say dey don be part of di late president circle of loyalists
Di council dey task dem wit 18-month transition to free and democratic election
Mahamat Idriss Deby dey also chair di military transition council, di council of ministers, di councils and superior committees of national defence, accordin to di charter
Di new head of state go promulgate legislation wey di 69 members of di national transition council adopt, wey dem name directly by Mahamat
Di Transition Charter, wey get 95 articles, also dey guarantee freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
Dem don set up transition goment, wey dem name by di new president
Di members of di army wey dem call to di transition goment dey discharge from all military duties, di charter tok
Chadian law
Di slain leader, wey rule wit iron fist for almost 30 years, succumbed to wound wey he suffer during a visit to di battlefield for di kontri's north wia Chadian soldiers fight against rebel group, na e di military announce on Tuesday.
As calm dey call, di army also announce 6pm curfew and shut di kontri border, while dem dey suspend di konstitution and dey dissolv di National Assembly.
opposition politicians for Chad don reject di army appointment of President Idriss Dby son make e take over in di wake of hin death
Experts tok say under Chadian law, di speaker of parliament suppose don take power afta Deby death and not hin son
Wetin di constitution tok be say if di president dey absent, or if e die, den di Speaker of di parliament dey in charge of di kontri for 40 days, and dem go put transition between elections until dem don hold Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, reporting from di capital, Ndjamena, tok am for Tuesday.
But di military don announce say di legislative assembly don dey dissolved and dat di constitution sef don dey dissolved, so wetin dem dey do na say dem replace di constitution wit dia own set of rules
Chelsea dey face possible point deduction afta brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face possible point deduction by hin FA for di team failure to control dia players, Mirror report
For seven years, di team don find pants down for seven rows wit opponents
Di brawl wey apun for clash on Tuesday night wit Leicester mark di seventh encounter Chelsea get wit Premier League teams.
Last week match wey dey between Chelsea and Leicester dey marred by skirmishes wey dey between di players of di two teams
As Chelsea don catch similar offense for di past, di FA decide to punish Chelsea
Leicester don also be charge for dia role in di brawl wey involved players and coaching staff following Ricardo Pereira challenge on Ben Chilwell.
For 2016, Chelsea sef dey charge for indiscipline say dem suppose warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar levy for dia part for mass bust-up durin match against Tottenham.
If e affect, di points deduction wey go affect dia season as dem dey go into final campaign for a top four spot.
US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and ova here
Na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo kom to have of di thousands of American GIs wey dey station for different military base for Britain during di Second World War
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers dey recurrent to pub brawls and dangerous knife fights wey build up a feeling of disdain for di yanks among di locals.
And dis na di pattern of behaviour wey dey among American soldiers evriwia for di hundreds of American military bases overseas from Okinawa for Japan, Stuttgart for Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga for Philippines.
Na why I dey perturbed, like many Nigerians, dat inside a virtual meeting wey I get last week wit di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari dey reported to don ask dat di United States consider relocating di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey don base for di southern German city of Stuttgart go Africa.
Dem dey presume say wit dis call, President Buhari dey make pitch for Nigeria to host Africom
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State
Di meetin suppose be wit Blinken Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, wey go transmit di details aftawards to di president
Yes, America be superpower and all dat, but protocol na protocol and dem suppose follow am strictly for all circumstances
Understandably, Nigeria dey currently faced wit gargantuan internal insecurity issues wey defy di best efforts of goment and di nation security establishment to tackle am.
Unrelentin terrorist insurgency for North East, banditry, kidnapping for di North West, farmers/herders clash all ova di kontri and di targeted kilin of security and law enforcement personnel and oda Nigerians coupled wit di destruction of institutional buildings for di South East, constitute di cocktail of insecurity wey dey donravage di kontri.
But even for dat, di call for di hosting of di Africom for Nigeria soil wen we consider against di various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria is hardly justified
Africom na one of nine such command wey di American military establishment use exclusively serve America strategic interests around di world
By dia doctrine and operational modus, dis command, particularly those outside America like Africom, no dey set up primarily to concern demsef wit di security and law enforcement issues for dia area of coverage
Dem only do am wen dis kind issue affect America interest for di area and for dat kind situation, dem no mandate dem to yield dia modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agencies.
If dem set up Africom for Nigeria for instance, e go be like island wey go dey restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establish jurisdiction wey go dey within di territorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies
As e dey always apun wit American military base for outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against di host kontri.
For di particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na actually to contain di growing strategic influence of Nigeria for West Africa and Africa afta awa successful peace enforcement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa sterling record of peace wey dey around di world
Africom's precursor na di Africa Crisis Response Initiave (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to counter Nigeria strategic interest for Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, make plenti secret and open visit to number of Afrika kontri to sell di idea
But bikos say Nigeria na di target, e pointedly leave am comot from hin itinerary
Senegal, wey no dey far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem tout am as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, e secret protocols dey unmistakably military and strategically target for Nigeria
Due mainly to undisguise hostility to di idea from France, wey be averse to seeing di Americans dem trying to butt into an area wey e consideras hin exclusive sphere of influence, di ACRI concept na hin dey review
For di review, wey bring di expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di American congress dey kontrol for secret sessions, di Americans consider and realise di need to set up African command make dem fit add to di oda command already dey place wey dey cover different continents of di world.
As e dey based on recommendation of dis assemblage of experts wey dem draw from all facet of America political and security establishment, dem set up Africom for di Bush Junior administration wit a wider mandate wey no just make e contain Nigeria but also make e dey keep an eye on di Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom go be to Africa wetin US Central Command (USCENTCOM), wey dey based for Florida, go be to di Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), wey dey based for Stuttgart, Germany, go Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), wey dey based for Florida, go be to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Na French military presence dey already surrounded Nigeria for Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin
Di America sef get drone base for Niger
Adding Africom to di mix for Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America
Make we keep in mind say awa strategic interest and profile for Africa no always cohere wit dose of France and America, di hosting of Africom for Nigeria go be di equivalent of letting di wolf into di chicken coop.
Notin dey for dis insecurity wahala wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed force no fit cope wit
Dis na afta all di military force wey secure Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents for those kontris from a long logistical supply line wey dey thousands of miles; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but few of di many gallant Nigerian soldiers wey distinguish demsef for those operations.
E dey regrettable say di military of Nigeria, as e don fall from di high standard wey dem dey know, dey struggle now to cope wit di activities of non – state actors internally
But intrinsically and essentially, di Nigerian military retains di capacity and capability to defeat dis threats to awa national security given di right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all di assistance and cooperation wey di America fit give us if dey so willing
But even as awa circumstances dey arm-twisted to hosting di Africom in view of im antecedents and implications to awa strategic interests, on awa soil
As challenges dey so, Plateau don target 7m metric ton of Irish potato
Plateau State na di number one grower of Irish potato wit di tuber wey dem dey produce for nine of di state's 17 local goment area
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di Afrikan Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as say na 90 per cent of di potato production for di kontri dey acount wit kontris like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin wey dey receive large supply of potato from Nigeria
Accordin to PotatoPRO.com wey be di leading information source for di potato industry, dis don make Nigeria di fourth biggest producer for sub-Saharan Africa.
Howeva, farmers tok say inadequate dams and road networks, and high cost of fertilizer and oda farming inputs continue to pose a major setback in di production of sufficient potatoes for di nation and for export.
Oda challenge wey dey contribute to low yield and harvest losses to di potato value chain include diseases like blight and bacterial wilt as well as poor seedlings.
According to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di 10 poorest states for Nigeria wey get poverty rate of over 70%
Di state get comparative advantage wey go boost economic activities wey go improve di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain
Di Project Coordinator for di Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say though di viability of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment area wey dey Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs na di potato hub for di state.
Dem dey produce more potatoes dan any LGA for di kontri
Muopshin, howeva, tok say adaptability research don indicate say di eight LGAs wey remain dey equally viable to produce potato; wey make all of Plateau's 17 LGA potentials to produce di tuber, especially for dry season.
Di association of Potato Farmers (APF) for di state don tok say unless challenges wey dey affect di value chain dey address squarely, increased production and export for potato go continue to dey elude di nation
Di Chairman for APF, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wey im get with Daily Trust, tok say inadequate smaller dams dey, especially for remote areas wia potato farming dey viable as well as poor roads and high cost of farm inputs, wey go continue to dey affect potato outputs.
E tok say di cost of mechanised farmin wey fit rapidly increase productivity don bikom expensive wit di majority of farmers wey be small scale producers wey no fit afford mechanization.
Anoda farmer, Martha Mamgup, wey dey grow potatoes for Ampang town for Mangu LGA, tok say inadequate water for di dry season dey affect potato farmers and e dey lead to annual low yield
she tok say, bikos of dis, plenty farmers dey search for borehole locations to farm to access irrigation water for dia farms
Martha explain say di high cost of fertiliser prevent many farmers make dem improve quantity and quality of yield, as she add say insufficient fertiliser dey affect di crops output
Di cost sef prevent many of us from expanding di business

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve month ago, dem arrest Ramoni Abbas (37 years) wey dem popularly know as hushpuppi for June 2020 for Dubai bikos dem allege money launderin from business email compromise fraud and oda scams wey target firms and English premier league club
E make a total sum of $435 million afta defraudin 1,926,400 victims
Afta 1 year, Abidemi Rufai (also wey dem dey call Sandy Tangâ), Senior Special Assistant for Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun sef arrest by di Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for John F Kennedy Airport, New York ova a criminal complaint wey defraudin Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di stolen funds na pandemic relief fund wey di Washington State design for pipo wey fit don suffer job losses as a result of di COVID-19 pandemic.
Di fraud incident apun for di lockdown and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster wey go don dey for Nigeria's Federal House of Representative wey dey make laws if e no lose di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of di pipo Democratic parti (PDP).
Di fraud na em stealin di identities of more dan 100 residents dem by filing false claim wit di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity wey dem thief, dem create separate e-mail account so di claim pipo go join different persons and e fit escape automatic fraud detection systems.
Afta, dem pay more dan $288,000 for hin American bank account between March and August 2020
Cybercrime na global threat to individual, organisation and kontri dem.
Nigeria dey lose more dan $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year
By 2021, di world go don lose $6 trillion.
till date, ova 40 Nigerians don dey investigate or dey investigate for dia complicity in fraudulent scams by di FBI
Rufai's alleged unemployment benefit fraud fall under wetin I call COVID-419 fraud for Nigeria
Na fraudulent scams wey dey leverage on top di loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic create to scam pipo, goment and organisation dem
For di covid-19 lockdown for Nigeria, cybercriminal pattern dia frauds along di intervention of goment and private sectors and scam plenti and some of dis scheme still dey exist till date.
Domino pizza fraud, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud sef dey
While different groups dey wey dey engage for cyber-criminality for di Diaspora, some youngsters dey do am for inside Nigeria
Dem dey arrest, tried and convicted by di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)
Understand di cultures wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment to fight di crime.
Di family na di microcosm of di society wey big
Na di place wey normal human being suppose dey nurtured for di society
Apart from di fact say plenti Nigerian families dey di dungeon of poverty and dey no fit take care of dia pikin, some of dis children don bikom breadwinners, albeit, illegitimately
Di challenge dey wit ethical behaviour trainin for many homes as dem dey arrest parent wey dey involve wit cyber-criminality
For anoda area, mothers of yahoo boys dey form association wey go celebrate dia son success and dey justify dia criminal behaviours
For di religious setin, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalist dem go create house and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds
Moral teaching don give way to materialistic Pentecostalism
One video na hin dey viral wia dem show some boys wey dey spray money while those wey be shepherds for one supposed white garment church enjoy di moment while di captive members of di church, wey be female wing record di scene wey dey shameful
One pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria return to democracy don reach 21 years
Sadly, dem no grew up to appreciate lying as way of life from di mouth of politicians (and for many cases from home) wey deceive pipo to vote for dem and do not fulfil or jettison di campaign promises.
Lying itself na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Dem dey socialise Youths to corruption and fraud by dose wey dey hold public offices
Dem see how dia systems dey provide a soft landing for fraudulent pipo (public or private).
Do dem ask how many fraud and corruption allegations don dey fully investigate and discharged wit punishment wen di accused dem dey found guilty?
Di majority of di cases end badly like di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case wey end as family affair
Di youths dey see flamboyant lifestyles wey dem dey celebrate amidst di squalor
Dem see how once poor political aspirants transform into millionaires within months of inauguration
Dem see how traditional institutions don turn cash and dem carry in awarding chieftaincy titles
Tertiary educational institutions, wit few exceptions, dey award undeserving honours in exchange for moni
All dose wey mismanage funds dem provide wit a soft landing
We add to di list of culture wey dey nurt cybercrimes na di lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians wey present cyber-criminality as work and game wey evribodi dey involve in and not be crime
If we elect fraudster dem as legislators, dem go make laws against di crime dem wey dem dey involve in?
Di process to give parti nomination to di highest bidders by parti leaders need dey review if we wan stop tokunbo products import into awa already morally bankrupt political system.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dey low wen money dey dangled for dia eyes
Dem dey provide platform for dubious characters to cover up dia tracks and awa society dey worse off through dia actions
Di greed dey also nurture cyber-criminality
FBI agent wey dey investigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege to dis defendant don affect all di taxpayers
Moving forward, we no fit live inside sin and dey expect grace to abound.
Nigeria need sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace accountability policy wey track lifestyle wit material accumulations.
We need give di youth hope for Nigeria, by to create employment opportunity, reduce poverty and review reward systems.
Di EFCC need to invest in technology and expose im detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
Di commission need conclude investigations before dem arrest di suspects wey di FBI do before dem arrest Ramoni Abbas hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless all di culture wey dey sustain cybercrimes for Nigeria dey tackle through social engineering, cyber-criminality go continue to dey fester

How e feel to give birth for di pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
Wen news of death dey evriwia, a new life go bring happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, new morning, two red lines don change my life
I dey pregnant and I dey hapi
E be amazing start to new year
Na di year wey I remember wella for my life
All of a sudden, evrithin change
my daughter Roshomon Tara na hin dem born for di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she don reach nine month
She na di reason why I be mama for di middle of global crisis
No be only her wey dem born, but na also new me, mother of Tara, wey spend an entire pregnancy in lockdown for house and give birth in emergency condition for di emergency
Tara don see di world wit mask and isolation
her grandmothers dey fear to dey hold her or kom close to her witout wearing mask
If pandemic no dey, my journey to be born different
Dis Mother's Day dey special as my daughter don dey front of me, she dey smiling and staring at me
Last Mother's Day, she dey grow inside me
di only thing wey no change be di pandemic
I be 16 weeks pregnant wen di pandemic strike, and di planet go inside lockdown
I dey struggle to survive di pandemic wit my hormonal and physical changes
Di 22 weeks no be less dan war
my husband Sina Hasan na musician, and all hin concert na hin dey cancel for dat time
Na freelance journalist since January 1, 2020
so, we dey depend on wetin I save for di years, and make I spend all my savings
awa parents and two journalists association kom forward to help for di time being
I dey fear evrithing
most of time, e dey like death
dey knock for door
I dey adapt to new online life wer we click and get awa things home-delivered
I gats wait for like one week make I get groceries delivered this way
I been dey afraid to send di only family member wey dey live wit me, my husband go outside kom buy food for storage
So, I dey chop less
Besides, I no fit go for my scheduled antenatal check-ups
and I no know if my pikin dey grow well or development dey take place wen e dey born.
I dey sorry for my unborn pikin, say I dey bring am into a more different world than ever
Tele-medication help me pass some hard times during di last trimister.
I forget my gynaecologist face
I no fit remember how she dey look witout di PPE
I need information about risks, precautions, and how I fit get emergency medical help.
Plenti information dey float around
Inside dis wahala of information, experienced mothers, my mother, and mother-in-law fit only help me by supporting me and not meeting me for person wen I dey pregnant
For tradition, experienced mothers and mostly older women for di family dey help new mothers wit dia experience and observation.
I don get plenti panic attacks bikos of my lack of information and understanding.
so, I dug for di experience of new mothers wey gimme during dis time
I found social media as my lifeline
I dey read many exciting experiences for social media while I dey follow a group of more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers wey support each oda to survive di pandemic.
Different media groups wey dey dis platform don help more dan 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers make dem share dia experience and information during di lockdown.
One of dis group help me find health care facility wey I go do emergency ultrasound afta heavy bleeding durin di lockdown
Anoda group na hin help me curb my anxiety durin pregnancy and post-partum depression
I dey soset say I no fit meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share di joy of welcoming new member for di family.
dem born my daughter on August 25, 2020, for di same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, wey I born decades ago
And she meet anoda pikin for person wen she be four months old on December 31, 2020, wen Tara and her Papa go di rooftop go see di fireworks
anoda family wey get two pikin, apparently my next-door neighbor wey I meet di first time, also go there to say goodbye to 2020
evri day na gift, if we dey consider di recent statistics of Covid-19 cases wey dey increase
Wen news of death dey evriwia, di new life bring hapi and make hope thrive
For mothers, e no less dan winning war as dem dey give birth to a pikin during pandemic and to dey take care of di infant alone, confam di highest safety for dia pikin
Socially, emotionally, and physically, dis time fit dey challenge
Thanks to di light for di shining eyes of di babies
Thanks to my baby, my daughter, for whom I be mother and successful fighter wey survive dis pandemic.

Di national question, insecurity and di Asaba declaration
E kom from Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors meet for Asaba and dem make some resolution wey dey far reach di state of di nation, wey dem now sabi as di Asaba Declaration
Di meetin na on top di heels of insecurity wey dey worse for di kontri, agitation by some ethnic group and di unending menace of murderous herdsmen wey dey generate nationwide attention
for true, di bipartisan nature of di meeting and di unanimity wey di 17 governors display show say dem mean serious business
Restructuring for di context of true federalism and di ban on open grazing na im form di core of di declaration.
Major highlights include di clamour for state police, devoluton of power, review of revenue formula wey dey favour of federating units and di need for national dialogue wey go discuss di national question.
While di foot-dragging of di governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary dey condemnable and e run contrary to di spirit of true federalism wey dem clamour, di bulk of dia resolutions na actually a cardinal tenet of di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on top True Federalism make far-reaching recommendations.
One go don expect di leading lights of APC make dem take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, di overwhelming support of di major opposition parti make dem start di process of addressing di issues.
Instead, we see attempts at playing to di gallery and for some quarters, subtle censure of di governors
Di El-Rufai Committee don recommended devolution of powers, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federatin units among odas
President Buhari don since give support for local goment, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backin amendment of di statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
If to say di state of di nation wey security and di economy don pose grave challenges, dis twin sectors suppose receive di utmost attention, concurrently
Even as dem don get Nigeria as di kontri wey get di highest GDP for Afrika, we neva see sufficient effort to make sure say we go improve standard of livin for di majority of awa citizens
awa annual budget wey dey about $35 billion, for instance, dey inadequate to cater to di need of 220 million Nigerians
South Africa wey get about 58 million pipo get a National budget of almost $75bn for 2019 wit dem Social Protection Programmes wey dey reach 17m of dia population
Di effort of Buhari administration, wey be say dem dey new and commendable, still represent drop for inside ocean and dey not adequate to make di required impact
Na wia di devolution of powers and resource control kom in.
Minerals wey get solid and natural resources no get business to dey stay a day longer for di Exclusive list
Almost all states for di kontri get commercially viable natural resources wey dem fit exploit to create wealth and generate di needed foreign exchange for di kontri
Di present system wia states dey cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations for di kontri dey indolence, e dey contrary to di principle of true federalism
As di El-Rufai committee propose, make dem review di revenue formula for favour of states since dem go add responsibilities to dem
For state police, di fear of abuse and envisaged excess by governors dem dey understandable, but like how Richie Norton tok To escape fear, you go need go through am, no go around am
So tey we don go around fear of abuse of state police, we don try turn blind eye to di obviously overstretched and over-centralised police force wey don bikom no only overly inefficient, but largely conundrum
Like Vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey don kom before.
We suppose address awa fears and overkom am
One of di way wey we fit do na by enacting a legal instrument for di establishment of di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments wey go permit State Police.
E go dey similar for functions to di Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but dem go get wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions
Di ban wey dem dey ban open grazing though di governors dem restate am no be new and form di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey dem approve by di National Executive Council (NEC)
Di international Crisis Group (ICG) tout di NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul di inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
Na di core be strategy wey go curtail migratory or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict wey dey between herder and farmers It,derfore, beggars belief say some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Make di federal and state goment move quick to fully implement dis new plan so we go fit put di perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.
Di convocation of National Dialogue, a major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report of di 2014 National Conference and recommendation of Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on top True Federalism dey.
Both report make far-reachin recommendation wey awa governors and dia legislators for di National Assembly fit reach consensus on, instead of to dey waste resources for anoda jamboree
On di issue of separatist agitations, modalities go dey for convening a referendum spelt out for di constitution
E dey almost certain say vast majority of Naija pipo want to live togeda, awa differences no dey stop
To dey do dis go take di sail out of di wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord
Di Southern Governors don affirm dia commitment to United Nigeria on di basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Even say we get challenges like evri oda kontri, we suppose dey listen to awaselves, like US President Joe Biden tok am
Tomori dey live for Abuja

Di establishment of di farm almost five years ago, wey dem gather, na direct response to di call by di President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for Nigerians to return to agriculture as di maintay of di nation's economy, instead say dem go rely on oil as di only source of revenue for di kontri.
Each cattle get number tag attached to im ear
Di company founder, Farouk Adamu Aliyu, wey be former member of di House of Representatives key into dis, di GGM add
We dey do greenhouse farmin

We also get two 250 square-metre greenhouse wia we dey produce oda greenhouse vegetables, and anoda 500 square-metre greenhouse, wey dem dey use as nursery
All dis greenhouse dem dey foreign-oriented, and dem don put different variety of vegetables.

Mansur tok say di major clientele for di tomato na premium customers, wey be big hotels for Abuja, Lagos and some oda locations
E confirm am say di main market for di products na for di eastern part of di kontri, like Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri
Hin admit, however, say besides di small customers wey dey Kano, dia tomato products rarely dey for di local market for some reason
Di second reason be di fact say di tomato wey dem produce from di farm na of special specie and di second reason na di fact say Jigawa na major tomato-producing area
You know say tomato na common product for here, so awa price dey high pass wetin dem dey get for open market normally
So, essentially, pipo no actually look at us, dem no feel apprehensive on wetin we get bikos dem believe say dem dey expensive
And wen you get product wey dey commonly available, pipo go surely go for di cheaper brand
One farmer dey feed di fish
As dem ask di average lifespan of dia tomato products, him tok say, if you give di tomato all di tin wey e need, I mean nutritional supplement wey you dey feed am wit wen e dey grow, if you give am all di tins, dis tomato fit last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even witout dat, e last for minimum of one week, no be under any refrigeration, but surely no dey under intense pressure and heat
you fit keep am on top table wia you get good ventilation
E fit last on average of 10 days, but wit evritin wey evribodi need (all nutrients) e fit last up to one month
We don experiment am, but den, you no get am as you dey always want am

As he dey reflect on di effect of Covid-19 on di operations of di company, Mansur tok say, Malam Alu, just like oda corporate entities for di kontri, dey suffer from di devastating effect of di virus.
For Mansur, youths for Nigeria no get any excuse to dey unemployed wit di opportunity wey agriculture provide, he add say dose wey dey wan secure white-collar job suppose adjust to di reality and go back to agriculture.
E believe say Nigeria don dey do wetin e suppose don do a long time ago, dey tok say if di kontri don take dis step, di current economic crisis no go apun.

Enthusiastic football fans for Nigeria dey wait eagerly for tonights finals of di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals wey dem go contest between two English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea for di Estadio do Dragao, Porto for Portugal.
Sake of di fact say di UEFA Champions League na one of di biggest football competition wey dey only next to di FIFA World Cup and di Olympics football event, level of expectation dey increase as di giants of di English Premier League dey set to tussle for di prestigious diadem.
As Manchester City neva win Champions League title, Chelsea win dia first and only title so far in 2012.
Even say football pundits don tipped City wey just win dia seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea go kom inside di contest wit beta credentials
Dem be former champions
Howeva, while Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead di Chelsea technical crew neva know say Champions League victory na hin opponent for Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola na two time winner
Hin win am for 2009 and 2010 wit Barcelona
So, wetin pipo go expect from di actors wey go dey out there for di field of Estadio
do Dragao for Porto and di men wey dey in charge of di technical areas
Interestingly, even as both contestants parade only three African players for Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (Germany)
Senegal, Chelsea) Africa interest for di final don drop
For Naija here, wer Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy large following from passionate football fans, expectations don reach feverish point, wey dey lead to interesting re-alignments
Fans of di European clubs wey dem eliminate from Champions League for different stage don re-align demsef wit either Chelsea or Manchester City base on divergent interest
Bikos of wetin dey so, di finals na one of di topic wey pipo dey discuss for sporting circles for Nigeria at di moment as dem fans of di Premiership clubs continue to dey predict wetin go be di final result
As almost evrione dey wait to savour di football artistry wey fit show for display, some pundits dey worry by di increasing decline of di number of African players for di finals of one of di biggest football competitions for earth.
To go by di history of di UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballers don contest and dem don win di trophy wit dia European clubs
Sadly African football legend like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote as World Footballer of di year for 1995
Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt no win Champions League even as dem dey dia football prowess.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage wen Liverpool win dia 6th UEFA Champions League title for 2019, di first African wey don win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
He achieve di feat for 1984 wit Liverpool
Dem follow Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am wit FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 wit Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu na hin lift am wit Ajax Amsterdam for 1995.
Dem don record am say Geremi Njitap of Cameroon wey be di first African to win di title twice for 2000 and 2002 wit Spanish giant Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon win am thrice wit Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 wit Inter Milan.
Oda African winner of di trophy wey dem dey coveted pass na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali)
Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am wit Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), wit Real Madrid 2018 wey complete di list of Africans wey don win the UEFA Champions League.
As e dey close to home, di last time wey Nigerian won Trophy na for 2012 wen Mikel Obi dey among di quartet of Africans wey lift am wit Chelsea at di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta dat achievement by di former captain of di Super Eagles, Nigeria don see di rise of oda immensely talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
but no one is yet to feature for di finals of Europe's biggest club competition.
Di reason for dis no dey farfetched
Di competition dey dominate by di top five clubs for Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool
Unfortunately, Nigeria players don fail to get into diz highly rated European clubs.
Na wetin di Nigerian football stakeholders hope say for no distant future di new generation of players go break all barriers and go start to play for clubs wey get potential to win the UEFA Champions League.
If dis fail, den football fans for Nigeria go continue to dey live wit di agony to dey watch finals of di UEFA Champions League kom and go witout di presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians dey wait for di next Super Eagles player wey go rise to di pinnacle of European club competition the way wey Nwankwo Kanu do wit Ajax for 1995 and Chelsea's Mikel Obi for 2012, di 2021 all English clubs finals don dey few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
