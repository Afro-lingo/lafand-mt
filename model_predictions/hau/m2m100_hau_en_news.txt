The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's (Ayatollah Khamenei) office issued a notice to the Iranian people during the month of mercy and blessings of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) brotherhood of the Islamic Republic of Somalia, in which he reiterated: "In the month of Ramadan, when the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.s.
See the translation of the notice:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
In these days, in sub-Saharan Africa and in particular in sub-Saharan Somalia, which is suffering from the bitterest and most bitter tragedies of hunger due to the emergence of storms in the region and the lack of vigilance seen by international organizations, the lives of millions of Muslims in Finland, especially women and children, have been seriously threatened and threatened.
Therefore, as a result of the attention of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution to the issue of helping the people who are suffering from a deadly hunger, the Islamic Ummah is encouraged to help the Islamic Ummah of Somalia in this month of mercy and blessings and they can provide financial and financial assistance to the affected organizations in order to deliver them to the Somalian nation.
Elsewhere in his statements, Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and added: "If the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and
The following is the full text of this message by Ayatollah Khamenei:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
By Allah's favor, human beings will receive divine rewards. By Allah's favor, they will receive divine rewards. By Allah's favor, they will receive divine rewards.
Through singing daily prayers, divine believers enlightened the enmity of humanity and saved it from great grief and deviation from this eclipsy.
Eid afternoon praying is an opportunity and a blessing that helps humanity victory in the flag of lack of vigilance. It helps human beings not spend their hearts on the basis of divine teachings, and it helps them breathe their hearts on the basis of divine teachings.
While prayers, prayers, and prayers are in line with social norms, Islamic jurisprudence can be referred to in its worshiping rules.
Mosque is the manifestation of this lack of vigilance.
The same is true of living in mosques and in faithful people as well as living in the shrine of divine blessings. The same is true of increasing the flow of divine blessings.
Thanks to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household,
Therefore, we should consider mosques from this prospective.
The spirituality of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household increases the vitality of the people.
In any arena of life, mosques are the main pillar.
It is necessary to establish architectural structures in cities, villages, schools, universities and local communities, ranging from business and service environments to airport, airport, transportation and transportation areas, to shopping and hospital areas and all areas.
Everybody should be patient and patient.
It is necessary to preserve the morality of the mosque - which is the duty of teachers - with wisdom and sense of responsibility.
In a correct way, the material and religious responsibility of the people and government officials will be greatly reduced.
We wish for this great day and for the holy of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Sayyid Ali Khamenei

The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the negotiations between the two officials and the negotiations that were concluded during the visit and added: "There is a lot of areas that can be used for strengthening cooperation between the two countries in many arenas and areas. Therefore, this area of cooperation should be strengthened, especially the areas of trade and construction.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the continued flood of the Lebanon-based war on the Zionist regime and added: "If Zionist regime can, it can tread Beirut to Tarabulous to occupy Syria."
But fighting against the Zionist regime is the only means that it can this goal.
His Eminence referred to Lebanon as the only Arab country that can defeat the Zionist regime and added: "Resistance is only what the enemies of Lebanon have defeated."
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the greatness of this concept.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution added: "As long as the Zionist regime persists, Lebanon needs resistance.
Ayatollah Khamenei expressed his delight over the firm relationship between Saad Hariri and Sayyed Hasan Nasrullah (a.s.) and other officials in the organization and added: “The relationship between the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Republic should be strengthened on a daily basis.”
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated that the Islamic Republic of Iran is supporting the establishment of unity and independence in the Lebanon and added: "The Lebanon is the country of different denominations which have been followed by different denominations for many years.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the past meeting with Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanon's prime minister, and said that he has made efforts to promote Lebanon's future.
Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who was headed by Mr. Rahimi, expressed his delight over the meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, further stating: "We believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an alliance and a brother with Lebanon, which has been with Lebanon in a difficult and helpful way."
The Lebanese government hopes that the relations between the two countries will strengthen in all the areas of economy, politics and culture as well.
He added that the Lebanese government is the international government of unity and added that any discord between the Lebanese people will benefit from the Zionist regime.
Meeting with Ayatollah Taskhiri, the chairman of the Board of Islamic Unity on the meaning of the hajj message by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
Following the prolonged interference and the expansion of Iranian pilgrims to Saudi Arabia as a result of negotiations and negotiations between the two officials, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Ayatollah Tashhari was one of the leaders of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps in the meeting with Saudi Arabia.
Each year during the hajj, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution sends a message to the hajj pilgrims, who should discuss the most important issues of the Islamic Ummah.
What is the philosophy behind this message?
First of all, it is necessary to discuss certain issues in order to answer this question.
First of all, the hajj itself - which is one of the Islamic works of worshiping - has many important goals.
The greatest goal of hajj is to promote the Islamic Ummah and the act of prophets in history, according to the Holy Quran. According to the Holy Quran, the goal of hajj is to promote the Islamic Ummah and the act of prophets in the history. According to the Holy Quran, the goal of hajj pilgrimage is to promote hajj pilgrimage, the goal of hajj pilgrimage, the goal of hajj pilgrimage, the goal of hajj pilgrimage and the goal of hajj pilgrimage.
The Holy Quran explains each and every one of these occasions, adding: â€œAnd whenâ€ whenâ€ whenâ€ whenâ€ all these occasions are following the path of divine prophets until it is reached by Abrahamic Prophet (s.w.a.) and says: â€œAnd when the Lord of Abraham tested him for a few words, he filled him with them.
He said, “It is Me, the Leadership of the People.”
He said, “Savannah Grass”, that is to say, he explained the leadership of the judiciary.
The second goal that is following this path is, in fact, to create human beings, to turn human beings into the main structure and to orientate human beings towards God. The same is true of the structure of human beings during the hajj. Therefore, the main goals of the hajj are explained, and one of them is the issue of renouncing them from polytheism.
These are all signs of dignity and unanimity of the people and the Islamic Ummah.
The message issued by the Imam (r.a.) and the Leader of the Islamic Revolution (r.a.) should also be referred to the hajj.
As for the philosophy behind this message - which was what I asked you for - the Islamic Republic and its leaders took this point into consideration because labor is a source of responsibility for society.
Commitment to the hajj means safeguarding the public movement.
The Holy Quran says, "Hajj is the flag of Islam. What does the flag of Islam mean?"
During the war, this means that the Armed Forces were vigilant and that the war was continued.
Therefore, refusing to have the hajj and referring to the hajj is one of the greatest goals of the Islamic Republic for "Islamic Awakening".
Therefore, the message that was delivered by Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the message that was delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei was very important.
Of course, we do not pay attention to the issue of the hajj, but we do not pay attention to the issue of the hajj, and we do not pay attention to the issue of the hajj, and we do not pay attention to the issue of the hajj.
The mass media of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the media of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps work in a different way, but their work is not based on the importance of this message.
The broadcasters, the cultural offices in the country) and the broadcasters should put all their power on spreading this message to all parts of the world in order to their goal.
It is necessary to make more efforts in this regard.
No, this was not the case. The Saudi government was only issuing a message.
How many people received this message from polytheists since the first day?
But after the crisis – which was why Iranians did not have years to hajj – a negotiating agreement was concluded which was part of the panel of discussions.
Both sides agreed that from that time to the next, there would be no gathering in Mecca, but that day in Arafat - that is, the day for Hazrat Zahra (s.a.) - in Arafat and in the name of the Iranian nation, there was a great gathering in order to read the message of Ayatollah Khamenei.
No, the Du’a Kumail agreement was one of its conclusions. This agreement was another agreement, after all discussions and conflicts.
We claim that the hajj message is delivered to the Muslim nations.
Did this message affect it yet?
First of all, there are many different kinds of hajj pilgrims coming there.
Second, this message can be conveyed in different publications during the hajj, in Mina and elsewhere and it can be accepted by all kinds of claims regarding the Islamic Revolution.
On the one hand, the arrogant powers of the world, the Arab and Islamic governments are trying to deny the influence of this message by all organizations of the world.
Sometimes this message was republished in one of the British newspapers and all Zionists throughout the world tried to see the newspapers behind it and they caused them to be injured.
What year was it?
The Zionists are trying to prevent this message from spreading.
The Saudi government has not only helped to promote this message but it has also prevented it in certain cases.
Of course these mistakes have been diminished in recent years, but they are trying to make the end of this message.
Sometimes we try to publish messages in the newspapers, but we are not publishers.
A majority of the journalists do not approve or approve the publication.
I love you and I am even Muslim.
He really didn’t give up, but as I said, we were deceived.
What was the position of this message?
Yau Ma Tei is the representative of the entire Islamic Ummah.
The base that is located here is, in fact, the base of society representation, that is to say, the base of the entire Islamic Ummah with the purpose of spirituality.
The hajj should keep his eyes safe.
He took care of his language.
The things that are prohibited from harvesting are educative and hajj.
I would like to learn lessons from the message issued by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in recent years.
If you take a careful look at the message of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, you will see that the hajj is the first element that is presented in this message.
This was what Ayatollah Khamenei wanted during the hajj.
For example, the role of the hajj is to compensate for the weakness of the Islamic Ummah.
The next point in the hajj is emphasizing that hajj is the flag of Islam.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution stated that hajj is the basis of a public movement.
If we pay attention to the foundations of the hajj, one of them is the lofty claims of the House of God.
That is to say, the entire nation is following up the laws of Allah the Exalted and it is following up its guidance.
The first point that is mentioned in this message is, in general, the hajj ceremony in the history of the Islamic Ummah.
The second point is the role of the hajj in promoting morality and personality.
This is in all the messages.
Of course from the beginning to the end of the message, the issue of purity will be mentioned as well as the access to the holy places related to the hajj.
The third point in this message is “the importance of Islam and the message that belongs to it.”
This is how Islam has acted in order to resolve the problems of humanity.
The next point is related to the issue of Islamic unity. The Islamic Awakening is the most important indication of this unity in the message of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In this message, there are many efforts to promote and promote Islamic Awakening.
It is also mentioned in the description of this unity: for example, the same clothes, the same paths, the same positions, the same positions, the same positions, the same positions, the same positions, and other positions.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Ka'bah is the symbol of monotheism and that it is the symbol of unity.
The message reveals the greatness of the power of the Islamic Ummah - that is to say, the greatness of material, spiritual, national and cultural power that the enemies are trying to undermine.
One of the reasons for this message is to reflect on the plots that the arrogant powers of the world are making.
In all these messages, he referred to the satanic and arrogant powers' efforts to defeat the Islamic Ummah as well as their oppressive efforts.
The events that are taking place in the Islamic world include the events that were raised by the enemies as well as their efforts to foment ethnoreligious fitna, promote corruption and assassination as well as propaganda against the Islamic Ummah.
All those threats that emerged after the September 11 attack, the guide clarifies.
Because thanks to the Islamic Revolution and the Islamic Awakening, the plots of the arrogant powers of the world - which have been occupied by Muslim countries - have already been plotsed by the enemies in order to suppress Muslim nations and promote corruption.
Therefore, the message of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution states that the arrogant powers of the world are considered to be the enemies of the humans, human rights and global supporters of terrorism, hypocrisy and colonialism in Muslim countries. One of the important points is, of course, the role of the regional mercenary governments in pursue the goals of colonialism and eliminating hajj pilgrimage from the main objective.
The ultimate point is to establish the Islamic Republic as the successor of global arrogance and global arrogance.
What is the effect of these actions in other countries?
Is there a difference between Muslim and Arab intellectuals and politicians?
Each year, when we go to about 50 countries, we meet people and groups of Islamic governments, the heads of political and activist groups of different countries, all of us mention this point.
That is to say, in spite of the shortcomings that we have in delivering this message, it has a great impact on wherever we can deliver this message.
Today the issue of diplomacy is the general issue of the world. That is to say, the heads of countries speak with the people.
Can this hajj be considered as one of the pillars of this complete diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and a source of inspiration for the Islamic Revolution?
The message of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) to the pilgrims is one of the best ways to express his condolences on the Islamic Revolution.
One of the methods for strengthening the hajj and responding to the efforts which are being made to misconstrue the identity of the hajj and the role that it deserves in the life of Muslims is the kind of message that has a significant impact on the Islamic Ummah. Although we have failed to deliver the message, as I said.
The failure is that many of the trolls come from low places and are suffering very much, but they fail to understand the message in the hajj.
We have a narration saying: "The hajj continues to be accompanied by the hajj if it does not grassroots", that is to say, the hajj will re-establish the brightness of the hajj and the brightness of this narration will remain with him and his people until the moment that the divine salvation makes grassroots, the moment that the brightness will be thwarted.
We hope that hajj pilgrims will try to promote the brilliance of the hajj and safeguard the message of hajj so that the hajj can play an important role in educating the Islamic Ummah.
Leader’s Speech to Shia Teachers and Ahlussunna - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with Shia and Ahlussunna scholars of Kermanshah province.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Two Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Those who call Allah the Prophet (s.w.a.) and are afraid of Him and are not afraid of anybody and Allah is satisfied with. [The Holy Quran, 33: 39]
One of the pleasant meetings is the meetings of the esteemed clergymen who are rendering services in different parts of the country and the youth who have focused their attention on religious education and learning.
Fortunately, today the dear brothers and sisters, students and esteemed scholars of this province, Sunni and Shia, are all together. This is an opportunity for me.
There are certain points that I would like to discuss, but before I speak about these points, I deem it necessary to express my gratitude to the world-renowned clergyman who, under the command of Ayatollah Borujerdi, spent his life in this province while he was martyred.
I had the opportunity to meet him at his home in Kermanshah several times before.
I had met him with him at certain meetings, namely, at the Friday prayer ceremony held in Islamabad, where the late Shahid Sadiq came from Yazd.
The summit was held under bombs (of the Iraqi Armed Forces for the time of war) and we also attended this meeting.
His hearts, role models, frustration, and apparent things - these are all characteristics that belong to him. He is a great man.
He was rewarded by Allah the Exalted and he was finally martyred at the end of his life.
I have repeatedly said that martyrdom is a profound business death.
Certainly, there will be the end of life "Every life is deadly" [The Holy Quran, 3: 185].
We who are interested in achieving this achievement - we who are interested in achieving this achievement - are interested in achieving this achievement. One is interested in achieving this achievement.
Allah is the Exalted, and He is blessed with the blessedness of believers. [The Holy Quran, 9: 11] Allah is the Exalted, and He is blessed.
In this province as well, our former Hajj friend, Marja Agha Baha'uddeen Mohammadi Araki, is one of the people who was martyred.
The late Agha Hajj Baha is one of the greatest scholars of Imam Khomeini and one of our friends in Qom.
Allah's grace and greetings be upon these two martyrs.
I would also like to congratulate my dear scholar, honorable and sympathetic Hajj pilgrim Agha-Mujtaba Hajj Akhund - who was one of our old friends at the Islamic seminary in Qom - who was a faithful, sincere and sincere person.
Allah has bestowed mercy on him.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, before being the president, I visited Kermanshah in one of the visits to him and went to his home.
He brought me another example of his life after the death of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
I need him to write this narration to me: "Anyone who makes himself a leader for a nation should learn his lessons before he recites his lessons." To put him on my table, we should not forget the issue of education.
He wrote it to me in a very good writing and I put it in another part of the class by putting out it for me.
This is the problem with our labor.
My dear people, dear men and women, if we want to live as an inexhaustible tree that puts on the ground, if you want to live as an inexhaustible tree that cannot put people on the ground, the way to do this is: "start teaching yourself".
Being fearful of God is one of the characteristics of teachers. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] Being fearful of God is one of the characteristics of teachers.
That is to say, there are certain characteristics for teachers, but fear of God is elected.
The characteristic of knowledge is that one can this great blessing - that is, having fear of God in one's heart.
Therefore, this characteristic should be achieved. You dear youth can do this much more than I can. When you grow up, if somebody does something in his youth, it will be difficult to do that.
It will be possible to survive. Some will go to the old, while others will not do so.
The difference between the 20 and 30 years and the 70 years is more than the 70s. The difference between the 20 and 30 years is more than the 40s.
When you are 20, you think there is a lot of time to go before you are 7 years old.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the needs of the youth. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the needs of the youth. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the needs of the youth.
Therefore, I advise the dear students to fulfill their duties in order to be close to God, which is necessary more than call to knowledge and which is the main pillar of their job: seeking knowledge.
If knowledge is available but not with fear of God, this knowledge can be useless. It is harmful at certain times.
We have a teacher - who has religious and non-religious knowledge - who is not only not benefiting from knowledge but also being wrong for him.
This spirituality, which is close to God, is necessary for knowledge and teachers.
Kermanshah is a very important city.
As Mr Ulamah said, Kermanshah had prominent scholars, including the family of Al Agha, the family of Jalili and other institutions where prominent scholars are located, not just one person, two people or ten people.
Another point in this chapter which is also interesting about Kermanshah is that as the people of Kermanshah are kind and sympathetic to those who have come, they have this characteristic even more than those who have come.
The late Mohammad Ali (may God bestow His blessings on him) — the late Wahid Bahbahani, who was one of his father’s great scholars — had just begun to Kermanshah for life.
Although he did not mean living, he stayed there and became part of the Al Agha Family.
Many of his children are among teachers.
This is an example.
Another example is the late Agha Sayyid Hossein Haeri, who at the end of his life arrives to Mashahad.
I still remember certain things about him.
His sisters, Agha Seyyed Mohammad Isfahan, and Agha Seyyed Mohammad Isfahan, as well as Akhund and Mulla Bozorgi, are from Iraq and have been living in Kermanshah for years.
He was scribbling in Isfahan.
He was a figure of God's grace and blessings.
He was also trained by the late Akhund Mulla Fat'ali Sultan Abadi, who at that time was in Samarra.
Another teacher is the late Sardar Kabuli, a well-known clergyman for different sectors.
The book that was written about him was a very valuable and brilliant book, and I have been visiting his book many years ago.
It is around sixty years in Kermanshah and many teachers benefit from it.
I have read in this book that the late Hajj Agha-Hussein Kummi (may God bestow His grace on him) travelled to holy places or returned to Kermanshah in a meeting with the late Sardar of Kabul.
The author of the book said that I was witness to two years ago - I think he was witness to me because I was reading the book for many years - the hajj of Agha-Hussein Kummi, who was a marjaje and a great scholar, but he was in the presence of the Sermon of Kabul and was teaching him this issue of knowledge.
This is the lesson itself, that is to say, one should learn the lessons of seven elderly people during the hajj.
This does not mean that we should be a source of pride for a senior teacher.
Our students should learn these things, and you dear youth should continue treading this path.
The man, the man of Kabul, was a great man in India and went to Najaf where he went to Kermanshah and was taken to Kermanshah.
Seventy years ago, the late Sardar Kabuli was in Kermanshah.
Mr. Shahid Ashrafi Isfahani is one of the most emigrating scholars in this province.
This story has a characteristic that shows that the hearts of the people are familiar with religious scholars and that they love religious scholars.
When they find a person and identify the characteristics that he enjoys, they will follow him so much that he might not be considered to be in their park.
The late Ashrafi was the people of Isfahan, but he felt himself like the people of Kermanshah. He was the people of Kermanshah.
That is to say, the things that I mentioned in this meeting were a source of awareness.
I would like to point out a few points.
Dear teachers, dear youth and great future students,
For two reasons: First, the opportunity to spread an Islamic message in the world - in Islamic and non-Muslim countries - which I will briefly explain to this issue.
Our responsibility will increase.
Today, you are in such a situation.
You should not be feared. "Everyone should be feared of Him and no one should be feared of God."
You should not be afraid of everything. You should not be afraid of the dangers.
You should not say there are no challenges, but you should not be afraid of these challenges.
They should do what they are unlikely to do.
Did this not happen in Iran?
In Iran, there is a situation in which if all analysts in the world spend day and night without enough time, they will have no results if they do not say that this is not possible.
Each commentator would say this work was not possible, but it was possible to see it.
I would tell you that some of our activists even say they are not able to do so.
Ayatollah Talikani said that the Imam (r.a.) had said that the Shah should not go away.
There is no doubt that Shah will be defeated.
He told us this later.
The Imam (r.a.) said that Shah would be killed and that nobody believed that he would be killed.
not only did the Shah's victory go unnoticed, America also went unnoticed, the western powers went unnoticed, the hegemony and arrogance fell.
Nobody believes this, but it has already happened.
Nobody has heard that the great revolution of this era in Islamic countries would be taking place in Egypt, a country that undermined Camp Dabid, and Egypt, Hosni Mubarak.
You may think that this might happen elsewhere, but nobody is thinking of Egypt. But the Revolution happened in Egypt.
These are some of the things that we should place in our minds.
We should do what is expected to be impossible in order to their potential.
They should not be afraid of God. They should not be afraid of God.
The answer to this question is, "Allah is the Beneficent, the Beneficent." Do not forget Allah, but Allah has the Beneficent.
And Allah is coming to be the Beneficent.
This is our path.
Sometimes we engage in modesty and weakness. Sometimes we engage in modesty and weakness. Sometimes we engage in modesty and weakness in modesty and weakness in modesty. Sometimes we engage in modesty and weakness in modesty. Sometimes we engage in modesty and weakness in modesty and weakness in modesty.
Allah the Exalted says, â€œAllahu Akbarâ€ [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 76]. â€œAllahu Akbarâ€ [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 76].
And if your Lord wants, not do it" [The Holy Quran, 6: 112].
Therefore, if there is determination for me and you to deliver divine messages, we will be prepared to be faced with the evil deeds of our society and the people.
They are going to attack us, so we stay prepared.
From a spiritual aspect, we need to create a firm and modest wall to ourselves — which is a religious wall to ourselves — so that we cannot victory over ourselves and we are defeated.
Ironically, the breeze of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of the weakness of our society.
That is to say, the bad defeat of one's body causes him to be outside defeat.
If you do not fail in your heart, nobody will victory over you.
Therefore, the people should rely on Allah. [The Holy Quran, 15: 122] "And whoever is relying on Allah, shall be relying on Him, and whoever is relying on Him, shall be relying on Him." [The Holy Quran, 65: 3] "So, God is not relying on His servants?"
These are all lessons for us.
We should read the Holy Quran with every thought and we should take it as a lesson and make it a system of our life.
The fact that today's witness reaches you via Internet, social media and other modern means of communication has contemporary narratives as well.
Currently, the crude oil is being dumped somewhere. I have a story about this.
These are unsuccessful reports. In some Islamic countries, a large number of people are being killed for preparing a sharia against Shia Muslims.
On this issue, a Shia idiosyncrasy was accused of being a Shia pilgrim in the name of Shia television, a Ummul Muminina Aisha accused of harassing women, harassing women and harassing women.
These are the standards.
Therefore, creating differences are a great blessing for them.
I would tell you that your province is the province where Shia and Sunni Muslims live together.
Shia and Sunni teachers should prepare, identify and speak among themselves.
We have many collective achievements in this regard.
You can believe in it, but you should continue your work in society.
If they wanted to conduct research, they would not do it.
I believe in sectarian speeches. If they want to discuss sectarian speeches between teachers and intellectuals, they want to place sectarian speeches between them, but if they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them, they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them, but if they want to discuss sectarian speeches, they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them, and if they want to discuss sectarian speeches, they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them, and if they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them, they want to discuss sectarian speeches between them.
In spite of all these things, there are certain things that are common in society.
Shia Imam (r.a.) is humble among his people, and the Sunni Imam (r.a.) is humble among his people. They use their power and insight to resolve these common problems.
Today some people are the armed forces of unbelievers. They are not angry. They are unbelievers.
This quarrelling among Muslim nations should be ignored.
Therefore, the ruby of work that we speak about depends on all these things.
Another responsibility is the responsibility of education.
I have heard that some Kermanshah students - who have undoubtedly been martyred by their brothers - should come and refuge, and if they fail to return, they should come at the special time. They should go through two, three, four months in the year.
Therefore, the issue of knowledge is very important.
Of course, in the arena of knowledge, the issue of gathering is very important.
There was a student coming before the lessons I had presented; after a while he didn't come and I didn't see him before the lessons.
After a while I got him up and asked, "Who are you?" he said, "I am in a particular area of Khorasan province and I am living there. What happened to you and come back, he said, "I do not have anything to learn from that area of interests."
This is the identity of the Islamic Ummah.
Today, look at the experience of our youth.
In Kermanshah’s own village, those who recited Kermanshah had a very prominent population.
This was not the case in the past.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, in all Kermanshah provinces, the most likely university graduates are not more than three.
But now those who exist have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly thus far, maybe thus far.
Those youth who are faced with various propaganda and speeches, there are certain questions that they ask.
It is necessary to identify the questions that exist, to prepare the answer to them and then go to the room for answering them.
You should choose who you speak with them. You should identify their intellectual principles. You should choose those who you speak with them. You should choose those who you speak with them.
As Mr. Mamduhi said, this was what Mr. Ayatollah Mutahari wrote in his book "The Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, and the Holy Quran are saying.
You were in Qom.
You should do such things.
It is necessary to think about education just as you think about education.
You should purge the hearts of those with whom you speak and educate them.
And this education, as I said, "whoever has to become a leader in society, should start his own education before his wife has to become a leader in society."
This difficult task should be carried out.
Teachers should focus their attention on social issues, but the important point is that they should focus their attention on the issues, especially on the issues of teachers. Teachers should focus their attention on social issues.
The advantage that teachers enjoy is that they should put them on the scene through their teachers’ methods of morality, advice, and demonstration.
She is everything.
If his relationship with Eid al-Adha ends, his relationship with Eid al-Adha will be defeated.
Salla Allah the Exalted is very important.
Try to encourage those with whom you say daily prayers and try to encourage them to participate in congregational prayers.
This meeting is about Eid al-Adha that is held every year, I do not know whether it has already been held in Kermanshah or not.
Shia and Sunni foreigners should not harm their brothers.
Go with your and make your compassionate.
There are certain things that can be done together.
If this happens, by Allah's favor, the teachings will be progressive.
I would tell you that when the Revolution achieved victory, Islam achieved a new spirit and a new power.
Was it such a powerful mechanism that was in the way of western civilization?
The victories of the Islamic Revolution and the Imam (r.a.) greatnessed western powers and the system of hegemony was undermined.
They returned to the Holy Quran and found some information about Islam. Therefore, they used to love Islam.
At that time the efforts were made to undermine Islam, and this progress was made. The second effort was made when the Marxist regime was defeated.
In Islamic countries, a large number of pure-hearted youth who pinned their hopes on the Marxist system - they thought that if a socialist system was established, poverty, injustice, isolation and isolation would be eliminated from their countries.
Some of them are truly sincere people. I see some of them, whether Muslims or non-Muslims.
They were socialists because they thought there was hope in socialism for the people.
But when the league fails, they realize that it is not the case and that it is not at all beneficial.
Therefore, they started treading the path of Islam.
All the youth groups that you witnessed in Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen and other places - all of them were from the slogans of Islam. All of them were from the slogans of Islam during the 1960s and 1970s. About a century or thirty years ago - all were from the slogans of Islam.
The same is true of our country as well. I do not want them to be asserted.
Some people speak about Islam, but under these things, it is in fact a leftist thought that it promotes.
After the leftist movement was defeated, all those groups who paralyzed the leftist movement went to Islam. They used to view Islam, they used to view the Holy Quran, they used to view Islamic laws, they used to view the Islamic Republic, and they used to view it.
When a government is established in line with the principles of Islam, it is fulfilling the current and current claims that are being imposed on its own country, and the brutal oppression of the people is opposed to it, but it persists like a truce.
They have defeated those who are after the Marxist and leftist elements and are unable to their goals. They have seen what they are doing in Islam.
Do you see what is happening?
They want to be humiliated. We cannot be humiliated.
At the Financial Center of America, in the United States of America, New York, and on the Wall Street, which is the global capital capital, thousands of people gathered around and say they didn't want the capital. And they were not black, and all of them were black, and students of universities took over and said they didn't want the capital.
Well, this is what we are saying. We have always said from the beginning that we are not anti-Westerners. We do not believe in the socialist system, and we do not believe in the socialist system.
You should be prepared.
Islamic teachers should be prepared.
They should take care of the Islamic system. They should take care of the Islamic system. They should take care of the Islamic system. They should take care of the Islamic system.
If you do this, you will see how Islamic love will rise.
I have many things to say for you. As I pointed out, this place is a pleasant place for me. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the time.
Dear God, make religious scholars part of the things that You believe.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on the dear youth and adolescents who are after religious studies in Kermanshah and Kermanshah.
Dear God, bestow Your mercy and guidance on all of us.
Dear God, make the great heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake) satisfied with us.

Leader’s Speech to the 24th Anniversary of Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) death - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on June 4, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the commemoration of the death of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us another opportunity and an opportunity to appreciate our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) on such a day.
Although the message of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was always alive in the hearts of our people, the 14th of Khordad was a manifestation of the love of the Iranian nation for our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
Today is the birthday anniversary of Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (peace and greetings be upon him).
This year coincides with the 50th anniversary of Khordad 15th of Khordad 1342.
The 15th of Khordad is an important and determining day for the future.
I will briefly speak about this issue before coming to the main issue and I will need to speak about it.
The 15th of Khordad is not the symbol of the great movement of teachers and people.
Before Khordad 15, there were certain important events that happened in the year 1341 and the beginning of the year 1342.
For example, the events that happened at the Faiziyya school took place on February 2, 1342, resulting in a blasphemous event and a blasphemous event against the great Islamic jurisprudent Ayatollah Rezvani.
Earlier, at the end of 1341, the issue of popular protests in the Tehran market was worsened and the honorable cleric Ayatollah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khunsari was also respected.
These are all indications that the teachers' movement in the year 1341 and the beginning of the year 1342.
But despite all this, the 15th of Khordad is a very important occasion.
The reason is that what happened on Khordad 15, 1342, was indicative of the relationship between the people and scholars during those difficult times.
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) delivered a re-appearance to the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps on the 13th of Khordad that year.
Later on, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was arrested and on the 15th of Khordad, in Tehran, Qom and other cities and cities. The satanic Pahlavi regime took to the ballot boxes against the people with all its power, including the Army, Police and other security forces. On the 15th of Khordad, a popular movement took place.
The important point is that such a relationship can help promote and lead this movement to success.
The movement will continue wherever a movement is accompanied by the people and wherever a movement is accompanied by the people.
But if people fail to take part in an aggressive movement, they will not victory.
As was with the constitution in Iran, leagues and patriotism had risen up, but their movement was defeated. Because the people were not with them.
When the people join the arena and support a movement with all their intellectual and intellectual capacities, the movement will go on and become successful.
This was the case with Khordad 15.
Because of the multidimensional incursion in Tehran and other cities, Imam Khomeini was arrested and forced the government to use all its power to insult the people. And a large number of people were killed.
The streets of Tehran were filled with the blood of the servants of God, the proud and proud youth.
On the 15th of Khordad, the dictatorship of the clergy and the unbelievership of the satanic Pahlavi regime was revealed.
In the case of Khordad 15, which should be watched by our dear youth and people, there is another point that is embodied by any international organization that calls itself human rights organizations and no one stands against it during the Sacred Defense Era.
The people and teachers were alone on the scene.
The people who claim to support the fight against the government have opposed the movement. They say the movement is an inexhaustible movement, an inexhaustible movement.
When intellectuals and intellectuals fail to enter the battlefields, they will blame the faithful people who are committed to the battlefields. They will blame those who are committed to the battlefields.
They used to say that Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was a successor, and he continued his movement thanks to the support of the Iranian nation. He showed that he was a religious leader in the world and in his history and in a determined way.
The Imam (r.a.) had three factors: faith in God, faith in the power of the people and self-confidence. These three faiths revealed themselves in the blessings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
He used to speak from his heart and the people answered his call to him with all his possessions.
They entered the arena with resistance.
They led this movement, which did not have any supporters in the world, to success.
Let me tell you about the three beliefs of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
These are important things which if we identify them, they will enlighten us our path.
From the perspective of religious faith in God, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was the manifestation of this definition: "Whoever has said to the people: 'Savannah, the people have gathered for your sake, fear your.
That is to say, they are faithful. They say, "Allah is the All-inclusive to us" [The Holy Quran, 3: 173].
This is a divine promise. When he works for the sake of God, he says, "By Allah's favor, he will help you" [The Holy Quran, 47: 7].
On the issue of religious faith and people, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) understands the Iranian nation in the full sense of this word.
He believes that a nation is faithful, intelligent and brave. If a nation enjoys an appropriate guide, it will be able to appear in all arenas just as the light of the day.
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) who believed that the Iranian people would be humiliated by an arrogant powers like the Shah of Hussein (a.s.) but that the Iranian people would be humiliated by an arrogant powers like Nadeer Kali (a.s.) and that they would be humiliated by the Iranian people.
He knows the Iranian nation and he believes in it.
He reappears his religious belief that the Iranian nation has become a source of resistance and insight.
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and his enemies as the greatest companions of the world.
This is why Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was not disappointed in the battlefield against the colonial powers because the colonial powers were opposed to the public and Imam Khomeini (r.a.) considered the enemies of the people.
On the issue of self-confidence, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) learnt the Iranian nation that we can do so.
He showed the world his capabilities. On April 1342, despite all the pressures, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said before Qom's students and members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, to Muhammad Ridha Shah, who was dependent on America and the superpowers of the country and who ruled the Islamic Republic without any limitation or limitation, threatened to push the people away from Iran if they had continued their efforts.
A teacher is the resident of Qom and he does not have any armed forces, money, or international support.
It is faith in God and it is firm to one's goals in this regard.
Then, when Imam Khomeini (r.a.) returned from the exile, in his book in Beheshti Zahra, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) threatened the Bakhtiyar government and said, "I will dismiss the Bakktiyar government, I will assign the Bakktiyar government."
He believed in the power of the Imam (r.a.).
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) who directed his attention to the people.
One of the most effective and effective tools which the enemies have used to use in order to impose their rule on other nations is to make them feel ‘no, they can’t, they can’t say, we can do nothing.
For many years, the Iranian nation has been fascinated by political, scientific, economic and other areas of its life.
He told the Iranian nation that you can.
He brought us back with courage, with firm determination in doing the right thing, and brought us back with self-confidence.
We have started a movement. That is why the Iranian nation has been successful in all arenas over the past thirty years.
The beliefs and actions of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) - namely, faith in God, faith in the people and self-confidence - were the foundation of all his decisions, actions and policies.
The Imam (r.a.) was established in the beginning of his resistance with three faiths.
The same is true of the time when he was forced to exile. The same is true of Paris when he was forced to return to Iran.
These were the three factors which allowed our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) to return to Tehran in such a situation.
During the winter of Bahman 1357, during the presence of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), during the presence of the Islamic Republic, during the presence of the oppressive people of the world, during the slogan “No East, No West”, during the Sacred Defense Era and in all the events that happened during the ten-year life of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), during the presence of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), during the presence of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), during the presence of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
These are the three factors which are the foundation of Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) power.
As long as his life had ended, nobody would have seen signs of weakness, grief, shamelessness, and disgrace in the words and actions of the Imam (r.a.).
A major portion of the global Revolution's Guards Corps starts to have doubts about their actions every year.
Sometimes they even reject the statements that they made in the past.
However, the Imam (r.a.) noted that he had the most enthusiastic and enthusiastic response in the year 1342.
He is old, but his heart is young, his spirit is alive.
This is the statement that the Holy Quran says: "And whoever has stood firmly on the path, We have shed much water to him."
In another Quran, the Holy Quran says, "These are the people who recite: Our Lord is Allah, and the angels descend upon them, saying: Fear not, nor be grieved, nor be trusted with the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household" [The Holy Quran, 41: 30]. These are the three faiths that have been promised by Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
The Iranian nation changed its wealth. And Allah the Exalted changed its hearts to them: "Surely Allah has not changed what the people have changed their hearts."
The Iranian nation has changed its path and its motivation, and Allah the Exalted has helped them.
What was the result?
There are a lot of things that our youth should know about the dependence of the Pahlavi satanic Pahlavi regime — which was mostly during the time of the Qajar regime — against England and America.
And their reliance on them is unacceptable.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, one of the prominent American diplomats added: "We are telling him what he needs and what he does not need.
It is they who tell him that you should maintain a relationship with a particular person.
You should produce oil in a particular country. You should sell oil in a particular country. You should sell oil in a particular country.
When a nation is dependent on other nations, it is turned into a free and noble nation.
Their corrupt heads, believers, monitors, and intellectuals were in power in the world, but they were republished in a nation.
They were changed by officials and the general public.
During the past thirty-something years, the heads of the government and economic and political affairs of the country have been public representatives.
This is an important point. They do not want to replace their heads when they take on the throne. Of course, some others are more important.
These corrupt politicians who are committed to the enemy and express their anger on the people have turned themselves into representatives of the people. Our country has made progress in scientific arenas and has turned into a country that has made progress in scientific arenas.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, we did not have any achievements in the area of scientific progress in our country.
Is this insignificant?
The global statistics say that by the next year - by 2017 - Iran will rank the world's highest number of knowledge in the world.
Is this insignificant?
We used to be a country where we wanted to construct a road, a river, a river or a company. If we wanted to construct a road, we had to invest in it and invest in it, and if we wanted to construct a road, we had to invest in it and invest in a company.
But today the youth of this nation - with no lack of self-confidence and no lack of self-confidence - are building thousands of industries, hundreds of shrubs, shrubs, and shrubs throughout the country.
Should we close our eyes to all these things?
In the arena of health and medication, because of a scarcity of pocket or pocket, our patients should go to European hospitals if they have to deal with it, but if they do not have it, they will be killed.
But today the highest range of silver, silver, and other important and important silver works are being carried out in our country. Not only in Tehran but many other cities are being carried out in this regard.
In this regard, the Iranian nation does not need any spaces.
We believe that in this sensitive part, we have dependence on ourselves.
During that time, many parts of the country had been forgotten.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, visiting many cities and villages in the country was not at all underestimated.
And today different kinds of services are being continued throughout the country, in different cities and villages.
Today nobody can say that a particular area does not have power plants or infrastructures such as infrastructures.
At that time, before the victory of the Revolution, the total number of students in the country was about 350 million and 50 million.
Today the number of students has declined twice, but the number of university students has declined 20 or 30 times more.
A majority of university students mean a majority of teachers and universities.
In every university, there are two, five, and 10 universities in one place.
At that time, there was even a state in which the number of secondary school students was low.
But today in this state, there are universities in every city and village.
This was the great movement of the Iranian nation thanks to the Revolution and the determination of our youth and government officials. This has been the case over the past thirty years.
These are important things.
Thanks to the Revolution, important and fundamental achievements were made in the country. There were thousands of manufacturing companies in the country.
Currently, we have exported goods from foreign countries, but today many of them are being exported in the country.
These things should be considered.
These things were achieved thanks to the three beliefs that had been placed in the hearts of the people of the country - faith in God, faith in the people, and self-confidence.
That is to say, we do not speak so much so that we might be satisfied with this false claim.
No, there is still a lot of work ahead of us.
There is a lot of difference between us and the Islamic Ummah. There is a lot of difference between us and the Islamic Ummah. There is a lot of difference between us and the Islamic Ummah. There is a lot of difference between us and the Islamic Ummah.
This is because our dear people and our courageous people should know that this path will be continued through their faith.
They know that there is a long way to go, but you can, you can, you can, you can, you can.
You can continue following this long path to the peaks.
I extend these words to you because you know that the enemies are trying to make obstacles in our hearts because of enmity.
The clear path lies ahead of us.
We have a straight path.
What is the foundation of our path?
The teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
We used to refer to the name of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.), but we forgot his teachings. This is a mistake.
It was Imam Khomeini (r.a.) who introduced his path to Islam, and he introduced it to us.
On the issue of foreign policy, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) taught the people: resistance against interference with the policies of colonialism, clampdowns on brotherhood and Muslim nations, cooperation with all the countries of the world except with the countries that have imposed their sights on the Iranian nation and against them. Fighting the Zionists, fighting for the liberation of Palestine, and assistance to the oppressed world and resistance against oppressive oppressors.
The Imam's (r.a.) wife was with us.
In cultural arenas, the teachings of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) were such: avoiding the culture of corruption and satanship in the west, avoiding consciousness and hate speech in religion, supporting moral and Islamic laws, and fighting corruption and prosperity in society.
In the economic arena as well, the teachings of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) were such: relying on the economy of the country, relying on domestic valor, economic integrity in production and division, supporting the unemployed people, fighting the capitalist culture and respecting domination. Imam Khomeini (r.a.) ignored the culture of oppression and capitalist valor, but he also appreciated the right to occupy, invest and work.
Similarly, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) asked us to appreciate the importance of the world economy. We should safeguard our independence in our economy.
The Iranian nation can remove this gap only through its firm faith and memory of its magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
The Iranian nation can make progress.
Regarding our capabilities, capabilities and outstanding personalities, the Iranian nation can pursue the clear path that has been built during the past 30 years as a result of the Revolution. By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will be a genuine role model for other Muslim nations.
This is the issue of elections, which is the issue of elections.
Dear brothers and sisters, dear Iranian people!
Elections are the manifestation of all the three beliefs that had been made by our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
Our responsibility is on our own, and our responsibility is on the destiny of our country.
We believe that Iranian pilgrims have these responsibilities.
It is also the manifestation of trust in the people because elections are the manifestation of the willpower of the people because they elect government officials through elections.
It remains the manifestation of self-confidence because anybody who votes during the election feels that he has played a role in determining the future of the country.
This is a very important thing.
Elections are the manifestation of trust in God and they are the manifestation of trust in the people.
Any vote that you give to one of these candidates - the eight of those who are in the arena of elections - is for the Islamic Republic.
Elections for each of these candidates are a vote for the Islamic Republic: a vote for the Islamic Republic is a vote for the Islamic Republic.
The fact that you participate in the arena of elections - whether the presidential candidates or the voters - that is, I and you - is dependent on the Islamic Republic and its conduct.
And the second stage is the issue of refusing to be a competition for you, for this competition for you, for this competition for you, for this competition for you, for this competition for me, for this competition for us, for this competition for us, for this competition for us, for this competition for us, for this competition.
Our enemies and the oppressors think that this election is a threat to the Islamic Republic. This is while the elections are a great opportunity for the Islamic Republic.
Their goal was either to hold elections smoothly in order to allow the people to break the Islamic Republic or create discord during the elections, just as it did in 2009.
This is what the enemies of our nation want.
But they made a mistake in this regard. The enemies of the Iranian nation forgot the day of Dei 9 (December 30, 2009) when the Iranian nation went to support the Islamic Republic after the fitna of the year 1388. Those who thought the majority of the country's population was opposed to the Islamic Republic, forgot that on Bahman 22, every year, 34 years, millions of people fled to different cities in order to support the Islamic Republic.
To de-escalate this election, they have designed some of their experts to speak out through these media.
Sometimes they say that elections are not free and sometimes they say that there is no freedom in elections. Sometimes they say that elections are unfair and in the eyes of the people.
No, they do not know our people, they do not know our elections, they do not know the Islamic Republic's system.
Is this true of capitalist countries?
In capital countries, if you are not part of one or three of these parties and if you have no support from the capitalists, their companies, and their dominant investors, you will only be able to vote.
Some people who do not have the support of Zionism and who do not have the support of capitalist and capitalist nations in the world will not be able to enter the ballot boxes whatever they do.
They do not have any broadcast media with them, and they do not have any televisions to replace their activities.
That is to say, they will only spend one minute of their work.
In our country, competers without killing or killing people, will not be allowed to send messages to people for a large number of times.
Why are these things happening throughout the world?
On the issue of elections, there is only law.
It is according to the law that certain people can enter the arena of elections, while others cannot enter the arena.
The law determines the judge that is preferred to be changed, that is to say, the judge must be changed.
All these things are carried out under law.
The enemies used to sit in a stone and close their eyes to all these things. They used to speak out. As I said, unfortunately some people - who were not afraid of God - used to repeat their words.
By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will answer these people with its identity and with its resistance, and their response will be disgraceful.
I would like to make a few points about the contestants as well. This is their right when the honorable contenders appealed to a number of government plans and plans.
However, it may be appropriate for them to maintain their determination, determination, and determination in order to the future.
They should pay attention to this point. I do not have any candidates. Currently, foreign media for the sake of opposition and evil intentions will say: "I'm preferred to any candidate."
I advise the brothers who are interested in promoting public interests to realize their statements in a fair way.
They did this, but they did not know what it was and they did not announce what a great achievement was made either in the government or in the previous governments.
It is not possible to criticize the good achievements that were made in the past.
Now anyone who gets on the throne in the country doesn't need to start working from the outset because thousands of great achievements have been made.
Over the years, a large number of construction projects have been carried out during different governments.
These should not be denied.
All those things that must be done in order to solve the economic situation and the cost of production is not enough, we must not deny these things. This is wrong.
If we had a solution from these problems, we would not have to deny all the things that have been done in the past.
Therefore, it is necessary to make promises that cannot be fulfilled.
I advise all contestants to make statements that if they had been recorded a cassette of statements in the same year, they would not be deceived.
Make promises that if they come to you in the future, you will not be making mistakes in the face of the latter and the latter.
Try to promise what you can do.
In our country, and according to the Constitution, the Presidency has a great power.
The presidential power in our constitutions is a great and prominent power.
The Managing Director is the Managing Director, the Managing Director is the Managing Director, the Managing Director is the Managing Director, the Managing Director is the Managing Director, the Managing Director is the Managing Director, and the Managing Director is the Managing Director.
The presidential hands are on different fronts.
The only thing that is accompanied by rule of law is righteousness.
It is only the law that is against him, and this is not against the parents.
The law is orientative, not restrictive.
Those who speak with the people today should tell them what they can and what people need.
If they have a structure and a structure, they should tell the people that they should make efforts in the face of these structures and they should under the pretext of using all the power that the law provides for the fulfillment of this great responsibility.
Some people make a mistake in thinking that we are dealing with the enemies in order to de-escalate their anger against us.
The interests of the people are more profound than the interests of the country. This is a mistake.
The enemy's pressures emerged from your presence, from the presence of the Islamic Republic because the Imam (r.a.) was alive in the hearts and minds of the people of the country and in what is being done. Because the people of Iran appeared from across the country on the 14th of Khordad, the day of Imam Khomeini's death.
This is the reason for their concern.
If our nation stands firm,ins its needs and resolves its problems, if it manages to strengthen its economy in the future, the enemy will be able to do nothing before the Iranian nation.
In any case, what is important is firm determination, faith in God, faith in the capabilities of the people and self-confidence, both in the classroom and in the individual class of a nation.
Dear brothers, the ten days are the season of great tests and I hope by Allah's favor the people will benefit from the tests of this great nation.
No power is rewarded with Allah, the Exalted, and the Exalted.
Leader’s Speech to Youth in Europe and North America - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Meet All European and North American Young People - Khamenei.ir
The recent events in France and other such events in certain Western countries made me deem it necessary to speak forward with you.
I speak with you dear youth, not because I hate your parents, but because you are the leaders of the world and the destiny of your country and your hearts are after the truth.
And I am not talking to your politicians and government officials because I believe that their policies have been clearly eliminated from the truths.
You speak against Islam, especially against what you are presenting as Muslims.
Over the past 20 years - that is to say, since the fall of the Soviet Union - the greatest efforts have been made to present this great religion as a great threat.
Unfortunately, such a situation of fear and fear is a frightening issue in the western political history.
I do not want to speak about the different kinds of terrorism that have been placed in the hearts of western nations so far.
If you take a look at the background of history, you will see that the new writers have rejected the oppressive behavior of the western powers towards nations and civilizations.
Europe and the U.S. are in the dark history of blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant and non-Christ.
Your historical scholars and outstanding personalities are inspired by the bloody blatant blatant blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemous blasphemo
The purpose behind part of this fragile phenomenon is not to make history bury. Rather, what I want is to ask your intellectuals why they have always been vigilant after the passage of decades or even hundreds of years.
Why should we depend on the issues that are taking place in our recent history and on the issues that are taking place today?
Why should they distort people from understanding important realities, such as the behavior, culture and Islamic thought?
As you know, blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatant blatants.
Now I want to ask you why has now been revoked the old method of making fear of Islam and Muslims?
Why does the hegemony of the world bring about an Islamic thought today?
What should they do when they think of the ideals and the ideals that are based on the ideals and the ideals of the global powers and what should they do when they think of Islam?
Therefore, the first needs of the Islamic Ummah is to ask them why they are trying to undermine the name of Islam.
The second requirement is to identify the truths of Islam with this religion in response to the propaganda that is being carried out in the name of Islam.
It is necessary to identify the truths of the world of Islam. However, I do not say that you should recognize or recognize an Islamic identity as an Islamic identity, but what I mean is to avoid being isolated from the realities that affect the modern world because of making a malevolent goal.
Do not allow you to be represented by Islam by the terrorists who are under your pretext.
First of all, you should know that Islam is based on its essential principles.
You should identify Islam with the Holy Quran and the life of the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.).
I would like to ask you, have you ever read the Holy Quran?
Did you learn the lessons of the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.) and his people about morality?
Have you ever understood that the message of Islam is from a different side, not from the media?
Were you wondering whether the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was established and whether he was the greatest culture, scientific and intellectual development of the world and was educated by the greatest intellectuals of the world?
I advise you to avoid using evil policies and slogans in order to keep you honest.
Now that social media is put ablaze on the front lines of countries, you should not be stuck in the hostages on the front lines.
Though nobody is capable of filling the gaps that has been created by anybody, each of you can create a fair way of reflection on the gaps that has been created.
Although the challenge that has been raised between you and the youth is a very strange challenge, it can create new questions in your hearts in search of realities.
An effort to find answers to these questions will give you an opportunity to discover new truths.
Therefore, you should not allow this opportunity to appreciate the truth of Islam. Therefore, you should not allow it to pass over this opportunity. Therefore, you should not allow it to pass over this opportunity.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Leader Appoints Dr. Ahmedinejad as Members of the Assembly of Experts - Khamenei.ir
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei appointed the ex-President of the Islamic Republic as a member of the Assembly of Experts.
The following is the full text of the commands issued on June 25, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
To the blessed presence of Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Considering the valuable achievements that you made during the past eight years as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, you have made many valuable achievements in this regard.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 20, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with thousands of people in the shrine of Imam Ridha (a.s.) in Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me another opportunity to meet you dear people, the dear youth of Mashhad, the dear people of Mashhad and the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this meeting in the holy city of Abul-Hasan Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha.
I would like to congratulate the people on the occasion of Norouz and the arrival of the new year and hopefully this year will be an auspicious year of blessings and joy for all Iranians. I hope this year will be an auspicious year for all Iranians.
In this meeting, I would like to discuss many issues which I would like to discuss with you dear brothers and sisters.
First, we should take a look at the issues that happened to us, our people and our country as well as the issues that happened to us in global arenas and in the region.
The reason why we should refer to the issues of the year 1390 and the past - the achievements of the Iranian nation this year - is because of the machinations of the enemies and the machinations of the spiteful and malevolent people against the Iranian nation.
The leaders of the arrogant powers, the bullying powers and their allies and mercenaries in our region - they have used all their power - whether monetary, political and propaganda power - to divert the attention of the Iranian nation and to make it disappointed.
Anybody who is following the propaganda of the spiteful and malevolent people of Iran can clearly see that these work-making efforts, economic efforts, political efforts, military threats, and other such things - which have seen the Iranian nation's steadfastness and progress from the arena of progress and progress - have made it clear that they are disappointed with and that they are present on the scene.
The Imam Khomeini (r.a.) learnt us the idea that we can, and the Islamic Revolution insisted on us that we can tell us that we cannot do anything from the hearts of a nation.
They made efforts to this goal. The year last year was the year they spent more efforts to this goal.
I wish everybody to realize that by following the expectations of the Iranian nation to continue its path, the Armed Forces have made progress and the resistance of the Iranian nation to show the Iranian nation - including the enemies - that we can.
The reason why we are talking about the dimensions of power and achievements is to ensure that the Iranian nation is making use of this power. Contrary to what spiteful people want to show that the Iranian nation cannot.
We do not have weakness in the way of wealth. We do not have weakness in the way of wealth.
We named the year 1390 (precedented) as "The Year of Economic Jihad"; therefore, this year (the first time I was talking) is about the issue of economy.
The achievements of our government officials in the arena of economic matters and the unity of the people in the country during the last year are very appreciative.
One of the things that can be said in this regard is that the policies of the Islamic Revolution are based on the importance of state aid.
Everybody knows that the implementation of these policies is mandatory in the country, whether in the previous governments or in the current government.
Though the problem with the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has been resolved in the past, the problem with the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps has been resolved in the past, and the problems with the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps have been resolved in the past, while the problems with the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps have been resolved in the past, and an important part of the initiative has been carried out in the past.
The task is not protective, but what government officials - both in the government and in the parliament - have already done and what the people have supported them is a successful task that is very important.
All of us have heard these things, but one should think carefully. This is a great achievement.
One of the goals of the initiative is to separate the government’s assistance to the people in a fair way.
In one response, I explained that the same assistance would not have been distributed in a fair way between different social groups. The same assistance would not have been distributed in a fair way.
I have good news from different parts of the country and it shows that it has been able to improve the livelihoods of the people of our country.
This is one of the goals of the bill and it is the most important goal of implementing it.
The next goal is to reform the production system and the economic system of the country.
Based on the figure of the economic figure - both of whom have agreed on this issue - economic figure can be fixed in the framework of the project and the project can simulate production and use.
The other purpose is to use the energy properly.
Of course we are a country where oil is blessed by God and we are used to invest in oil, gas and cannabis without care.
The fact that we benefit from these blessings belongs to many countries in the world - to more than any other country in the world.
The extracted statistics and the credible statistics show that if the preparedness had not started, the value of the preparedness that is used in the country would more than the value of the preparedness that is used in the country today.
When we are not at the service of domestic products, what should we do?
That is to say, the Iranian nation should be soft in the hands of the enemies and the spiteful.
Of course, the Iranian nation has managed to make progress as a result of this movement. Today the Iranian nation is almost equipped with the Iranian nation's progress. Therefore, we need to make progress.
This was what we did in the year 1390 before. Meanwhile, our enemies imposed sanctions on bringing our nation to its knees.
But through their efforts, the youth of our nation managed to resolve the machinations of the enemies."
What was done in the arena of knowledge and technology was a very important achievement that was made in the past few years as a result of the determination of the people.
Knowledge and technology are among the pillars for economic stability and stability.
When a nation acquires knowledge and advances its technology, it acquires power and political capabilities. It becomes honorable and powerful.
It is because the importance of scientific progress and technological progress, which makes me sensitive to this issue.
I get different reports on different fronts almost every day so I can tell you that the growth of the country has been far more than what has been announced so far.
According to the reports issued by scientific centers around the world - which were not mentioned by our scientific centers - scientific progress is currently the lowest rate of scientific progress in the world.
In the year 1390 which is approximately the year 2011 millennium, the Iranian nation managed to make more scientific advances than it did in the year 2010 millennium and its progress was 20 per cent. What does this mean?
This happens at a time when the enemies of the Iranian nation were excited about imposing fragile sanctions on the Iranian nation, but the Iranian nation managed to do something like that.
In their reports - also on the list of scientific centers that have been recognized in the world - it continues to say that in the region, Iran is the first country in the world to make progress in scientific arenas, and the fourth largest country in the world.
In the year 1390 we managed to make progress in the arena of artistic activities. In the year 1390 we managed to make progress in the arena of artistic activities. In the year 1390 we managed to make progress in the arena of artistic activities. In the year 1390 we managed to make progress in the arena of nuclear activities.
This 20-percent uranium is what America and some others decided to do before delivering us in the year 1389.
We had a duty to produce energy for our research center in Tehran because its existing value is very high.
We have been prepared to give us uranium and they have said we should carry out our export uranium, but we have denied this.
Brazilian and Turkish officials came here to meet our president and discuss it and lay down an agreement.
But after the signing of the treaties, the Americans declined. They did not want the treaties to be signed, they want to find a bit of it and they want to use force and force to push them down.
Due to the failure of the promises made by the Americans, Brazil and Turkey's governments are so angry. This is the case with an estimated 20 percent of the uranium.
Last year they produced 20-percent uranium using the Tehran nuclear power plant and made it known to the world. Our enemies were afraid and lost.
Although they know that Tehran's organization is based on the needs of the patients - that is to say, the needs of the patients and the needs of many other patients - it is opposed to it, it is opposed to it, it is opposed to it.
Our youth created it.
It is a difficult and complex task, but this has been done in the past, and different kinds of medication is being carried out in the modern city of Tehran with the domestic power.
This was the case in the year 1390 too.
Of course, when there is a mention of uranium exchanges that have been raised in the country, they say, "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Russia" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Russia" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of France" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of France" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and "By Allah's favor, give up the country of Iran" and they say, "By Allah's favor,
This was the case in the year 1390.
The increased number of pharmaceutical products that were mixed in the panegyrist up until six years ago, the increased number of foreign products that were exported and the increased number of public service projects - all of these products were produced in the year 1390.
These are part of the achievements of the year 1388 (the year 1388).
These are scientific progress, scientific progress and these things are indicative of scientific power, but they all have a direct impact on the country's economy.
At the end of the year 1390 - that is to say, the past week - I inaugurated the Institute for Industrial Research.
There are many things that have been done in different areas of knowledge. There are many things that have been done in different areas of knowledge. Therefore, one can say that such progress has not been made only in this area of knowledge. There are many things that have not been made in the backwardness of our nation and our people even in the dreams of knowledge.
The first step is the spirit and jihad of the people who are committed to this goal.
These intellectuals engage in jihad with the spirit of jihad. Just like those who engage in jihad, they are engage in jihad with the spirit of jihad for the sake of God.
There is a difference between those who work for the sake of money, position, fame and knowledge and those who work as a jihad for the sake of God.
This is a very valuable and important thing.
The second advantage is that our intellectuals have turned this sanction into an opportunity for our nation.
During the second half of my time, some people explained to me that we are thankful to Allah for making us sanctions.
This spiritual sense that the sanctions which the enemy has put on us as an opportunity is valuable and important.
The third advantage that I am enjoying at that point is the great credibility that I have.
They only have a small portion of industrial production from three to four countries, and they do not allow anybody to gain such technology.
For many years, we have been in need of teaching women in this arena, and these difficult and complicated duties have killed many people in this arena.
But my eyes saw that they were trying to say that we can.
The sincerity of a nation with the intellectuals and youth of a nation is very valuable.
Another characteristic is self-confidence and youth.
This is because labor is in the hands of the youth.
Our youth are a source of brilliance and innovation.
The relations between industries and universities are a different characteristic.
I have always advised the officials in charge of different sectors of relations with the governments to make efforts to build relations between industries and universities.
Fortunately, this relationship was strengthened at that time.
Of course this includes a combination of all our industries and universities, which pushes us towards scientific progress as well as our industries.
This is the economic aspect of the year 1390; the year that the enemies had plunged from the beginning to the end; they threatened at times, they imposed political pressures at times, and they imposed sanctions on us.
Currently, the supporters of the US regime are trying everywhere to implement these sanctions in order to harm the Iranian nation and create a rift between the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic.
There were other great achievements made in the year 1390.
Conference on Islamic Awakening, Conference on Palestine, Conference on Armed Forces, International Conference without terrorism, Youth and Islamic Awakening - these are all among the things that was done in Tehran.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has become a center where the eyes of the world of Islam are focused on achieving goals.
In the arena of economic services, thousands of houses have been built and sold to the people.
This is a very valuable and important figure. House buildings were built in villages, street buildings were built in large numbers.
These were the things that were created in the course of the years of justice.
In spite of the plots made by the enemies and their enemies, the Iranian nation has continued its progress and transcendence.
Of course we should pay attention to the fact that the elections are yet to end.
This election is very important.
I would tell you that it is about six months now that the enemy has been trying to kill the people in order to prevent them from coming out.
They used to say that there is a lot of money in the country. They used to say that there is a lot of money in the country. They used to say that there is a lot of money in the country and they used to say that there is a lot of money in the country.
Sometimes our people were crushed to death by killing our outstanding personalities - who were crushed to death in the past six months - and their purpose was to insult our people and kill them.
Over the past ten years, the number of presidential elections in the Senate has not increased by 40 per cent.
You should compare these with the Iranian nation. You should take a look at the presence of the people. You should take a look at the Iranian nation.
By following such pressures, through such logic, such threats and such brutal killings, the 12th of Esfand is the day of the separation between the people and the Islamic Republic, but unlike what they expect, this day is the day of honor for the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
This election was a source of truth and a source of power.
They used to scribbling stories about Iran, disinformation of Iran and disinformation of realities, but this election cannot be denied.
This has already taken place in the eyes of the people.
This election served as a powerful and portable tool to reveal the truths of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic to other nations in the world.
These were the events that happened in the year 1390 and the year in which the enemies tried to defeat the Iranian nation.
These were some of the greatest achievements of the Iranian nation in the year 1390.
Since the issue of nuclear energy has been discussed, it has been questioned by the enemies.
Of course, they know, and they even say that Iran does not want to buy nuclear weapons.
This is the truth. We do not want to use nuclear weapons for any reason, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons, we do not want to use nuclear weapons.
What is the essence?
The main point is the resistance of the Islamic Republic against the natural resources of our country.
And the future - just like the future - is dependent on economic power, scientific power and military policies as well as energy and oil.
Gasoline is needed for the future of the world, and this is something that everybody has accepted.
The arrogant powers know that their souls are dependent on oil and gas.
On the one hand, the western powers have to deal with the problem that they are faced with in order to reward the needs of the people. And the western powers have to deal with the problem that they are faced with in order to reward the needs of the people. And the western powers have to deal with these problem on a daily basis.
Petroleum supplies from certain European and Western countries in the global atmosphere will be approved for four years, six years or nine years. Therefore, they should make use of the blessings of certain countries.
The U.S. government, which has so far deposited about three billion barrels and a bit of money, is based on what our experts have done — and this depends on the number and figures of the Americans’ export — by the year 2021, the new year will be safeguarded.
At that time they would be relying on oil originating from the Persian Gulf which is more than 50% of the world’s population originating from this region.
At that time it would depend on the three prime oil products of our region and the factory sea, which is one of the prime oil products of our region.
Between all the countries of the world - not just the countries of the Persian Gulf - the country with the highest number of oil and gas consumption is the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Gasoline is far more than we do, and oil is far more than we do.
By Allah's favor, we are the second largest country in the world - the first country in the world - in terms of gas, and then we are the fourth country. There are three countries that are ahead of us - which are more than any other country.
This is an excuse for the countries that are using fuel, for the organizations of the arrogant powers whose life is dependent on energy, oil and gas.
It is up to ten years to fifteen years now that the Islamic Republic of Iran will continue defending it.
A country that has oil and gas resources like this, what do the arrogant powers want?
They want this country to be controlled by a government and a government that is like a bullying in the hands of some regional countries. These countries produce oil and many other countries, but they are like a bullying in the hands of the Americans: they say, "The majority of you live in, and they say, 'The majority of you live in, and they say, 'The majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live in, and the majority of you live
In the oil and gas sector, if a pioneering government stands on the path of safeguarding the economy and approves the policies of the enemies, it is wrong to deny the government.
Those who think that if we take back on the nuclear issue, America will put an end to its enmity - they have ignored this fact.
Their issue is not nuclear.
Certain countries are equipped with nuclear weapons, but they are not equipped with them.
Therefore, it is not the issue of nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons.
The problem lies in the fact that the Islamic Republic has stood beside the Islamic Republic like a weakness.
And if, just like some other countries in the region, the Islamic Republic is ready to fight against it, it will not be able to fight against it.
This is the reason why they are opposed to the Iranian nation.
Of course the Americans are making a mistake.
It is a great mistake to think that through their enmity and threats, they can force the Islamic Republic to retreat, or that they can defeat the Islamic Republic from the arena of action.
Westerners do not allow their nations to understand what hardships they could face in the arena of spiritual blessings.
They do not want their nations to pay attention to the issue of their oil and energy. They do not want to tell their nations this.
They thought that the Iranian nation would not be able to do so further by expressing its enmity.
Dear brothers and sisters, dear people of Iran, I would like to announce that the US, with all its power and enthusiasm in the aftermath of the conflict, is weak and defeated.
I am not just wanting evidence or any other special news. What I will say is something that is clearly similar to the two calculations of the nine and two.
Now, the US President is gaining power as a result of his "transgender" slogan.
What does change mean?
That is to say, we are in a very bad situation and we want to change it.
The slogan was entered the arena and people voted for the slogan. Otherwise the people of the U.S. were not prepared to give an oppressive vote to a particular person, but they voted for reforms.
That is to say, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this person stands up, the situation of America when this
Therefore, it has been admitted that the condition is bitter.
I do not want me to speak about this, but the Americans themselves showed that their situation was worse.
When did these people enter the arena of government and make certain changes?
Did they manage to change this tragic atmosphere?
It can improve or improve the quality of the product that is produced in the country.
This is a serious challenge for a country.
This is the current policy: it forces them to leave Iraq without achieving any achievements. In Afghanistan, their condition is almost every day.
In Islamic countries, in Egypt, in North Africa and in Tunisia, the American reputation has fallen down in their eyes.
In addition to all these things, you will see the Wall Street movement that has just begun within America.
Is this a good condition?
Therefore, America is faced with serious problems.
America might be threatening other countries.
I would like to announce that we do not have a nuclear weaponry and we will not have a nuclear weaponry. But in order to protect ourselves from any kind of enemy attack against us - whether America or the Zionist regime - we will give them an appropriate response to the enemy's attacks.
The Holy Quran promises us: "As for the unbelievers as well as the unbelievers, they will never find a suffer. They will never find a suffer."
[The Holy Quran, 48: 22-23] Allah's path will not be changed before Allah's path.
No part of the Holy Quran says that if you start a war and attack, you will victory. You may victory. You may defeat as it did in the early years of Islam, when Muslims attack and when they are defeated in some places.
He has promised that when the enemies start attacking you, they will definitely be defeated.
We should not think that this is the case in the beginning of Islam. No, "God's grace is out of this and you will not change your path to God." This is a divine call.
The Iranian nation is determined. It does not mean that it is attacked by anybody, but it is related to it and its honor, dignity, Islamic dignity, and Islamic Republic with all its power.
That is to say, when you are a domestic producer, you are helping Iran grow, you are helping the Iranian nation grow, you are helping the Iranian nation grow, you are helping the Iranian nation make progress.
This wrong and misguided tradition - which is unfortunately comprised of some social sectors - of using outstanding products is harmful for our world, for our progress and for our future.
Everyone of us is responsible, we need to support and strengthen our domestic production.
Today the officials have a base in hand, and they can use it as a tool to strengthen our domestic production.
The same is true of the fact that both the people - both the capitalists and the people who have the right to work - should work together.
You should be producers and consumers of domestic products.
It is not honorable and it is wrong that we are delivering foreign goods in our home, in our farms, in the needs of the day and in the needs of the day and in the needs of the day and in the needs of the day.
I have heard that some of the products that are produced in some cities of the country are used to be marked by foreign companies and returned to them.
Of course, if they are not on the market, they may not have the right to go on the market, but if they are on the market, they may have the right to go on the market, they may have the right to go on the market, they may have the right to go on the market.
The domestic production is very important.
Production is one of the most important things that can be done in the country. Production is one of the most important things that can be done in the country.
Dear brothers and sisters, today we need unity and cooperation throughout the country.
There are many factors that create differences and differences.
This shows us that the views of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the views of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are different in one way or another.
Sometimes, one may have this view of labor and another may have a different view of labor. This should not be a source of differences.
The Holy Quran teaches us: â€œDon’t be deceived until your enemy is defeatedâ€ [The Holy Quran, 8: 46] If we defeat various kinds of affairs - including political, economic and economic matters - when we are defeated, our enemies will be defeated.
The increase in the power of our enemies’ attacks in the past few years was the result of growing differences between us and others.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) teaches us and says, "Whoever is after the truth and is wrong, he does not correspond with whoever is after falsehood."
If an opponent is after the truth, he wants the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Revolution and he loves religion and Allah the Exalted, his path is wrong.
He is different from those who are against the Islamic Republic and are against the Islamic Republic.
Your hearts and behaviors towards one another are kind and sympathetic. Unfortunately, the new media and social media platforms have enabled the people to speak wrongly about one another.
The essence is that we should feel that we should follow an Islamic model and observe the law.
This speech should not be regarded as a narrative, but some people should blame and accuse our revolutionary youth of ethnic hate speech at the service of perception.
Of course, I deem all the active, faithful and enthusiastic youth in the country the children and I support them. I support the faithful and revolutionary youth.
Everybody should respect the law.
The Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is part of the Islamic Republic's constitution.
The same is true of Iranian officials.
Governments honor the wicked parliament, the parliament also honor the wicked government and the president of the country. They should cooperate with each other and cooperate with each other.
This does not mean that all of them are intellectuals.
I hope that the year 1391 that began today will be an auspicious year for the Iranian nation.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, help our dear youth and our dear people tread this path.
Dear God, punish and suppress the enemies of this nation.
Dear God, bestow Your resistance and determination on the goals of this great nation. Make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us and make us benefit from His prayers.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with thousands of people in the shrine of Imam Ridha (a.s.) in Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Two Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Greetings be upon Siddikat al-Tahirah Fatimah, the Holy Prophet’s (God’s greetings be upon her, her father, her husband and her children) daughter.
I would like to express my condolences to all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this great meeting.
I hope that Allah the Exalted will guide our hearts and languages towards His blessings.
I would like to congratulate my dear youth on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz, on the occasion of Norouz and on the occasion of Norouz.
Dear brothers and sisters, you should pay attention to the fact that we Iranian people are not the only people that can take attention to our affairs and account for them. There are other people who can take attention to our affairs and responsibilities.
Certain nations benefit from our experience. They take care of the Iranian nation's situation and they are happy about our success.
If we succeed, they feel that they are successful. And if there is no doubt in us, they feel hot and grief.
There are some people in the world who are following up our responsibilities, but the opposite is the first.
They are desperate hopefuls for the Iranian nation.
Therefore, they are the people who have been in charge of all affairs in the country for many years.
The Islamic Revolution came and their hands were shed.
Therefore, they are opposed to the Revolution and they are opposed to the government that the Revolution created.
We are considering a large number of human beings.
Therefore, when we take a look at our future plans and plans, our view of labor should be real.
Some of us look at the situation of the country and do not look at the weakness of the country.
They did not see anything except the expansion of domestic production, the decline in domestic production and the pressure of the enemy.
I have a different view of labor.
When I take a look at the situation of our country and the people, I see that the Iranian nation has managed to victory in this regard despite the enmity of the enemies.
Without a doubt, there are certain shortcomings in the country. Some superpowers of the world who are working for the Iranian nation to suppress the Iranian nation are working for the Iranian nation to suppress it.
The unqualified woman, who recently served as the secretary of state in charge of military activities outside the U.S., was quarrelled and said that we wanted to impose on the Islamic Republic sanctions on Iran.
I will explain what they have done and what they have done in the future.
Therefore, on the one hand, there is the enemy's enmity and enmity in the face of the enemies' confrontation with the Iranian nation. On the other hand, the great achievements of the Iranian nation are indicative of its power and capabilities.
When one takes a look at this arena, it is like the arena of sports where there are many capacities and capacities, but there is only one champion who will be worthy of achieving victory and other people should appreciate it.
The Iranian nation is the champion of this great arena in front of our eyes.
Whoever considers this arena appropriately, his research appropriately, will appreciate the Iranian nation. As we know today, we hear about this appreciation from other nations, including those of the countries that are opposed to Iran.
Some politicians, outstanding universities and those who know where the world is moving forward and who look at the situation - all praise the Iranian nation.
The efforts that have been made throughout the country should be taken into account as well as the results that will be achieved in this regard.
Who are these people?
I will briefly speak about this issue later on.
The enemies who cannot expect the Iranian nation's progress in all arenas have two main plans. First, they will try as much as they can to prevent the Iranian nation from achieving this progress.
Through sanctions, through threats, through interference with government officials and certain other activities, they will prevent them from carrying out sensitive and sensitive duties. The second point is that they should deny the advances that have been made in their media. Today there are thousands of different media in the world who have involved in this move to show the world that the Iranian nation has not made any progress.
In his speech, the president of the United States of America addressed the economic problems of the country. The same is true of his achievements.
He said that the country’s economic value was higher than its value.
But I do not mention the good achievements that have been made in our country and the great achievements that have been made by the Iranian nation. For 30 years, we have been faced with these challenges. I will briefly speak about the achievements of the Iranian nation during the past 30 years.
The year 1391 last year was one of the years that our enemies used to deal with the issue of enmity.
They said we wanted to undermine the Iranian nation through sanctions.
This is because if the Islamic Republic stands firm andins progress, its honor will decrease.
Therefore, if they can, they should not let it go. If they fail to do so, they should try to improve this through their media and propaganda.
Today these two measures are being adopted by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps. These two measures are being adopted by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, and these two measures are being adopted by the Islamic Revolution.
We said there were enemies.
Who are these enemies?
What is the foundation of these great plots?
Answering on this question is not difficult.
Today it is 30 years now that everybody who is referred to as the "enemy" is in the hearts of the Iranian nation's minds and minds towards the US government.
For more than three decades, the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized that the Iranian nation has realized
This is an important point, and any government that desires to live an honorable life in the world should pay attention to this point, and it should learn its lessons.
They are the foundation of such machinations and enmities.
Of course, there are other kinds of enemies as well, but they are not considered to be the first kind of enemy.
The Zionists are also the enemies, but the Zionist government does not have the right position to make them among the enemies of the Iranian nation.
At times, the Zionist regime threatens us and threatens us with a military attack. But in my opinion, they even know that if they do not know, they should know that if they attack us, the Islamic Republic will destroy the "Tel Aviv", "Haifa" and other such people.
The corrupt British government is also enmityful to the Iranian nation.
England is one of the oldest enemies of the Iranian nation, but the British government is an American mercenary.
The British government itself does not have any independence, but it considers itself a self-sufficient enemy - the American mercenary.
There are some governments that show enmity.
I deem it necessary to inform you that the French government has recently shown its enmity to the Iranian nation. This is what the French government is doing.
A intelligent man, a politician who knows the right thing, should not turn his unknown man into the enemy.
We did not have any problems with the government and France, and we did not have any problems with them throughout the history, just as at this time. But the wrong policy of the enmity of the Iranian nation began during the Sarkozy rule, and the progressive government continued to do so.
This is a mistake in our view, and it is a lack of reasoning and a lack of reasoning.
When they speak, the Americans say they are “nationalities.” They named some countries as “nationalities” — namely, the United States, their Zionist mercenaries, the British government and other governments.
The world does not resist Iran and the Islamic Ummah. Now that we are looking for another look at the year 1391, we should know that since the beginning of the year 1391, the Americans began making a new plot.
Since the beginning of the year 1391, severe sanctions have been imposed on the Iranian nation: oil sanctions, banks, and monetary exchange between the Islamic Republic and other countries. There have been many things to do in this regard.
They are opposed to this reason, but they hope that the Iranian nation will not realize that the Iranian nation is the enemy and that it is opposed to it.
During the past few years, in a meeting with Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha (greetings be upon him and his household), in a meeting with me the beginning of the year, I said you should be careful not to say that your love does not mean that you are humble and that you want to be kind, but you are hurting your.
The U.S. government has specified individuals to speak to the countries of the world, go to these countries and negotiate with the leaders of corporations in order to prevent their economic and economic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
They should also prosecute them if they have established a financial and oil relationship with the Islamic Republic.
It started this work since the beginning of 1391, especially from the month of Mordad, where it was spent very much.
Of course, I have to say - in the past few months I have spoken about this point as well - that the Americans were excited to show that the sanctions were effective and that they would not say that the sanctions were effective if they wanted to be happy.
Our economy is faced with a problem that it is relying on oil.
We should separate our economy from a fuel-based economy. Our governments should put this in their plans.
Fifty-nine years ago, I told the government that they should have a system that can shut down our lives whenever we want.
At that time, some people who call themselves “struggle” were shouting slogans and asked, “Is this possible?”
Yes, it is possible to move forward. It is necessary to be prepared.
When the economy of a country is deprived of a particular area, it is the place where the enemies are determined to do this.
Of course, sanctions are effective, but they are not the same as the enemy wants.
I will explain all these things to the future. This is about the issue of the economy. As far as political activities have been carried out, the enemies have made as much as they can for the year 1391 to view the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Republic.
The Islamic Republic must not allow the Islamic Republic to influence and develop its policies in this region and in other parts of the world. They have been defeated in this regard as well.
The opposite was what they expected to see.
The countries of the Islamic Revolution make up two per cent of the total population of the world. Leaders and officials of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps have attended the meeting in Tehran.
Both of them praise the Iranian nation.
They told us this, and they all spoke about it in their interview with the media, and their people all realized it after they returned home.
That is to say, the opposite of the enemies of the Iranian nation has been expected to happen.
They could not affect it.
In the arena of domestic politics, the purpose behind these sanctions is to raise doubts in the hearts of the Iranian nation about its path. Creating discord between the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic.
On Bahman 22, the Iranian nation managed to bring the Iranian nation to its knees through its fitnas, expressing its sympathy and sympathy towards the Islamic and Revolutionary Guards.
In terms of security, they have made their utmost efforts to destroy the health of the country, which have been clarified by government officials during their interviews with the media.
In the political arena of the region as well, they have been trying to curb the influence of the Islamic Republic.
In the regional political arena, they have proven that there is no regional problems that can be solved without the presence of Iran and its relying on Iran.
In the case of the Zionist regime's attack to Gaza, this presence on the front line has caused the Zionists to be defeated by the Palestinian activists. They themselves speak about this.
But they said - not I said - that without the presence of the Islamic Republic and its power, the Palestinian activists would not be able to stand up against Israel at all times.
This is because during the eight-day war, Palestinians managed to defeat the Zionist regime.
I said that their efforts would not affect them. Of course they were effective, but they brought about a great achievement in one way.
That is to say, the sanctions have influenced the people of Iran with their capabilities and they have made valuable achievements. Without these sanctions, such things would not have happened.
Our youth managed to such goals without sanctions and we did not such goals. In the area of construction work, which I will explain briefly later on, the year 1391 we made progress compared to the past, the year 1391 can be an unprecedented year.
Many advanced projects have been carried out in the country - in the area of construction, in the area of power, in the area of refinery, in the area of refinery, in the area of refinery, in the area of refinery, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area of power, in the area
We made considerable scientific progress in the year 1391.
In terms of scientific and technological work, we have made numerous efforts last year to encourage people to believe in a good future for our society.
That is to say, our dear youth and outstanding personalities transported the people of Nahid to the battlefields this year. The battlefields were transported to the battlefields in the battlefields.
When this life-giving habitat is brought back to our youth, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our youth, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our human beings, when this life-giving habitat is brought back to our
But later, when the truth was revealed to everybody, they did not find a way to trust it.
In the area of health and medical areas, great achievements have been made which are related to the health of the people.
In the arena of biodiversity, we were one in the region.
Great achievements were made and several other medications were made.
All these things are done in the year that the Iranian nation has been prohibited from living a good way and from achieving human successs.
And this year, we have been at the top of many important scientific areas.
In the arena of academic knowledge and technology, the country has lost 30 per cent compared to last year.
In 1391, there were more than twenty five university students compared to the beginning of the Revolution.
That is to say, the number of our university students grew by twenty and five percent of our students who graduated from our university academies last year.
This is the great victory of the Iranian nation.
Great achievements have been made both in the area of water and climate, in the area of biodiversity, in the area of new energy, in the area of raw materials and in the area of nuclear energy.
These things are the case in the year when the enemies of the Iranian nation have done their utmost efforts to bring the Iranian nation to its knees.
There are great lessons from the events of the year 1391.
And I assure all of us and all those who take care of the issues of Iran. What is important for a nation is to rely on its power, reliance on Allah the Exalted, self-confidence and lack of self-confidence.
That is why we should move ahead.
The year 1391 was an atmosphere of analyses.
Of course, we know what we are doing. This is the characteristic of the environment.
During the Sacred Defense Era, the Armed Forces were aware of their capabilities and weakness in order to cure it.
We recognize the weakness of them.
And this weakness originates from relying on what we have done - which I described earlier as one of our weaknesses - on the lack of political preservation, economic planning and on the current levels of life.
The officials in charge of the government - the officials who are now on the throne and especially the officials who will come after the presidential election that will be held this year - should pay attention to this point.
Another great lesson that we have attracted is that the construction foundation of the country is a powerful foundation.
When the foundations are strong, the plots of the enemies will not be affected much.
If the great government officials of the country and the powerful government identify their responsibilities and fulfill their responsibility appropriately, they will be able to turn all kinds of threats into opportunities.
By Allah's favor, the effect of the government and the people of the country in the year 1391 will be awakened in the future.
Of course, the economy is very important. I have spoken about this issue many years ago, but the economy is not just an important issue. The security of the country is also important, the health of the people is important, scientific progress is important, but it is also the basis of work.
Therefore, if knowledge prevails on a daily basis, other things will be done in the future.
National dignity is also important. The lack of vigilance in a nation is important. The effect of regional affairs on a nation and a country that guarantees national independence and security.
We have made progress in all these areas.
In terms of security, in terms of health, in terms of international influence and in terms of domination, the country has faced various kinds of problems.
Through such progress, our people proved that missing the power of the United States does not mean going backward. This is an important point.
In the superpowers and colonialists of the world - when there is direct domination - today the U.S. wants to show that if you want a better life and a better progress, you should be under our power.
The Iranian nation has proven this is false.
Our nation has proven that the lack of reliance on America and other global powers will not only lead to progress but also lead to progress.
There are certain countries that depend on themselves.
We have 30 years of experience in this regard. You should see how the Islamic Republic has behaved in the past 30 years and how the Islamic Republic has behaved in different countries.
Whoever is interested in this, will realize that lack of reliance on global powers is an opportunity for a nation and it is not a threat.
Thankfully the Iranian nation has exploited this opportunity thanks to its power, courage and wisdom.
Once I did this and I witnessed its success.
An example is the issue of 20 percent of the nuclear power supply that the Tehran's research centre needs.
“This small plant needs 20 potatoes, which we did not even produce at that time, we imported from outside.
They should criticize our national needs and force the Islamic Republic to accept their ideas and demands.
But even before it arrives to a position that would be problematic for us, our youth and outstanding personalities prepared the ground for 20 per cent of the energy supply chain in order to address the needs of the foundation.
Our opposition cannot afford to do so.
But at that time our officials identified the needs of the country and strengthened our national defense, and we managed to do so.
When they think that the Islamic Republic will come to their knees in order to reduce its energy to 20 per cent, the Islamic Republic announces that we are preparing for this energy, but that we do not need you.
If our intellectuals and youth had not managed to do this, we would have deceived the needs of the people who are opposed to us and we would have presented them with the needs of the people who are opposed to us.
The officials of the country recognized this and they did the right thing to do.
Therefore, we should victory. The government should be responsible in all the affairs of the country. The Iranian governments, industries, farmers, entrepreneurs, intellectuals, scientists and industries should carry out this great responsibility, and it should be careful not to say that they should prepare themselves and move forward in the face of the enemies in their plots.
The issues that should be written in this regard are the same: scientific research is the same.
If they do industrial or scientific work, all of them should be in this regard.
“The responsibility of all of us is to build the country in a impossible way and to influence the enemy.
Let us preserve it. This is one of the worst economic economies of our resistance.
In the economy of resistance, one of the essential pillars is to put the economy in the face of threats.
The economy should be faced with threats. It should be able to face whatever is faced with the enemies' plots.
This is the first point that I should announce to you.
The second point is that in different ways, the Americans used to send messages to us and they used to speak about nuclear issues. They used to send messages to us and they used to disinformation them through their media.
American high-ranking officials and high-ranking officials repeatedly told us that after the 5+1 negotiations, the U.S. and the Islamic Republic should stand on the table of negotiations on the nuclear issue. I do not have good expectations for this negotiation.
What do he do?
Because our experience shows that negotiating from the US perspective is not our place to find a conscious solution, it does not mean that negotiating is.
What they mean is our room for discussion, our room for discussion so you trust what we have said!
Therefore, we have always announced that this is not a negotiation.
I don’t have certain hopes about these things, but I don’t have any pressure on them.
However, there are some points that you should keep up:
First, the Americans used to send us a message, and they used to send us a message, saying that we do not want to control the Islamic Republic. They used to tell us that what they are doing is a message.
Our answer is that we do not want you to believe that you are against the Islamic Republic. You should not want us to believe that you are against the Islamic Republic.
That is to say, you will not be able to do anything in the future as long as you are determined to overthrow the Islamic Republic.
The second point is that the Americans are saying in their message that we are honest with the issue of negotiations.
That is to say, we really want to speak with you and speak with you in a conscious way. That is to say, we do not want to speak with you in a conscious way.
And I tell you: We have repeatedly told you that we do not want to create a nuclear attack, but you have said that you do not believe.
Why should we believe in what you say?
When you are not prepared to accept a righteous and righteous statement which is not righteous, what is the reason why we believe in your statement that you repeatedly showed the opposite?
Getting us through the negotiating counseling with the Americans is a kind of deception and deception to the people of the world and people of our country.
You should be sure that this is not the case.
Can you prove?
During this meeting, I would like to announce that one of their ideas was that some people from the Leader of the Islamic Revolution went to negotiating with Americans.
This is another form of propaganda and it is a great lie.
Until now, nobody from Ayatollah Khamenei was in contact with them.
Third point is that what we know and what is based on our experience is that the U.S. does not want to end nuclear negotiations.
The Americans do not want to end this nuclear negotiation and this issue to be resolved. Otherwise, if they want to end this issue and resolve it, the issue will be resolved through a clear and enlightened path.
On the issue of the nuclear issue, what Iran wants is that the world recognizes its right to uranium, which is a right.
Global powers should admit that the Iranian nation has the right to use uranium in order to stability in its country as well.
Is this a great hope? This is what we have always said.
They said, "We are afraid that you will continue to develop a nuclear power."
And they are some countries whose name I have known in the past. They call themselves, "International Nations".
They said the countries of the world were afraid.
No, the countries of the world are not afraid.
Most countries in the world support the Islamic Republic and our needs. They did this because the needs of the Iranian nation are real.
They believe that Iran has the right to waste urnium and in order to curb this concern, they can comply with the provisions of the World Nuclear Power Council.
Whenever we are approaching for the solution, the Americans call the ban on this solution.
Their goal, as far as we can understand, is to pursue this issue in order to attain that they have to pressure the people.
Of course, as they say, these pressures will not manage to control the Iranian nation.
The fourth and last point in this regard is that if the Americans really want to put an end to this issue, I will give them a solution.
The following is the full text of the message: The Americans should put an end to the enmity of the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
If they want to put an end to the problems that exist between us and America - as they say, we want to create a problem between Iran and the United States - they want to put an end to this enmity.
For more than three decades, different American governments have been making plans to harm the Iranian nation through their misguided understanding.
Since the victory of the Islamic Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic government, they have shown enmity to us.
In the arena of security, they have prepared the way to harm our security. They have acted in a hostile way and have defeated our country. They have supported the enemy for many years. They have prepared the way to harm our economy.
Therefore, I advise the officials of the US. If they are after a conscious way, the appropriate way is to fix their policies, fix their duties and put an end to their enmity towards the Iranian nation. This is the end of this debate.
There is another point which should always be mentioned in this meeting: the issue of elections is very important.
Elections in our country are a manifestation of political valor.
Elections are the manifestation of political enthusiasm. They are the manifestation of the establishment of the Islamic Republic. They are the manifestation of the honor of the Islamic Republic. The Islamic Republic can determine the presence of the people in the elections and the influence of individual individuals on the elections.
Elections are the symbol of national willpower and a symbol of Islamic democracy.
Therefore, considering the importance and significance of elections, it is necessary that the enemies of the Iranian nation constantly try to create discord for the Iranian elections.
They have laid out plans to prevent the people from participating in elections, kill them and make them hateful.
Thro the years that we have conducted elections - whether parliamentary or presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to prevent the elections from happening because of the importance of elections in the country.
Let me say a few things before the elections. Of course, there were two months and a few months before.
I would like to discuss a number of other points.
“On the basis of the first stage, the first stage in general elections is that the presence of the people in general elections is very important.
The presence of the people in the elections can reduce the impact of the enemies’ threats. It can make the enemy disappointed and safeguard the security of the country.
The people throughout the country should know that their presence in the elections will influence the future of the country - including security, independence, economic security, and economic security - as well as all the important issues of the country.
That is to say, by Allah's grace, assistance and determination, the Iranian nation managed to make the greatest elections for the Iranian nation.
Second point is that all parties and groups that believe in the Islamic Republic should join the elections.
It is a everybody’s right. It is a everybody’s duty.
Elections are not for a particular party or political party.
Those who believe in the Islamic Republic's system and the freedom of the country and are committed to the future of this country and the movement of the people should join the elections.
Negligence in the elections is appropriate for those who are opposed to the Islamic system.
Third point is that public opinion can determine the outcome of elections.
It is you own to conduct an investigation into the candidates who have voted, advise with your trustworthy people so you can find the best person to choose him.
I do not have more than one vote.
As everybody else, I have one vote in this meeting and before the elections nobody knows what I want to vote for.
Of course, the people who take care of the elections should know what to write in that case. They should know who should I vote for.
If somebody says this, it is not true.
Of course, in those days and in those amazing and outstanding media, including daily prayers, there are many different kinds of publicity and speeches to other people.
One may send thousands of messages to one another.
“I was that on the day of the elections, there were hundreds of million such messages.
You should be careful not to influence the situation of the country.
Of course, anybody or any political party can attract the attention of other people - there are no problems with this issue - but about this issue nobody will hear anything from me.
In any case, the people can advise and help each other to determine the right man.
The most important point is, of course, the opinion of the people.
The fourth point is that in matters related to elections and non-election, everybody should pay attention to the law.
What happened in the year 1388 - which harmed and destroyed the country after the presidential election - resulted in the lack of respect for the legislation. They do not want to respect the opinion of the people.
The opinion of the people may be used to what I want, but we should appreciate this.
It is necessary to appreciate what a majority of people want.
These legal measures should be adopted.
We call the people to go and go because only what happened is used to what we wanted - just as it did in 1388 - and this is one of the mistakes that could not be cured for their losses.
This is a lesson for the Iranian nation, and the Iranian nation will stand up against this.
Last but not least, everybody should know that we need to be in charge of the presidential elections in the absence of the weakness of the country.
Everybody should know that the president should always be superior to what the president has done, but not inferior to the weakness of the president.
Everybody has an advantage as well as a weakness.
The heads of the country - both today and in the future - are strong and weak.
The future leader should have the main characteristics that are present in the presence of the current government and the current president.
That is to say, among the governments that have come and go, they should move towards one another's progress and perfection.
Those who are prepared to enter this arena should make efforts with all their power, relying on God and relying on the capabilities of this nation.
Dear God, bestow the good and the benefit of this nation on its own.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with all of us.
Dear God, make the holy souls of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and our martyrs happy with us.
Dear God, make what we have said for Your sake and tread Your path.
Leader’s Speech on Economic Jihad - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 17, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on the occasion of the 16th of Ramadan.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to extend my congratulations to the dear brothers and sisters who are working for different sectors of the country’s economy.
On the one hand, today's summit is a point that shows the importance of this system to the issue of the economy in such a sensitive part of the world, the region and the country.
One day in the month of Ramadan, we want the officials in charge of the economic matters of the government, businessmen and different other sectors to come together, sit up, listen to the statements and observe these statements in the country on a few hours, to ensure that the issue of economy is very important and that the government - in the area of government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government, government,
This is the first point.
This is a message to everybody - both the government officials in the area of economic affairs and the executive officials in the area of economic affairs in all parts of the country and the people who should pay attention to the issue of economic matters today.
The second element, which was achieved by the summit, was thankfully an opportunity for those who were not present by government officials to report on the realities of the country, the development of the country, the movement that is being carried out and to reach the people.
Of course, I do not believe that the people of this country have always been informed about the achievements of this event. Everybody knows my opinion. I believe that it is necessary to announce the achievements and losses of this event in order to be vigilant.
I would tell you that I am in a relationship with the people and that they have not been informed about these advances.
By Allah's favor, the things that you said today - those things that I have written in all areas and that will be recorded in all areas - are often unprecedented.
Great achievements are being made in the country and this is a source of pride for the Iranian nation.
This is the progress of the Iranian nation.
We have made good achievements in the area of production, service, agriculture, industrial, scientific and other related areas.
These things are good things for the people to hear from different government officials and they are not governor of the country. They are happy about this.
Today, one of the best ways to fight the enemies of the Iranian nation is to kill the people and I ask them to pay attention to this point.
What is said should not be deceptive, hopeful and determined.
We have made a lot of progress, for example, we have made a lot of progress, we have made a lot of progress, we have made a lot of progress, we have made a lot of progress, we have made a lot of progress.
The first point is that we named the year 1390 the year 1390 the year of Economic Jihad.
The policy of the arrogant powers is to harm the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic's system in the economic arena.
Although they fought the issue of nuclear energy in the way of the imposition of economic sanctions, this was a mistake. The issue of nuclear energy was not the reason for such sanctions.
You can remember that when they imposed great sanctions which were the beginning of their sanctions, they did not speak about nuclear activities at that time either.
Although sanctions that are not significant, they are still known as "Amato" — a sanctions that had been imposed on a particular person in the United States Congress — but they were still known as "nuclear sanctions" at that time.
The purpose of the sanctions is to improve the economy of the country.
Fortunately, this sanction has been imposed on the Iranian nation 32 years now.
Of course sanctions have been enforced in recent years, but these sanctions have not been enforced due to the progress of different construction projects in the country. 30 years after the imposition of these sanctions, our sanctions are likely to overcome us more than the imposition that is imposed on us today and the imposition that is promised to increase.
It is necessary to identify the enemies against us, to identify the Armed Forces and to prepare the Armed Forces against them.
This necessitates economic jihad.
No movement is called jihad.
This is a characteristic of a movement called jihad.
The movement against such enmityful and enmityful efforts is one of the main requirements of jihad.
This movement is called jihad.
Therefore, economic jihad means a steady and progressive movement which has turned the Iranian nation into a different way to shed the enemy's hatred.
Another point is that we have prepared the ground for the progress of the country - which is a very important ground for national progress - for the country in terms of vital and vital areas. We have to this point.
Of course other nations do not allow us to be the first nations to move forward.
Of course we do not have the right to use the methods, and we do not have the right to use the methods.
Therefore, it requires jihad.
We should make efforts so that we can reach the first point.
No, this is because the future of nations depends on this issue.
If a country fails to the necessary measures in terms of economic matters and scientific matters and if it is able to make progress in terms of scientific matters, it will be oppressed more than any other country.
We do not want to be oppressed.
All of us have been faced with injustice for two years.
The weakness of the armed opposition and the machinations of the enemies are the reasons for this oppression.
Britain was the first to infiltrate the political system of the country since 1800s. The political system of the country was closed to other European countries during that time.
It was 1800, when the first British ambassador - who came from India - entered the country at the time when the Indian government was in charge of the British transportation system in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr, in the city of Bushehr.
All these pure-hearted, pure-hearted and pure-hearted children immediately enlightened this man. The plots of the enemies and their evil-doers began in this country. At that time, the unparalleled plots allowed the enemy to discourage and capture his minds from within.
But we do not want it to go down.
The Islamic Revolution prepared the ground for the Islamic Republic.
We want that this ramparts become stronger.
We should not let them interfer in our economy, our culture, our policies, our future and our blessed country on a daily basis.
Economy is one of the pillars of our national power.
That is why we should stand on the first place.
This does not mean that Iran should be the first country in the region.
Therefore, it is necessary to make selfless efforts and to influence the people. It is necessary to make use of all the strengths and capacities of the country.
We have heard these things, and we have seen these things in the country’s progress of the Revolution.
What happened in the river basin in our country would not be expected to happen before the Revolution.
There have been certain examples of waves in the country, but the situation is the same in different areas. The developments that are being carried out in our country have not been expected at any time. But today we see the developments being carried out in front of our eyes.
As I say, this is because of my knowledge of the different sectors of the country and our youth cannot be present in the arena unless in any part of the country.
This is a very important thing.
The economic power that we have is very important.
Once I said that compared with the status quo, our blessed country will be equal to the number of our people in the world.
As I said, the majority of the people of the country are about the per cent of the world's population. Our country is about the per cent of the world's population. Therefore, we should get the per cent of the world's population.
These are important and valuable areas.
The same is true of the coastline that is being discussed in the country, and the same is true of the coastline that is being discussed in the country, but the same is true of the coastline that is being discussed in the country through appropriate scientific projects, which have been mentioned in this meeting by some brothers.
Therefore, the country in fact has many blessings.
The same is true of the area where we live and where we live.
We have a very important point.
The same is true of the relationship between Asia and Europe. The same is true of the relationship between Asia and Europe. The same is true of the relationship between the two seasons and the close ties between the East and the West.
These are all good things for us.
As I mentioned earlier, we have lost one in four years in the 20th anniversary of the National Development Programme.
That is to say, the four-year plan was to fly out and defend the country. This year is the fifth plan.
Of course, a lot of achievements have been made over the past 10 years.
And great achievements have been made, and great achievements have not been made, and great achievements have not been made, and great achievements have not been made.
The policies that were announced in the context of the reform, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, the policies that were implemented in the country, and the policies that were implemented in the country.
If we manage to do these plans in an appropriate way, we will be able to benefit from the benefits of these plans.
These policies can create unity and promote economic valor.
Of course, in order to fail to realize some of the goals that were fixed in the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps for ten years, there are various reasons that prevent them from realizing these goals - including domestic issues and foreign issues.
The issue of reducing the unemployment rate of 8 per cent, reducing the unemployment rate of 8 per cent, reducing the investment rate of 8 per cent, and reducing the cost of production - which I mentioned that day - is totally unfinished.
And this is what requires us to make more efforts in the course of the five-year plan so that we can make up for the past generation.
According to the provisions of this law, we should pay attention to the areas of government occupation and economic affairs.
The goal is to create a competitive and competitive economy by involving entrepreneurs and investors in the arena of economy.
They calculated that the amount needed for investments over the past five years is about 160 billion dollars year-on-year.
It is necessary to implement these principles.
In the implementation of the provisions of Article 44 Act, good achievements were made, but they were not equivalent. It is necessary to make up. It is not just the issue of weakness in the economy. It is not the issue of weakness in the economy. It is also the issue of weakness in the economy.
There are always certain things that are wrong in terms of good deeds.
For many years I have spoken about the issue of fighting the ban on the economy.
When I take a look at this point, some people need to say that the same statements that you repeatedly make about the issue of economic disruption would threaten to enter the arena of economic disruption.
I would like to discuss the opposite of the opposite of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Any businessman who wants to have legal services and wants to have legal services approved by the judiciary should be vigilant if he realizes that the government does not carry out any responsibilities against the violations, which will force him to be vigilant.
We are opposed to those who invest in the government, those who create methods to do so and those who have deployed their opportunities in the wrong way. It is necessary to strengthen our financial and economic capacities, strengthening our financial and economic capacities, and it is necessary to strengthen our financial and economic capacities. Therefore, fighting economic disruption is undoubtedly an essential element.
Fortunately, all and most economic ministers and government officials in charge of economic matters are present in this meeting.
They heard the things that they used to say - that is to say, the areas that they used to speak about the good things, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to say, the areas that they used to
We should not allow what has been mentioned in this regard.
Of course, in spite of the point that Mr. Tawakkuli used to raise, why he was not present in the case of a decision-maker? Why did he not present in the case of a decision-maker when he used to raise a decision-maker that was not present in the case of a decision-maker?
I would like to discuss two or three issues that have been discussed in this regard. I would like to discuss two or three issues that have been discussed in this regard. One of them is the issue of addressing the issues of the government and the other is the issue of discussing the issues of the country.
First, the issue of supporting the production sector is the issue of supply of goods. Production is the basis of the economy of the country.
Regarding the level of production, according to the law: this 30 per cent of the production that has been specified in this regard, it is necessary to pay attention to the level of production.
Of course some of the government officials with whom we discussed believe that this 30 per cent is not necessary.
This may be the case in certain areas, but the production sector needs the support of government centers.
There are certain dimensions in which this sanction is harmful, and we should benefit from this.
Of course, the businessmen are also responsible in this regard: they also involve energy efficiency, efficiency and innovation.
Some government officials insisted that some of the manufacturers would not do anything to re-establish their old and old machinery. They would not do anything to re-establish if they had to buy the machinery.
It is necessary to pay attention to this point.
Of course the attention of the government is important in this regard as well.
There is a lot of information to be given, but there is a lot of information to be given to those people whom I mentioned earlier - that is, the evil people who used the opportunity to use it as if they did not use it for any other work.
It is necessary to stand up against this issue with all our power so that sincere and selfless corporations can manage their jobs.
The next point is related to importation. I have mentioned this point in this meeting, and I have repeatedly discussed the issue of importation with the officials.
Nobody is opposed to importing goods, but the situation of the country should be regulated.
“That is why we are not allowed to leave a market for some time – for example, the Eid al-Kubra (s.a.) – because we are not allowed to leave a market for some time.
It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production.
Of course it has been said that importation is helpful for domestic production. Unless domestic products are imported, they will not pay attention to the quality of domestic products and the prices of domestic products.
I believe that this is not a firm reason.
On the issue of import, especially on agricultural products, the issue of export is considerable and stronger than what we can see today.
We have very good products in the field of agriculture.
One of the teachers presented a report on the benefits of poultry (production) production.
Our country in this regard is one of the most advanced countries in the world.
We should increase our production.
We did not export such goods from Latin America as countries such as Iran. We did not export such goods from the countries such as Latin America and the countries such as Iran.
The next point is the issue of export.
Of course, the government is responsible to assist the exporters.
As a brother mentioned in this meeting, the goods that we produce are not growing. The goods that we produce are not growing. The goods that we produce are not growing.
“Particularly, we have reached a position where we can compensate for oil-rich income.
One of the greatest obstacles in our economy and the entire country is the dependence on oil and petroleum.
In the past few years - that is to say, in those days government officials were not responsible - we had to do something that if one day, because of political and economic concerns, we decided to stop the sale of petroleum for us as an example of fifteen days, we would have to do something that we would have to do.
Try to see what will happen in the world.
Today we cannot do so, because we need that amount of money.
Each day the economy of the country is dependent on oil and petroleum, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will be so powerful that their influence will be considerable in the world.
We should do this. But this need to be supported. It is necessary to support the issue of export.
In this regard, the exporters and their officials are responsible. The countries that have been mentioned in the report that we export most of our products to those countries, we get stories of the evil achievements of some of our exporters.
For more than fifty years, there have been factories in the world who have been selling goods to consumers and investors.
As an example, a Japan-based and Swiss factory is making and selling goods for 50-60 years, and they have still owned their goods in our country and in other countries.
Why?
These things should be considered by the exporters.
This is what a culture needs: the culture and quality of domestic production.
The issue of fighting the ban on the economy is very important.
However, as long as this corrupt man does not find a corrupt person in the government who can help him, he will not be able to betray the economy.
Therefore, government officials have a responsibility to prevent the spread of economic corruption in governmental organizations.
For example, when you realize that a disease is suffering from a rhinoceros, you will not have any kindness and mercy. You should know that if you repeat this, you will not be suffering from a few thousand infections. You should know that this is the case.
The same is true of economic corruption.
If you witnessed a corrupt economic sign in some part of the government, you should not make a mistake.
Tackling economic disruption is one of the most dangerous and progressive diseases in the country. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point carefully.
One of the things that should be done is to prepare the ground for unity of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps and the framework for unity of the Islamic Revolution.
We need striking policies in the area of solidarity.
As Mr. Qara'ati said, the best way to this goal is to this goal, and the best way to this goal is to this goal - that is to say, the best way to this goal is to this goal.
One important point is that we should pay attention to the importance of present-day investments to private sectors.
That is to say, the businessmen should understand where there is an opportunity for investments. Everybody should have an experience, not just those who will benefit from this.
Those who have the story can use it inappropriate manner.
Details should be for everybody.
Of course many things have been done in the past governments, and many other things have not been done in the same way.
It is necessary to make intensified efforts in this regard.
It's a lot of things that I have written down, but it's already time for Eid al-Adha and I will hold up all of them.
By Allah's favor, this season will be an event which will make the people who are close to the country, this nation, the Islamic Republic and the future of this nation make selfless efforts and make efforts, making efforts, making efforts, making efforts, making efforts, making efforts, making efforts, making efforts, and making efforts.
Last year’s slogan of “Intensified Effort and Labor” should be followed up with the issue of economic strength.
We hope everybody will make efforts.
The future of our country is bright. The power of our country is vast.
Thankfully, there are good hearts, faith, determination and power in this country.
The country has a lot of capacities to be named as the second largest country in the world.
Thro our history, our cultural heritage, the power of the people and our national blessings are all these things that I want to mention on this issue.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with thousands of people in the shrine of Imam Ridha (a.s.) in Mashhad.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Al-Mustafa Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me the opportunity to spend the first days of this year on the occasion of Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake and may God bestow peace on him).
I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here and in this great assembly on the occasion of Norouz and the arrival of the New Year - both the dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here and in different places.
This meeting is indeed an example of the Iranian nation. On that day, our honorable people from various cities have all gathered in the hub of Abul-Hasan al-Ridha and they have received the blessings of that meeting.
There are also brothers and sisters from the city of Mashhad.
I extend my congratulations to everybody and everybody.
Norouz of Iran for all of us Iranians and Muslims from other countries who appreciate this Eid are an opportunity to appreciate and benefit from it in terms of religion and Islamic movement.
The Islamic view is that we should make use of all the opportunities and conditions of our life to human perfection in order to material and spiritual progress. We Iranian people can make use of this opportunity and this opportunity in order to implement the principles and values of Islam.
We should know about great Islamic goals.
During these days, it is an opportunity to serve as a sacrifice to society, to listen to Allah the Exalted, to listen to good statements and to listen to them in different religious places.
The truth is that during these years, especially when there was an Islamic government in Iran, our people used the Norouz Eid al-Kubra (s.a.) to follow the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
This shows that when you take a careful look at the beginning of the New Year, you will see that the majority of the people gathered in shrines of worshiping, ibing, shrines, and mosques in shrines of prayers and prayers for God.
This means that the Iranian nation is trying to benefit from the symbols and ceremonies in a religious manner.
We should learn this example in all cases. And we should use Norouz and it should improve our knowledge, spirituality, religion, establishment of Islamic laws, and morality.
I hope that Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of us and the Iranian nation.
Today, when there is an opportunity which has been created by Allah the Exalted, I will discuss three issues.
The first point is about the events that were taking place in the year 1389 and the second point is about the events that were taking place in the year 1389 and the second point is about the events that were taking place in the year 1389 and the second point is about the events that were taking place in the year 1389 with the name of "The Year of Economic Jihad" and "The Year of Economic Jihad".
The third point is related to the events that are taking place in the region: the events of the Middle East, the events of North Africa and the events of the Islamic region. Considering the efforts of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah to curtail the events that are taking place in the region.
On the basis of the first point, I think the name for the year 1389 - that is, the Year of Intensified Effort and Labor - has been mentioned in this regard throughout the year, and our people have revealed their efforts and efforts in different areas.
Of course the results of this great effort and this hardworking effort are unprecedented in the future. But according to the first analysis of the year 1389, the measures that the officials of the country adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people adopted, the measures that the people
This can be seen in many arenas.
Let us start with the issue of knowledge and technology.
In the beginning of the year 1389, I was able to visit one of the greatest industries in the country on Eid al-Adha. And at the end of Esfand I was able to visit the festival for many scientific and creative works as a result of this one-year job.
The scientific and technological advances that have been made today in our country are far more than they have been announced to the people.
Since many years ago until today, this great scientific movement has started in different areas, and this movement has been accelerated on a daily basis.
One day, when I was reading a letter written by a Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), I used to say, "Education is a power", that is to say, knowledge is a power for a society and for a particular person.
Science and technology have these characteristics.
Today the movement of our country in the area of knowledge and technology in most areas, especially in new areas, is clear.
In different areas - in the area of climate science, in the area of innovative knowledge, in the area of Nano technology, in the area of biodiversity, in the area of production areas, in the area of self-production, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas, in the area of production areas,
As I said in the message of Norouz the night, various research centers throughout the world showed that in this regard, your country is ahead of the majority of the countries of the world and that the country has made progress in different parts of the world.
There are two to three key points that I deem it necessary to clarify for the issue of scientific progress and technology.
First, the majority of the outstanding personalities who are working on this issue are young.
It is necessary to rely on our youth in the age of 30-50 years and it is necessary to benefit from the benefits of these youth. Of course, there are certain faithful intellectuals who are working on this issue.
The next point is that the people who are committed to these great achievements are self-confident, who have a powerful spirit and who are committed to it.
One essential element is the power of the people, and this is what our country enjoys.
Our youth are firmly working on this issue and they believe that all the things that are the main pillar of the country's progress are they can do.
The last point on the issue of scientific progress is that knowledge-based process, technology-based process, knowledge-based process, and knowledge-based process - which is very important - are being built on a daily basis.
That is to say, knowledge is produced, and it is transferred to technology, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced, knowledge is produced and knowledge is produced.
It directed the path of production of knowledge to the glory of the country and to the satisfaction of the people.
The honorable people should know that all economic outstanding personalities - whether economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities or economic outstanding personalities.
Participating in this arena is a very difficult task and the methods for it have not been prepared for it.
Thankfully, this task has already started.
And in fact the unity that is created between the government and the people is a good unity.
The movement of the people in this regard is a very good movement. The effect of the movement will be clearly noticed, although the effect has been clearly noticed right now.
The important goal of this goal is, in the first case, to separate the role that the government plays among the people in a fair way.
It is a great step toward social justice.
Another goal is to manage the goods of the country, including water and energy.
Two years ago, I named this year "The Year of Intensified Effort and Beneficence with National Beneficence"; stormy, economy and avoidance of agriculture.
This is one of the most effective and practical ways to improve the quality of our country. The result has already been witnessed.
During the past few months, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning, this planning,
The widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread wealth.
By Allah's favor, this is one of the advantages that have been made in the future. The same is true of the economic situation.
Furthermore, one of the things that is indicative of increasing energy efficiency in the arena of economy is the increase in oil-free exports.
Unfortunately, our economy has been relying on oil for many years.
And this path has been used in our own country. Petroleum is used in my own country, and this path is wrong. Petroleum is used in my own country, and this path is wrong.
For many years I have said that one of the things that I want to do is to manage the country in the absence of oil sales.
Of course, this is not a difficult task, but a hardworking task.
“That’s how much oil-free products are sold and what will push us closer to our goal.
Great achievements were made in this regard in the year 1389.
Similarly, one of the things that guarantees firm determination and hard work in the economic arena is the wise management of western sanctions under the leadership of the United States and the follow-up of certain European governments to Iran.
Since the beginning of the year 1389, they have increased their sanctions against Iran.
They use themselves in their calculations - which are a source of awareness for us - to say that within five to six months, the sanctions would end up for the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
They thought that through these sanctions they would have made the same thing for the Iranian nation and they would have made the same thing for the Iranian nation in order to express their opposition to the Islamic Republic. This was their goal.
It was done an intelligent and enlightened work to oppose this sanction in order to derail the enemy's willpower.
The enemies were unable to their goal through these sanctions.
Today westerners themselves say that imposing sanctions on Iran is not helpful.
One of the problems that has been with our labor for a long time is this: we are a country that exports oil, but we are also importing oil from the outside.
Therefore, they say that this is the weakness of the Islamic Republic and that we must not let it go unnoticed.
Our officials made efforts due to these sanctions. They made efforts, and we did not even need oil.
This was what I heard from the dear youth during my visit to the festival that took place at the end of Esfand.
They told me that we wanted to remove this issue. They told us that you were under sanctions and they would not give us it. Then we realized that we should prepare ourselves for this issue.
Then we returned home, thought, made efforts and made efforts without relying on foreigners.
The government’s report said that the year 1389 had been production of about one million and six thousand laborers. If this report was that, it would have been production of about five thousand laborers more than the previous report.
Good achievements have been made in the area of agriculture, urban construction, construction, urbanization, and modernization. Good achievements have been made in the area of agriculture, agriculture and agriculture. Good achievements have been made in the area of agriculture, agriculture and agriculture.
This is true of economic matters.
In many other areas, there have been great achievements that have been made and we will exceed them only when we have good achievements.
Of course, what shows us the year 1389 is that thankfully this year, in the full sense of the word, is the year of labor and labor.
Of course, the year 1389 does not have any characteristics. This year as well, the year 1388 is the year of labor and labor.
By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation and all government officials should pay attention to their efforts in order to reach the right destination.
But from the perspective of intellectuals, the issue of the economy is more important at this point.
If our dear country achieves an achievement in the arena of economic valor, this great movement will be in line with what will be carried out in the future and it will undoubtedly affect the country and the progress of the Iranian nation.
On this issue, what is important is to national progress in the framework of the five-year plan for national progress. That is to say, the eight-year plan for national progress is expected.
A great business will depend on how much power we have in order to use our power inside the country appropriately.
Two years ago, in this new year's address, I referred to the issue of bullying and the problems that lie in the way of the blessed use of the country.
The people should pay attention to these points.
I ask our government officials to inform the people about the necessity of strengthening the economy and improving the economy. They should show their importance in increasing the economy of the country and in reducing the gap between the people.
This gap is not what we want. Islam does not accept it.
They should pay attention to this point in order to the goal which has been planned for the five-year plan of development of the country.
Reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the unemployment rate in the country are among the most important and essential things.
Furthermore, they are among the most important and essential things that can be done in this regard. They are among the most important things that can be done in this regard. They are among the most important things that can be done in the arena of economic matters.
It is necessary to create a legislative framework.
This means that we should support development.
Today the flood, which we have in our country are largely utilized in the area of agriculture, is largely utilized in the area of agriculture.
You should consider what will happen if, by Allah's favor, the government manages to fix the road without water and if ten percent of the population are reduced to 10 percent.
In addition to the sector of agriculture, we also do ten times more than the other sectors - including the domestic sector, the industrial sector and the other sectors that need water - than the other sectors that we only use in these areas.
The widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread widespread.
The importance of the people in terms of economic matters is necessary.
If we had decided to carry out this great economic movement in the country in the year 1390, there are a few things that should be done and it is necessary to do so.
I will present a list of the requirements.
First of all, the spirit of jihad is necessary.
Since the victory of the Revolution up until today, our nation has made progress everywhere in the arena of jihad and jihad. We have seen this during the Sacred Defense Era, we have seen this in the arena of jihad and we have seen this in the arena of knowledge.
That is to say, if we had the spirit of jihad in different areas, if we had the spirit of jihad in different areas, if we had the spirit of jihad in different areas, if we had the spirit of jihad in different areas, our movement would undoubtedly continue.
The second point is to strengthen the spirituality, faith and spirituality of the people.
Everybody should know this. The establishment of a religious spirit in the country and in the youth will help all of the people to deal with the issues of the world.
It is wrong to think that the influence of spirituality on the hearts of our youth would only appear during the Sacred Defense Era or during the Friday night during Dua Kumail.
If the youth of a nation are religious, they will avoid fascism. They will avoid wrath. They will avoid the moral and practical characteristics of the youth.
The same is true of the economic arena.
The power of religious guests is a very prominent factor.
You should consider that in our country, the main issue is often the issue that everybody should pay attention to. Everybody should pay attention to this issue.
It would be like a international flight with people who would like to go to a particular area. I just say a little bit of it says it is busy with the air in the middle of the sea, let him go, and sometimes it is forbidden to go.
Therefore, after the stage should not be entered into the arena.
Another requirement is to preserve unity and national awareness.
There is unity among the people and the people and government officials. There is unity among the people and there is unity among them. There is unity among the people and there should be unity and strengthening it on a daily basis.
One of the greatest machinations of the enemies of the Iranian nation is to create internal disputes. They focus on ethnic, ethnic, political and partisan issues and many other issues.
Fortunately, our nation is awakened.
All those who love their country and are interested in religious democracy which is a source of pride for the Iranian nation. They should become familiar with each other.
The officials of the country should do the same. They should do something to ensure that there is discord among themselves, and that their complaint may always be real. They should not make it known to the people because it will harm international unity.
I would like to extend my heart to the officials in charge of this issue.
The issue of the world is more important than the issue of dialogues. These issues are no matter.
I would like to remind you of this issue. I would like to remind you of the issue of this issue. I would like to remind you of the issue of this issue. I would like to remind you of the issue of this issue.
This is no use.
Sometimes even for too many money, what is necessary in this regard?
For the people and government officials, what I want is to listen to this slogan, accept it and try to make it clear.
There is no need for great work to be done.
Even if we pay attention to the issue of the economy that I mentioned earlier, this does not mean that the other areas should be ignored.
In other areas as well, especially in the arena of knowledge and technology, it is necessary to encourage and encourage our youth in order to be able to make great achievements.
The recent events - that is to say, the issues of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Bahrain - are very important.
There are great changes in the Islamic and Arab region. This is the manifestation of Islamic Awakening.
There are two characteristics that exist in the Islamic Republic: one is the issue of popular presence and the other is religious commitment.
These are two essential things.
The presence of the people on the scene is the same as it did during the Islamic Revolution.
Congregations, parties and those that sit on the table and in big houses and local commentators are not able to do anything.
Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) managed to put the people on the scene.
The same is true of the events that are happening in the Arab countries.
In Egypt and Tunisia, the people used to enter the arena with themselves. Otherwise the intellectuals and residents of the larger houses used to speak with themselves on a daily basis. They used to call the people to them on a daily basis.
It is the people who entered the arena and their beliefs and goals were religious.
People who entered the arena entered the arena with religious principles such as Friday prayer, parliamentary prayers, in the name of God, religious scholars, outstanding religious scholars and outstanding religious scholars.
This is the characteristic of this issue.
Why did they think?
In Egypt, Tunisia and as well as other countries, these plots and oppressive governments harass the people and their identity.
As an example, Egyptian people see that their leaders are doing the right thing to address the needs of the Zionist regime.
If Hosni Mubarak had not contributed to the Zionist regime in the clashes against Gaza, the Zionists would not be able to harm the people of Gaza.
However, Hosni Mubarak went to the arena, helped, closed the way and left Egypt.
When he finds the story that the people of Gaza are walking under the ground, in a wheelbarrow and in order to prevent them from doing this, he built a 30 meters-long wall and entered the ground to close the way.
This was what Hosni Mubarak did.
The similar effects can be found in other countries as well.
For example, in Libya, despite the fact that Gaddafi had demonstrated the resistance and enmity of the west during the early years of his administration, he has rendered a lot of services to the west during the recent years.
The [Liberian people] and their eyes saw that from a threat to him, he picked up all his nuclear equipment, placed them in a boat, attended to the west and said, go with them!
You should consider the position of our nation.
But not only have our government officials not just made efforts to retreat to the battlefields, but it is also necessary to multiply the plans each year, in contrast with what the enemy wants.
This kind of insult has been witnessed in all those countries and people who have experienced it.
This is what is important for us.
After these events take place, they do not understand the issue, they do not know the people and they do not take action against one another.
Of course what has been seen so far from the US and other countries is the support of the heads of the dictators. They have been defending Hosni Mubarak as much as they can, but when they found out that they are not able to do so, they have rejected the pretext.
This is itself a lesson for the heads of America’s self-confidence to understand that when their advantage is gone and they have no use whatsoever, they will be showering them like an inexhaustible pen. They will not be annoyed for it.
What happened to the west and to America itself was totally unacceptable.
Egypt is one of the main policies of the East and East America. It is based on these policies.
But they did not manage to retain this foundation in order to benefit from it.
If human beings stay vigilant, they will be able to mislead their plots and destroy their plot.
Since they lost Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, the Americans tried to protect their own government.
By Allah's grace, and with His power, the United States will continue to suffer defeat in the region.
After losing their people in these countries, they introduced two things that they wanted to: the first is waiting and the second is trying to cause obstacles in other parts of the country.
They were defeated in this regard.
The second point is comparatively. What comparatively means is to create similar events in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya in some other countries.
The main reason why they do this is to defend the rights of the people.
The dear people of America should not realize that they are their supporters. They claim that they are opposed to the dictators and that they support the rights of nations.
Not only have they been kind to other nations, but their nations are not kind to them.
The president of the United States of America himself used to spend billions of dollars in order to de-escalate the economic situation of the United States. He used to de-escalate the armed industry and de-escalate other industries.
Therefore, they have not given up to their people. Therefore, they have not given up to their people. Therefore, they have not given up to their people.
Today the Americans are faced with serious economic problems and they do not have any solution.
In addition to prisons and torture, such as Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, Iraq and other places where people are being tortured and tortured in different places.
People do not recognize these things.
Did the US President know what he was saying then?
Were he really aware of the people who are behind the arena and they distort his politics or does he not understand and ignore it?
He said that the people who are working for Azadi ('independence') in Tehran are the people who are working for Egypt's independence.
He was right because on the 22th of Bahman each year, the people who flattered on the day of independence were shouting the slogan "God cried America".
Regarding the events that happen in the region, the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran is clear.
Our responsibility is supporting nations and their rights.
This is the position of the Islamic Republic: this is the position of the Islamic Republic.
Our policies are these: our hearts, wisdom and things that we speak about - whether by the people or by the officials of the country.
There are two things to pay attention here: one is Libya and the other is Bahrain.
As for Libya, we are opposed to the behavior of the Libyan government towards the people and its brutal killings and bombardments against the cities and civilians. But we are opposed to the influx of the Americans, the West Bank and other Western countries.
They claim that we have entered Libya to protect the people and do not want to carry out military attacks.
If they had supported the Libyan people in the real sense of the word and if their hearts had been shed down by the Libyan people, they would have been bombarding the Libyan people in the present time.
If you want to help them, you should give them an army, you should give them any resources, you should give them an airplane crew.
Therefore, you do not want to protect the people. You do not want to buy oil from Libya, but you do not want to establish your position in Libya.
If you want to find a space to stand up and use it to criticize the revolutionary governments that will be formed in the future in Egypt and Tunisia, you should go away.
It’s a bad intention.
The United Nations, which should be a servant of nations, must, unfortunately, be a source of weapons in the hands of these people.
This is a disgrace for the World Congress.
Therefore, the presence of foreigners and westerners cannot be accepted.
If you want to help the Libyan people, the way to help these people is clear. You can help the people, strengthen them, and the people of the country can resolve the issue of Gaddafi themselves.
Their main need is to hold elections, and every person has one vote. Is this a great need?
This is a great hope. When the elections are held in Bahrain, the people have not the right to vote in the general sense of the word and they have not the right to vote in the general sense of the word.
The west would take this opportunity to interfere in the affairs of the region and introduce a new issue - the issue of Shia and Sunni.
Because the Bahraini people are good Shia and there is no right to support them.
The broadcasters who were recording the events that happen in the region were silent on the issue of Bahrain and they did not announce the events that are happening in Bahrain.
There were some people from the Persian Gulf - whether political or journalists - who used to speak about it and say that the issue of Bahrain is the issue of Shia and Sunni.
Depression is a nation and a female oppression. Like what happened in Tunisia, like what happened in Egypt, like what happened in Libya, like what happened in Yemen is not different.
The Americans were happy that they managed to claim this issue as a discord between Shia and Sunni through their media and propaganda tools.
They said that the Iranian people are supporting the Bahraini people for a reason.
And we have supported all of them.
For 32 years we have supported the Palestinian people.
Are the Palestinians Shia?
Our youth went to the airport so they could not travel to Gaza!
They are ready to go to Gaza and fight against Israel.
We said they should not go.
Our people expressed their support to the people of Gaza, Palestine, Egypt and Tunisia. They are not Shia.
Therefore, it is not the issue of Shia or Sunni.
Demonstrators are trying to present the issue of Bahrain as a Shia-Sunni issue.
Unfortunately, some people who are unlikely to have malevolent goals have deceived their own tricks.
If there is good hope in this regard, I would tell them that the issue is not Shia and Sunni. This is a great service to the Americans. This is a great service to the enemies of the Iranian nation who describe the movement for independence of a nation as a Sunni and Shia conflict. There is no conflict between Shia and Sunni.
We are not different from Gaza, Palestine, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen.
If any social movement is like Islam, and if we seek independence, we will support it.
The great message of the United States is that Saudi-Arabia and Bahrain are not interfering in the military activities of the country. But when our maraaje, our scholars, and our mercenaries say you do not kill people, they say you are interfering.
Is this interference in the affairs of a country?
It is a government, a oppressive government that we have acted against killing your people, but the introduction of foreign tanks on the streets of Bahrain does not stop internal operations. This is America's great voice and its mercenaries in the region who promote and promote it.
The Americans are far away thousands of kilometres from the region.
Anybody who does this makes a mistake.
By Allah's favor, a new movement has started in the region.
As Allah has promised, this movement will definitely victory.
The Iranian nation is powerful. It is proud that the Iranian nation has started this movement.
The youth who have come today do not see the Revolution. But if they are not more young than the youth of that period, they will not fail to do so.
Dear God, bestow Your mercy and grace on this dear nation.
On the Day of Judgment, bestow Your blessings on this nation, on this movement, on Islam and on Muslims.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, bestow the souls of our martyrs and our magnanimous Imam on us.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 7, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a group of high-ranking officials in Tehran.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one remaining with Allah on earth.
Dear brothers and sisters, welcome to the honorable and competent government officials of the country. I hope that Allah the Exalted will bestow such a blessing on all of you.
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us a year to organize and organize this pleasant meeting and speak out about the most important issues of the country.
I would like to divide my statements into three categories. The first aspect is the memory of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the second aspect is related to the issues of the country and the first aspect is related to me.
The final point is that we should take a look at the issues of our neighborhoods and the issues of the region if there is enough time.
In his book ‘Al-Murakabat,’ the hajj pilgrim Mirza Javad Agha Maliki Tabrizi said that determination is a divine gift which Allah the Exalted has bestowed on his servants and believers.
His Eminence said, "I need to be thankful for this reason." His Eminence said, "I need to be thankful for this reason. It is necessary to be thankful for this reason."
One of these things is that, as Mr. Qara'ati has pointed out, one of the characteristics that is more important than any other characteristics, is that this hunger and sword create a brightness in the heart of a person, and this prepares the ground for thought that "one hour thought is more than one year for worshiping".
This thought is part of a type of thought that is based on the minds and souls of a person who reveals the truth to him and reopen the path of wisdom. We should make use of this thought.
Jihad is the main capital of everybody.
All blessings are achieved through this life - which is the period of day - and this is an achievement that can bring about happiness for human beings in the end of life.
So, let us think about this life and how many years have passed.
We should remember how seasons of our life and days and days go.
We took a look at the way life goes: ‘the soul is like a bull which is covered with warmth of the day.’
This spring is slowly going on, and this spring is about everything to us and it is about everything to us in order to spiritual blessings.
How do we use it and how do we use it?
It is one time for each one of us to think of death, to go out of the world and to get the soul of a person out of the body and to speak with the angels of death. "Every life is about death."
Will our condition be at that time? Will our hearts be at that time? These are what we should think about.
This prayer is one of the pillars of thought.
The prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household are amazing. The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household are quoted as saying: "The prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household are not part of the prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Therefore, these prayers are very important.
It is a sacrifice to those who have heard it and it is a reminder to those who have not heard it: it is the eight-year prayer in the book of Sahfat al-Sajjahia, a prayer known as Makarim al-Akhlak.
In the beginning of this prayer, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "Allah, bestow peace on Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household.
What do you mean that I am respected with the servants and those who fear God?
Dear God, associate me with the people who are afraid of God in a number of things: my beginning is to establish justice. We can justice in society, justice in the judiciary, justice in the sense of the divide of the people from the people, justice in the sense of the divide of the opportunity to work and benefit from the people.
Fear of God that is expected from us is one of the pillars of fearing God.
Sometimes, one becomes a committed person (whoever does not have a public responsibility in the face of it), the fate that you make is related to a religious brother, a family member or a member of your staff. The fate is very good. The fate is related to the fate of a member of the staff. The fate is related to the fate of a member of the staff. It is related to the fate of a member of the staff. It is related to the fate of a member of the staff.
When you talk to a particular person or group, the effect of this anger on a particular person that does not have any responsibility whatsoever is not the same.
Therefore, we should not fight against it and we should not fight against it.
Dear God, bestow His signs on us.
Defeating the fire of enmity.
Everybody should make efforts in order to downsize this fire.
This is the reason why we are constantly insisting on our brothers and sisters, our government officials, those who speak out very well, those who promote their speeches in the country and those who promote their speeches in a certain part of the country.
Sometimes it is not the case that an expression is not the case that it is exerting power.
Those who are treading the right path should try to reach the right spot. We should not allow our work, our behavior and our words to be humble people who are treading the right path and prevent them from believing in this path.
We should not separate those who are closely connected to the Islamic system.
If there is discord among us, we try to divert them from one another.
When a university makes a good job, try to explain it.
We have spoken a lot about this issue.
This is part of this prayer. It is about twenty two to three things, but I usually speak about six of these things.
We should pray to God to bestow faith on us.
These are the dimensions of fear of God.
This is the first point that I would like to discuss on.
The second point is one of the general analyses of the situation of the country.
There are certain important points in the report, and I assure you that these details will reach the audience and everyone knows how hard they are making and how hard they are rendered.
I would like to explain what a part of the country is doing and this is very important for us.
Why is it important?
First of all, knowing the situation of our country and where we are and where we are, is very important and always important. But today it is very important. You can say, because of the conditions of the world, which are very important and very important.
First of all, the conditions of the region are unparalleled.
The fact that Islamic Awakening and the great events that are taking place in this region have been unprecedented since the beginning of the Revolution.
When a nation like Egypt has carried out such a great movement, which is opposed to the government, and which is based on Islamic principles, it is threatening the Zionist regime with the status of the region. These are all the things that I do not know about.
And we find ourselves in such a situation. This situation prepares an astonishing situation for the Islamic Republic.
The economic situation of the arrogant western governments is a very great situation. The economic situation of the western governments is a very great situation.
The westerners’ analysis of the economic situation of America and certain western countries and their concerns about their future are part of this issue. They are not all saying anything.
The intellectual and policy-makers of the world - which are often controlled by media in major parts of the world - do not want the people of the world to understand the truth about these issues because the dimensions of these issues are far more than they are.
By Allah's favor, if I have enough time to discuss this issue at the end of my statements, I will try this issue clearly.
Another point is the continuation of transgression and terrorism in western countries, especially in Europe; from new Nazis and from uprisings and mercenaries of the U.S. That is to say, they are the prepared people for the US government to do what they have done in the past.
Later on, he attacked two Muslim countries.
There are certain things that they are willing to do, but Allah the Exalted has not given them the opportunity to fail.
These are important points.
What happened in Norway should not just be considered a disastrous event.
And we should look at these characteristics and see at what level we are.
If we fail to take advantage of this opportunity in an appropriate way, and if we fail to take advantage of this opportunity in an appropriate way, we will be deceived.
Sometimes ignoring an opportunity becomes a threat and it becomes a backwardness.
Therefore, we should not pay attention to the issues of the country in this regard.
All of us should be vigilant. We should not make any mistakes nor be hesitant. We have good things, and we have bad things. We should look to the truth.
The same is true of media and other such things.
As long as one says why you are talking about this, they will tell you not to allow us to speak the truth about it.
No, we want to speak the truth. No, we want to undermine this.
I pay attention to about 10 to 20 newspapers every day.
Each day, some of these newspapers have newspapers, which every one of them attract the hearts of a weak person.
We did not blame on others, but it was a fact, a mistake.
The taste of this is the same.
It is necessary to pay attention to the weakness of the weaponry by paying attention to the quality of the weaponry.
It is necessary to identify the measures adopted by the government as well as the measures adopted by the government.
Therefore, if we want to identify the realities of the country, we need to pay attention to our weakness and power.
I would like to raise an accurate point about this issue today, but there are certain things that need to be done in this regard.
These good things will show us a position and a position we have in our country.
And these weaknesses show us what we should do, and what should be done.
When we bring these things together, it becomes a source of awareness for us. We understand what should be done.
I have written in my book five verses which have been continued throughout the history of Islamic Republic over the past 32 years, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour, every hour and every hour.
The first point that is based on the capacity of the Islamic system is to overcome the threats that have been imposed on the Islamic system. This is very important.
Over the past 32 years, we have experienced various kinds of threats - political threats, security threats, and economic threats - and the purpose of these threats is to harm this government.
Of course they wanted to strengthen the government, but this was not a bad thing for them. They wanted to halt the foreign policy and put the country behind.
And this system can overcome all these threats.
Some of these things are directly regulated by foreigners, just like the issue of sanctions.
In the country, sanctions have been imposed for many years, but in the recent years, they have increased their vigilance and insult, saying that these sanctions are fragile.
These sanctions have at times been imposed on us through the United Nations - which can be imposed on their hands - and other such sanctions have already been imposed on us.
These things are related to foreigners and they are directly at the service of foreigners.
There are other threats which are opposed to domestic events. Although the enemies have used these threats as an example for the tribe of the country, the Islamic Republic has been able to overcome all these things. Today different tribes of the country live together.
This, in my opinion, is one of the most powerful areas for us.
We should pay attention to this point when calculating the capacities of the Islamic Republic.
This government was isolated from itself, without the support of international powers and with the support of material powers which had suffered various threats over the past 32 years, but that government was able to overcome all those threats. This is a very important point.
This, in my opinion, is the first aspect of the system.
Second is the solidarity between the people and the government.
