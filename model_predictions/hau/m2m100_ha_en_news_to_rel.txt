18.
How can Allah the Exalted help a Christian brother?

In particular, the 33th of Farvardin's Day is an auspicious birthday anniversary.
People are making fantasies.
This is the kind of worship that has been raised and taught.
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household was born in Tehran and his household.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 15-20] Thus, when the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household was born, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household was born in the hereafter.
The Pharaoh faces this unity every week.
This event is due to an important event that happened in Fentakos the year 33.
This happened to the 120-year Imam of Jesus who was worshiping in a hotel in Urushalem.
(1: 13-15) A year before that time, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household announced this.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 28-22] What was so important?
3 Corresponding to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
God bestowed the immaculate souls of the 33-year Armenians in Fentakos.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Mosalla, Ayah 8] Therefore, the people came to their knees and discussed the issues that were not related to the Holy Quran.

He said to those who have come together: â€œBe for each one of you infallible in the name of Jesus Christ to the shrine of your souls. â€œBe for the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) soulâ€.

How do we know that the situation of Armenian Christians is different from that of us?
The men who have gathered in this meeting will not remember what happened on the Day of Judgment.
It was like an insult to each other.
God did not allow them to do something.
In fact, this shows that they have been inspired by a holy spirit.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 6-12] But the Armenian nation did not give rise to this holy Quran with their immaculate soul.
For example, the Holy Book is not like a shout on thousands of people who were baptised and delivered to Urushalem on the Day of Judgment.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 38] This is while the Armenian people were not chastened.
The same is true of the self-sacrifice of the Samaria that was imposed on them later on.
[The Holy Quran, 8: 14-17] Karnelius and his household had been thrown into the battlefields in order to be infused by the Holy Quran.
6
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, were among the people whose household and their families?
6 Armenians believe that Allah the Exalted has different from them to a great extent.
Some people used to pretend that God had brought them to the battlefields.
But all of them understood this from a distance.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used to distort what the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used to say, "You are not honest with the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (1: 13), Ayah 14] Therefore, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used to make the Armenians feel stronger than they did.
The immaculate soul is the soul that shows that in the future they will live a better life than in the world. [The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran,
Everybody in charge of Armenian activities does not allow him to be sacrificed for his sake.
7
What should every noble Christian do in order to be rewarded?
7 Is it possible to raise an Armenianship which means that they will be rewarded?
A.
In fact, it is clear that Allah the Exalted will reward him even more.
However, it will only succeed if it has a security for Jehova.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "By Allah's grace, brothers and sisters, you should not let this city pass over your. You should not let this city pass over your. You should not let this city pass over your, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just as you want, just
It is clear that Allah the Exalted will reward him even more, but He will not be rewarded even more. [The Holy Quran, 3: 1].
What is it that we should do?
8, 9. (a) Why do not the majority of the people realize what is happening in the face of a holy soul? (b) How can one realize that Allah the Exalted will reward him even more?
Today the youth of Jehovah will not realize what is happening, and they will not be able to realize what is happening with their holy soul.
This does not mean that we should invite them to a holy soul.
Allah the Exalted has created Adam to live in this world for everybody.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fitr, Ayah 28: 37: 29] Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday
Therefore, the blessedness that Allah the Exalted has bestowed on them will prevent them from living in a better way than their thoughts. [The Holy Quran, 1: 18]
9 But how can one know that they are weaker than they did?
Dear God, pay attention to what the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) brothers and sisters.
He said, â€œAgainst you do not take care of the divine souls, but you do not take care of the divine souls, where we call you Abba and Uba.
We are divine servants, and the soul whose soul is sacrificed for us will be sacrificed for us.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 7] Allah the Exalted is making use of a pure soul to show that he or she should be accompanied by Jesus. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 12]
10.
The Holy Quran, 2: 27 says, "Who did Armenians not need to be teached?"
10 And Allah the Exalted will reward them more than anybody else who needs them.
It would be hard to realize that they were chastened.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said to the Christians: "The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) asked you, but you know the truth."
He reiterated: "You dear youth have not been learnt by anybody in your heart by the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) spirit.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (2, 20, 27)] The truth is not the kind of truth which has been teached upon you.
But they do not need anybody to prove that they have been inspired.
He used to use his ikon, a pure soul, and he used to refer to them. He used to say that they were sophistry.
What should they do?
11, 12
What kind of Christianity can be thought of, but what kind of security is it based on?
Sa’ad that was chosen to occupy Armenian territories and a holy soul is so strong that its dimensions are deeper.
Jesus said, “On the basis of these things, they have been created.”
[The Holy Quran, 3 : 5] Do not insult for the sake of me.
You should know where to go. You should know where to go. You should know where to go. You should know where to go. You should know where to go. You should know where to go.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Yazdi, Ayah 7: 8] In fact, it is not possible to reveal its identity to anybody who is not confined to it with a pure soul.
When he is spiteful of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) prayers, he suddenly realizes that the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will be spiteful of his prayers.
12 And if Allah the Exalted gives him a holy soul, he will be able to think of this: "Why should God ask God not to send another servant to him?"
He used to say that he did not manage to such a position.
Of course, God will see him, and He will not be doubled.
He was happy and thankful for this opportunity.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "By Allah, the Lord of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who bestowed the blessed presence of Jesus Christ on his daily basis, from the age of four to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four, to the age of four."
13
Why should somebody sleep in a safe and enlightened soul and how should somebody change his soul?
13 Before the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used to say that the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household lived a lifetime for everybody.
They managed to do something that would bring the world to their knees.
Later on, they thought that they would break their brothers and sisters out of communities.
Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to whether we want to construct or construct our homes.
Isaiah 65: 21-23) Why did they renounce their children?
Did they do this due to feelings or disagreements?
Were they thought that there will be no happiness in the world at all?
Were they want to know how to live a better life?
A.
It is Allah the Exalted who bestows such promise on them.
Whenever he spends on his role, he spends on his role, he spends on his role, he spends on his role, he spends on his role, and he spends on his role.
14
Which kind of people play a role in the world?
14 Does this mean that she wants to be sacrificed for her?
He referred to the nature of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency of self-sufficiency.
They are happy to live a happy life with families and friends.
But in their affairs, they will not forget what Allah has promised of. 1 Corinthians 15: 53; 2 Petrus 1: 4; 1 John 3:2; 3 the soul of John 20: 6
What is a divine test?
15
How do they prove that they are not after a holy soul?
You should think 15 times more about it or more about it.
If you see that he is doing this, pay attention to these important questions: "Why do you know that you are making a lot of efforts in international arenas?"
Have you heard the lessons of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) resonant recitation and the lessons of God's deep affairs? (1 Corinthians 2: 10).
What does this mean by relying on God?
How can you help them celebrate His Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household with your heart and soul?
Have you seen some events in your life showing that God is helpful to you?
If you answer these questions, does this mean that you are superior to Jehovah?
A.
Why?
The honor belongs to the servants of God, whether they know these things or not.
That is to say, God will not allow him to have a holy soul and will not allow him to have a lot of things or not.
If you think of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), you will be honest in this regard and if you do not think of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), you will be honest in this regard.
Everybody knows that he will be killed and he knows that he will be killed and he knows that he will not be killed.
16
How do we know that those who have not been buried should not be buried more than those who have not been buried?
The Holy Quran contains many examples of divine servants.
One of them is the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Jesus said that nobody will join the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, but he said that the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will not be humiliated.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] There is a pure soul.

[The Holy Quran, 2: 34] The Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon the immaculate servants of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household did not give in to immaculate things.
Did this mean that they were not thriving and that they were not thriving?
A.
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household are the people of this world.
17, 18. (a) The number of Jehovah’s servants is increasing today. (b) What questions should we discuss in the future?
Today the dimensions of God's servants are not more than those of us.
Abraham, Daud, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, and many other men and women - who have lived in this vast world - are the hereafter and the hereafter.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] Jesus will be humiliated for more than 144,000 people.
The Holy Book revealed that in this holy era, there were "other souls" or "other souls" that were destroyed in the world.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 17] But their majority broke down, and they rose up.
18 But if somebody says that his life is long enough, how should those who have the right to live in this world take him to death?
What should you do if somebody in your family is humiliated and if he is after the death of Jesus, what should you do with him?
Why should we ask Allah the Exalted if there is an increase in the number of sacrifices made by Allah the Exalted?
We will answer those questions in the future.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 44] On the Eid al-Fentakos, when Allah the Exalted bestowed the law on Moses on Sinai.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] Therefore, as Allah the Exalted used Moses to conclude a meeting with the people of Israel in the year 1513 before the birth anniversary of Jesus, God also used Jesus to fulfill the promise of Jesus' pleasure on this day in the year 333.

[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] With the ta'weel of the Last Prophet (s.w.a.) and the Imams (peace and greetings be upon him and his imams (peace and greetings be upon him and may God be sacrificed for his sake).
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (4:1-3) The holy soul of Jehovah helps his servants to be ta'weeled and unscholarly.
(3: 12) Therefore, they could not see anybody else.
Everybody knows that Jehovah has not offered his pure-hearted spirit.
And they fail to understand the teachings of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) book.
As a result of these acts, they will not give in to anybody who has been forced to death and who has suffered an insult to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
My dear youth and my dear youth should know that divine blessings are the only way for divine blessings.
7 and 8.
Why should the Armenian people not be allowed to do so?
Of course 7 people are far more vigilant than they do, and they do not expect the people to benefit from their appreciation in this regard.
[The Holy Quran, 1: 18 and 19] The Holy Quran, 2: 2 and 3
And we know that Jehovah has not delivered anybody with a holy soul.
Therefore, the wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked wicked.
He should remember that the Holy Book allows us to fail to accept someone who says it is a particular person.
[The Holy Quran, 2:2] If the people are not happy to listen to him, he will not be able to tell the people who are beginning to listen to him to him to a holy soul.
Sometimes he does not want to speak to anybody.
[The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, and Quran.
8 Armenian pilgrims did not realize that they should stay together with other pilgrims just as they were in one way or another.
They will not allow any caravans to speak about their caravans or they will not allow them to speak about the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
[The Holy Quran, 1: 15-17] The family of our martyrs and soldiers will not be honest with us at all.
If this is the case, it will prevent the immaculate soul that helps the people of God dignity and dignity. [The Holy Quran, 16: 17, 18]
What do they do?
9
Why do you need an intelligent and enlightened game with the people who are crying and crying at the shrine of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.)?
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 76]
9 What should you do with brothers and sisters?
Jesus said to his companions, “You are brothers.”
He reiterated: "Whoever is humble will be thriving, and whoever is humble will be humble."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Mustafa, Ayah 8-12] Therefore, we cannot afford to be humble even if we are humble.
When the Holy Book says something that makes us learn from it, it does not say that we should have Adam, our Lord.
[The Holy Quran, 13: 7] One of them is, in fact, the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
But in order to make efforts in order to make decisions, they do not want to have a holy soul.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 17] If we insult the sacrifices of Imam Hussein (a.s.), they will not be rewarded.
Otherwise, we can become great.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 3]. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 17: 4] No one of us should make such a mistake at all.
Why should you ask someone who is insulted and who is shouted by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) during the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) meeting?
[The Holy Quran, 9: 11]
10.
How should we demonstrate that we are from Christianity?
10 How can we show that we are indebted to those whom Jehovah has praised the immaculate soul of his father?
We should not ask them how they are sophistry.
We do not know, and they do not know us.
(1 Salomons 4: 11; 2 Salomons 3: 11) Therefore, we should not think that their men and women are pure-hearted.
This is not a value.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 12] We should be prepared to raise the issue for the people.
For example, we should not question the issue of having a holy soul in a world in which we live eternally.
We should be sure that at the re-appearance of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will pay the price for it.
11
What should we do when we look at the people at the right time?
11 We will be deceived by the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and his household.
What?
The Holy Book says that brothers and youth can be hypocritical.
Galatians 2: 4, 5 ; 1 John 2: 19 ) But there will be no security for a particular person.
[The Holy Quran, 25: 10-22] Therefore, if we let those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, or those who have not been sacrificed, and those who have not been sacrificed, and those who have not been sacrificed
If this happens, we will have a good position in this regard. [The Holy Quran, 16: 4]
Why should we compete with safeguarding?
12, 13
Why should we not listen to a number of humble and humble people during the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) meeting?
12 The number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, the number of the humble, and the number of the humble.
On the other hand, the number of people living in our country increases.
What should we do?
A.
Let us see what we should not pay attention to.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 19] God knows whom He has called.
Therefore, there are some people who think they are shafaf, but Jehobah does not shafaf them.
For example, there are some people who are showering and showering slogans from behind.
Some of them are afraid of their thoughts and they predict that they will punish Christ even more.
In fact, we cannot identify the number of false phenomena in the world.
14
What is the meaning of the Holy Book?
Later on, the 14th of Aban represents the Sacred Defense Era, and the 13th of Aban represents the Sacred Defense Era.
The Holy Book says, "Yet the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) angels shall be chastened, and their saints will be chastened, and their saints will be chastened, and their blood will be chastened, and their blood will be chastened, and their blood will be chastened."
[The Holy Quran, 24: 31] Therefore, the Holy Quran says that the four corners of the earth will be defeated in the holy day.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 17] Therefore, there are not certain kinds of worshiping for the sake of the Imam who has been sacrificed for his sake.
15, 16
How should we know if 144,000 spectators were athletes and if they were athletes, what should we do?
15 When it is necessary to refer to Shafaff, it is necessary to be prepared.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 28: 30] Later on, when the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household had been raised for his sake, the Lord of the Worlds (God's greetings be upon him and his household) had been raised for his sake.
The Armenian Revolution's Guards Corps was the first to celebrate its birthday anniversary.
Several years later, the major portion of the people who used to pretend that they were Armenians did not learn the lessons of Christ.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) had seen a number of Armenian pilgrims during those years.
Jesus compared the honorable Armenian people with the rooms or rooms.
[The Holy Quran, 13: 24] For the past few days, the Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) household was 144,000.
Therefore, if Allah the Exalted promises that He will retreat for a particular period of time, We should know that He is doing the right thing.
Isaiah 45: 9; Daniel 4: 35; Romans 9: 11 and 16.)
We should be careful not to be like laborers who are working hard on a daily basis. [The Holy Quran, 20: 8-15] The laborers are not working hard on a daily basis.
16 And those who are in this arena do not belong to those who are in this arena.
[The Holy Quran, 24: 45] The Lord of the Worlds and the Lord of the Islamic Ummah is making use of tangible people in order to teach many people today, just as they did in the first round.
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this afternoon with the first letter written by Matta to Ru’ya ta Yohanna.
Today, the self-sacrifice of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household is limited to the right to honor the people of God.
17
What do you learn from these slogans?
17 What should we learn from these things?
God will make the majority of his people happy in the world.
But those who are deceived by Jesus will live a better life.
May God bestow His blessings on him, the Bayahuden, and the Lord of the Age.
All of them should be careful, watchful and watchful.
In this case, all of them need to do good deeds in order to be healthy in their bloodthirsty.
There is a lot of trouble in the past so that we can pray for Jehova and pray for Christ as an immaculate tree.
[The Holy Quran, 8: 56] In the Holy Quran, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will reveal the names of those who are committed to Jesus.
The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, and Quran.
[The Holy Quran, s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.a.s.)
Leader’s Message - Khamenei.ir
The Holy Prophet (God's greetings be upon him and his household) said, "They have a major portion of wealth, and their household has a lot of wealth, and their household has a lot of wealth, and their household has a lot of wealth, and their household has a lot of wealth, and their household has a lot of wealth, and their people have a lot of wealth."
In this case, if we look close to our friends, we think about how they feel before they make a message or make a message to us.
We will show that we are superior to those who are there and that they are superior to all of us.
Sometimes, certain brothers and sisters - like the eulogists and servants of Bethel, the members of the Board of Experts, the officers of Shahid al-Jobah and the supporters of the Jurisprudence - visit our Islamic seminary or our magnanimous seminary.
In fact, we want to love them with their women, and this is right.
We do not want to be like a diotourist who has not visited their civilization in order to be able to find a place for them.
[The Holy Quran, 9: 10] Even if we recite these brothers, is there a kind of action which shows that we are not reciting them?
How can this happen?
Of course, we are happy to speak to different people and we should not like their athletes.
For example, we should not spend hotons without their permission.
Should we tell them whether they should be written in our Book or in the Book of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household?
Should we ask the people why we need them?
Were we witnessed such an outstanding performance in the first round of the war?
In fact, we will not do such things if we look at our friends.
So, we will prove that we know why they used to visit us and what they were doing in our markets.
How can they help us know how to find out about our friends?
First, we should remember that God is the code that we should pay attention to.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 11] Second, we should remember that we are pleased with their brothers and sisters, but we should not be viewed as athletes.
These brothers want us to see them like our friends.
[The Holy Quran, 23: 8] Third, we remember that Jesus had said, â€œAgainst what you want, make the people like this.
[The Holy Quran, 7: 12] If we follow these values, it will reveal that we are honest with our own brothers and that we will not be humiliated.
The Importance of Traditions
Later on, they would come together with Bayahud.
Similarly, there are some panegyrists who follow the chaves and follow them. Like others, they view them as their brothers.
Your work is accompanied by Allah the Exalted.
We will cooperate with him, and we will hope you will not be underestimated by God's grace.
Valor: 75, 74
Will we go after the hajj?
Did we be happy?
How can we get close to God and the people?
Is it possible?
1.
Of course, if Adam had been sacrificed for his sake, who would be sacrificed for his sake?
JEHOBH is the Supreme Prophet (s.w.a.).
That is to say, there is a lot of knowledge and understanding.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated: "I know you should do what you want, and I do not want to prevent you from doing what you want."
[The Holy Quran, 42:2] God can do whatever he wants without the help of anybody.
But because he wants us, we need to cooperate with him in order to his goal as well.
2
What was the important responsibility of Jehovah and Jesus?
Allah the Exalted created His Lord and Jesus made other things compared to Adam.
He did not allow him to work hard on this issue.
The Holy Prophet (God's greetings be upon him and his household) said, "Everything is indeed enlightened. Everything is indeed enlightened.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Kubra, Ayah 15: 17] Jehovah had given to Him an important responsibility and He had given to Adam an important responsibility.
This is not a great achievement.
3
What did God say to Adam?
3 God willing, Adam should cooperate with them.
For example, Adam does not work for panegyrists.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 19, 20] Without a doubt, Adam was happy to do such things.
He takes care of the characteristics of his behavior and behavior but he does not know what to do.
He believed that Imam Hussein (a.s.) would not have the right to do so, but he said that Imam Hussein (a.s.) would not have the right to do so.
God did not allow Adam to do what he was doing in the world.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Farava, Ayah 27: 28] But Adam became willing to cooperate with God later on, and his children became harsher. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Farava, Ayah 17: 19: 23].
4
What does this mean if somebody works with God?
4 Later on, Allah the Exalted ordered some people to cooperate with Him.
Noah built a train for his family during the time of Righteousness.
Moses delivered the people of Israel from Egypt.
Joshua Ja - the passage of the people of Israel to the Seal of the Promise.
They built hajj in Urushalima.
Mary is the father of Jesus.
That is to say, there are many so-called security forces who have cooperated with Jihad in order to their goal.
5
What work has been done by Jehova and what work has been done and we need assistance?
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj 27]
5 Today, the Lord of the Worlds has prepared us to take care of His support.
There are a lot of things that we can do against God.
If our condition is different, we can play the role of the Imams (a.s.).
God will be able to do the same thing, and Adam will be able to do the same thing.
Later on, Jesus said, "Yet the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, will make more efforts than the Lord of the Worlds."
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "I have acted with him and I hope you should not be underestimated by Allah's grace." (2 Corinthians 6:1).
Let us take a look at the reasons why we are happy.
By Allah's favor, we will be safeguarded.
6
How can Allah the Exalted first compare His blessings with His Lord?
6 Being accompanied by God makes God happy.
Jesus Christ came to this world and said, "God has made me since his beginning."
And I advise him to do something that is in line with the principle of responsibility of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 30] When Jesus had acted as his Lord, he was happy to see that the Lord was with him.
What should we do?
There is not any room for teachers to read the Holy Book (The Holy Quran, 7).
7
Why should we be happy to engage in bishara?
7 Jesus says, "We are happy to go after good deeds, and they are happy to go after good deeds."
[The Holy Quran, 20: 35] We are pleased with divine blessings. Why are we pleased with divine blessings when we are treated with divine blessings?
Therefore, we can witness that the people are happy to find out what the Holy Book teaches and they are committed to divine blessings.
Therefore, we are happy to see that they have finished their works with enthusiasm.
Being humble is the most important and detrimental thing that we are doing so that those who are servants of God are rewarded. [The Holy Quran, 5: 20]
8
Who says that they are happy with cooperating with God?
8 I hope God will become happy to help the people know what he is doing and I know that God is happy to be sacrificed for his sake.
This makes us happy.
(1 Corinthians 15: 58)
Marco, who is living in Italy, says: "I am happy to see that I am able to go to the battlefields so that they can not forget what I have done."
His Eminence said, "By Allah's favor, His Eminence remembers us every day that He teaches us many important points, even if we consider it as important, even if we consider it as important."
Being accompanied by Allah the Exalted makes me happy.
By Allah's favor, we will be closer to all of them.
9
What is the relationship between God and Jesus?
9 The age in which we work with the dear ones, the age in which we work with the dear ones, the age in which we work with the dear ones
We should increase their knowledge.
We know what men and women have established.
Jesus worked for many years.
But their relationship with one another is so deep that nothing can be separated from one another.
Jesus said that their behavior towards humanity is clear and reiterated: "I have humanity as well."
[The Holy Quran, 10: 30] indeed, they have behaved in a friendly way and they have acted in a friendly way.
Wa’azi strengthened our level in order to make us remember the promises that Allah has bestowed on us.
10.
Why should we pray to God and the people?
10. Jesus asks the Lord of the Worlds (may God hasten his reign)
Why?
He prayed, “On the basis of which they are viewed by us, they should stay like us.”
[The Holy Quran, 17: 11] If we live in a divine way, we will realize his evil behavior.
We should learn how we can rely on God and how we should pray to God.
And Allah will close us.
(4:8 )
I advise our friends to stand up against the obstacles that lie in front of us and the things that lie in front of us.
We are working hard to resolve problems.
The brothers in Octavia said, "By Allah's favor, the movement is closer to the people."
He said that what he has done with the people about their domestic products is more than what he has done with the people.
In fact, we have behaved in a normal way.
That is to say, the behavior that our followers are doing in order to make Jehovah happy is closer to us.
11
For example, why should we enter the arena of self-sacrifice between God and God?
11 We are after God and our forefathers, but we will benefit from them in the future of the world.
Dear God, imagine what a great achievement we will make in the future.
We will learn them from religious principles and we will learn them from divine values.
We will do something to make the world prosperity.
When we are perfectioned with the blessedness of Christ, we will be extremely happy to work together.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] Those who are in hearts will get close to God.
May God bestow His blessings on us.
12
Which kind of ethics should we use?
12 We should look to God and live in the world of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.).
Our responsibility is to think like the people of the world and act like them.
That is to say, it engenders feelings in the face of the people, and it engenders feelings in the face of the people.
Our duty is to reach a certain point.
In fact, we need to take care of the influence of the Shia world.
Which kind of ethics should we use?
During our negotiations with Jihob and the Holy Book, we have focused our attention on important and critical issues.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fitr, Ayah 8] The Iranian nation intensifies its patience in order to make us remember what Allah the Exalted has promised.
Therefore, it helps us to behave in a behavior that helps us to distance ourselves from the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and his world.
When we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other people and when we take care of other
13
Should a Masahid in Osteria do something that is played in international arenas?
13 If we pay attention to the domestic factor, we will be deceived by the domestic factor and we will be deceived by the domestic factor.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 11, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the members of the Assembly of Experts.
Wa’azi helps me make a dignified man. It relies on Jehova and his friendship.
14
Why should we intervene when we see that the divine spirit is with us?
We should always be sure that the spirit of God is with us.
For example, you do not want to be independent of the people of your region.
They will not fight their knees and they will not fight their knees in order to bring the people to God.
That is to say, a majority of the people do not want to spend money in order to bring them to the battlefields.
Will they do such things?
You will never pay attention to this issue so far. You will never pay attention to this issue so far.
We are constantly vigilant in spite of the fact that we are using our slogans, our times, and other people care about us.
This shows that the divine spirit is with us.
May Allah the Exalted bestow His blessings on us.
15
How can mankind speak about God for the sake of Adam?
15 How should I speak about the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household?
The goal is to surrender to Adam and to live an eternal life, and this goal is to not surrender to Adam.
[The Holy Quran, 55: 11] God has prepared us to be saved from sin and sin.
What?
Jesus came to the world and gave rise to the world of Islam.
Adam should be after God's blessings in order to benefit from these blessings.
Therefore, Jesus teached the people what God deserves from them, and He did not allow them to do so.
If we advise the people and help them to be friends with God today, we will be prepared to resist with God in order to remove Adam from sin and sin.
16
What is the essence of speaking to divine commanders?
The fact that we have helped the people to celebrate their Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household is proven.
That is to say, it is Allah's favor to rescue the people and to bring them to the truth. [The Holy Quran, 2: 4] Sa'ad and a Bafaris asked Jesus, the Lord of the Worlds, to bestow His blessings on him with your heart, soul and soul.
This is an extraordinary law, and it is acted like it.
The second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point is, the second point
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Mustafa, Ayahs 10: 37- 39] When we engage in a ceremonial ceremony, we have been following these commandments.
17
Do you do something to play at the ballot boxes?
17 God blessed us very much so that He bestowed pleasure on us.
This does not allow us to prove that we are after God and the people.
There are millions of people in the world and the situation is different from the other.
But whether we are wounded, weak, weak, wealthy or weak, we can tell the people what we are doing.
Our birthday is the birthday anniversary of a brother who came from France and said, "God is the Exalted and the Exalted of all things.
I am not listening to the Book of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and I ask God to bestow help and assistance on the people of the world.
That is to say, I am teaching them and I do not tell them when they are right."
Our responsibility is, in fact, the responsibility that Jehovah has bestowed on us and that we should cooperate with God.
The Importance of Traditions
We cooperate with Allah the Exalted and we help them to live a divine blessing for everybody.
Of course God can do these things without the help of anybody, but He allows us to cooperate with Him in order to be able to do these things with us.
It makes us happy to do these things. It makes us happy to do these things. It makes us close to Jehovah and God.

The following is the full text of the speech delivered on November 24, 2013 by Margaret Walker, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, in a meeting with a group of youth in Tehran.
At that time, our magnanimous Margaret Walker paid a visit to her father's household and she studied the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
She was a master.
I used to spend a few days in my hospitality with them, but my father used to come outside and see them.
But I could do something to listen to them.
Later on, Margaret asked, "Who knows the name of God?"
That is to say, "Everyone knows that Allah is His Name."
[The Holy Quran, 8: 18] Try to see the Holy Quran in the Holy Quran.
When I take a look at you, I see that the name is Jehoba.
I would like to address this message to the friends of my dear countrymen before going to us, saying, "If you go home today, try to test the Book of Judgment [The Holy Quran, 83: 18].
And this is how I acted.
I read the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and baftism in the year 1941.
Later on, it was announced that it would be necessary to conduct a basiji book.
I encouraged the dear parents and brothers to come and fulfill their duties.
But their parents did not like this.
Members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps - Khamenei.ir
I have not managed to do anything in the biographies of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and in the books that were written by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
One day his father showed his literature and said, "Have you seen these things?
I do not want them to go home and go to the streets."
I stayed in the holy city of Zanesville, an inexhaustible city of Ohio.
But she goes home to improve her father's life and brothers and sisters."
He urged the parents of our martyrs not to go to the streets.
Sometimes, if they come together, they will come together and go home.
The dear parents of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and soldiers of our martyrs and war veterans.
I told the parents, "The more you do, the more you do, the more you do, the more you do?"
After the passage of time, she moved back to the battlefield.
In the year 1343, when Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) household had been hospitalized for the first day of the hajj, I used to start our hajj pilgrimage.
The performance that I made in my university was very good.
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution - Khamenei.ir
I was ordered to join the Army in the year 1344.
I had a lot of troops in Fort Hayes, in Columbus, in the province of Ohio. I had a lot of troops.
I told the people that I will not join the Army.
They allowed me to go home.
But a few days later, a person came to me and said, "Corwin Robson, I have not been allowed to wait for you."
After the second hour, we fell so angry and said, "Yet I am going to play a role in praying."
What is a clarification?"
He reiterated: "Dear God, I will be viewed as a cleric.
I am foreigners. I have played a lot of games with the Master of God for many people.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] He reiterated: "You do not want to come and engage in solemn praying for your sake.
You should come together to tell us whether you participate in military activities or not.
In the 30th of Aban, they were condemned to have a sin.
I was chosen to celebrate the New Year in Ashland, Kentucky.
The Lord of the Worlds and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
I made the first two hours of my visit to Columbus, the capital of the country of Ohio. The first day I did not visit the country.
I pray to God, the Lord of the Worlds, to bestow His blessings on him and his household.
I do not know of it. "
My friends and guests stayed here and there.
But I went to a front line. This is a solid wall. We stood up and watched the walls from behind.
He asked, "Why do you do these things in the streets?"
She said, “I am the Masjid of Jehoba.”
He said, “They are right?”
What did you do here?"
He said, "The devils of Jehovah have not been killed.
He said, "You have been killed in order to be able to kill them."
But there are some people who are trying to kill you.
Is this appropriate?"
He said, “No, this is not the case.”
He said, "I have been 15 years old in one classroom and I have read some of your books in the same classroom."
When I heard these things, I prayed, "Have you helped me?"
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "If you meet these people, try to call me alone."
I will say what they say.”
Therefore, there were no problems with the 50th of Farvardin.
I was attracted to a group of Shahids of Jihad who were killed in Ashland, Kentucky.
I have visited a country in the province of Ashland.
I had a meeting with some other people in this meeting.
They send us a Book Fair to recite the Holy Quran and we arrange questions and respond to them so that we can call it "The Holy Quran".
We were among the people in a country that had many logic.
There is a position that determines the region.
Ayatollah Khamenei said, "Robin, you will do something to those who have not been hosted by that cleric.
This is the region.
Dear God, bestow Your guidance on them.
We have acted in a systematic and systematic way against you.
Leader's Speech to Jurisprudents - Khamenei.ir
At the end of the 25th of Aban, I decided to go to the battlefields in southern Iran.
I asked my parents, my parents and my brothers to tell me that if they could, they would not be able to leave my home if they could.
Later on, I noticed that there were some people in our homes to go to the ballot boxes and that there were some brothers and sisters who were kissing their children off the ballot boxes.
I am living with Demetrius Papageorge, a safeguard who started praying for Jehova in the year 1913.
In the year 1950, when the relationship between the North and North Korea broke up, the Armed Forces entered the military base of Fort Hayes.
When he was tested, he said, "Take a lot of tests."
He said, "This is good, but I will not join the Army."
2: 3 And I say, "I am the companion of Christ."
Shortly before he came to the battlefield and said, "Take action.
Without a pretext, I went to a ceremonial ceremony in Bethel, in the city of Cincinnati, in the province of Ohio.
Mr. Milton Hschel said that there are a need for panegyrists in Bethel.
So, I was kicked in and was kicked in.
In August of the year 1954, I was rendering services to Brooklyn and since that time I was rendering services to Bethel.
I have done a lot of work in Bethlehem.
I have been working for many years at the service of the Navy Branch and the establishment of offices.
Later on, I went to Tehran and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) offices.
I am working at the Navy Board where a branch was established in Bethleyn, Brooklyn.
I would like to organize the meetings that are being held in Bethlead for example worshiping the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
The honor belongs to the honorable families of Shahid Sattari.
If the parents and the wounded people speak together, worship and worship the family together, if they speak in the circle, if they speak in the clergy, if they speak in the clergy, if everybody in the family is close to God.
I have many friends in Bethless and I have many friends in Basij.
They are superior to each other.
She is not a shafaff.
The Lord of the Worlds is the servant of all those who are rendering services to Betlehem.
If there are certain problems with me, I can be sure that we are suffering from them.
I think of the Holy Quran, 5: 23 and 24 and how we can resolve the issue that exists in this regard.
It does not mean â€œBe patientâ€, but many problems can be solved.
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
My mother, my mother, did not have any room for me to go home, but my mother did not have any room for me.
I have learnt lessons on Ka'bah and I am very happy to have a relationship with Ka'bah and I am very happy to have a relationship with Ka'bah on the front lines.
Sometimes I do not have 30 or 40 meetings for all people.
I would like to speak to the Ka'ni people in Brooklyn, New York.
I listened to a book with the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) book.
One day, a spiteful brother asked me, "My mother, my mother, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, the body of the body, and the body of the body."
I murmured and did not speak to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household in Ka'bah.
She named Katie.
Later on, Katie came to me and spoke to me whenever she had seen me.
I have learnt lessons on the names of a number of youth in Turkey and I have read lessons on the names of some youth in Turkey.
So, should I explain what a role is being carried out in the book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and what a role is being carried out in the book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
But after a few signs, I did not see them anywhere.
After a few months, I did not find my motherly and malevolent family athletes.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 11, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with the officials of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran.
He said, "I do not know anybody in Ka'bah."
But then I resorted to it and said, "Sanna, name Robison."
I heard a cry saying, "Robby, it is a girl.
I will wait now.”
What do they say: “How?”
She said, “They are good people.
Robby is the kind of worshiping woman.
You should learn a lot of good things.
May Allah teach women as you teach."
She said, "My mother, I can make a lot of pleasure.
I am thankful to you so much that you stayed here and there."
I do not speak at all about "The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household".
I hope that the two women who are active in this meeting will continue their youthful activities.
I am thankful to God at the age of 73. I am thankful to God who helped me.
My dear brothers and sisters said that the continuation of my duty to God's blessings has been much more effective than what our father did.
Later on, the father and brothers and sisters of men and women made baptism.
The father of our martyrs took care of us and took care of some of us before he died.
If it were for the sake of God, our neighbors and our friends would have to live in the new world.
We will have a happy meeting with God and with those whom we welcome forever.
When the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was prepared for this ritual, Corwin Robison died and was a source of security for Jehova until his death.
Jihad says, “Aminina”
[The Holy Quran, 41: 8] But come to God, the daughter of Abraham, the daughter of whom I have left behind.
Prayers: 91, 22
What is important?
How did Abraham know of God and what he was doing for his sake?
What did Abraham do for the sake of God?
How can Ibrahim learn his lessons about Yahweh?
1, 2. (a) How can we know that Adam be friend to God? (b) How can we speak about this issue in this regard?
From the day to the day of our martyrdom, we need to be vigilant.
Adam needs dogmatism and hearts, not just the kindness that exists between men and women.
But we are asking the people to do something from Jehovah.
Many people do not believe that Adam will be able to do something that is related to Jehovah and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household in order to be able to see him.
We have acknowledged this!
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) two works showed that Adam can speak about divine blessings.
We should learn their examples.
Why?
Being humble is the most important factor in our life.
Let us take the example of Abraham.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 23]
How do they become friends with God?
Abraham was very familiar with God and he was known as the "immaculate and righteous brother ".
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 11] When you study his example, try to ask one another, "Who should I learn the lessons of Abraham, and how should I learn the lessons of Jacob?"
Abraham is after God?
3, 4. (a) Why should Abraham be prepared to use Ishaq as a prostitute?
3 Do not think of Abraham's salvation at the age of 125 when he is raised on a daily basis.
Isha al-Kubra is 25 years old at that time.
Ishaq brings about it and his father gives him the brilliant opportunity to shoulder.
This was the slightest path that Abraham used to go.
But not for the sake of kissing.
There are all his advantages.
Pharaoh 22:1-8 is the duty of God to stand up against Him.
4 And this is the greatest test that Abraham had suffered for.
They used to say that Abraham should not be sacrificed for his sake.
Then Abraham said, "Well, he will not return to God and He will not return to God."
Those who make these statements do not know what to say and what to say is the basis of these statements.
Therefore, they do not know how to influence one's life.
(1 Corinthians 2: 14-16) Abraham did not pray to God without reasoning.
He knew that Ayatollah Khamenei would not allow him to do whatever would destroyed his life forever.
Abraham knew that He would be blessed by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) if He followed his path.
How Abraham could have been asked to such a position?
They should identify God and identify what He has done.
5
Did Abraham recognize and acquire this knowledge?
5 Sanin Jehoba
Abraham achieved great achievements in a name called Ur.
There are some people who pray to God, including his father.
[The Holy Quran, 24:2] How did Abraham learn to play with God?
The Holy Book shows that Noah is the household of Abraham and he lived until Abraham was 150.
He was a very wise and sympathetic man who played a role in the world of Islam.
Of course we do not know what was happening, but we can say that Shem is Abraham who sends His blessings to God.
This knowledge was achieved by Abraham in a favorable way.
6.7 Why did Ibrahim achieve such things?
6 Shia that Jehovah did.
Abraham should know what he was doing for his sake.
Some people used to think that it would be able to do something and that it would be able to tread the path.
In the Name of Abraham, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, his heart was praised and said, "God is pure, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, and the Lord of the Worlds."
[The Holy Quran, 14: 22] Fear of God is called this great book.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 7] We should be careful of God if we want to deal with the problem of God.
[The Holy Quran, 25: 14] This was how Abraham became kind to God.
7 And Allah the Exalted bestowed Abraham and Sarat on their own destination.
They are not swift and they will not be allowed to sit in the streets or in the streets.
Of course Abraham knew that it would be in need of many hajj pilgrims and praised God for his sake.
Therefore, God blessed him and commanded him.
For example, the wife of Sarato - who had been abducted from his hand and murdered him - had loved Abraham and Sarato to surrender to his body.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fitr, Ayahs 12: 10-20, Ayahs 20: 2-7, Ayahs 10: 12 and Ayahs 17] These things made Abraham's blessings stronger on a daily basis.
8
How should we know of God and how should we improve his understanding of God?
8 Can we speak about God's blessings?
Dear God, make these things happen.
As Abraham, we should ask God for a role model.
We will find out what we need to know about Jihad and what is done in the Holy Book.
Today, what will help us know Jehovah is from Abraham.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 4] The Book of the Holy Prophet contains many of the things that we need to know alongside the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) book.
What we have learnt shows us the importance of Jehovah and the importance of God.
If we look at God and observe Him, We will be diverted from His blessings.
That is to say, it helps us, it helps us, it helps us, it helps us.
If we return to God with our heart, our life will be full of tranquility and happiness.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Sura al-Hajj, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini, Imam Khomeini,
Abraham is behind his relationship with God.
9, 10. (a) How can the relationship between men and women be strengthened? (b) How can the relationship between men and women be strengthened?
9 Therefore, we need to strengthen our dignity, and we need to strengthen our dignity.
The Holy Quran, 17: 17
Eid al-Kubra is not the kind of tool that is used to raise children.
It is like a beautiful tree and it needs water and water to be enlightened.
Abraham prayed for his divine blessings and praised God for his sake.
Why did they do this?
10 Abraham continued his prayers to God and he did not pray for fear of God.
For example, when he travels to the holy city of Kan'ana with his family and servants, he follows the command of God during his sacrifices.
He stood at the age of 99 before being forced to return to Ishaq, and Abraham said, "Well, he was forced to return to Ishaq and he was forced to return to Ishaq."
Were Abraham suspicious of God or were he willing to follow the commanders of God?
No, but he relies on God and makes good deeds on the Day of Judgment.
11
Why did Abraham go to Saduma and Gwamarata and help God?
[The Holy Quran, 11: 11] Even when Abraham was kind to God, his relationship with God was strengthened.
That is to say, he feels like being able to speak to God and ask God for His help and raise many questions.
For example, Abraham paid the price for Saddam Hussein (s.a.) and said that he would destroy Saddam Hussein (s.a.).
Why?
He was afraid that there would be disagreement with the people of Kermanshah.
He loved Lutu and his families who were living in Saddam Hussein (a.s.).
Abraham trusted the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and reiterated: "The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.)
Jihad believes in him and shows that he is humble.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 33] The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said that before he was judged, the people were chastened and chastened.
12, 13. (a) How did Abraham know of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and how did he witness the achievements of Abraham in the past? (b) How did Abraham know of God?
12 Knowing God and helping Abraham improve his relationship with God.
God knows that He is humble and sincere. He knows that He is humble and that He is safe at all times.
Abraham is sure that Jehovah is not even an aggressive man.
Why should we do this?
13 When Abraham had returned to his servants, he said, â€œBe with you, and we will go after youâ€.
[The Holy Quran, 22: 5] What does Abraham mean?
Is this possible if you know that Isha al-Kubra (s.a.) will return to your country again?
A.
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said that Abraham should know that the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) would be able to take Ishaq (a.s.) out of his life.
[The Holy Quran, 10: 19]
Abraham knew that He was the honorable person of Sarato and his wife.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 12: 18] Therefore, it is clear that God cannot do anything.
Abraham does not know what will happen on that day.
However, it is clear that whenever he dies, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will take him to fulfill his promises.
Abraham has been named as "those who are righteous, those who are righteous and those who are righteous."
Abraham said that whenever he dies, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will take him to fulfill his promise.
14
Who can help you when you pray to God and engage in a ceremonial ceremony like Abraham?
Of course, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) does not want us to speak with our friends today, but He wants us to speak with him.
Sometimes, we will not understand why Jihad had been commanded in a particular way.
Do you explain what this is doing?
Yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday yesterday.
Babies feel angry and have a duty to speak to different people.
And they are afraid of being highlighted both in writing and in writing.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Fitr, Ayah 22:2] When you have been asked to do something that belongs to you, remember the daughter of Abraham and observe what he was doing.
If we take a look at the examples of these humble people, then we will learn them and be after the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household. [The Holy Quran, 12: 1 and 2].
YADDA ABRAHIM VICTORY OF KUD, KUD AND JEHOBAH
SAAD AND SOKE VICTORY
Abraham and Sarato learn the lessons of playing with Jihob and they listened to them.
Abraham ordered the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) to return to Ur.
SA’AD AND THE VICTORY OF THE ISLAMIC KANA
Abraham and Saratu Sa’ad - Khamenei.ir
LAST REVOLUTION in Khamenei
Abraham ordered Allah the Exalted to betray the pilgrims of his home.
Later on, he played a role with Saddam Hussein (a.s.).
Abraham and Saratu
Abraham showed his blessings, and he was ready to follow his path.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] Abraham used to say, "The tree of the earth is a tree for many years.
And this is a good point.
15
Why should we be sure that Abraham did not know that he was asking for Jehovah?
15 Did Abraham know that he was committed to God?
In the Holy Book of Abraham, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "The life of Abraham is far more than a century.
[The Holy Quran, 25: 8] Even when Abraham was in the year 175 he could have thought about many years in the world.
Why?
Therefore, it should be very important to refer to God.
Of course, the Holy Book says that Abraham has lived a long life. This does not mean that he should live a long life.
16
How may Abraham be sacrificed for his sake?
16 The Holy Book says, Abrahams, is an immaculate and immaculate city, the capital of which is Allah the Exalted.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] Abraham is sure that he will see this city one day and he will live in the reign of God in a selfless way.
In fact, Abraham will be defeated!
Dear God, reflect on the blessedness of Abraham whose companions were with him, and on the blessedness of Abraham whose companions were with him.
You should know that the examples of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household have been helpful to the people of God for twenty years.
On the other hand, it would be like to say that the greatness of Isfahan is a very important role.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 19] Therefore, you will learn that the sense of self-sacrifice of the Imam of Ishaq (a.s.) helped millions of memorized people to realize that the sense of self-sacrifice of the Imam of Jesus Christ as the representative of Adam.
[The Holy Quran, 3: 16] Abraham's example helped us to thank the people for his sacrifice, and nobody would forget this example.
17
What should we discuss in the future?
17 Let us pay attention to the enemy's role model and model.
As Abraham, we need to identify God and observe what He has done among us.
As long as we continue teaching and speaking to God, we will witness His blessings and guidance.
(6:10 - 12 )
Let us continue speaking to God for everybody.
In the near future, we will discuss a few examples of the three main elements that are related to spirituality.
[The Holy Quran, Sura Ibrahim, Saratu Abram and Saraya]
But in this regard, we will benefit from the name that Jehobah has written back on us.
The Importance of Traditions
If we want to be friends with God, we need to know the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
We will learn how much we can play, and we will learn how much we can play.
This makes us trust in him and makes us trust in him.
If we continue our relations with Jihad, our relations with Jihad will continue.
Dear God, bestow Your guidance on the Holy Quran and the Holy Quran.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 14] Allah the Exalted will bestow His blessings on him.
No. 106, 118
What is important?
What lessons should we learn from the poetry and role of Ruth?
Why did the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household become friends with God?
What was the behavior of Mary, the father of Jesus, who was the believer in the Lord of the Worlds?
1.3. (a) Why should we be sure that we can be friends with God? (b) Which methods should we discuss in this regard?
There is a report in the Holy Book that says that Ibrahim is the servant of God.
[The Holy Quran, 20: 7 ; Isaiah 41: 8 ; Ayah 22: 23] Abraham was the servant of the Holy Book and he called the servant of God stable.
Did this mean that he was condemned to be a member of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps?
A.
The Holy Book shows that we can have this balance.
The Holy Book contains the memory of many men and women who are afraid of God and who believe in it and who have become friends and friends with Him.
(25:14 LMT )
They were mentioned in the Holy Quran by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Yes, all of them are brothers to God. [The Holy Quran, 12: 4]
3 Let us pay attention to the three elements of the Holy Book who show that they have been friends with God.
What lessons can we learn from being servants of God?
She referred to religious faith and dignity.
4, 5 What kind of worship was it that Ruth asked, and why was it worshiping?
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj 9]
4 In addition to their dear ones, Ruth and Orphan, they travel from Moab to Israel in an inexhaustible way.
When they are treading the path, Orphanism begins from the mouthpieces of Moab.
Then Naomi focused his intentions on going to the battlefield, namely, the ground of Israel.
That is to say, the situation of Ruth is very bad.
What will they do?
Will Moab return to be with her, or will she turn Naomi to Ba'talami?
The 5th of Ruth is located in Moab.
Their character will be changed, and their character will be changed.
I know the people of Moab, Yere and their culture.
She cannot prove that she will be allowed to sit in the Ba'talami.
But then, Naomi feels that it will not be able to find a single woman.
Therefore, Naomi returned to Moab to Ruth.
As we saw, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) returned to her.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 9: 15] But the Holy Quran returned to his household.
6. (a) What is the good performance of Ruth? (b) Why did Boaz say that Ruth should be performed under the shrine of Jehoba?
6. Later on, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
You should learn that Moab is different from Ayatollah Khamenei.
She knew that Zeinab al-Kubra (s.a.) had been humbled and that she had been tortured.
Therefore, Ruth went through a good performance.
He said to Naomi, "Their hearts will be for the sake of God and God."
(1: 16) If we think that the Holy Prophet of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, our hearts will be defeated.
But what is worse is that Ruth worshiped and praised God.
He moved to Boaz and went to Tehran so that he believed in Jihob and "wished to be infallible among his eyes" [The Holy Quran, 14: 39].
[The Holy Quran, 2: 12]
The poems that Boaz used to use remembered how sincere they used to shoulder under the eyes of their father.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Baqara, Ayah 7] Judgment of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Ruth did not pretend that she had entered the arena of divine values.
7
How can the innocent people help God?
7 Many people listen to the Holy Book, but they do not want to be after divine remembrance.
They made sacrifices against God and they made baftism.
If you find themselves in this situation, think about the reasons why you are living in this situation.
Everyone knows what they are doing.
[The Holy Quran, 24: 15] Going to God is the best opportunity for you.
If you do not think of God, you should show that He will definitely help you.
That is to say, it will help you tread your path or face certain problems.
Here is what Allah the Exalted has done for Ruth.
“I believe the world of Islam.”
8
Dear God, reveal what was happening in Hussein al-Shafa.
8 Thoughts on Hezekiah are different from the Thoughts of Ruth
It was created in a society that was devout to God.
But the family of Israelis did not be safe.
The father of Hizkiyyah is the sarki Ahaz.
They do not believe in God's virtues.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this afternoon with his brothers and sisters.
Dear God, he will not be able to do anything that is wrong. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 10-27] The Holy Quran will not be able to do anything that is wrong.
9, 10. (a) Why should we not trust Allah the Exalted in this regard? (b) Why should we not allow him to tell us that his education allows us to become pure and pure people?
Hazrat says 9 things that Hazrat can do, Hazrat says 9 things that Hazrat can do.
Today those who do not know what Hezekiah wants do not feel secure because they are shouting "there is no divine blessing" or because they are shouting "there is no divine blessing".
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 3] Their brothers and sisters should not be able to do the right thing or do the wrong thing that their fathers did.
[The Holy Quran, 18: 2, 3] Is this truly true?
10 years ago Ayatollah Khamenei said that this is not truth.
There is no reason why we should engage in a hostage fight against God.
That is to say, it would not have to make the people shed tears.
[The Holy Quran, 34: 10] The father can teach his father to do good and do bad things.
(22: 6 ; Colossians 3 : 21) This does not mean that we are far more educated than we are today.
Why?
If God gives us the opportunity to do what we want, it means that we can ask God to do what we want.
[The Holy Quran, 30: 19] How did Hezekiah use this word?
Many youth and adolescents entered the arena of God in spite of the fact that their father was not Shahid of God. [The Holy Quran, 9: 10]
11
Why should Hizkiya be among the best of the lists in Judah?
Of course, although his father was among the dead Jewish pilgrims, Hezekiah was among the deadly pilgrims.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Adha]
He had not seen any examples of his father.
Similarly, he studied the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household as Isaiah, Mikah and Hosi.
He recited their recitation and listened to them.
That was why he did a lot of things that his father did not like.
He stepped up in the hajj, and Allah the Exalted bestowed His blessings on his people.
[The Holy Quran, 29: 1 - 11], 18: 24: 31: 1] Later on, when the Assyrian camp of Sennacherib threatened to attack Urushalem, Hizkiya proved that he was a pioneer.
He relies on God and gives him the opportunity to follow it.
[The Holy Quran, 32: 7] On the one hand, Hezekiah achieved great achievements, but when the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household had sitting around, it was humbled.
[The Holy Quran, 32: 24-26] indeed, we should learn from Hezekiah.
He did not believe the atmosphere of his life.
His Eminence said that it is religious faith in God.
12
How many people have participated in the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) meeting today?
Therefore, today the world is full of shortcomings and shortcomings. Therefore, many of our children have suffered great losses without their lasting families.
(2 Timothy 3:1-5) Of course many Armenian Christians are far away from their homes and their families are not well educated, but they are closest to God's friendship.
The Islamic Republic has shown that their education does not reveal their future identity.
Allah the Exalted has bestowed determination on us.
“Yet my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my father, my
13 and 14.
Why should we say that the task that was not done for Maryams is not appropriate and that it is not done for the angels of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.)?
13 Several years after the era of Hezekiah, Mary-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani-e Bastani.
They will do two things, but Allah's grace be upon them.
In fact, the Lord of the Worlds (God's greetings be upon him and his household) honored Mary, and he accepted it.
But why should they make efforts in order to this goal?
[The Holy Quran, 13: 14] Look at me, the servant of God.
14 Let us be careful about the greed that was bestowed on Mary.
But there are some things that are not afraid.
For example, the angels of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household would say that there are two kinds of worshiping for each other.
But the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household would not tell her how to do two things.
What would they think of the Iranian nation if they had seen them inside the country?
How should they tell Joseph that he was not after fame?
That is to say, it is not enough to say God's grace.
We fail to know what Maryam was thinking at that time, but we fail to know what she did after the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) time.
He said, "By Allah's favor, I will be a servant of you." 1.Luka 26-38.
15
Why should Mary be so bad on a daily basis?
Mary 15 is very good.
She prepared her heart for what had been ordered.
He was not sure whether God would take him to death or not.
This is the case with Mary.
They do not give us any benefit.
But we can be similar to Mary, and I hope God will help us.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 22] Mary acted in a rowza to strengthen her bloodthirsty.
How do we know this?
Let us pay attention to the situation of the country and the situation of the country.
16
How do they prove that Maryham is good on a daily basis?
Mary's 16th Anniversary
The Holy Book says, "Everyone knows what he says and what he says."
Mary (God's greetings be upon him and his household)
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) shows that everything that has been teached by women, especially the things that have been teached by God.
It took him time to take care of the important issues.
For example, when Jesus was born, the enemy sent a message to Mary which the angels had bestowed on them.
Later on, when Jesus was 12 years old, he made an announcement that Mary had been astonished.
Mary came to her at that time and she noticed what she had seen. [The Holy Quran, 2: 16-19, 49 and 51]
17
What lessons should we learn from the words of Mary?
Mary's 17th Message - Khamenei.ir
The Holy Book does not describe Mary's words as accurate.
The longest period of time is mentioned in Luke 1: 46-55.
This freshness shows that Maryam knows Nassosin Ibrancy very well.
Why?
Mary's prayers were close to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) prayers.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-
Obviously, she was obliged to do something that she was teaching from Imam Khomeini's (r.a.).
18.
How should we learn the lessons of Mary?
Sometimes, God may not allow us to do something that is opposed to Mary.
Let us learn from doing this and reliance on God will help us.
If we ask God for divine assistance, we will be able to teach Mary as well as if we ask God for divine assistance, and we will be able to teach Mary as well.
If we do this, we will be happy to tell the people what we have learnt. [The Holy Quran, 77: 11, 12, 8: 18 and 10: 15].
19
Whenever we learn the lessons of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the people mentioned in his Holy Book, how can we be honest with these things?
Ruth, Hezekiah and Maryam are apparently friends with God like Abraham.
They were among the "grateful fiends" who were considered friends with God.
Let us continue being examples of such men.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (6: 11), Ayah 12] If we do this, we will be after divine servants forever.
Dear God, give good news to God, peace and greetings be upon you.
Remember one of the most important days in your life.
What was the birthday anniversary of Norouz and what was the birthday anniversary of Norouz?
What is the day when you are infallible?
In fact, the day when there is baftism, will be the most important and the most pleasant day of your life.
In this day, your brothers and sisters made the most pleasant and pleasant appearances to Allah the Exalted for your sake, your hearts, your forgiveness, your forgiveness, your forgiveness, your forgiveness, your forgiveness, your forgiveness, and your forgiveness. [The Holy Quran, 12: 30]
Without a doubt, since the day when you were pious, many things have been done in God's shrine.
Now there are some misguided people who are prepared to give in to God's blessings.
Why did this happen?
How can it help us to pray for divine blessings?
All of the reasons for this reason are pure and pure.
I am very happy to see that Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) household is very pleasant.
Why?
He promised that His rule will destroy the modern world and destroy it.
Zionists 1: 14 say, "God's Day is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near, it is near."
If we witness the arrival of the war, we can turn our enthusiasm into enthusiasm just as we have done previously.
Sometimes we can render good services to God. [The Holy Quran, 13: 12]
If we stay together with our brothers and sisters, this brings about happiness and happiness for all of us.
The behavior of the people of Jehovah is that we should perform our services in a truly sincere way.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 12] But how can it go if certain people are forgotten to follow the prayers of God?
That is to say, there are some people in your circles who can make them feel happy.
The world can give us the opportunity to benefit from our divine blessings.
What?
The discipline of commercialization that is carried out in this world can compete with all the things that are not necessary.
Jesus said, "Whoever does not have the right to invite him to two people, whether he is or not, his wife is the wife of a wife, and his wife is the wife of a wife."
Do not allow your to be sacrificed for the sake of God and the blessings of God."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Mustafa, Ayah 24] If we belong to the material elements of the world, we will not be able to betray God's blessings.
Biography of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) in Tehran
Those who follow Jehova are not thwarted.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 3] remember that Jesus had said, â€œTurn to the battlefields and fight to the battlefields with heavy responsibilities and with heavy responsibilities.
You should learn from wound, but your life will be rewarded. Your life will be rewarded.
It is necessary to raise and fulfill one's responsibility."
[The Holy Quran, 11: 28] The life of a sincere Armenians is pleasant and pleasant.
Without a doubt, we have good reasons to be happy with divine services.
Let us speak about three kinds of things.
I pray to the Imam of the Age (may our magnanimous Imam be sacrificed for his sake).
[The Holy Quran, 17: 28] The Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) companions are humble and humble.
Therefore, even if we go after the hajj, even if we go after the hajj, even if we go after the hajj, even if we go after the hajj, even if we go after the hajj.
He was happy to go and rendered services to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Dear God, pay attention to a brother who has been rendering good services for Hector for more than four decades.
He used to pray to God for his sake, and He used to pray to God for his sake.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 12-14] Although his wife had not allowed him to do anything in the service of God, Hector would remained happy.
He reiterated: "The health of a woman is insignificant and it is associated with other things. This frightened me. Be careful, but this does not prevent me from betraying God's blessings."
May God bestow His grace and blessings on him, and may God bestow His blessings on him.
I am so happy to stay alive in this meeting and I pay attention to what the Imam of the Age will offer to me so that I can remain happy on this occasion."
Jihad gives us happiness in his life.
The Holy Book says, "God loves the world until He has given its righteousness and brought it to its knees, so that the tree which is not righteous about it will not be destroyed, but it will be rewarded forever."
[The Holy Quran, 3: 16] indeed, Allah will guide our servants, and we will be happy forever if we look for the servants whom Allah has bestowed on us.
This is the appropriate reason why we should be thankful.
Jesus bestowed happiness on him and his life on him for many years.
His Eminence said, "I want to do something that is necessary in certain cases, especially if I do not want to do it or not."
But I only do this in order to my position.
When I was teaching God to play a role in the arena of self-confidence and when I was teaching God to play a role in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-confidence and in the arena of self-conf
I do not believe in God and I do not believe in God.
But after the 28th of Aban, I rendered services to the company for a very long time."
Jesus Christ bestowed joy and blessings on him.
We have lived a good life and we are happy to do so.
Can you remember how long your life was before you came to God?
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said to Armenians that they are the children of zombies, but now they are the children of justice.
As long as they can live a good life, they can live a lifetime for everybody.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Roshan, Ayah 17-22] We are also after the blessings of Jehovah who is suffering from destruction or lack of faith.
This is indeed a source of joy.
I have been witness to many years of happiness in my life with those whom I pray to God.
You should pay attention to a Jaime who is unaware of the existence of God.
He started his lectures on the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and on the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
During his lifetime, Jaime spoke to God and helped him.
Jaime reiterated: "Sayed that the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter (the Holy Prophet's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter
There were good religious scholars and good religious scholars.
That is to say, I was not at all killed in the real sense of the word.
I have been rendering services to God for many years, and I have been rendering services to God for many years.”
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on earth.
What should we feel when we are waiting for the storm of this world?
You should remember that we mean God and we should live forever.
Therefore, "we do not limit ourselves to be accompanied by righteous, righteous, righteous and righteous."
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 9] With the help of Yehuwa, we should continue making efforts in order to fulfill our obligations in order to be satisfied with the obligations we need. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (7, 9), Ayah 13, 14 and Ayah 1:2-4].
We are sure that God will bestow His blessings on us because He knows what we are doing.
He knew that we were following his path and that we were following his path.
If we go after divine rejoinders, we will be like the late Daud, who says, "I am divine before all kinds of people.
The hearts of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) are pure and pure. [The Holy Quran, 16: 8].
In Nazari
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on May 4, 2016 by Ayatollah Khamenei.
Dear God, bestow Your security on Eid al-Hajj.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 20: 42].
Volumes : 125, 62
What is important?
Were the SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK SAVAK?
How can we be sapled to God and see that a righteous man is not sapling our souls?
How can it be possible to ask Allah the Exalted for peace and justice at the service of such people who are unjustly understood justice?
Why should Jonathan and Dauda be appointed as an example of security?
Undoubtedly, Daud had lost his heart in a very sincere way.
Daud murdered a colonialist and so-called Goliath and placed the so-called "An Bafilist" on the father of Jonathan, the Holy Prophet of Israel.
[The Holy Quran, 17: 57] When you know that Allah is with Daud, you should know that God is with God.
Since then, Jonathan and Dauda have been friends in many arenas.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Adha].
Of course, when he was witness to Imam Hussein (a.s.), the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) voiced his objection to the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) voiced his objection to Imam Hussein (a.s.), the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) voiced to Imam Hussein (a.s.).
When Saul tried to kill Daud, he played a role with his friends.
When he knew that Daud had a residential residence in Horesh, he went to Tehran and relied on God.
Therefore, the Lord of the Worlds (God's greetings be upon him and his household) will bring him to the battlefields, and he will not be afraid of it. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Shafa, Ayah 25: 16, Ayah 17] The Lord of the Worlds (God's greetings be upon him and his household) will be sacrificed for his sake.
3
What was more important for Jonathan, and how we knew that?
[The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 14, 2011]
We love secure people.
What was done with Daud?
No, being in security with God is more important for Jonathan.
In fact, he used to be in security for Daud and he did not listen to Daud and he would probably be in contact with his companions.
He trusted God and helped Daud.
Both of them provided security for Jehova and for each other.
They have fulfilled their promise, “there is divine blessing among yours and yours” [The Holy Quran, 20: 42].
4. (a) How can we get happy and happy? (b) How can we discuss the issue in this regard?
4.We should pay careful attention to our families, friends and friends.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 10] But what is more important is that we should safeguard the Lord of the Worlds for his sake.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 11] If we are in a safe and pleasant way, we will be happy.
As a result of this, we know that we should be careful about God or not.
During hajj, we will discuss how a example of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) can help us be a safe and healthy mankind in such areas: (1) witnessing a spiteful innocent person to us, (2) witnessing a safe and healthy mankind to whomever we are a safe and healthy mankind, (3) witnessing a malevolent person who makes us feel unjust or (4) witnessing the pleasure of our prominent figure.

Why should the people of Israel be safeguarded and safeguarded by Allah the Exalted?
5 The Jonathan and the people of Israel are in a difficult situation.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) belonged to the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and his father.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 17-23] Allah the Exalted bestowed peace on him for many years.
They should not be vigilant in this regard, but they should not be vigilant in this regard. [The Holy Quran, 29: 23] The people who are in this regard should not be vigilant in this regard.
6
What does it suggest that Ayatollah Khamenei would be a safe and secure man?
6 The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
For example, pay attention to what Jonathan said was an insignificant and unforgettable point after that Sauls had decided to be in love with God.
(1 Sam 13: 13), 14) At that time, a large number of Palestinian Armed Forces had reduced their number to 30,000 in order to attack the people of Israel.
He had an army of 600 soldiers.
But Jonathan was not afraid.
He remembered the words of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and said, "God will never forgive his people against His great name." [The Holy Quran, 12: 22] Jonathan said to a soldier, "God will not forgive him from doing anything, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing, no matter what he is doing
As a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies, as a result of these tragedies as a result of these tragedies.
He was blessed by Ayatollah Khamenei.
The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Palestinians were afraid.
They attack each other and kill each other. This is what the people of Israel do. 1. Sama'ila 13: 5, 15, 22, 14: 1, 2, 6, 14, 15, 20
7
How does Jonathan find out about his father?
7 Of course, when Saul continued his friendship with God, He spent his friendship with his father on a daily basis.
For example, they took action in order to call the people to God. 1. Sama'ila 31: 1, 2.
8, 9. How do we benefit from God's blessings when we benefit from the rulers?
8 When this happens, we can ask God for assistance and we can ask God for assistance.
Later on, he said, "They are our rulers and they need us to follow them."
(Romans 13: 1, 2 )
That is to say, we should ask a government official to do something that is not in line with the law and we should ask them to do something that is not in line with the law.
Dear God, indeed, we should pay attention to those who are not our heads by God. [The Holy Quran, 11: 3] Abraham 13: 17.
Our trust in God's guests is to be orientated towards rendering services to our fellow countrymen or not to God's guests.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 9] In North America, some brothers and sisters had a source of insight for Jehovah and had a source of insult for her. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 136]
Sometimes he does not speak at all. Sometimes he does not speak at all in order to be a Master of God.
She said that she would not have been injured.
But the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) did not name him as a "wretched man".
She can make efforts in order to be a woman.
She used to raise children, raise children and take care of others in her family.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 17] But if there is an opportunity, it will be able to visit him and his friends in the best way possible.
For example, a patient who wanted to go to a hotel for the sake of his father, organized a meeting with him for the sake of his father, and if he had to go to a meeting with him, he would have to go to the ballot boxes.
After many years, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household gave rise to an acceptable relationship with the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
If they go to the ballot boxes, they go to the ballot boxes, and if they go to the ballot boxes, they go to the ballot boxes also. [The Holy Quran, 3: 1].
SAAD AND VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY VICTORY
10.
How could Jonathan know who should be safeguarded from him?
10 When Saul said that he would kill Dawud, he was in need of an insult to the people.
He wanted to be a security for his father, but he wanted to be a security for Daud.
He knew that God was with Daud and not with Saul. Therefore, he knew that he would be a source of security for Daud.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] When Imam Hussein (a.s.) was born in the holy city of Qom, Imam Hussein (a.s.) was born in the holy city of Qom.
11, 12
How can our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) help us be sacrificed for his sake?
The dear brothers and sisters of Alice, from Osterely, are in need of safeguarding those who are safe for her.
That is to say, "The Book of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household has written lessons on its own."
Later on, he showed why he or she should do this.
First of all, they were bad enough to do so, but later on they were bad enough to do so.
They saw that Alice had ignored them.
Her father said, "I did not want to see her.
Alice said, "I have taken a lot of trouble and I have spent a lot of trouble visiting our houses."
But the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household were all underfoot." [The Holy Quran, 10: 37]
12 We should not believe in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way or in another way.
For example, Henry is excited to do a role model for his athlete.
However, in order to play sports in every part of the game, he does not at all go to the ballot boxes or go to the ballot boxes as much as necessary.
Henry said that he should pay attention to the consequences of his worship.
Therefore, he was willing to participate in sports with his companions. [The Holy Quran, 6: 33]
13
How can reliance on God help us solve the problems of our families?
13 Sometimes it becomes a source of security for the heads of our families.
For example, Ayatollah Khamenei said, "I would like to visit the late parents of our martyrs and they would like to stay there and wait for them."
But the father and the wife are not prepared."
He reiterated: "If I want to give the woman happiness, she will be thirsty for her."
Considering the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and realizing that the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) should make his wife happy and happy in this regard.
Later on, he gave an excuse to his wife.
He explained to his wife the reasons why she should love her father.
He reveals to his father the reasons why he should be a woman. [The Holy Quran, 2: 24] The Holy Quran, 13: 4
Today's Sa'ad and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) birthday anniversary anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) or the birthday anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
14
Why did Saul put an injustice on Jonathan?
14 We will be in a safe and safe way for Jehova if a brother in his household fails to justice.
It is Allah the Exalted who appointed Saula the Exalted, but He did not receive his appointment appropriately.
We did not understand why Jonathan was following Daud.
That is to say, when Ayatollah Khamenei became a cleric, Ayatollah Khamenei became a cleric, and when Ayatollah Khamenei became a cleric, Ayatollah Khamenei became a cleric and a cleric.
But still, Jonathan paid the price for his father.
Therefore, it would be a source of security for Jehova and Daud, who by Allah's favor, will be the source of independence for Israel. [The Holy Quran, 20: 30 - 41]
15
What should we do if a person faces an injustice?
Today the dear brothers and sisters of our Islamic seminaries are far more vigilant than those of them.
But those who are alive brothers will fail to realize why we were doing this in a certain way.
(1 Sam 13: 17) Therefore, if there is no justice or if there is no understanding of us, there is security for Jehovah.
SAAD AND VICTORY OF OUR VICTORY
16
Will we have security in those conditions and will not be after it?
16 Saul wants to invite Jonathan to be a servant of Daud.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-
That is to say, Jonathan became a brother and made his promise fulfilled.
Everybody should be vigilant in this regard. Everybody should be vigilant in this regard.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 4] We shall fulfill our promises in order to be in security with Allah the Exalted.
For example, if we make a trade agreement, we will do what we have promised.
And if we suffer from difficulties in our hearts, we will pay attention to Jehovah and Heaven as a source of security for our dear ones or for our dear ones. [The Holy Quran, 2: 13-16]
If we make a trade agreement, we will do whatever we have promised to us so that we can have security for Allah the Exalted.
17
How does this teaching help you?
17 Just like John, we should be trusted in God or in other places.
Therefore, we should take care of our happy brothers and sisters.
That is to say, I hope God will bring us happiness.
27: 11 We are sure that He will bless us.
We will learn lessons from certain people during the time of Daud, who were safe and who did not do so in the near future.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 9] There are certain things that can be done in this regard.
The Importance of Traditions
Presence and security for Jehova: We believe in Jehova and we pray to him on a daily basis.
In certain circumstances, we think of what Jehovah wants to do and what he wants to do so that we can listen to him or anybody else.

Learns from Imam Khomeini's (r.a.) servants
Why should you tread the path of Eid al-Mustafa in the near future? [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Mustafa, Ayahs 6: 8].
Valor: 63, 43
What is important?
Who should show us security?
Why did Joseph ask Daud not to be able to do anything other than Abner?
How do these behaviors help us be trusted in God?
How did Daud realize that he was safe and secure from God?
(Take a look at the hotel rooms here.)
SAUL and his 3,000 soldiers were after DAODA in the Jewish arena in order to killing him.
But a day, Daud and his people found that Saul and his Armed Forces had established their sanctions.
Both of them were ignorant. Daud and Abishai gradually left the Armed Forces and they sent the Saul down.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] When the Imam of the Age (God's greetings be upon him, his immaculate soul be upon him and may God hasten his immaculate soul, may God hasten his immaculate soul, and may God hasten his immaculate soul, and may God hasten his immaculate soul.
But Daud did not even killing Saula.
He addressed the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and said, "Who is he wrong?
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-
2. Dauda realizes what to be a safe and kind person means.
He knew that he was asking for the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and he should not think of being weak.
Why?
By Allah's favor, Saul will be the daughter of Israel.
Even today, the Lord of the Worlds (God's greetings be upon him and his servants be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him and be upon him)
3
Why was Abishai safe for Daud?
3 The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) went to Daud and said that it was Allah the Exalted who allowed Daud to be Exalted.
However, as a result of Daud, he became stronger and stronger.
When the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) spoke to the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) died, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) died and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) died.
[The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, and Quran.
If that is to say, Abishai was the head of the Army and he was able to use his ikone as the Supreme Leader, but he did not do so.
Similarly, he rendered services to Daud and took him out of his friendship. [The Holy Quran, 10: 10].
4. (a) How Daud used to demonstrate insight in God? (b) How can we demonstrate insight in God?
Daud was safe all of his life.
She murdered the daughter of Goliath, who also belonged to Jehova and Israel.
[The Holy Quran, 17: 23] When Daud was humbled, He sent the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) daughter Nathan.
Later on, Daud accepted that he was sincere.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Adha].
[The Holy Quran, 29: 1-5] Daud had indeed made certain hardships in his life, but he was not forgiven by Allah the Exalted.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (42), Ayah 10]. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 50] During this sermon, we will discuss the examples of Daud and some people and we will learn how we can safeguard the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) servants.
Then we will speak about certain things that will help us be safe and secure.
Which kind of religious faith should be undermined?
5
What lessons we have learnt from the mistakes that Abishai made?
5 Sa'ad ibn Abishai (a.s.) wanted to kill Saul and he wanted to show his father to Daud.
But Daud knew that killing the "sacrifice of God" was a burden. Therefore, Abishai did not believe that he would kill the shrine of Saul.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-
The most important point is that we should safeguard our security for everybody.
6
Of course, why should we express our concerns about the issue of security for our neighboring countries and our friends?
6 For those of us, including our friends and our neighbors, we should show security.
Of course, if we rely on them, our heart can rely on them.
[The Holy Quran, 17: 9] Therefore, if somebody who is trying to do something that is wrong and who has lost the honor of Jehovah, he should remember that being safe for Jehovah is more important for all men. [The Holy Quran, 22: 37].
7
How can a treacherous person have a security for God in a difficult situation?
7 If there is suspicion in your home, it will be possible to prove that you are safe for it.
For example, the father of an inexhaustible person was given to her and she said, "When she wants to go to her, she wants to go to her."
The mother of Anne used to go to the streets in order to speak to anybody in the family.
She refused to tell her father that her child should be inspired by her children.
Before she wrote a testament, Anne buried some of the holy books of Kermanshah.
(1 Corinthians 5: 11; 2 Corinthians 9: 11) She wrote a message in which she stated that her father had abandoned the forefathering family of her husband and her husband.
She said to her father that she should look to God and be happy with it. [The Holy Quran, 4: 8]
8
What behavior can help us be secure of God?
8 And the servants of Jehovah who were in charge of divine sanctions were pure-hearted and pure during the time of Daud.
Let us speak about the ways in which these behaviors can help us be safe and secure for Jehova.
We should stay together.
9
Why did Abner claim to kill Daud?
9 The daughter of Saul, that is to say, Jonathan and the head of the Israeli Armed Forces, entered the arena where Daud had taken Goliath to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Jonathan became a brother of Daud and he was secure of him.
(17: 57 – 18: 3 ) But Abner did not do so.
He also helped Saul when he wanted to kill Daud.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Adha].
But after the death of Saul, Abner did not support Daud.
Similarly, he was honored with the name of Ish-Boshet and his household.
Later on, Ayatollah Khamenei paid the price for his household and sentence him to the wife of Saül.
2: 8-10; 3: 6-11 Why did Jonathan and Abner play a role in the face of Daud?
He said, "By Allah's favor, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) is a magnanimous Imam.
10.
Why did Absalom not be forgiven by God?
[The Holy Quran, 10: 10] Therefore, the Imam of the Age (a.s.) was not satanic.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 1] Therefore, He wants to be a wolfisher, and He wants to be a wolfisher, and He wants to be a wolfisher, and He wants to be a wolfisher, and He wants to be a wolfisher, and He wants to be a wolfisher.
Even if he wished to kill his father even if he knew that he was the Lord, Daud would be the son of Israel. [The Holy Quran, 15: 13, 14, 17: 1-4]
11
How can we benefit from the story of Abner, Absalom and Baruch contained in the Holy Book?
11 If a person is not taught and is after greatness, he will be in security with Allah the Exalted.
Of course we are committed to God and we do not want to be like the gentlemen, Abner and Absalom, and we should try to avoid being committed to what is very important for us.
That is how I think of God.
Therefore, he was happy to be worshiped at the ceremonies of Eid al-Adha.
Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later on, Later
How do you win big games with you?
Do not kill them. "
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Irmiya, Ayah 45: 4].
In fact, we should call Allah the Exalted to God so that He will destroy the storm of the world.
When I spoke about your duty, you should help me and pray to God.
12
Try to reveal why we cannot be trusted of God without our dear ones.
There were 12 panegyrists in Mexico who asked him to raise a safe and secure position for his father.
She wanted to ask God for a divine blessing.
Daniel reiterated: "I have continued my writing to women whenever I am rendering services to women."
He said, "Well, he should do whatever he wants to do in order to be honest with the people of our country."
He does not love God and needs to be a ta'weel.
That is to say, he played a role in sports arenas.
Daniel reiterated: "By Allah's favor, help me know that I am asking for security for Allah and I should write down your book."
When I prayed in a holy prayer, I wrote another book on the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Therefore, it is not necessary to give in to death, but it is necessary to be satisfied with the services."
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on November 24, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a group of students.
Greetings be upon Allah's pious servants
Were it possible to find out how hard they are doing this in order to be able to help them?
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj 14]
13
Which year Nathan asked, "Who is the security of Jehoba and Daud?"
13 If we trust God, we trust certain people and we will help them on the best possible path.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was a source of security for Jehova and Dauda.
After Daud achieved the killing of a single person, Zeubah sent Nathan to Daud.
Nathan praised the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) for his sake.
He showed his wisdom and understanding in order to be able to speak to Daud.
He wanted to help Daud know that Daud was making serious crimes.
As a result of this, he recited the story of a cowardly who was treading the streets of a cowardly.
Sa’ad and Daud felt that they used to fight to death and they used to fight to death for the sake of the Iranian nation.
Nathan says, “It is an individual.”
Then Daud realized that he was in love with Jehovah. — 2 Samayla 12: 1-7, 13.
14
How can I ask God for peace and greetings be upon you and your friends?
14 You can also be safe for Jehovah and you can also be safe for some people to help them.
For example, you can claim that your body is weak.
You will not want to separate the gap between men and women, especially if you are friends with men and women.
You should know that being in a safe and healthy way for Jehova is the most important thing.
Therefore, you should cooperate with God and help God.
Try to tell us that they will not have the right time to do what they are doing.
When he reaches the meeting, he starts with a meeting with you.
If they do this, they will pray to God.
Therefore, your youth should be vigilant in this regard and they should also be able to strengthen their relationship with Jehova.
They shall live in an intelligent and intelligent way. [The Holy Quran, 5: 1].
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on us.
15, 16
Why should Hussein (a.s.) pay attention to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) heart and soul?
15 Hushai is the memory of the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
When the people want to call the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, Hussein (a.s.) wants to be a source of security for Daud and God.
You should know that Absalom achieved Urushalimah, his Army and Daud.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 13] What was Hushai doing?
Did he return to Daud to support the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household?
A.
Of course Daud went through and many people wanted to kill him, and Hussein had a source of security for Daud.
Therefore, Imam Hussein (a.s.) managed to do so in Dutsen Zeitun.
16 Daud referred to Hussay and returned to Urshalem and showed that he supports the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
He took care of DAODA and SAVAK to SAVAK and SAVAK to SAVAK.
Daud prayed to help Hushai and what happened here and there.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 31] The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household was born in Ahithophel.
17
Why should we need sincerity in order to be safe?
We need sincerity and we need to be in favor of the Lord of our servants who should do whatever they like in our home, in our work and in our society.
For example, a cleric who stepped in the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets.
He loves them and is safe with them so that he loves them.
However, when Shahid Sattari (s.a.) read the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), his parents would not allow him to do so.
He used to say that he would be willing to go to the ballot boxes.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "They have been very happy to visit our country for many years.
I prayed to be a divine prayer for the sake of being pure and forgotten.
You should visit them again and again." [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (29, Ayah 25]
18.
How do you benefit from this link?
Daud, Jonathan, Nathan and Hushai trusted God and made them happy. We will be happy even if we act on this path.
We should not be like the believers of Abner and Absalom.
It is obvious that we are pilgrims and we make a mistake.
We should show that it is the most important thing in our life.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (7), Ayah 7] There are certain things that can be done in this regard.
The Importance of Traditions
If there is security and ta'weel, we will be unaware of what Jehovah wants us, and not what we want.
If we are safe and patient, we will ask the people to help them and we will offer them as much as Jehovah wants.
If there is security and sincerity, we will be asking for Jehova or we will be vigilant.
