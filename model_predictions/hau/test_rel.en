Would it be difficult to explain to Jesus why I enjoy the video games I play ? ’
Our love for Jehovah should motivate us to throw away anything that would be inappropriate for a Christian , no matter how much it cost .
( Acts 19 : 19 , 20 ) When we dedicated our life to Jehovah , we promised to use our life to honor Christ .
So we should not keep anything that could make it difficult for us to imitate Jesus. — Matthew 5 : 29 , 30 ; Philippians 4 : 8 .
11 . ( a ) How does our love for Jehovah and Jesus motivate us in the preaching work ? ( b ) How can our love motivate us to help others in the congregation ?
11 Our love for Jesus motivates us to preach and teach with zeal .
( Matthew 28 : 19 , 20 ; Luke 4 : 43 ) During the Memorial season , can you arrange your daily life so that you can auxiliary pioneer and spend 30 or 50 hours in the preaching work ?
One widower who was 84 years old thought that he could not pioneer because of his age and poor health .
But the pioneers in his area wanted to help him .
They provided transportation and chose appropriate territory that he could work .
As a result , the brother reached his goal of 30 hours .
Can you help someone in your congregation to auxiliary pioneer in March or April ?
It is true that not everyone can pioneer , but we can use our time and energy to increase our service to Jehovah .
If we do so , we will show that we , like Paul , are motivated by Jesus ’ love .
What else will God ’ s love move us to do ?
WE ARE OBLIGATED TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER
12 .
God ’ s love motivates us to do what ?
12 Second , God ’ s love should motivate us to love our brothers .
The apostle John wrote : “ Beloved ones , if this is how God loved us , then we are also under obligation to love one another . ” ( 1 John 4 : 7-11 ) So if we accept God ’ s love , we need to love our brothers .
( 1 John 3 : 16 ) How can we show love for them ?
13 .
What example did Jesus set in loving others ?
13 Jesus ’ example shows us how we can love others .
When he was on earth , he helped people , especially the humble ones .
He cured the sick , lame , blind , deaf , and mute .
( Matthew 11 : 4 , 5 ) Unlike the religious leaders , Jesus enjoyed teaching people who wanted to learn about God .
( John 7 : 49 ) He loved those humble people and worked hard to help them. — Matthew 20 : 28 .
Can you help an older brother or sister in the ministry ?
( See paragraph 14 )
14 .
What can you do to show love for your brothers ?
14 The Memorial season is also a good time to think about how you can help the brothers and sisters in your congregation , especially the older ones .
Could you visit these dear ones ?
Could you bring them a meal , help them with chores in the home , offer them a ride to the meeting , or invite them to work with you in the ministry ?
( Read Luke 14 : 12-14 . )
Let God ’ s love motivate you to show love for your brothers !
SHOW MERCY TO OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS
15 .
What must we recognize ?
15 Third , Jehovah ’ s love motivates us to forgive our brothers and sisters .
All of us have inherited sin and death from Adam , so no one can say , “ I do not need the ransom . ”
Even the most faithful servant of God needs the gift of the ransom .
Each of us has been forgiven a huge debt !
Why is it important to recognize that ?
We find the answer in one of Jesus ’ illustrations .
16 , 17 . ( a ) What should we learn from Jesus ’ illustration of the king and the slaves ? ( b ) After meditating on Jesus ’ illustration , what are you determined to do ?
16 Jesus gave an illustration about a king who forgave his slave a huge debt of 60,000,000 denarii .
But later , that slave did not forgive a fellow slave a much smaller debt of only 100 denarii .
The king ’ s mercy should have motivated his slave to forgive a fellow slave .
The king was furious when he heard that his slave did not forgive such a small debt .
He said : “ Wicked slave , I canceled all that debt for you when you pleaded with me .
Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I showed mercy to you ? ”
( Matthew 18 : 23-35 , footnote ) Like the king , Jehovah has forgiven us a huge debt .
What should Jehovah ’ s love and mercy motivate us to do ?
17 As we prepare for the Memorial , we might ask ourselves : ‘ Have I been hurt by a brother ?
Do I find it difficult to forgive him ? ’
If so , this is a good time to imitate Jehovah , who is “ ready to forgive . ”
( Nehemiah 9 : 17 ; Psalm 86 : 5 ) If we appreciate Jehovah ’ s great mercy , we will show mercy to others and forgive them from the heart .
If we do not love and forgive our brothers , we cannot expect Jehovah to love and forgive us .
( Matthew 6 : 14 , 15 ) When we forgive others , it does not change the fact that they hurt us , but it will help us to have a happier future .
18 .
How did God ’ s love help one sister to put up with the imperfections of another sister ?
18 It can be difficult to put up with the imperfections of our brothers and sisters .
( Read Ephesians 4 : 32 ; Colossians 3 : 13 , 14 . )
One sister who did that was Lily . [ 1 ] ( See endnote . )
She helped a widow named Carol .
For example , she drove Carol wherever she needed to go , helped her with necessary shopping , and did many other things for her .
Despite all that Lily did , Carol was always critical , and at times it was not easy to help her .
But Lily focused on Carol ’ s good qualities and helped her for some years until Carol got very sick and died .
Even though helping Carol was difficult for Lily , she says : “ I look forward to seeing Carol in the resurrection .
I want to know her when she is perfect . ”
Clearly , God ’ s love can motivate us to put up with our brothers and sisters and to look forward to the time when human imperfection will be gone forever .
19 .
How will God ’ s “ indescribable free gift ” motivate you ?
19 Jehovah has truly given us an “ indescribable free gift . ”
May we always appreciate it !
The Memorial season is an excellent time to meditate on all that Jehovah and Jesus have done for us .
May their love motivate us to imitate Jesus closely , to show love for our brothers , and to forgive our brothers from the heart .

The Spirit Bears Witness With Our Spirit
“ The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God ’ s children . ” — ROMANS 8 : 16 .
SONGS : 109 , 108
WHAT DO THESE SCRIPTURES TEACH US ABOUT HOW SOMEONE BECOMES ANOINTED ?
2 Corinthians 1 : 21 , 22 ; 2 Peter 1 : 10 , 11
Romans 8 : 15 , 16 ; 1 John 2 : 20 , 27
1-3 .
What events made Pentecost a special day , and how did those events fulfill what the Scriptures had foretold ?
( See opening picture . )
IT WAS Sunday morning in Jerusalem .
This was a special and exciting day .
That morning at the temple , the high priest offered the regular sacrifices .
The high priest waved the loaves from side to side to present them to Jehovah .
This was Pentecost of the year 33 . — Leviticus 23 : 15-20 .
2 Every year , for hundreds of years , the high priest made this wave offering .
The offering was closely related to something very important that happened on Pentecost of the year 33 .
And it happened to 120 disciples of Jesus who were praying together in an upper room in Jerusalem .
( Acts 1 : 13-15 ) Eight hundred years earlier , the prophet Joel had written about this event .
( Joel 2 : 28-32 ; Acts 2 : 16-21 ) What happened that was so important ?
3 Read Acts 2 : 2-4 .
On Pentecost of the year 33 , God gave those Christians his holy spirit , and they were anointed .
( Acts 1 : 8 ) Then , a crowd began to gather around them , and the disciples started to speak about the wonderful things they had just seen and heard .
The apostle Peter explained what had just happened and why it was so important .
Then , he told the crowd : “ Repent , and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins , and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit . ”
That day , about 3,000 people were baptized , and they too received holy spirit. — Acts 2 : 37 , 38 , 41 .
4 . ( a ) Why should we be interested in what happened at Pentecost ? ( b ) What other important event may have happened on the same day many years earlier ?
( See endnote . )
4 What did the high priest and the offering he made every Pentecost represent ?
The high priest represented Jesus .
The loaves represented the anointed disciples of Jesus .
Those disciples have been chosen from among sinful humans and are called “ firstfruits . ”
( James 1 : 18 ) God has accepted these ones as his sons and has chosen them to rule as kings with Jesus in heaven as part of God ’ s Kingdom .
( 1 Peter 2 : 9 ) Jehovah will use his Kingdom to bless all obedient humans .
So whether our home will be in heaven with Jesus or on a paradise earth , Pentecost of the year 33 is very important to us . [ 1 ] — See endnote .
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS ANOINTED ?
5 .
How do we know that not all those who are anointed receive their anointing in exactly the same way ?
5 The disciples in the upper room would never forget that day .
Each of them had what looked like a flame on his head .
Jehovah gave them the ability to speak in a foreign language .
They had no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit .
( Acts 2 : 6-12 ) But these spectacular things do not happen to all Christians when they are anointed .
For example , the Bible does not say that something that looked like a flame appeared on the heads of the thousands in Jerusalem who were anointed later that day .
They were anointed when they were baptized . ( Acts 2 : 38 ) Also , not all Christians are anointed at the time they are baptized .
The Samaritans were anointed sometime after their baptism .
( Acts 8 : 14-17 ) And in an unusual case , Cornelius and those in his house were anointed before they were baptized. — Acts 10 : 44-48 .
6 .
What do all anointed ones receive , and how does this affect them ?
6 Clearly , Christians realize in different ways that they are anointed .
Some may have realized right away that Jehovah anointed them .
Others realized this over a period of time .
But the apostle Paul explained what happens to each one of them . He said : “ After you believed , you were sealed by means of him with the promised holy spirit , which is a token in advance of our inheritance . ”
( Ephesians 1 : 13 , 14 ) So Jehovah uses his holy spirit to make it absolutely clear to these Christians that he has chosen them to go to heaven .
In this way , the holy spirit is “ a token in advance , ” or proof to them that in the future they will live forever in heaven and not on earth. — Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 21 , 22 ; 5 : 5 .
Each anointed Christian must not let anything stop him from serving Jehovah
7 .
What must each anointed Christian do to receive his reward in heaven ?
7 When a Christian is anointed , does it mean that he will definitely receive his reward ?
No .
He is sure that he has been invited to go to heaven .
But he will only be rewarded if he stays faithful to Jehovah .
Peter explained it this way : “ Therefore , brothers , be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves , for if you keep on doing these things , you will by no means ever fail . In fact , in this way you will be richly granted entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . ” ( 2 Peter 1 : 10 , 11 ) So each anointed Christian must not let anything stop him from serving Jehovah .
Even though he has been invited , or called , to go to heaven , if he does not stay faithful , he will not get his reward. — Hebrews 3 : 1 ; Revelation 2 : 10 .
HOW DOES SOMEONE KNOW ?
8 , 9 . ( a ) Why is it difficult for most people to understand what happens when someone is anointed ? ( b ) How does a person know that he has been invited to go to heaven ?
8 Most of God ’ s servants today may find it difficult to understand what happens to someone when God anoints him .
This is normal , because they themselves have not been anointed .
God created humans to live forever on earth , not in heaven .
( Genesis 1 : 28 ; Psalm 37 : 29 ) But Jehovah has chosen some to be kings and priests in heaven .
So when he anoints them , their hope and the way they think change , so that they look forward to life in heaven. — Read Ephesians 1 : 18 .
9 But how does a person know that he or she has been invited to go to heaven ?
Notice what Paul said to the anointed brothers in Rome , who were “ called to be holy ones . ”
He told them : “ You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again , but you received a spirit of adoption as sons , by which spirit we cry out : ‘ Abba , Father ! ’
The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God ’ s children . ”
( Romans 1 : 7 ; 8 : 15 , 16 ) By means of his holy spirit , God makes it clear to someone that he or she is invited to rule as a king in heaven with Jesus. — 1 Thessalonians 2 : 12 .
10 .
What does 1 John 2 : 27 mean when it says that an anointed Christian does not need someone else to teach him ?
10 Those who receive this invitation from God do not need anyone else to tell them that they have been anointed .
Jehovah makes them feel convinced .
The apostle John tells anointed Christians : “ You have an anointing from the holy one , and all of you have knowledge . ”
He also says : “ As for you , the anointing that you received from him remains in you , and you do not need anyone to be teaching you ; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie .
Just as it has taught you , remain in union with him . ” ( 1 John 2 : 20 , 27 ) Anointed Christians need to be taught by Jehovah just like everyone else .
But they do not need anyone to confirm that they are anointed .
Jehovah has used the most powerful force , his holy spirit , to make it absolutely clear to them that they are !
THEY ARE “ BORN AGAIN ”
11 , 12 .
What might an anointed Christian wonder , but what does he never doubt ?
11 When Christians are anointed by holy spirit , they change very much .
In fact , Jesus said that they are “ born again , ” or “ born from above . ”
( John 3 : 3 , 5 ; footnote ) He then explained : “ Do not be amazed because I told you : You people must be born again .
The wind blows where it wants to , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit . ”
( John 3 : 7 , 8 ) Clearly , it is impossible to explain exactly how it feels to be anointed to someone who has not been anointed . [ 2 ] — See endnote .
Someone who has been anointed does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him
12 Someone who has been anointed may wonder , ‘ Why did Jehovah choose me and not someone else ? ’
He may even wonder if he is good enough for this responsibility .
But he does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him .
Instead , he feels extremely happy and is very grateful for such a gift .
Anointed ones feel the way Peter did when he said : “ Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance . It is reserved in the heavens for you . ” ( 1 Peter 1 : 3 , 4 ) When anointed ones read these words , they know without any doubt that their Father is speaking to them personally .
13 .
How does the way a person thinks change when he is anointed by holy spirit , and what causes this change ?
13 Before Jehovah invited these Christians to go to heaven , they had the hope of living forever on earth .
They looked forward to the time when Jehovah would make the earth into a paradise and remove all wickedness .
Perhaps they imagined themselves welcoming back a family member or a friend who died .
And they looked forward to building a home and living in it or planting trees and eating the fruit .
( Isaiah 65 : 21-23 ) Why did they start to think differently ?
Did they change because they felt depressed or suffered a lot ?
Did they suddenly decide that it would be boring to live forever on earth and that they would not be happy here ?
Or did they want to experience what it would be like to live in heaven ?
No .
Instead , God is the one who decided this for them .
When he invited them , he used his holy spirit to change the way that they think and the reward that they look forward to .
14 .
How do anointed ones feel about their life here on earth ?
14 So does this mean that anointed ones want to die ?
Paul described how anointed ones feel . He compared their human body to a “ tent ” and said : “ In fact , we who are in this tent groan , being weighed down , because we do not want to put this one off , but we want to put the other on , so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life . ” ( 2 Corinthians 5 : 4 ) These Christians do not want to die .
They enjoy life and want to use each day to serve Jehovah with their family and friends .
But no matter what they are doing , they remember what God has promised them for the future. — 1 Corinthians 15 : 53 ; 2 Peter 1 : 4 ; 1 John 3 : 2 , 3 ; Revelation 20 : 6 .
HAS JEHOVAH INVITED YOU ?
15 .
What does not prove that a person has been anointed by holy spirit ?
15 Perhaps you are wondering whether Jehovah has invited you to go to heaven .
If you feel that he might have , think about these important questions : Do you feel that you are especially zealous in the preaching work ?
Do you really enjoy studying the Bible and learning “ the deep things of God ” ? ( 1 Corinthians 2 : 10 ) Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful results in the preaching work ?
Do you want to do what Jehovah wants more than anything else ?
Do you have deep love for others and feel a great responsibility to help them serve Jehovah ?
Have you seen proof that Jehovah has helped you in many specific ways in your life ?
If you answer yes to all these questions , does this mean that you have been invited to go to heaven ?
No , it does not .
Why not ?
Because all of God ’ s servants can feel this way , whether they are anointed or not .
And by means of his holy spirit , Jehovah can give the same power to any of his servants , no matter what their reward will be .
In fact , if you are wondering whether you will go to heaven , it means that you have not been invited .
Those chosen by Jehovah do not wonder about this ! They know !
16 .
How do we know that not all those who have received God ’ s spirit have been invited to go to heaven ?
16 In the Bible , there are many examples of faithful ones who received Jehovah ’ s holy spirit but who did not go to heaven .
One example is John the Baptist .
Jesus said that there was no man greater than John , but then he said that John would not rule as a king in heaven .
( Matthew 11 : 10 , 11 ) David too was guided by holy spirit .
( 1 Samuel 16 : 13 ) Holy spirit helped him to understand deep things about Jehovah and also directed him to write parts of the Bible .
( Mark 12 : 36 ) Even so , the apostle Peter said that David “ did not ascend to the heavens . ”
( Acts 2 : 34 ) Jehovah used his holy spirit to give these ones the power to do amazing things , but he did not use it to invite them to live in heaven .
Does that mean that they were not faithful enough or qualified to rule in heaven ?
No .
It simply means that Jehovah will bring them back to life in Paradise on earth. — John 5 : 28 , 29 ; Acts 24 : 15 .
17 , 18 . ( a ) What reward do most of God ’ s servants look forward to today ? ( b ) What questions will we consider in the next article ?
17 Most of God ’ s servants today will not go to heaven .
Like Abraham , David , John the Baptist , and many other men and women in Bible times , they look forward to living on earth when God ’ s government will rule over them .
( Hebrews 11 : 10 ) There will be 144,000 ruling with Jesus in heaven .
But the Bible speaks of “ the remaining ones ” of the anointed who are still on earth in this time of the end .
( Revelation 12 : 17 ) So most of the 144,000 have already died and are in heaven .
18 But if someone says that he is anointed , how should those who have the hope of living on earth react ?
If someone in your congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should you treat him ?
And what if the number of those who say that they are anointed keeps growing ?
We will answer these questions in the next article .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 4 ) The Festival of Pentecost was possibly celebrated at the same time of the year that the Law was given to Moses at Sinai .
( Exodus 19 : 1 ) So perhaps Moses brought the nation of Israel into the Law covenant on the same day of the year that Jesus brought anointed ones into the new covenant .
[ 2 ] ( paragraph 11 ) For more explanation of what it means to be born again , see The Watchtower , April 1 , 2009 , pages 3-11 .
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
Anointed by holy spirit : Jehovah uses his holy spirit to invite a person to rule with Jesus in heaven .
By means of his spirit , he gives that person a promise for the future , or “ a token in advance . ”
These Christians can say that the holy spirit “ bears witness , ” or makes clear , to them that their reward is in heaven
“ We Want to Go With You ”
“ We want to go with you , for we have heard that God is with you people . ” — ZECHARIAH 8 : 23 .
SONGS : 65 , 122
CAN YOU EXPLAIN ?
How is Zechariah 8 : 23 being fulfilled ?
How should anointed Christians feel about themselves ? — 1 Corinthians 4 : 6-8 .
Why should we not be worried about the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial ? — Romans 9 : 11 , 16 .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What did Jehovah say would happen in our time ? ( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?
( See opening picture . )
JEHOVAH said that in our time , “ ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold , yes , they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew , saying : ‘ We want to go with you , for we have heard that God is with you people . ’ ”
( Zechariah 8 : 23 ) The “ Jew ” represents those whom God has anointed by holy spirit .
They are also called “ the Israel of God . ”
( Galatians 6 : 16 ) The “ ten men ” represent those who have the hope of living forever on earth .
They know that Jehovah has blessed this group of anointed ones and feel that it is an honor to worship him with them .
2 Like the prophet Zechariah , Jesus said that God ’ s people would be united .
He described those who look forward to living in heaven as a “ little flock ” and those who look forward to living on earth as “ other sheep . ”
But Jesus said that they would all be “ one flock ” and would follow him , their “ one shepherd . ”
( Luke 12 : 32 ; John 10 : 16 ) Since there are two groups , some may wonder : ( 1 ) Do the other sheep need to know the names of all today who are anointed ? ( 2 ) How should anointed ones think of themselves ? ( 3 ) If someone in my congregation starts to eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial , how should I treat him ? ( 4 ) Do I need to worry when I see the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial going up ?
This article will answer these questions .
DO WE NEED TO KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL TODAY WHO ARE ANOINTED ?
3 .
Why is it not possible for us to know for sure who will be part of the 144,000 ?
3 Do the other sheep need to know the names of all anointed ones still on earth today ?
No .
Why not ?
Because it is not possible for anyone to know for sure that these ones will get their reward . [ 1 ] ( See endnote . )
Even though God has invited them to go to heaven , they will receive their reward only if they remain faithful .
Satan knows this , and he uses “ false prophets ” to try “ to mislead ” them .
( Matthew 24 : 24 ) Anointed Christians cannot be sure that they will receive their reward until Jehovah makes it clear to them that he has judged them as faithful .
Jehovah gives this final approval , or final sealing , either before they die or just before the start of “ the great tribulation . ” — Revelation 2 : 10 ; 7 : 3 , 14 .
Jesus is our Leader , and we must follow only him
4 .
If it is not possible to know the names of all anointed ones on earth today , how can we “ go with ” them ?
4 If it is not possible to know the names of all anointed ones on earth today , how can the other sheep “ go with ” them ?
The Bible says that the “ ten men ” would “ take firm hold of the robe of a Jew , saying : ‘ We want to go with you , for we have heard that God is with you people . ’ ”
The Bible verse mentions one Jew .
But “ you ” and “ you people ” refer to more than one person .
This means that the Jew is not just one person but represents the whole group of anointed ones .
The other sheep know this , and they serve Jehovah along with that group .
They do not need to know the names of every member of that group and follow each one of them .
Jesus is our Leader , and the Bible tells us we must follow only him. — Matthew 23 : 10 .
HOW SHOULD ANOINTED ONES THINK OF THEMSELVES ?
5 .
What warning should anointed ones think seriously about , and why ?
5 Anointed ones should think seriously about the warning found at 1 Corinthians 11 : 27-29 .
( Read . )
How might an anointed one eat the bread and drink the wine “ unworthily ” at the Memorial ?
If he does not keep a good relationship with Jehovah and is unfaithful to him , then when that person eats the bread and drinks the wine , he is being disrespectful .
( Hebrews 6 : 4-6 ; 10 : 26-29 ) This strong warning reminds anointed ones that they must stay faithful if they want to receive “ the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus . ” — Philippians 3 : 13-16 .
6 .
How should anointed Christians feel about themselves ?
6 Paul told anointed Christians : “ I , the prisoner in the Lord , appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called . ”
How should they do this ?
Paul explained : “ With all humility and mildness , with patience , putting up with one another in love , earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace . ”
( Ephesians 4 : 1-3 ) Jehovah ’ s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble , not proud .
( Colossians 3 : 12 ) So anointed ones do not think that they are better than others .
They know that Jehovah does not necessarily give anointed ones more holy spirit than he gives his other servants .
And they do not feel that they can understand Bible truths more deeply than anyone else .
They would also never tell someone else that he too has been anointed and should start eating the bread and drinking the wine at the Memorial .
Instead , they are humble and know that only Jehovah can invite people to go to heaven .
7 , 8 .
What do anointed Christians not expect , and why ?
7 Although anointed ones feel that it is an honor to be invited to go to heaven , they do not expect others to treat them in a special way .
( Ephesians 1 : 18 , 19 ; read Philippians 2 : 2 , 3 . )
They also know that when Jehovah anointed them , he did not let everyone else know about it .
So an anointed person is not surprised if some do not believe right away that he has been anointed .
He realizes that the Bible tells us not to be quick to believe someone who says that God has given him a special responsibility .
( Revelation 2 : 2 ) Because an anointed person does not expect others to give him too much attention , he would not tell those he meets for the first time that he is anointed .
In fact , he would probably not mention this to anyone .
He would also not boast about the wonderful things he will do in heaven. — 1 Corinthians 1 : 28 , 29 ; read 1 Corinthians 4 : 6-8 .
8 Anointed Christians do not feel that they should spend time only with other anointed ones , as if they were members of a club .
They do not try to find other anointed ones so that they can talk about being anointed or meet in groups to study the Bible .
( Galatians 1 : 15-17 ) The congregation would not be united if anointed ones did this .
They would be working against the holy spirit , which helps God ’ s people to have peace and unity. — Read Romans 16 : 17 , 18 .
HOW SHOULD YOU TREAT THEM ?
9 .
Why do you need to be careful about the way you treat those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial ?
( See the box “ Love ‘ Does Not Behave Indecently . ’ ” )
9 How should you treat anointed brothers and sisters ?
Jesus told his disciples : “ All of you are brothers . ”
He continued : “ Whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
( Matthew 23 : 8-12 ) So it would be wrong to admire a person too much , even if he is an anointed brother of Christ .
When the Bible speaks of the elders , it encourages us to imitate their faith , but it does not tell us that we can make any human our leader .
( Hebrews 13 : 7 ) It is true that the Bible says that some are “ worthy of double honor . ”
But this is because they “ preside in a fine way ” and “ work hard in speaking and teaching , ” not because they are anointed .
( 1 Timothy 5 : 17 ) If we give anointed ones too much praise and attention , we would embarrass them .
Or even worse , we could cause them to become proud .
( Romans 12 : 3 ) None of us want to do anything that might cause one of Christ ’ s anointed brothers to make such a serious mistake ! — Luke 17 : 2 .
How should you treat someone who eats the bread and drinks the wine at the Memorial ?
( See paragraphs 9-11 )
10 .
How can you show that you respect anointed Christians ?
10 How can we show that we respect those who are anointed by Jehovah ?
We would not ask them how they became anointed .
This is a personal matter , which we do not have the right to know .
( 1 Thessalonians 4 : 11 ; 2 Thessalonians 3 : 11 ) And we should not think that their husband or wife , their parents , or other family members are also anointed .
A person does not inherit his hope from his family .
( 1 Thessalonians 2 : 12 ) We should also avoid asking questions that could hurt others .
For example , we would not ask the wife of an anointed brother how she feels about living forever on earth without her husband .
After all , we can be absolutely sure that in the new world , Jehovah will “ satisfy the desire of every living thing . ” — Psalm 145 : 16 .
11 .
How do we protect ourselves if we avoid “ admiring personalities ” ?
11 If we do not treat anointed ones as more important than others , we also protect ourselves .
How ?
The Bible tells us that there might be “ false brothers ” in the congregation who may even say that they are anointed .
( Galatians 2 : 4 , 5 ; 1 John 2 : 19 ) Also , some anointed ones might not stay faithful .
( Matthew 25 : 10-12 ; 2 Peter 2 : 20 , 21 ) But if we avoid “ admiring personalities , ” we will never follow others , even those who are anointed or well-known or those who have served Jehovah for a long time .
Then , if they become unfaithful or leave the congregation , we will not lose our faith in Jehovah or stop serving him. — Jude 16 , footnote .
DO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE NUMBER ?
12 , 13 .
Why should we not worry about the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial ?
12 For many years , the number of those who ate the bread and drank the wine at the Memorial kept going down .
But recently , that number has been going up every year .
Do we need to worry about this ?
No .
Let us see why not .
13 “ Jehovah knows those who belong to him . ” ( 2 Timothy 2 : 19 ) Unlike Jehovah , the brothers who count the number of people eating the bread and drinking the wine at the Memorial do not know who truly is anointed .
So the number includes those who think that they are anointed but are not .
For example , some who used to eat the bread and drink the wine later stopped .
Others may have mental or emotional problems and believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven .
Clearly , we do not know exactly how many anointed ones are left on earth .
14 .
What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones who will be on earth when the great tribulation starts ?
14 There will be anointed ones in many parts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven .
The Bible says that Jesus “ will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound , and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds , from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity . ”
( Matthew 24 : 31 ) The Bible also shows that during the last days , there will be a small number of anointed ones left on earth .
( Revelation 12 : 17 ) But it does not say how many of them will be left when the great tribulation begins .
15 , 16 .
What do we need to understand about the 144,000 chosen by Jehovah ?
15 Jehovah decides when he will choose anointed ones .
( Romans 8 : 28-30 ) Jehovah began choosing anointed ones after Jesus was resurrected .
It seems that in the first century , all true Christians were anointed .
For hundreds of years after that , most of those who said that they were Christians did not really follow Christ .
Even so , during those years , Jehovah anointed those few who were true Christians .
They were like the wheat that Jesus said would grow among the weeds .
( Matthew 13 : 24-30 ) During the last days , Jehovah has continued to choose people who will be part of the 144,000 . [ 2 ] ( See endnote . )
So if God decides to choose some of these just before the end , surely we would not doubt that he is doing the right thing .
( Isaiah 45 : 9 ; Daniel 4 : 35 ; read Romans 9 : 11 , 16 . ) [ 3 ] ( See endnote . )
We must be careful not to react like the workers who complained about the way their master treated those who started working in the last hour. — Read Matthew 20 : 8-15 .
16 Not all who have the hope of living in heaven are part of “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
( Matthew 24 : 45-47 ) Just as in the first century , Jehovah and Jesus today are using a few people to feed , or teach , many .
Only a few anointed Christians in the first century were used to write the Christian Greek Scriptures .
And today , only a few anointed Christians have the responsibility to give God ’ s people “ food at the proper time . ”
17 .
What have you learned from this article ?
17 What have we learned from this article ?
Jehovah has decided to give everlasting life on earth to most of his people and life in heaven to those who will rule with Jesus .
Jehovah rewards all of his servants , the “ Jew ” and the “ ten men , ” and he requires them to obey the same laws and stay faithful .
All must stay humble .
All must serve him together and be united .
And all must work to keep the peace in the congregation .
As we get closer to the end , let us all keep serving Jehovah and following Christ as one flock .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 3 ) According to Psalm 87 : 5 , 6 , in the future , God may reveal the names of all those who are ruling with Jesus in heaven. — Romans 8 : 19 .
[ 2 ] ( paragraph 15 ) Although Acts 2 : 33 shows that Jesus is involved when someone is anointed , Jehovah is the one who invites that person .
[ 3 ] ( paragraph 15 ) For more information , see “ Questions From Readers ” in The Watchtower , May 1 , 2007 , pages 30-31 .
Love “ Does Not Behave Indecently ”
Love is not jealous . It does not brag , does not get puffed up , does not behave indecently , does not look for its own interests . ” ( 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 5 ) We “ behave indecently ” if we are rude , have bad manners , and do not show others that we respect them .
Instead , when we love our brothers , we think about their feelings before we say or do something .
We can show that we love those taking the lead in Jehovah ’ s organization by the way we treat them .
At times , well-known brothers might visit our congregation or the convention we attend . They may be circuit overseers , Bethelites , members of the Branch Committee , members of the Governing Body , or helpers to the Governing Body .
Naturally , we want to show them and their wives respect , and this is good .
We do not want to be like Diotrephes , who did not welcome the brothers visiting his congregation because he did not respect them .
( 3 John 9 , 10 ) But even if we welcome these brothers , could it be that we are still not showing them respect ?
How might this happen ?
Although we enjoy meeting and talking with the brothers and sisters who visit us , we would not show them respect if we treated them as celebrities .
For example , would it show good manners if we take photos of them without their permission or when they are not aware of it , perhaps when they are eating or doing something else ?
Would we ask them to sign our books and Bibles ?
Would we push in front of others and insist that we have a photo taken with them ?
What effect could such behavior have on those attending one of our conventions for the first time ?
Surely , if we love our brothers and sisters , we would not do anything like this .
Instead , we show them respect because we understand why they are visiting us and how hard they work for us .
What will help us to know how to treat our brothers ?
First , remember that we should give glory to Jehovah .
( Revelation 4 : 11 ) Second , realize that while it is good to respect these brothers and their wives , we would not want to treat them as celebrities .
They want to be treated as our brothers and sisters .
( Matthew 23 : 8 ) Third , remember what Jesus taught us : “ All things , therefore , that you want men to do to you , you also must do to them . ”
( Matthew 7 : 12 ) If we remember these things , we will show love and “ not behave indecently . ”
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
The ten men “ go with ” the Jew : The other sheep serve Jehovah with anointed ones but do not think of them as their leaders or give them too much praise and attention .
Instead , the other sheep love and respect anointed ones and treat them as their brothers and sisters
Working Together With God — A Cause for Rejoicing
“ Working together with him , we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose . ” — 2 CORINTHIANS 6 : 1 .
SONGS : 75 , 74
WHY CAN IT BE SAID THAT THE PREACHING WORK . . .
brings us happiness ?
draws us closer to God and to others ?
is a protection for us ?
1 .
Even though Jehovah is the Supreme One , what has he invited others to do ?
JEHOVAH is the Supreme One .
He created everything , and he has unlimited wisdom and power .
After he helped Job understand this , Job said to him : “ I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you . ”
( Job 42 : 2 ) Jehovah can do whatever he decides to do without help from anyone .
But he shows love by inviting others to work together with him to accomplish his purpose .
2 .
What important work did Jehovah invite Jesus to do ?
2 God created his Son , Jesus , before he created everyone and everything else .
Then , Jehovah allowed his Son to help him create all other things .
( John 1 : 1-3 , 18 ) The apostle Paul wrote about Jesus : “ By means of him all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth , the things visible and the things invisible , whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities . All other things have been created through him and for him . ”
( Colossians 1 : 15-17 ) So Jehovah not only gave his Son an important work but told others about it .
What an honor !
3 .
What did Jehovah invite Adam to do , and why ?
3 Jehovah also invited humans to work together with him .
For example , he allowed Adam to name the animals .
( Genesis 2 : 19 , 20 ) Imagine the joy Adam felt doing this work !
He carefully studied the way the animals looked and acted , and then he chose a name for each one of them .
Jehovah had created all the animals , so he could have named them himself .
However , he showed Adam how much he loved him by allowing him to name the animals .
( Genesis 1 : 27 , 28 ) But Adam eventually decided to stop working with God , and the result was great suffering for him and all his descendants. — Genesis 3 : 17-19 , 23 .
4 .
How did others work with God to accomplish his will ?
4 Later , God invited other people to work with him .
Noah built an ark that kept him and his family alive during the Flood .
Moses freed the nation of Israel from Egypt .
Joshua led the Israelites into the Promised Land .
Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem .
Mary became mother to Jesus .
All these faithful ones and many others worked with Jehovah to accomplish his will .
5 .
In what work can we share , and did Jehovah need to involve us in this work ?
( See opening picture . )
5 Today , Jehovah invites us to do all we can to support his Kingdom .
There are many ways we can serve God .
And even though not all of us are able to serve him in the same way , we can all preach the good news of the Kingdom . Jehovah could have done this work by himself .
He could have spoken directly from heaven to people on earth .
Jesus said that Jehovah could even make the stones tell others about the King of His Kingdom .
( Luke 19 : 37-40 ) But Jehovah allows us to be his “ fellow workers . ” ( 1 Corinthians 3 : 9 ) The apostle Paul wrote : “ Working together with him , we also urge you not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose . ” ( 2 Corinthians 6 : 1 ) It is a great honor to be invited to work with God .
Let us see some reasons why this brings us great joy .
WORKING WITH GOD MAKES US HAPPY
6 .
How did God ’ s firstborn Son describe how he felt about working beside his Father ?
6 Working with God has always made Jehovah ’ s servants happy .
Before coming to earth , God ’ s firstborn Son said : “ Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way . . .
I was beside him as a master worker . I was the one he was especially fond of day by day ; I rejoiced before him all the time . ”
( Proverbs 8 : 22 , 30 ) When Jesus worked with his Father , he was happy because he accomplished many things and he knew that Jehovah loved him .
But what about us ?
What could be more satisfying than teaching someone the truth ? ( See paragraph 7 )
7 .
Why does the preaching work bring us joy ?
7 Jesus said that we are happy both when we give and when we receive .
( Acts 20 : 35 ) It brought us joy when we received the truth , but why does it also bring us joy to share the truth with others ?
Because we see them become truly happy when they understand what the Bible teaches and begin to have a relationship with God . We are excited to see them change their thinking and their way of life .
The preaching work is the most important and the most satisfying work we could be doing .
It makes it possible for those who become God ’ s friends to have everlasting life. — 2 Corinthians 5 : 20 .
8 .
What have some said about the joy of working with Jehovah ?
8 When we help others learn about God , we know that we are pleasing Jehovah and that he values our efforts to serve him .
This also gives us joy .
( Read 1 Corinthians 15 : 58 . )
Marco , who lives in Italy , says : “ I have the priceless joy of knowing that I am giving my best to Jehovah and not to someone who will soon forget what I ’ ve done . ”
Similarly , Franco , who also serves in Italy , says : “ By means of his Word and his spiritual provisions , Jehovah reminds us every day that he loves us and that everything we do for him is important , even though our efforts may seem like nothing to us .
This is why working along with God makes me happy and gives my life meaning . ”
WORKING WITH GOD DRAWS US CLOSER TO HIM AND TO OTHERS
9 .
What relationship existed between Jehovah and Jesus , and why ?
9 When we work together with those we love , we draw close to them .
We come to know more about their personality and their qualities .
We learn what their goals are and how they try to reach them .
Jesus worked with Jehovah for perhaps billions of years .
Their love and affection for each other became so strong that nothing could destroy their relationship .
Jesus explained how close that relationship was when he said : “ I and the Father are one . ”
( John 10 : 30 ) They were truly united , and they fully cooperated when they worked together .
Preaching strengthens our faith because it reminds us of God ’ s promises and loving standards
10 .
Why does preaching draw us closer to God and to others ?
10 Jesus asked Jehovah to protect his disciples .
Why ?
He prayed : “ So that they may be one just as we are one . ”
( John 17 : 11 ) When we live by God ’ s standards and share in the preaching work , we better understand his wonderful qualities .
We learn why it is wise to trust in him and to follow his direction .
And when we draw close to God , he draws close to us .
( Read James 4 : 8 . )
We also draw close to our brothers and sisters because we experience similar problems and joys and because we have the same goals .
We work together , rejoice together , and endure together .
Octavia , who lives in Britain , says : “ Working with Jehovah draws me closer to others . ”
She explains that it is because her friendships are now based on “ a common goal and direction . ”
Surely , we feel the same way .
When we see the efforts our brothers make to please Jehovah , it draws us closer to them .
11 .
Why will we draw even closer to Jehovah and to our brothers in the new world ?
11 Our love for God and our brothers is strong now , but it will be even stronger in the new world .
Think of all the exciting work we will do in the future !
We will welcome back those who are resurrected and teach them about Jehovah .
We will also work to make the earth into a paradise .
It will be a great joy to work together and gradually become perfect under Christ ’ s rule .
All humans will draw even closer to one another and to Jehovah , who will surely “ satisfy the desire of every living thing . ” — Psalm 145 : 16 .
WORKING WITH GOD IS A PROTECTION
12 .
How is the preaching work a protection ?
12 We need to protect our relationship with Jehovah .
We live in Satan ’ s world and we are imperfect , so it is easy for us to start thinking and acting like the world .
It is like swimming in a river with a current that pulls us in a direction we do not want to go .
So we must use all our strength to swim in the other direction .
Similarly , we need to work hard to avoid being influenced by Satan ’ s world .
So how does preaching protect us ?
When we talk about Jehovah and the Bible , we focus on things that are important and good , not on things that will weaken our faith .
( Philippians 4 : 8 ) Preaching strengthens our faith because it reminds us of God ’ s promises and loving standards .
It also helps us to maintain the qualities we need in order to protect ourselves from Satan and his world. — Read Ephesians 6 : 14-17 .
When we keep busy in Jehovah ’ s work , we do not have time to worry too much about our own problems
13 .
How does one Witness in Australia feel about preaching ?
13 When we keep busy preaching , studying , and doing things for others in the congregation , we are protected because we do not have time to worry too much about our own problems .
Joel , who lives in Australia , says : “ The preaching work helps me not to lose touch with reality . It reminds me of the challenges people are facing and of the benefits I have experienced by applying Bible principles in my life .
The preaching work helps me to try to stay humble ; it gives me an opportunity to rely on Jehovah and on my brothers and sisters . ”
14 .
Why does our perseverance in preaching show that God ’ s spirit is with us ?
14 Preaching also gives us more confidence that God ’ s spirit is with us .
To illustrate : Imagine that it is your job to give bread to the people in your community .
You do not get paid to do this , and you have to pay for your expenses .
Also , most people do not want the bread , and some even hate you for bringing it to them .
How long would you continue to work at such a job ?
Very soon , you would feel discouraged , and you would probably quit .
Yet , many of us continue in the preaching work year after year , even though this costs us time and money and even though people make fun of us or get angry with us .
This proves that God ’ s spirit is helping us .
WORKING WITH GOD SHOWS OUR LOVE FOR HIM AND FOR OTHERS
15 .
How is the preaching of the good news connected with God ’ s purpose for humankind ?
15 How is the preaching work connected with Jehovah ’ s purpose for mankind ?
God ’ s purpose was that humans live forever , and his purpose did not change when Adam sinned .
( Isaiah 55 : 11 ) God made an arrangement for us to be freed from sin and death .
How ?
Jesus came to earth and sacrificed his life .
But to benefit from his sacrifice , humans needed to obey God .
So Jesus taught people what God requires of them , and he commanded his disciples to do the same .
When we preach and help others to become God ’ s friends today , we are working directly with God in his loving arrangement to save humans from sin and death .
16 .
How is our preaching linked to God ’ s greatest commandments ?
16 When we help others find the way to everlasting life , we show that we love them and we love Jehovah .
His “ will is that all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth . ” ( 1 Timothy 2 : 4 ) When a Pharisee asked Jesus what was God ’ s greatest commandment , Jesus said : “ ‘ You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind . ’
This is the greatest and first commandment .
The second , like it , is this : ‘ You must love your neighbor as yourself . ’ ”
( Matthew 22 : 37-39 ) By preaching the good news , we obey these commandments. — Read Acts 10 : 42 .
17 .
How do you feel about the honor to preach the good news ?
17 How blessed we are !
Jehovah has given us a work that brings us joy , that draws us closer to him and to our brothers , and that protects our relationship with him .
It also gives us the opportunity to show our love for God and for others .
Jehovah has millions of servants around the world , and all of them have very different circumstances .
But whether we are young or old , rich or poor , strong or weak , we do all we can to share our faith with others . We feel like Chantel from France , who says : “ The most powerful Person in the universe , the Creator of all things , the happy God , says to me : ‘ Go !
Speak ! Speak for me , speak from your heart .
I give you my strength , my Word the Bible , heavenly support , earthly companions , progressive training , and precise instructions at the appropriate time . ’
What an immense privilege it is to do what Jehovah asks of us and to work together with our God ! ”
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
We are working together with God when we preach to others and help them to become his friends so that they can live forever .
Even though God could do this work by himself , he shows us love by inviting us to work with him .
This work makes us happy , protects us , and draws us closer to Jehovah and to one another

LIFE STORY
Jehovah Has Given Me Success in His Service
As told by Corwin Robison
I told the officer that I had already been in prison because I would not fight .
I asked him , “ Are you going to make me go through that again ? ”
This was the second time I was ordered to join the United States Army .
I WAS born in 1926 in Crooksville , Ohio , in the United States .
Father and Mother were not religious , but they told us eight children to go to church .
I went to the Methodist Church .
When I was 14 , the minister gave me a prize because I went to church every Sunday for a year .
Margaret Walker ( second sister from the left ) helped me learn the truth
About that time , a neighbor named Margaret Walker , one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses , began visiting my mother and talking to her about the Bible .
One day , I decided to join them .
Mother thought that I would interfere with her study , so she told me to get out of the house .
But I kept trying to listen to their discussions .
After a couple more visits , Margaret asked me , “ Do you know what God ’ s name is ? ”
I said , “ Everyone knows that — it ’ s God . ”
She said , “ Get your Bible and look up Psalm 83 : 18 . ”
I did , and I discovered that God ’ s name is Jehovah .
I ran out to my friends and told them , “ When you get home tonight , look up Psalm 83 : 18 in the Bible and see what God ’ s name is . ”
You might say I started witnessing right away .
I studied the Bible and got baptized in 1941 .
Soon afterward , I was assigned to conduct a congregation book study .
I encouraged my mother and siblings to come , and they all began attending the book study that I conducted .
Dad , though , was not interested .
OPPOSITION AT HOME
I was given more responsibility in the congregation , and I collected many books published by Jehovah ’ s Witnesses .
One day , Dad pointed to my books and said : “ You see all that stuff ?
I want it out of this house , and you can go with it . ”
I left home and went to live in nearby Zanesville , Ohio , but I traveled back and forth to encourage my family .
Dad tried to stop Mother from attending the meetings .
Sometimes when she was on her way , he chased after her and pulled her back into the house .
But she would just run out the other door and go to the meeting .
I told Mother : “ Don ’ t worry .
He ’ ll get tired of running after you . ”
In time , Dad gave up trying to stop her , and she attended the meetings freely .
When the Theocratic Ministry School began in 1943 , I started giving student talks in my congregation .
The counsel I received after my parts on the school helped me to become a better speaker .
NEUTRALITY DURING WAR
In 1944 , during World War II , I was ordered to join the army .
I reported to Fort Hayes in Columbus , Ohio , had a physical examination , and filled out paperwork .
I also told the officials that I would not become a soldier .
They let me go home .
But a few days later , an officer came to my door and told me , “ Corwin Robison , I have a warrant for your arrest . ”
In court two weeks later , the judge said : “ If it were up to me , I ’ d give you a life sentence .
Do you have anything to say ? ”
I replied : “ Your Honor , I should have been classified as a minister .
Everyone ’ s doorstep is my pulpit , and I have preached the good news of the Kingdom to many people . ”
The judge told the jury : “ You are not here to decide whether this young man is a minister or not .
You are here to decide whether he reported for induction into the army or not . ”
In less than half an hour , the jury decided that I was guilty .
The judge sentenced me to five years in prison in Ashland , Kentucky .
JEHOVAH PROTECTS ME IN PRISON
I spent the first two weeks in a prison in Columbus , Ohio , and I stayed in my cell the first day .
I prayed to Jehovah : “ I cannot stay in a cell for five years .
I don ’ t know what to do . ”
The next day , the guards let me out .
I walked over to a tall , broad-shouldered prisoner , and we stood there looking out a window .
He asked me , “ What are you in for , Shorty ? ”
I said , “ I am one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . ”
He said , “ You are ?
So why are you here ? ”
I said , “ Jehovah ’ s Witnesses don ’ t go to war and kill people . ”
He said , “ They put you in prison because you won ’ t kill people .
They put other guys in prison because they kill people .
Does that make sense ? ”
I said , “ No , it doesn ’ t . ”
Then he said , “ For 15 years I was in another prison , where I read some of your literature . ”
When I heard that , I prayed , “ Jehovah , help me get this man on my side . ”
At that moment , the prisoner , whose name was Paul , said : “ If any of these guys touch you , just yell .
I ’ ll take care of them . ”
So while I was there , I had no problems with the 50 prisoners in that section .
I was among the Witnesses imprisoned for neutrality at Ashland , Kentucky
When the officials moved me to the prison in Ashland , I met some mature brothers who were already there .
They helped me and others to remain close to Jehovah .
They assigned us a weekly Bible reading , and we prepared questions and answers for meetings that we called Bible Bees .
We were in a large cell that had beds along the walls .
There was a brother who would organize our territory .
He would tell me : “ Robison , you are responsible for bed such and such .
Anyone assigned to that bed is your territory .
Make sure you witness to him before he leaves . ”
That is how we preached in an organized way .
WHAT I FOUND OUTSIDE OF PRISON
World War II ended in 1945 , but I stayed in prison for some time after that .
I worried about my family because Dad had told me , “ If I can get rid of you , I can handle the rest . ” After my release , I had a pleasant surprise .
Seven in my family were attending meetings and one of my sisters was baptized , despite Dad ’ s opposition .
Going out in the ministry with Demetrius Papageorge , an anointed brother who began serving Jehovah in 1913
When the Korean War began in 1950 , I was ordered to join the army a second time . I was told to report to Fort Hayes again .
After testing my abilities , an officer told me , “ You had one of the highest scores in your group . ”
I said , “ That ’ s fine , but I am not going into the army . ”
I quoted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a soldier of Christ . ”
After a long silence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
Soon afterward , I attended the Bethel meeting at a convention in Cincinnati , Ohio .
Brother Milton Henschel told us that there was a need at Bethel for brothers who wanted to work hard for the Kingdom .
I applied for Bethel service and was accepted .
I started serving in Brooklyn in August 1954 , and I have been at Bethel ever since .
I have always had a lot of work at Bethel .
For several years , I operated the boilers in the printery and the office buildings , worked as a machinist , and repaired locks .
I also worked at Assembly Halls in New York City .
Caring for the boilers in the office buildings at Brooklyn Bethel
I love the programs at Bethel , such as morning worship and the family Watchtower Study , as well as preaching with the congregation .
When you think about it , these are things that any family of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses should be doing regularly .
When parents and children consider the daily text together , have regular Family Worship sessions , participate in the congregation meetings , and are zealous for preaching the good news , all in the family will likely remain close to Jehovah .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
Some were of the anointed and have gone to heaven .
Others were not anointed .
But all of Jehovah ’ s servants are imperfect , including Bethelites .
If I have an argument with a brother , I always try to make peace .
I think of Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 and how we should handle our disagreements .
It is not easy to say “ I am sorry , ” but most disagreements are solved this way .
GOOD RESULTS FROM MY SERVICE
Now I have a hard time preaching from door to door because of my age , but I have not given up .
I have learned a little Mandarin Chinese and enjoy approaching Chinese people on the street .
Some mornings I place 30 or 40 magazines with interested ones .
Preaching to the Chinese people in Brooklyn , New York
I have even made a return visit in China !
One day , a nice young girl smiled at me as she passed out advertisements for a fruit stand .
I smiled and offered her The Watchtower and Awake ! in Chinese .
She took them and told me that her name was Katie .
After that , whenever she saw me , Katie came over to talk to me .
I taught her the names of fruits and vegetables in English , and she repeated the words after me .
I also explained Bible texts to her , and she accepted the Bible Teach book .
After some weeks , though , she disappeared .
Months later , I offered the magazines to another girl who was passing out advertisements , and she accepted them .
The next week , she handed me her cell phone and said , “ You talk to China . ”
I said , “ I don ’ t know anybody in China . ”
But she insisted , so I took the phone and said , “ Hello , this is Robison . ”
The voice at the other end said , “ Robby , this is Katie .
I ’ m back in China . ”
I said , “ China ? ”
Katie answered , “ Yes .
Robby , you know that girl who handed you the phone ? She ’ s my sister .
You taught me many good things .
Please teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ Katie , I will do the best I can .
Thanks for letting me know where you are . ”
Soon afterward , I spoke to Katie ’ s sister for the last time .
Wherever those two girls are now , I hope that they learn more about Jehovah .
I have served Jehovah for 73 years , and I am happy that he helped me to remain neutral and to be faithful in prison .
Also , my siblings tell me that they were encouraged when I faced Dad ’ s opposition without giving up .
Eventually , Mother and six of my brothers and sisters got baptized .
Even Dad ’ s attitude changed a little , and he attended some meetings before he passed away .
If it is God ’ s will , my family members and friends who have died will return to life in the new world .
Imagine our joy as we worship Jehovah forever with those whom we love ! * — See footnote .

HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
How did knowledge and experience strengthen Abraham ’ s faith ?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his friendship with God ?
How can you imitate Abraham in building a friendship with Jehovah ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) How do we know that humans can become God ’ s friends ? ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
FROM the moment we are born to the moment we die , we need love .
Humans need close and loving friendships , not just romantic love .
But most of all , we need love from Jehovah .
Many people do not believe that humans can have a close and loving friendship with God because he is invisible and almighty .
But we know the truth !
2 We know from the Bible that humans have become God ’ s friends .
We should learn from their examples .
Why ?
Because friendship with God is the most important goal we can have in life .
So let us consider the example of Abraham .
( Read James 2 : 23 . )
How did he become God ’ s friend ?
Abraham ’ s close friendship with God was based on faith , and he is known as “ the father of all those having faith . ”
( Romans 4 : 11 ) As you consider his example , ask yourself , ‘ How can I imitate Abraham ’ s faith and strengthen my friendship with Jehovah ? ’
HOW DID ABRAHAM BECOME JEHOVAH ’ S FRIEND ?
3 , 4 . ( a ) Describe what was likely Abraham ’ s greatest test of faith . ( b ) Why was Abraham willing to sacrifice Isaac ?
3 Imagine Abraham at about 125 years of age walking slowly up a mountain . [ 1 ] ( See endnote . )
Behind him was his son Isaac , who was about 25 years old .
Isaac carried firewood , and Abraham carried a knife and the things needed to start a fire .
That journey was probably the hardest trip of Abraham ’ s life .
But it was not because of his old age .
He still had a lot of energy .
Instead , that journey was difficult because Jehovah had asked him to sacrifice his son ! — Genesis 22 : 1-8 .
Abraham did not blindly obey God , that is , obey him without thinking 4 That was probably the greatest test of Abraham ’ s faith .
Some people say that God was cruel for asking Abraham to sacrifice his son .
And others say that Abraham was willing to do this because he did not love his son .
People say such things because they do not have faith and do not know what true faith is or how it works .
( 1 Corinthians 2 : 14-16 ) But Abraham did not blindly obey God , that is , obey him without thinking .
He obeyed because he had true faith .
He knew that Jehovah would never ask him to do anything that would cause permanent harm .
Abraham knew that if he obeyed , Jehovah would bless him and his dear son .
What did Abraham need in order to have such strong faith ?
He needed knowledge and experience .
5 .
How may Abraham have learned about Jehovah , and how did that knowledge make him feel ?
5 Knowledge .
Abraham grew up in a city called Ur .
People there worshipped false gods , and his father did too .
( Joshua 24 : 2 ) So how did Abraham learn about Jehovah ?
The Bible shows that Noah ’ s son Shem was Abraham ’ s relative . And he lived until Abraham was about 150 years old .
Shem was a man of great faith , and he probably talked to his relatives about Jehovah .
We do not know for sure , but it is possible that this is how Abraham learned about Jehovah .
What Abraham learned made him love Jehovah , and that knowledge helped him to build faith .
6 , 7 . How did Abraham ’ s experiences strengthen his faith ?
6 Experience .
How did Abraham gain experience that strengthened his faith in Jehovah ?
Some say that thoughts lead to feelings and feelings lead to actions .
Abraham ’ s heart was moved by what he learned about God , and that gave him deep respect for “ Jehovah the Most High God , Maker of heaven and earth . ”
( Genesis 14 : 22 ) The Bible calls such deep respect “ godly fear . ”
( Hebrews 5 : 7 ) In order to have a close friendship with God , we need to have godly fear .
( Psalm 25 : 14 ) It was that quality that motivated Abraham to obey Jehovah .
7 God told Abraham and Sarah to leave their home in Ur and move to a foreign country .
They were no longer young , and they would have to live in tents for the rest of their lives .
Even though Abraham knew that there would be many dangers , he was determined to obey Jehovah .
Because of his obedience , God blessed and protected him .
For example , when Abraham ’ s beautiful wife , Sarah , was taken away from him and he was in danger of being killed , Jehovah miraculously protected both Abraham and Sarah more than once .
( Genesis 12 : 10-20 ; 20 : 2-7 , 10-12 , 17 , 18 ) Those experiences made Abraham ’ s faith stronger .
8 .
How can we gain knowledge and experience that will strengthen our friendship with Jehovah ?
8 Can we be close friends with Jehovah ?
Yes , we definitely can !
Like Abraham , we need to learn about Jehovah .
And we too can gain the knowledge and experience we need .
Today , we have much more than Abraham had .
( Daniel 12 : 4 ; Romans 11 : 33 ) The Bible is full of knowledge about the “ Maker of heaven and earth . ”
What we learn makes us love Jehovah and helps us to have deep respect for him .
This love and respect for God motivates us to obey him .
When we do , we see how he protects and blesses us , and this gives us experience that makes our faith stronger .
When we serve Jehovah fully , we will gain satisfaction , peace , and joy .
( Psalm 34 : 8 ; Proverbs 10 : 22 ) The more knowledge and experience we gain , the stronger our friendship with him will become .
HOW ABRAHAM KEPT HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH GOD
9 , 10 . ( a ) What is needed for a friendship to become stronger ? ( b ) What shows that Abraham cherished and strengthened his friendship with Jehovah ?
9 A close friendship can be like a valuable treasure .
( Read Proverbs 17 : 17 . )
It is not like an expensive vase that is used only for decoration .
It is more like a beautiful flower that needs water and care to bloom .
Abraham cherished and maintained his friendship with Jehovah .
How did he do that ?
Friendship is like a beautiful flower that needs water and care to bloom 10 Abraham continued to strengthen his godly fear and obedience .
For example , when he traveled to Canaan with his family and his servants , he continued to let Jehovah guide him in making decisions both big and small .
A year before Isaac was born , when Abraham was 99 years old , Jehovah told him to circumcise all the males in his household .
Did Abraham doubt Jehovah or try to find an excuse for not doing what he was asked ?
No , he trusted in Jehovah and obeyed “ on that very day . ” — Genesis 17 : 10-14 , 23 .
11 .
Why was Abraham concerned about Sodom and Gomorrah , and how did Jehovah help him ?
11 Because Abraham always obeyed Jehovah even in little things , their friendship became stronger .
He felt that he could talk to Jehovah about anything , even asking for help when he struggled with difficult questions .
For example , when Jehovah said that he would destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , Abraham was concerned .
Why ?
He was afraid that good people would die along with the bad .
He was probably worried about his nephew Lot and his family , who lived in Sodom .
Abraham trusted in Jehovah , “ the Judge of all the earth , ” so he humbly talked to Jehovah about his concerns .
Jehovah was patient with his friend and showed him that He is merciful .
Jehovah explained that even when he brings judgment , he searches for good people and saves them. — Genesis 18 : 22-33 .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Abraham ’ s knowledge and experience help him later ? ( b ) What shows that Abraham had confidence in Jehovah ?
12 It is clear that all the knowledge and experience Abraham had gained helped him to keep his friendship with Jehovah strong .
So later , when Jehovah asked Abraham to sacrifice his son , he knew that Jehovah had always been patient , merciful , trustworthy , and protective .
Abraham was absolutely sure that Jehovah had not suddenly become cruel or harsh !
Why do we say that ?
13 Before leaving his servants , Abraham said : “ You stay here with the donkey , but the boy and I will go over there and worship and return to you . ”
( Genesis 22 : 5 ) What did Abraham mean ?
Was he lying about coming back with Isaac , knowing that he would sacrifice him ?
No .
The Bible says that Abraham knew that Jehovah was able to resurrect Isaac from the dead .
( Read Hebrews 11 : 19 . )
Abraham knew that Jehovah had given him the power to have a son even though he and Sarah were very old .
( Hebrews 11 : 11 , 12 , 18 ) So he realized that nothing was impossible for Jehovah .
Abraham did not know what would happen that day .
But he had faith that if needed , Jehovah would resurrect his son so that all of God ’ s promises would come true .
That is why Abraham is called “ the father of all those having faith . ”
Abraham had faith that if needed , Jehovah would resurrect his son so that all of God ’ s promises would come true
14 .
What challenges do you face in serving Jehovah , and how may Abraham ’ s example help you ?
14 Today , however , Jehovah does not ask us to sacrifice our children , but he does ask us to obey his commands .
Sometimes we may not understand the reason for these commands or we may find them hard to obey .
Do you ever feel like that ?
For some , the preaching work is difficult .
Maybe they are shy and find it hard to talk to people they do not know .
Others are afraid to be different at work or at school .
( Exodus 23 : 2 ; 1 Thessalonians 2 : 2 ) When you are asked to do something difficult , think of Abraham ’ s outstanding example of faith and courage .
When we meditate on examples of faithful men and women , it can motivate us to imitate them and to draw closer to our Friend , Jehovah. — Hebrews 12 : 1 , 2 .
ABRAHAM ’ S FRIENDSHIP WITH JEHOVAH
WHILE LIVING IN UR
Abraham and Sarah come to know and worship Jehovah
Abraham obeys God and leaves Ur
TRAVELS TO CANAAN
Jehovah protects Abraham and Sarah during their journey
LIFE IN CANAAN
Abraham is obedient and circumcises all males of his household
Jehovah patiently listens to Abraham ’ s concerns about Sodom
Jehovah makes it possible for Abraham and Sarah to have a son
Abraham shows faith and is willing to sacrifice Isaac
Abraham dies “ at a good old age , old and satisfied ”
A FRIENDSHIP THAT BRINGS BLESSINGS
15 .
Why may we be sure that Abraham never regretted his loyal obedience to Jehovah ?
15 Did Abraham ever regret obeying Jehovah ’ s commands ?
The Bible says that Abraham “ died at a good old age , old and satisfied . ”
( Genesis 25 : 8 ) When he was 175 years old , Abraham could look back on his long life and feel satisfied .
Why ?
Because his friendship with Jehovah was always the most important thing to him .
However , when we read that Abraham was “ old and satisfied , ” this does not mean that he had no desire to live in the future .
16 .
What joys will Abraham experience in Paradise ?
16 The Bible says that Abraham “ was awaiting the city having real foundations , whose designer and builder is God . ”
( Hebrews 11 : 10 ) Abraham believed that one day he would see that city , the Kingdom of God , ruling over the earth .
And he will !
Imagine how happy Abraham will be to live on a paradise earth and to continue strengthening his friendship with God .
He will be happy to know that his example of faith has helped God ’ s servants for thousands of years !
In Paradise he will find out that the sacrifice on Mount Moriah illustrated something much greater .
( Hebrews 11 : 19 ) And he will learn how the pain he felt when he prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac has helped millions of faithful people to understand Jehovah ’ s pain when he gave his Son , Jesus Christ , as a ransom for mankind .
( John 3 : 16 ) Abraham ’ s example has helped us all to have even more appreciation for the ransom , the greatest act of love ever shown !
17 .
What is your determination , and what will we consider in the following article ?
17 May each of us be determined to imitate the faith of Abraham .
Like him , we need knowledge and experience .
As we continue learning about Jehovah and obeying him , we will see how he blesses and protects us .
( Read Hebrews 6 : 10-12 . )
May Jehovah be our Friend forever !
In the following article , we will consider three more examples of faithful ones who became close friends of God .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 3 ) Abraham and Sarah were originally called Abram and Sarai .
But in this article , we will use the names that Jehovah later gave them .
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
To become God ’ s friend , we must come to know him well .
As we learn about him , we will begin to have deep love and respect for him .
This will motivate us to trust in him and obey him .
If we keep strengthening our friendship with Jehovah , it can last forever
Imitate Jehovah ’ s Close Friends
“ Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him . ” — PSALM 25 : 14 .
SONGS : 106 , 118
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
What can we learn from the friendship with God that Ruth enjoyed ?
Why was King Hezekiah a close friend of Jehovah ?
What qualities made Jesus ’ mother , Mary , a friend of Jehovah God ?
1-3 . ( a ) Why can we be sure that we can become God ’ s friends ? ( b ) What individuals will we consider in this article ?
IN THE Bible , Abraham is called God ’ s friend three times .
( 2 Chronicles 20 : 7 ; Isaiah 41 : 8 ; James 2 : 23 ) He is the only person directly called God ’ s friend in the Bible .
Does that mean that Abraham is the only human ever to become Jehovah ’ s friend ?
No .
The Bible shows that all of us can have that privilege .
2 God ’ s Word is full of accounts of many faithful men and women who feared Jehovah , put faith in him , and became his close friends .
( Read Psalm 25 : 14 . )
They are part of the “ great cloud of witnesses ” mentioned by Paul .
All these different individuals were God ’ s friends. — Hebrews 12 : 1 .
3 Let us take a close look at three of Jehovah ’ s friends described in the Bible : ( 1 ) Ruth , the loyal young widow from Moab , ( 2 ) Hezekiah , a faithful king of Judah , and ( 3 ) Mary , the humble mother of Jesus .
What can we learn from the way each of them became God ’ s friend ?
SHE SHOWED LOYAL LOVE
4 , 5 . What difficult decision did Ruth have to make , and why was making it so hard ?
( See opening picture . )
4 Naomi and her daughters-in-law , Ruth and Orpah , were walking the long distance from Moab to Israel .
Along the way , Orpah decided to go home to Moab .
But Naomi was determined to return to Israel , her homeland .
What did Ruth decide to do ?
She had to make a very difficult decision .
Would she go back home to Moab to be with her family , or would she stay with Naomi , her mother-in-law , and travel to Bethlehem ? — Ruth 1 : 1-8 , 14 .
5 Ruth ’ s family lived in Moab .
She could return to them , and they would probably take care of her .
She knew the people , the language , and the culture of Moab .
Naomi could not promise Ruth any of those things in Bethlehem .
And Naomi was afraid that she would not find a husband or a home for her .
So Naomi told her to go back to Moab .
As we saw , Orpah “ returned to her people and her gods . ”
( Ruth 1 : 9-15 ) But Ruth decided not to return to her people and their false gods .
6 . ( a ) What wise choice did Ruth make ? ( b ) Why did Boaz speak of Ruth as seeking refuge under Jehovah ’ s wings ?
6 It seems that Ruth learned about Jehovah from her husband or from Naomi .
She learned that Jehovah was not like the gods of Moab .
She loved Jehovah and knew that he deserved her love and her worship .
So Ruth made a wise choice .
She told Naomi : “ Your people will be my people , and your God my God . ”
( Ruth 1 : 16 ) Our hearts are moved when we think about Ruth ’ s love for Naomi .
But what is more impressive is Ruth ’ s love for Jehovah .
This also impressed Boaz , who later praised her for ‘ seeking refuge under Jehovah ’ s wings . ’
( Read Ruth 2 : 12 . )
The words Boaz used may remind us of how a baby bird looks for protection under its parent ’ s wings .
( Psalm 36 : 7 ; 91 : 1-4 ) In a similar way , Jehovah gave Ruth loving protection and rewarded her for her faith .
Ruth never had any reason to regret her decision .
7 .
What might help those who hesitate to dedicate their lives to Jehovah ?
7 Many people learn about Jehovah but choose not to take refuge in him .
They hesitate to dedicate their lives to him and get baptized .
If you feel the same way , think about why you hesitate .
Everyone serves one god or another .
( Joshua 24 : 15 ) The wise choice would be to serve the true God .
When you dedicate yourself to Jehovah , you show that you have faith that he will be a refuge for you .
And he will help you to keep serving him despite any problems you may have .
That is what God did for Ruth .
“ HE HELD FAST TO JEHOVAH ”
8 .
Describe Hezekiah ’ s background .
8 Hezekiah ’ s background was very different from Ruth ’ s .
He was part of a nation that was dedicated to God .
But not all Israelites remained faithful .
Hezekiah ’ s father , King Ahaz , was wicked .
He showed disrespect for God ’ s temple and convinced the people to worship other gods .
Ahaz even had some of Hezekiah ’ s brothers burned alive as sacrifices to a false god .
Hezekiah had a terrible childhood ! — 2 Kings 16 : 2-4 , 10-17 ; 2 Chronicles 28 : 1-3 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) Why might Hezekiah easily have become bitter ? ( b ) Why should we not become bitter against God ? ( c ) Why should we not think that our background determines the type of person we will become ?
9 The bad example of Ahaz could have caused his son Hezekiah to become bitter or angry with Jehovah .
Today , some who have had to endure far less than Hezekiah feel that they have good reason to become “ enraged against Jehovah ” or bitter toward his organization .
( Proverbs 19 : 3 ) Others feel that their bad family background may cause them to have a bad life or to repeat their parents ’ mistakes .
( Ezekiel 18 : 2 , 3 ) But are these ideas true ?
10 Hezekiah ’ s life proves that the answer to that question is no !
There is never a good reason to become angry with Jehovah .
He does not cause bad things to happen to people .
( Job 34 : 10 ) It is true that parents can teach their children to do good or bad .
( Proverbs 22 : 6 ; Colossians 3 : 21 ) But this does not mean that our family background will determine the type of person we will become .
Why ?
Because Jehovah has given us the gift of free will , which means that we can choose to do what is good or what is bad .
( Deuteronomy 30 : 19 ) How did Hezekiah use that precious gift ?
Many young people accept the truth despite their family background ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
11 .
What made Hezekiah one of Judah ’ s best kings ?
11 Even though his father was one of the worst kings in Judah , Hezekiah became one of the very best .
( Read 2 Kings 18 : 5 , 6 . )
He chose not to follow his father ’ s bad example .
Instead , he chose to listen carefully to Jehovah ’ s prophets , such as Isaiah , Micah , and Hosea .
He paid close attention to their counsel and correction .
This motivated him to fix many of the problems his father had caused .
He cleansed the temple , asked God to forgive the people ’ s sins , and destroyed the idols throughout the land .
( 2 Chronicles 29 : 1-11 , 18-24 ; 31 : 1 ) Later , when the Assyrian king Sennacherib threatened to attack Jerusalem , Hezekiah showed great courage and faith .
He trusted in Jehovah ’ s protection and strengthened his people .
( 2 Chronicles 32 : 7 , 8 ) At one point Hezekiah became proud , but when Jehovah corrected him , he humbled himself .
( 2 Chronicles 32 : 24-26 ) Clearly , Hezekiah is a wonderful example for us to imitate .
He did not let his family background ruin his life .
Instead , he showed that he was Jehovah ’ s friend .
12 .
Like Hezekiah , how have many today proved to be Jehovah ’ s friends ?
12 The world today is cruel and unloving , and many children grow up without loving and caring parents .
( 2 Timothy 3 : 1-5 ) Even though many Christians today come from difficult family backgrounds , they have chosen to build a friendship with Jehovah .
Like Hezekiah , they show that their family background does not need to determine what kind of person they will become in the future .
God has given us the gift of free will , and we can choose to serve and honor him , as Hezekiah did . “ LOOK !
JEHOVAH ’ S SLAVE GIRL ! ”
13 , 14 .
Why might Mary ’ s assignment have seemed too difficult , yet how did she respond to Gabriel ’ s words ?
13 Many years after Hezekiah ’ s time , a humble young woman named Mary had a special friendship with Jehovah and a unique assignment .
She would become pregnant and give birth to and raise God ’ s Son !
Jehovah must have loved and trusted Mary in order to give her such an amazing honor .
But how did she react when she first heard about that assignment ? “ Look !
Jehovah ’ s slave girl ! ” ( See paragraphs 13 , 14 )
14 We often talk about the great honor Mary was given .
But what may have been some of her fears ?
For example , the angel Gabriel said that she would become pregnant without having sexual relations with a man .
But Gabriel did not offer to explain to her family and neighbors how she would become pregnant .
What would they think ?
How would she convince Joseph that she had not been unfaithful to him ?
In addition , she had the great responsibility of raising God ’ s Son as a human !
We do not know all of Mary ’ s concerns , but we do know what she did after Gabriel spoke to her . She said : “ Look !
Jehovah ’ s slave girl ! May it happen to me according to your declaration . ” — Luke 1 : 26-38 .
15 .
Why is Mary ’ s faith remarkable ?
15 Mary ’ s faith is truly outstanding !
She was ready to do whatever was asked of her , just like a slave girl .
She trusted that Jehovah would take care of her and protect her .
How could Mary have such strong faith ?
We are not born with faith .
But we can have faith if we cultivate it and ask God to bless our efforts .
( Galatians 5 : 22 ; Ephesians 2 : 8 ) Mary worked hard to strengthen her faith .
How do we know ?
Let us consider how she listened and what she spoke about .
16 .
What shows that Mary was a good listener ?
16 How Mary listened .
The Bible says that we “ must be quick to listen , slow to speak . ”
( James 1 : 19 ) Mary was a good listener .
The Bible shows that she carefully listened to the things she heard , especially the things she learned about Jehovah .
She took time to meditate on such important things .
One example of this was at Jesus ’ birth when shepherds told Mary about a message from an angel .
Later , when Jesus was 12 years old , he said something that amazed Mary .
In both cases , Mary listened , remembered , and thought carefully about what she had heard. — Read Luke 2 : 16-19 , 49 , 51 .
17 .
What can we learn about Mary from the way she spoke ?
17 What Mary spoke about .
The Bible does not tell us much about what Mary said .
Her longest speech is found at Luke 1 : 46-55 .
These words show that Mary knew the Hebrew Scriptures very well .
How so ?
Mary ’ s words were similar to the words of the prayer of Hannah , the mother of Samuel .
( 1 Samuel 2 : 1-10 ) It seems that Mary quoted the Scriptures about 20 times in her speech .
It is clear that she liked to speak about the truths she had learned from her greatest Friend , Jehovah .
18 .
In what ways can we imitate Mary ’ s faith ?
18 Like Mary , we may at times receive assignments from Jehovah that we think are too difficult for us .
Let us imitate her example , humbly accept the assignment , and trust that Jehovah will help us .
We can also imitate Mary ’ s faith when we carefully listen to Jehovah and meditate on what we have learned about him and his purposes .
We then can joyfully tell others what we have learned. — Psalm 77 : 11 , 12 ; Luke 8 : 18 ; Romans 10 : 15 .
19 .
As we imitate the Bible ’ s outstanding examples of faith , of what may we be assured ?
19 It is clear that Ruth , Hezekiah , and Mary were Jehovah ’ s friends , just as Abraham was .
They were part of the “ great cloud of witnesses ” who also had the privilege of becoming God ’ s friends .
May we continue to imitate such outstanding examples of faith .
( Hebrews 6 : 11 , 12 ) If we do so , we can look forward to the reward of being Jehovah ’ s friends forever !
Keep On Serving Jehovah With Joy
THINK about the happiest day of your life .
Was it when you got married or when your first child was born ?
Or was it the day you got baptized ?
That was likely the most important and joyful day of your life .
And on that day , how glad your brothers and sisters were to see you prove that you love God with your whole heart , soul , mind , and strength ! — Mark 12 : 30 .
Very likely , you have experienced much joy in serving Jehovah since your baptism .
However , a number of publishers have lost some of the joy they once had .
Why has this happened ?
What reasons do we have for continuing to serve Jehovah with joy ?
WHY SOME HAVE LOST THEIR JOY
The Kingdom message brings us a lot of joy .
Why ?
Because Jehovah promises that the Kingdom will soon put an end to this wicked world and bring in God ’ s new world .
Zephaniah 1 : 14 tells us : “ The great day of Jehovah is near ! It is near and it is approaching very quickly ! ”
But if we feel that we have to wait longer than expected , we could lose the joy we once had .
This could cause us to slow down in our service to God. — Proverbs 13 : 12 .
When we spend time with our brothers and sisters , we feel encouraged to keep on serving Jehovah with joy .
The good conduct of Jehovah ’ s people may have attracted us to true worship and helped us to begin serving God joyfully .
( 1 Peter 2 : 12 ) However , what could happen if one of our brothers or sisters was disciplined because he or she did not obey God ’ s commands ?
This may discourage some in the congregation and cause them to lose their joy .
Materialism could also cause us to lose our joy .
How so ?
Satan ’ s world tries to convince us that we should buy things that we really do not need .
So may we remember Jesus ’ words : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
( Matthew 6 : 24 ) We cannot serve Jehovah with joy and at the same time try to get all that we can from this world .
JOYFUL IN JEHOVAH ’ S SERVICE
Serving Jehovah is not a heavy load for those who love him .
( 1 John 5 : 3 ) Remember that Jesus said : “ Come to me , all you who are toiling and loaded down , and I will refresh you .
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart , and you will find refreshment for yourselves .
For my yoke is kindly , and my load is light . ”
( Matthew 11 : 28-30 ) Being a true Christian is refreshing and brings us joy .
We certainly have good reasons for being joyful in Jehovah ’ s service .
Let us now consider three of them. — Habakkuk 3 : 18 .
We serve our Life-Giver , the happy God .
( Acts 17 : 28 ; 1 Timothy 1 : 11 ) We realize that we owe our lives to our Creator .
So let us continue to serve him with joy , regardless of how many years have gone by since we got baptized .
Héctor keeps his joy by remembering his Kingdom hope and staying active
Consider Héctor , who served Jehovah as a traveling overseer for 40 years .
“ Even in old age , ” he still enjoys serving Jehovah .
( Psalm 92 : 12-14 ) His wife ’ s illness has limited his activity in God ’ s service , but Héctor has not lost his joy .
He says : “ Although it is sad to see my wife ’ s health gradually deteriorate and it has been challenging to care for her , I have not allowed this to rob me of my joy in serving the true God .
Knowing that I owe my life to Jehovah , who created man for a purpose , is reason enough to love him deeply and serve him wholeheartedly .
I strive to stay active in the preaching work , and I try to keep the Kingdom hope foremost in my mind so as not to lose my joy . ”
Jehovah has provided the ransom sacrifice , making it possible for us to have a joyful life .
Indeed , “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
( John 3 : 16 ) Yes , our sins can be forgiven and we can have everlasting life when we show faith in God ’ s loving gift of the ransom . This is truly an excellent reason to be grateful !
And our gratitude for the ransom will motivate us to serve Jehovah joyfully .
Jesús simplified his life and served Jehovah joyfully for years
A brother named Jesús , who lived in Mexico , said : “ I was a slave to my job , at times working five consecutive shifts even though it was not obligatory to do so .
I did it just to make more money .
Then I learned about Jehovah and how he had given his dear Son for mankind .
I had an intense desire to serve him .
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah , and after having worked for the company for 28 years , I decided to quit and take up the full-time ministry . ”
That is how Jesús started serving Jehovah with joy .
We live a morally clean life , which brings us happiness .
Do you remember what your life was like before you came to know Jehovah ?
The apostle Paul reminded Christians in Rome that they “ were once the slaves of sin ” but had become “ slaves to righteousness . ”
Because they were living a clean life , they could look forward to everlasting life .
( Romans 6 : 17-22 ) We too follow Jehovah ’ s standards , so we are free from the sadness that comes from an immoral or violent way of life .
What a cause for joy !
“ The happiest years of my life have been those spent serving Jehovah . ” — Jaime
Consider Jaime , who was an atheist and evolutionist and also a boxer .
Jaime began to attend Christian meetings and was touched by the love he found there .
To abandon his former lifestyle , Jaime had to ask Jehovah to help him believe in Him .
“ Little by little , I discovered the existence of a loving Father and merciful God , ” Jaime says .
“ Keeping Jehovah ’ s righteous standards has been a protection for me .
Had I not changed , I might have been killed , as some of my former boxing friends were .
The happiest years of my life have been those spent serving Jehovah . ”
DO NOT GIVE UP !
How should we feel while we wait for the end of this wicked world ?
Remember , we are doing God ’ s will and we are looking forward to everlasting life .
“ So let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out . ”
( Galatians 6 : 8 , 9 ) With Jehovah ’ s help , let us endure , work hard to cultivate the qualities we need to survive “ the great tribulation , ” and continue to serve Jehovah with joy. — Revelation 7 : 9 , 13 , 14 ; James 1 : 2-4 .
We can be confident that Jehovah will reward our endurance because he knows the work we do and the love we show for him and his name .
If we keep on serving him with joy , we will be like the psalmist David , who said : “ I keep Jehovah before me constantly .
Because he is at my right hand , I will never be shaken . So my heart rejoices , my whole being is joyful .
And I reside in security . ” — Psalm 16 : 8 , 9 .

Prove Yourself Loyal to Jehovah
“ May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever . ” — 1 SAMUEL 20 : 42 .
SONGS : 125 , 62
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER ?
How was King Saul ’ s son Jonathan loyal to Jehovah ?
How can we be loyal to God when we feel that someone who has authority does not deserve our respect ?
How can we be loyal to Jehovah if others misunderstand us or treat us unfairly ?
1 , 2 . Why is Jonathan ’ s friendship with David a remarkable example of loyalty ?
JONATHAN must have been amazed at how courageous young David was .
David had killed the giant Goliath and brought “ the head of the Philistine ” to Jonathan ’ s father , King Saul of Israel .
( 1 Samuel 17 : 57 ) Jonathan had no doubt that God was with David , and from then on , Jonathan and David became very close friends .
They promised that they would always be loyal to each other .
( 1 Samuel 18 : 1-3 ) For the rest of his life , Jonathan was loyal to David .
2 Jonathan stayed loyal to David even though Jehovah had chosen David , not Jonathan , to be the next king of Israel .
And when Saul was trying to kill David , Jonathan was worried about his friend .
He knew that David was in the wilderness at Horesh , so Jonathan went there to encourage him to keep relying on Jehovah .
Jonathan told David : “ Do not be afraid , for my father Saul will not find you ; you will be king over Israel , and I will become second to you . ” — 1 Samuel 23 : 16 , 17 .
3 .
What was more important to Jonathan than being loyal to David , and how do we know ?
( See opening picture . )
3 We usually admire people who are loyal .
But do we admire Jonathan only because he was loyal to David ?
No , being loyal to God was the most important thing in Jonathan ’ s life .
In fact , that is the reason why he was loyal to David and was not jealous of him , although David would become king instead of him .
Jonathan even helped David to rely on Jehovah .
Both men stayed loyal to Jehovah and to each other .
They kept the promise they had made : “ May Jehovah be between you and me and between your offspring and my offspring forever . ” — 1 Samuel 20 : 42 .
4 . ( a ) What will make us truly happy and satisfied ? ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
4 We too must be loyal to our family , our friends , and our brothers and sisters in the congregation .
( 1 Thessalonians 2 : 10 , 11 ) But most important of all , we must be loyal to Jehovah .
He is the One who gave us life ! ( Revelation 4 : 11 ) When we are loyal to him , we are truly happy and satisfied .
But we know that we must be loyal to God even in difficult times .
In this article , we will discuss how Jonathan ’ s example can help us to stay loyal to Jehovah in four situations : ( 1 ) when we feel that someone who has authority does not deserve our respect , ( 2 ) when we have to choose to whom we should be loyal , ( 3 ) when a brother taking the lead misunderstands us or treats us unfairly , and ( 4 ) when we feel it is difficult to keep a promise .
WHEN WE FEEL THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS AUTHORITY DOES NOT DESERVE OUR RESPECT
5 .
Why was it difficult for the people of Israel to be loyal to God while Saul was king ?
5 Jonathan and the people of Israel were in a difficult situation .
King Saul , Jonathan ’ s father , had become disobedient , and Jehovah rejected him .
( 1 Samuel 15 : 17-23 ) Still , God allowed Saul to continue ruling for many years .
So it was hard for the people to be loyal to God when the king who was chosen to sit on “ Jehovah ’ s throne ” was doing very bad things. — 1 Chronicles 29 : 23 .
6 .
What shows that Jonathan stayed loyal to Jehovah ?
6 Jonathan stayed loyal to Jehovah .
Think of what Jonathan did soon after Saul started to disobey God .
( 1 Samuel 13 : 13 , 14 ) At that time , a large army of Philistines came with 30,000 chariots to attack Israel .
Saul had just 600 soldiers , and only he and Jonathan had weapons .
But Jonathan was not afraid .
He remembered the words of the prophet Samuel : “ For the sake of his great name , Jehovah will not abandon his people . ” ( 1 Samuel 12 : 22 ) Jonathan said to another soldier : “ Nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few . ”
So he and the soldier attacked a group of Philistines and killed about 20 of them .
Jonathan had faith in Jehovah , and Jehovah blessed him .
Jehovah caused an earthquake , and the Philistines became frightened .
Then they attacked and killed one another , and the Israelites won the battle. — 1 Samuel 13 : 5 , 15 , 22 ; 14 : 1 , 2 , 6 , 14 , 15 , 20 .
7 .
How did Jonathan treat his father ?
7 Even though Saul continued to disobey Jehovah , Jonathan still obeyed his father whenever possible .
For example , they fought together to defend Jehovah ’ s people. — 1 Samuel 31 : 1 , 2 .
8 , 9 . How are we being loyal to God when we respect those who have authority ?
8 Like Jonathan , we can be loyal to Jehovah by obeying whenever possible the government of the country where we live .
Jehovah allows these “ superior authorities ” to have authority over us , and he requires that we show them respect .
( Read Romans 13 : 1 , 2 . )
That is why we should treat a government official with respect even when he is not honest and we feel he does not deserve our respect .
In fact , we should respect all those who are given authority by Jehovah. — 1 Corinthians 11 : 3 ; Hebrews 13 : 17 .
One way we stay loyal to Jehovah is by treating our husband or wife with respect , even if he or she does not serve Jehovah ( See paragraph 9 )
9 Olga , a sister in South America , showed her loyalty to Jehovah by being respectful to her husband even though he treated her badly . [ 1 ] ( See endnote . )
He sometimes refused to speak to her or said cruel things to her because she was one of Jehovah ’ s Witnesses .
He even told her that he would leave her and take the children with him .
But Olga did not “ return evil for evil . ”
She did her best to be a good wife .
She cooked for him , washed his clothes , and took care of others in his family .
( Romans 12 : 17 ) And when she could , she went with him to visit his family and friends .
For example , when he wanted to go to another city for his father ’ s funeral , she prepared everything they needed for the trip . Then , at the funeral , she waited for him outside the church .
After many years , Olga ’ s husband started to treat her better because she had been so patient and always showed him respect .
Now he encourages her to go to the meetings and takes her there . Sometimes he even attends the meetings with her. — 1 Peter 3 : 1 .
WHEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO WHOM WE SHOULD BE LOYAL
10 .
How did Jonathan know to whom he should be loyal ?
10 When Saul said that he was going to kill David , Jonathan had a difficult decision to make .
He wanted to be loyal to his father , but he also wanted to be loyal to David .
Jonathan knew that God was with David and not with Saul , so he chose to be loyal to David .
He warned David to hide and then told Saul why he should let David live. — Read 1 Samuel 19 : 1-6 .
11 , 12 .
How does our love for God help us decide to be loyal to him ?
11 Alice , a sister from Australia , had to decide to whom she would be loyal .
While she was studying the Bible , she told her family about the things she was learning .
She also told them that she would not celebrate Christmas with them and explained why .
At first her family members were disappointed , but later they became very angry with her .
They felt that Alice did not care about them anymore .
Then her mother said that she never wanted to see Alice again .
Alice said : “ I was shocked and deeply hurt because I really loved my family .
Nevertheless , I resolved that Jehovah and his Son would be first in my heart , and I got baptized at the next assembly . ” — Matthew 10 : 37 .
12 We must not let loyalty to anything , such as a sports team , a school , or a country , become more important to us than our loyalty to Jehovah .
For example , Henry enjoyed playing chess with his school team and wanted to win a championship for his school .
But because he played chess every weekend , he did not have enough time for the ministry or the meetings .
Henry said that it had become more important for him to be loyal to the school than to God .
So he decided to stop playing chess for his school. — Matthew 6 : 33 .
13 .
How can loyalty to God help us to cope with family problems ?
13 Sometimes it can be hard to be loyal to different members of our family at the same time .
For example , Ken says : “ I wanted to visit my elderly mother regularly and to have her stay with us occasionally .
But my mother and my wife did not get along well . ”
He continues : “ I could not please one without displeasing the other . ”
Ken thought about what the Bible says and realized that in this situation , he had to please his wife and be loyal to her .
So he found a solution that his wife was happy with .
Then , he explained to her why she had to be kind to his mother .
He also explained to his mother why she should respect his wife. — Read Genesis 2 : 24 ; 1 Corinthians 13 : 4 , 5 .
WHEN A BROTHER MISUNDERSTANDS US OR TREATS US UNFAIRLY
14 .
How did Saul treat Jonathan unfairly ?
14 We can also be loyal to Jehovah if a brother who is taking the lead treats us unfairly .
King Saul was appointed by God , yet he treated his own son badly .
He did not understand why Jonathan loved David .
So when Jonathan tried to help David , Saul got very angry , and he embarrassed his son in front of many people .
But Jonathan still showed respect to his father .
At the same time , he stayed loyal to Jehovah and to David , who was chosen by God to be the next king of Israel. — 1 Samuel 20 : 30-41 .
15 .
If a brother treats us unfairly , how should we react ?
15 In our congregations today , the brothers taking the lead try to be fair to everyone .
But these brothers are imperfect . Because of that , it is possible that they may not understand why we have done something .
( 1 Samuel 1 : 13-17 ) So if we are ever misjudged or misunderstood , let us stay loyal to Jehovah .
WHEN IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP OUR PROMISE
16 .
In what situations must we be loyal to God and not be selfish ?
16 Saul wanted Jonathan to become the next king instead of David .
( 1 Samuel 20 : 31 ) But Jonathan loved Jehovah and was loyal to him .
So instead of being selfish , Jonathan became David ’ s friend and kept his promise to him .
In fact , anyone who loves Jehovah and is loyal to him will “ not go back on his promise , even when it is bad for him . ”
( Psalm 15 : 4 ) Because we are loyal to God , we will keep our promises .
For example , if we make a business agreement , we will do what we agreed to do , even if this becomes difficult .
And if we have problems in our marriage , we will show our love for Jehovah by staying loyal to our husband or wife. — Read Malachi 2 : 13-16 .
If we make a business agreement , we will do what we agreed to do because we are loyal to God ( See paragraph 16 )
17 .
How has this study helped you ?
17 We want to be loyal to God even in difficult situations , as Jonathan was .
So let us stay loyal to our brothers and sisters when they disappoint us .
Then we will make Jehovah ’ s heart rejoice , and that is what makes us happiest .
( Proverbs 27 : 11 ) We can be sure that he will always do what is best for us and take care of us .
In the next article , we will see what we can learn from some in David ’ s time who were loyal and from others who were not loyal .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 9 ) Some names have been changed .
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
We stay loyal to Jehovah : We love Jehovah and obey him always .
In difficult situations , we think of what he wants us to do and then obey him because we love him more than anyone or anything else
“ Superior authorities ” : The governments and officials that Jehovah allows to have authority over us .
He wants us to treat them with respect and obey them except when they want us to do something that he commands us not to do

Who deserves our loyalty ?
Why was Jonathan ’ s reaction to David so different from Abner ’ s ?
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God , and how ?
1 , 2 . How did David show that he was loyal to God ?
( See opening picture . )
SAUL and his 3,000 soldiers were looking for David in the wilderness of Judah to kill him .
But one night , David and his men found the place where Saul and his soldiers were camped .
They were all asleep , so David and Abishai walked carefully past the soldiers and found Saul .
Abishai whispered to David : “ Let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once , and I will not need to do it twice . ”
But David would not let him kill Saul .
He told Abishai : “ Do not harm him , for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent ? ”
Then David said : “ It is unthinkable from Jehovah ’ s standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah ! ” — 1 Samuel 26 : 8-12 .
2 David understood what he needed to do to be loyal to Jehovah .
He knew he should respect Saul , and he did not even think of hurting him .
Why ?
Because God had chosen Saul to be king of Israel .
Today , as in the past , Jehovah wants all of his servants to be loyal to him and respect those whom he allows to have authority. — Read Micah 6 : 8 .
3 .
How was Abishai loyal to David ?
3 Abishai respected David because he knew that God had chosen David to be king .
Yet after becoming king , David committed serious sins .
He had sexual relations with Uriah ’ s wife and then told Joab to make sure that Uriah would be killed in battle .
( 2 Samuel 11 : 2-4 , 14 , 15 ; 1 Chronicles 2 : 16 ) Joab was Abishai ’ s brother , so Abishai may have heard about what David did , but he continued to respect David .
In addition , Abishai was a military leader and could have used this authority to make himself king , but he never did .
Instead , he served David and protected him from his enemies. — 2 Samuel 10 : 10 ; 20 : 6 ; 21 : 15-17 .
4 . ( a ) How was David an example of loyalty to God ? ( b ) What other examples will we consider ?
4 David was loyal to Jehovah all his life .
When he was young , he killed the giant Goliath , who was insulting Jehovah and the Israelites .
( 1 Samuel 17 : 23 , 26 , 48-51 ) When David was king , Jehovah ’ s prophet Nathan had to correct him for the sins he committed .
Immediately , David admitted that he had sinned , and he repented .
( 2 Samuel 12 : 1-5 , 13 ) Later , when David was an old man , he gave many valuable things to help build Jehovah ’ s temple .
( 1 Chronicles 29 : 1-5 ) It is clear that even though David made serious mistakes in his life , he never stopped being loyal to God .
( Psalm 51 : 4 , 10 ; 86 : 2 ) In this article , we will discuss the example of David and others who lived at that time and learn how we can be loyal to Jehovah more than to anyone else .
And we will discuss other qualities that will help us to do so .
WILL YOU BE LOYAL TO JEHOVAH ?
5 .
What lesson do we learn from Abishai ’ s mistake ?
5 When Abishai wanted to kill Saul , he was trying to be loyal to David .
But because David knew that it would be wrong to harm “ the anointed of Jehovah , ” he did not let Abishai kill the king .
( 1 Samuel 26 : 8-11 ) This teaches us an important lesson : When we need to decide whom to be loyal to first , we need to think about which Bible principles can help us in our situation .
It is more important to be loyal to Jehovah than to anyone else
6 .
Although it is natural to be loyal to our family and friends , why must we be careful ?
6 It is natural to be loyal to someone we love , such as a friend or a family member .
But because we are imperfect , our feelings can mislead us .
( Jeremiah 17 : 9 ) So if someone we love is doing something bad and leaves the truth , we must remember that it is more important to be loyal to Jehovah than to anyone else. — Read Matthew 22 : 37 .
7 .
How did one sister stay loyal to God in a difficult situation ?
7 If someone in your family has been disfellowshipped from the congregation , you can show Jehovah that you are loyal to Him .
For example , one day Anne ’ s mother , who was disfellowshipped , called her on the phone to say that she wanted to visit her . [ 1 ] ( See endnote . )
Anne ’ s mother said that she was very unhappy because the family refused to talk to her .
This made Anne feel sad , and she promised to reply in a letter .
Before she wrote the letter , Anne meditated on some Bible principles .
( 1 Corinthians 5 : 11 ; 2 John 9-11 ) Then , in the letter , she explained in a kind way that her mother was the one who left the family when she sinned and refused to repent .
Anne told her mother that the only way she could be happy again was by returning to Jehovah. — James 4 : 8 .
8 .
What qualities will help us to be loyal to God ?
8 Loyal servants of God in David ’ s time were also humble , kind , and courageous .
Let us see how these qualities can help us to be loyal to Jehovah .
WE MUST BE HUMBLE
9 .
Why did Abner try to kill David ?
9 Saul ’ s son Jonathan and the commander of Israel ’ s army , Abner , saw David bring Goliath ’ s head to King Saul .
Jonathan became David ’ s friend and stayed loyal to him .
( 1 Samuel 17 : 57 – 18 : 3 ) But Abner did not .
In fact , later he even helped Saul , who wanted to kill David .
( 1 Samuel 26 : 1-5 ; Psalm 54 : 3 ) Both Jonathan and Abner knew that God wanted David to be the next king of Israel .
But after Saul died , Abner did not support David .
Instead , he tried to make Saul ’ s son Ish-bosheth king .
Later , Abner may have wanted to be king himself , and perhaps that is why he had sexual relations with one of King Saul ’ s wives .
( 2 Samuel 2 : 8-10 ; 3 : 6-11 ) Why did Jonathan and Abner feel so differently about David ?
Because Jonathan was loyal to Jehovah and was humble but Abner was not .
10 .
Why was Absalom not loyal to God ?
10 Absalom , King David ’ s son , was not loyal to God because he was not humble .
He wanted to be king , so he got “ a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him . ” ( 2 Samuel 15 : 1 ) He also convinced many Israelites to be loyal to him .
He even tried to kill his father , although he knew that Jehovah had made David king of Israel. — 2 Samuel 15 : 13 , 14 ; 17 : 1-4 .
11 .
How can we benefit from Bible accounts about Abner , Absalom , and Baruch ?
11 When a person is not humble and wants to have more authority , it is hard for him to stay loyal to God .
Of course , we love Jehovah , and we do not want to be selfish and wicked like Abner and Absalom . But we must be careful that we do not start to desire a lot of money or a job that makes us feel important .
This will harm our relationship with Jehovah .
For some time , Baruch , Jeremiah ’ s secretary , wanted something he did not have and was no longer happy serving God .
Then Jehovah said to Baruch : “ Look ! What I have built up I am tearing down , and what I have planted I am uprooting — the entire land .
But you are seeking great things for yourself .
Stop seeking such things . ”
( Jeremiah 45 : 4 , 5 ) Baruch listened to Jehovah .
And we must listen to him too , because soon he will destroy this wicked world .
When you ask your brother to go to the elders for help , you are being kind to him and loyal to Jehovah
12 .
Show why we cannot be loyal to God when we are selfish .
12 Daniel , a brother in Mexico , had to decide to whom he would be loyal .
He wanted to marry a girl who did not worship Jehovah .
Daniel says : “ I continued writing to her even after I entered the pioneer service . ”
But then he realized that he was just selfishly doing what he wanted .
He was not being loyal to Jehovah , and he needed to be humble .
So he told an experienced elder about the girl .
Daniel explains : “ He helped me to see that to be loyal to God , I needed to stop writing to her .
After many prayers and tears , that is what I did .
Soon , my joy in the ministry increased . ”
Daniel now has a wife who loves Jehovah , and he serves as a circuit overseer .
LOYALTY TO GOD HELPS US TO BE KIND
If you find out that your friend has committed a serious sin , will you talk to that person and make sure that he or she gets help from the elders ?
( See paragraph 14 )
13 .
How did Nathan stay loyal to both God and David when David sinned ?
13 When we are loyal to Jehovah , we can also be loyal to others and help them in the best way .
The prophet Nathan stayed loyal to Jehovah and was also loyal to David .
After David had taken a man ’ s wife and then killed him , Jehovah sent Nathan to counsel David .
Nathan was courageous and obeyed Jehovah .
But he also acted wisely and spoke to David in a kind way .
He wanted to help David understand how serious his sins were .
So he told him a story of a rich man who stole the only lamb that a poor man had .
When David heard this , he got very angry at what the rich man had done .
Nathan then said : “ You are the man ! ”
David realized that he had sinned against Jehovah. — 2 Samuel 12 : 1-7 , 13 .
14 .
How can you be loyal to both Jehovah and your friend or relative ?
14 You too can be loyal to Jehovah first and be loyal to others by being kind .
For example , you may have proof that a brother has committed a serious sin .
You may want to stay loyal to him , especially if he is a close friend or a family member .
But you also know that it is more important to be loyal to Jehovah .
So like Nathan , obey Jehovah but be kind to your brother .
Tell him that he should ask the elders for help and that he should speak to them soon .
If he does not , then you should tell the elders yourself .
By doing this , you stay loyal to Jehovah .
And at the same time , you are kind to your brother because the elders can help him to have a good relationship with Jehovah again .
They will correct him in a calm and gentle way. — Read Leviticus 5 : 1 ; Galatians 6 : 1 .
WE NEED COURAGE TO BE LOYAL TO GOD
15 , 16 .
Why did Hushai need courage to be loyal to God ?
15 Hushai was one of King David ’ s loyal friends .
When people wanted to make Absalom king , Hushai needed courage to stay loyal to David and to God .
He knew that Absalom had come to Jerusalem with his soldiers and that David had run away .
( 2 Samuel 15 : 13 ; 16 : 15 ) But what did Hushai do ?
Did he abandon David and support Absalom ?
No .
Although David was old and many people wanted to kill him , Hushai stayed loyal to him because Jehovah had appointed David to be king .
So Hushai went to the Mount of Olives to meet David. — 2 Samuel 15 : 30 , 32 .
16 David asked Hushai to go back to Jerusalem and pretend to be Absalom ’ s friend so that he could convince Absalom to listen to his advice instead of Ahithophel ’ s .
Hushai was courageous and risked his life to obey David and to stay loyal to Jehovah .
David prayed that Jehovah would help Hushai , and that is what happened .
Absalom listened to Hushai instead of Ahithophel. — 2 Samuel 15 : 31 ; 17 : 14 .
17 .
Why do we need courage to be loyal ?
17 We need courage to be loyal to Jehovah and obey him instead of doing what our family members , workmates , or government authorities want us to do .
For example , ever since he was a little boy , Taro , in Japan , did all he could to make his parents happy .
He obeyed them and was loyal to them , not just because he had to , but because he loved them .
But when he started to study with Jehovah ’ s Witnesses , his parents wanted him to stop .
This made him sad , and it was very difficult for him to tell them that he had decided to go to the meetings .
Taro says : “ They were so angry that for years , I was forbidden to visit them at home .
I prayed for courage to stick to my decision .
Now their attitude has softened , and I can visit them regularly . ” — Read Proverbs 29 : 25 .
18 .
How have you benefited from this study ?
18 Like David , Jonathan , Nathan , and Hushai , may we too feel the satisfaction that comes from being loyal to Jehovah .
We never want to be like Abner and Absalom , who were not loyal .
It is true that we are imperfect and make mistakes .
But let us show Jehovah that being loyal to him is the most important thing in our lives .
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 7 ) Some names have been changed .
SOME EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED
If we are loyal and humble , we will not focus on what we want but on what Jehovah wants us to do
If we are loyal and kind , we will try to help others , and we will treat them the way Jehovah wants us to
If we are loyal and courageous , we will obey Jehovah even when it is difficult or when we feel afraid
