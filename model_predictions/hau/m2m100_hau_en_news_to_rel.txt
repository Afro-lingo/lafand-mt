Would he want me to explain to Jesus why I am listening to the video games? ’
Our enthusiasm about Jehovah will force us to mislead what is not proper to Christians, even if we are selling what is too old.
[The Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) household, 19: 19, 20] We have promised to use our life to bring about the blessing of Christ.
Therefore, we should not have a room for us to learn lessons from Jesus Christ. — Matt 5: 29, 30; Phillips 4: 8.
11. (a) How do we encourage the love of Jehovah and Jesus to speak with us? (b) How do we encourage the love of God to help the people from other parts of the world?
Our commitment to Jesus will encourage us to practice and teach humanity.
Matth 28: 19, 20 ; Luka 4: 43 ) During the re-appearance of Jesus Christ, would you have prepared your work to serve a dignified servant for a single period of time and give you 30 or 50 hours for a dignified servant?
A 84-year-old brother and his wife find themselves unable to practice because he is aged and disappointed.
But the supporters in his district wanted to help him.
They booked on him a car and selected an appropriate territory to live in there.
That made the brother even achieved his 30-year goal.
Can you help someone in your church serve for a single term in March or April?
Everybody is not able to serve practitioners, but we can use our time and our money to serve God again.
Like bulus, if we do this, we will show that the love of Jesus is driving us.
What is the hope that God will encourage us to do?
Everybody must be vigilant in this regard.
12
What does God's grace encourage us to do?
12 Second, our greetings towards Allah are a source of friendship for us.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "If our enemies are humiliated like this, we must be humiliated like one another." [The Holy Quran, Ayah 4: 7-19] Therefore, if we understand what humiliation means, we need to humiliate ourselves.
(1 John 3: 16) How can we prove that we are opposed to them?
13
What example was that Jesus stood beside the people?
13 The example that Jesus sets out shows us how to compete with others.
When he comes to the world, he helps people, especially those who are slow.
He advised guards, babys, babys, and babys.
(Math 11: 4, 5) Unlike religious leaders, Jesus heard the lessons of the people who wanted to know about God.
[The Holy Quran, 7: 49] He conveyed the opposing group and made a lot of efforts to help them.
Can you help the elderly people in service?
(Take a look at page 14)
14
What would you do to show yourself sympathetic?
14 Thro the time of Jesus’ death, it would be appropriate to think about the ways in which you can help your family members, especially the elderly people.
Can you bring them together?
Can you provide them with food and help with the help of the Iranian nation - with the help of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic?
(Luke 14: 12-14)
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on your brothers.
We give good news to your brothers.
15
What should we know?
15 Third, the divine blessings of the Lord of the Worlds are encouraging us to tread the path of our brothers.
Our souls went viral and died from Adam so that no one would say, “I do not need his own.”
He needs a divine servant even more.
All of us have been treated a lot of bushes!
Why is it important to know this?
This answer was embodied by Jesus Christ.
16, 17. (a) What should we learn from the equivalence of Jesus to a particular person and to his servant? (b) After discussing Jesus’ equivalence, what should we mean?
16 Jesus gives himself the amount of money he paid for his servants at least 60 million diners.
However, this panegyrist could not at all belong to his brother who had paid his money not just 100 dollars.
The servant should feel secure from the servant as if the servant feel secure.
The archbishop was so sad that he heard the story that the servant had not been informed of his colleagues.
He said, “You are a bigot!
“I’ve spent all of you so much that you prayed me, right now, you didn’t even feel the blessing of your companion as I feel your blessing?
(Matth. 18: 23 - 35, The Holy Book.) Like this authority, Jehovah offered us a lot of insight.
What should be motivated by the love of God and his soul for us?
17 When we are prepared to Meet Jesus’ death, we should ask ourselves, ‘One brother has lost my life?’
“Who’s he trying to get him up? ‘
If that was the case, we would have to learn a lesson about the “diviner” of Jehòbá during the time of Jesus Christ’s death.
If we are thankful for the responsibility of the Lord of the Worlds, we will show enthusiasm and cooperation with the people with our hearts.
If our brothers and sisters were not humiliated by God, God would not humiliate us.
When we look at the people, this does not mean that they will not lose our life, but that they will help us be happy in the future.
18
How could Allah's favor help to a Christian brother?
18 He does not allow us to imbue the status quo of our brothers.
[The Holy Quran, 4 : 32; Colossia 3 : 13 and 14]
This was done by a friend named Lily. [ 1 ]
She helped a test called Carol.
For example, she is pushing Carol wherever she goes and helping her with a few friends. She has also done a lot of things to her.
Meanwhile, Carol accuses Lily of being very helpful to her and sometimes she doesn’t have enough to help Carol.
However, Lily has been careful about the Carol’s positive behavior and has helped her so much that Carol sufferes serious infection.
Though she was not enough to help Carol, Lily said about her: “I have seen Carol Sad straying from death.
I just want her to be a perfection.”
In fact, greetings be upon Allah's mercy and blessings will push us to stay together with our friends and listen to them when the appointments will not be fulfilled.
19
What is the divine gift “which is the first to speak”?
19 Indeed, Jehova gave us the gift “which is the first to speak.”
Let us have a lot of thanks for this!
During the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) time, we should pay attention to the things that Jehovah and Jesus did for us.
Eventually, Jehovah and Jesus are very close to us. Therefore, let us learn more from Jesus so that we can humiliate and humiliate our brothers and sisters with our hearts.
[ 1 ] (Figure 18) Some names have been changed in this link.
What is the meaning of words
Let something encourage you: If something encourages us to take a step, we are trying to do what we should do.
When we accepted the gift of his life that Jehovah had bestowed on us, that forces us to be thankful to him and take Jesus Christ behind us.
Jesus Christ's death season: This is the seat of Jesus Christ's death season and a few weeks later.
Sometimes, it involves months of March, April and May

The holy soul witnesses us
“We are witnessed by the soul of itself. We are served by Allah. ” [The Holy Quran, 8: 16]
Scribblers: 109, 108
What are the appropriate nations for teaching us to safeguard our humble with a pure soul?

What happened in Fentakos in which the day was sensitive and how did it fill the message made in the Holy Book?
(Take a look at the image on this page.)
FENTAKOS' 33-year Sunday is an exceptional day.
People celebrate Fentakos.
This is an event which has been celebrated during Carnival events.
“Savannah Grassroots is an aggressive military attack, just as it has always been done.
After this, he presented two of the heads of his father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's father's son.
2 Philosophers hold this meeting almost every year.
This narration depends on an important event in Fentakos of the 33th year.
This is true of the 120 Jesus Mosques praying in one hour at the Upper House in Jerusalem.
[The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet Joel spoke about these events eight years before.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 28-22] What is more important than this?
3 Coroner’s works 2 : 2 – 4.
Allah the Exalted gave these Christians the immaculate soul in 33th Fentakos.
[The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said that what happened is very important.
He told the people who came together: â€œAgainst each one of you â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€œAgainst each other â€.
On the day 3,000 people were martyred and received a holy soul. — Ayatollah Khamenei the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
4. ( a) Why should we talk about what happened in Fentakos? ( b) What is important had happened several years before?
(Take a look for more details )
4 What is the main prism and the daily presence of the phenkatos?
The archbishop represents Jesus.
The two classes represent the witch-hunting of Jesus Christ.
[The Holy Quran, 14: 39] Allah has chosen these magnanimous men among the most humble men of the world, and He has called them “the most humble men.”
[The Holy Quran, 1: 18] He has chosen them to be sacrificed by Allah the Exalted, and He has chosen them to be sacrificed with Jesus Christ.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 9] Jehovah will benefit from the throne thanks to the brotherhood of Adam.
Therefore, the 33-year-old Fentakos Day is very important for us whether we should go to the highest levels or we should live in the highest levels of the world. [ 1 ] — View more.

How do we know that the situation of Christianity is different?
The 5 members of the council that gathered this morning would never forget what happened that day.
It was something like a fire falling on each one.
Ayatollah Khamenei asked them to do something or not.
In fact, this shows that they have been subjected to a holy soul.
(2: 6-12) However, it was not the Christians who witnessed this evil ceremony with their immaculate soul.
For instance, the Holy Book does not say something like a flames of fire on thousands of people who were barred and burnt up in Jerusalem on the day.
[The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Armenian family and the Armed Forces are not even affected by the Armenian family.
Some Samarians became victims just after their baftism.
[The Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him and his household) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him, the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him, the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him, the Holy Prophet's) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's) household, the Holy Prophet's (God's) household,

What were the vaccines found and how did they affect them?
6 Christians realized that the way Allah saw them was very different.
Some people realized that Jehobah had inflicted them.
And some people understood this later on.
But all of them were witness to what the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said in the past: “You who are righteous, you who have been belonged to the Holy Spirit, the Holy Prophet’s (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet’s (s.w.a.) household.
[The Holy Quran, 1: 13, 14] Therefore, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) used the holy soul to convince these Christians that He had chosen them to go.
The holy soul is the “sacrifice” that shows that it will survive in the future, not in the modern world. — Corinthians 1: 21, 22; 5: 5.
Every victim of Christianity should not approve of anything that bans him from serving God.
7
What should every enlightened Christian do to his higher salaries?
7 When a Christian is attacked, does this mean he will definitely be returned to him?
No.
In fact, he became sure that he was more outstanding than he did.
However, he's only able to find his reward when he's trusting God.
[The Holy Quran, 10: 11] For this reason, brothers, you should not allow any kind of Christian to accept your call and vote. And when you do these things, you will not allow any kind of vote. And when you enter the arena, you will be able to enter an infallible person within the seat of our Lord and the Lord, Jesus Christ.
It is clear that Allah has chosen more to him, but He will not be rewarded if He does not have trust. [The Holy Quran, 3: 1].
How do people choose?
8, 9. (a) Why can’t most people understand what’s going on in a holy city with a holy soul? (b) How can one realize that Allah has chosen him to go?
8 Today the majority of the servants of Jehovah will not understand what happened to a person after he had a holy soul.
This is not surprising that they are not affected by a sacred spirit.
Allah the Exalted created mankind to survive in this world for always.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 28] However, a number of them had been chosen by Jahobah in the past.
Therefore, the blessedness that God has bestowed on them becomes a replacement for their thoughts and forgiveness for the sake of life in the hereafter. [The Holy Quran, 1: 18]
9 But how do they know he's been attacked and he's going further?
Consider what the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) told the Roma brothers and sisters who were elected to be pure.
He said, 'You should not receive the holy souls of fear, but you should receive the unity of the spirit where we call Abba, Uba.
Our souls and our souls are witnessed by God.
[The Holy Quran, 1: 7; 8: 15, 16] Allah the Exalted uses the holy spirit to prove to his brothers and sisters that He has chosen them to eat up with Jesus Christ.
10
What is 1 Ayah 2: 27 meaning of a message that says that the Christ does not need anybody to teach?
10 Those who have been selected by Allah to go ahead do not need anyone to tell them that they have been arrested.
It would be possible to convince themselves that they were jailed.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said to the Christians, "The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) has affected you, and you know the truth.
He reiterated: "You dear youth, because the Holy Spirit is in your heart and no one teaches you.
The truth is not false. But as the enemy has learnt you, you should stay in it." [The Holy Quran, Ayah 20: 27]
But, they didn’t need anyone to prove them that they were detained.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and referred to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and referred to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
How do they collect marriage?
11, 12
What a Christian thought would have been, but what is the certainty of it?
When the spirit of Christianity is sacred, it turns its nature to a great extent.
He said Jesus Christ, they were “born from below.”
(Yohanna 3: 3, 5) He reiterated: “Don’t be surprised to tell you that I am about you, but you must be deceived from within.
You should know where it is going, but you should not know where it is going. You should know where it is going, but you should not know where it is going.
[The Holy Quran, 3: 7 and 8] The sapling can indeed reveal his identity to a innocent person. [The Holy Quran, 3: 7 and 8] — See more.
The victim was convinced that Jehobah had chosen him and he had no doubt in him.
12 Whoever is busy with a holy soul can think about it: ‘Why has Jehovah chosen me instead of choosing another?’
He would even imagine that he could not find an outcome like that.
However, it turned out that Jehobah had chosen him and he had no doubt about it.
He's happy and thankful for this opportunity.
“Thank God, our Lord, Jesus Christ, who bestowed his sacrifice on his holy soul, on the earth of Jesus Christ, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the earth of a woman, on the
13
What is the behavior of a person to change his life with a holy soul and why should he change his life?
13 Before the sacrifice of Jehovah, the brothers and sisters chose to go to the battlefields, to survive forever in the world.
It took a time when Jehobah was going to defeat the wolfish and bring the world to espionage.
Certainly, they thought that their brothers or friends would be forced to death.
In addition, they took the time to build homes inside, to plant and to bomb the war veterans.
[The Holy Quran, 65: 21-23] Why should they change their view?
Did they do this because of frustration or difficult experiences?
Were they thinking that living forever in the world will not be happy at all?
Or do they want to be witness to the improvement of life?
No.
Instead, it was Allah who bestowed this advice on them.
When he chose to select them, he used his self-sufficiency, that is to say, his immaculate soul, to change their view of labor and management.
14
How many people feel about their life in the world?
14 Does this mean that victims are willing to death?
But we do not want to be humble, but we do not want to be humble, but we do not want to be humble, but we do not want to be humble, but we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble, and we do not want to be humble.
They feel secure and want to pray for Jehobah every day with their families and friends.
But in their affairs, they must not forget what God has promised for them in the future. — 1 Corinthians 15: 53; 2 Petrus 1: 4; 1 Johannes 3: 2; 3 Ru'a 20: 6.
Is the Lord of the Worlds?
15
What does it mean that a man is not affected by a holy soul?
15 Those you think or Jehobah has chosen you to go more.
If you think he is doing this, you should pay attention to these important questions: How do you think you are making a lot of efforts in the exhibition?
How do you think that the Holy Book is based on divine teachers? [The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, and Quran?
What does it mean that God is more than you do?
How do you tread the people through your heart and see that you have your right to help them be sacrificed for Jehovah?
Have you seen certain events in your life showing that Jehovah has helped you?
If your answer to these questions belongs to you, does this mean that Jehovah has chosen you to go ahead?
No.
What do he do?
That is to say, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, and the Lord of the Worlds.
In addition, Jehobah can give everybody the holy soul of his father a lot of things in his mind, whether he has been elected or not.
The truth is that if you think that God has voted for you, it means that you have not been elected.
Those who were elected by Jehobah should know that they were elected, and they were no doubt about it.
16
How do we know that those given to the holy soul have not been elected to go ahead?
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) contains many instances of servants who have received holy souls, but not more.
One of them is Yohanna Bastism.
Jesus said there was no one else than Yohanna, but he said Yohanna would no longer be ornamented.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] Dauda is an immaculate soul.
[The Holy Quran, 16: 13] A holy soul helps him to understand what is important about Jehovah. In addition, he will learn from the holy soul and write in the Holy Book sections.
[Marcus 12: 36] The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) however, said the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) not to the end of his life.
[The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household household houses.
Did this mean that their branches do not come and they are going to change to the above?
No.
That is to say, the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will have a living in the world. [The Holy Quran, 5: 28, 29] The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will have a living in the world.
17, 18. ( a) What is the majority of Jehovah’s servants today? ( b) What kind of questions will we discuss in the near future?
17 The majority of the divine servants today will not come to no more.
Abraham, Daud, Yohanna Baftism, and many other men and women who surviv in that world are the first people to survive in the world of sabotage by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] Jesus Christ will be sacrificed for more than 144,000 casualties.
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) contains a number of references that have taken place in the world at the end of modern times.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 17] But most of them died and died.
18 But if somebody says he is affected, what should those who are interested in living in the world take him away?
What should you do if somebody in your class commemorates the death of Jesus Christ?
Additionally, if there is an increase in the number of infections, should we be careful about it?
We will answer these questions in the near future.
[ 1 ] (Figure 4) Eid al-Fentakos is usually performed on the right time when Allah has bestowed a law on Moses in the city of Sinai.
[The Holy Quran, 19: 1] Similarly, just as Moses was used by God to conclude a meeting with the people of Israel in the year 1513 before the birth of Jesus, it was also used by Jesus to promise the sacrifices of Jesus Christ in the year 333.

What is the meaning of words
Change a person with a holy soul: Jehobah uses the holy soul to select a person to slide up with Jesus Christ in the upper hour.
The holy spirit is for those who are “confident” that they will go higher in the future.
These Christians can say their holy souls are witnessed to them, or they can say their sins is superior.

Eid al-Adha, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, said, “One of the ten tongues of nations will capture a neck which is not Jewish. They say, We will go with you and we will finally hear the story of God with you.”
[The Holy Quran, 8: 23] This revelation represents those in whom God has served a holy soul.
They are also called, “Israeli of Allah.
(6: 16) The thousands of people represent those who want to live forever in the world.
They know that Jehobah is blessing for these sacrifices and they see that they are just treating God for the sacrifices.
Just like the two prophets of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), Jesus says that the people of God will be together.
He compared those who have the right to go to more than “the minor garbage” and those who have the right to survive in the world with “those who are humble. ”
However, Jesus says their bodies will be “one garbage” and take it as a “one enemy.”
After the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household in Yau Ma Tei, there are two people who can think about this issue. (Luke 12: 32; Yohanna 10: 16) There are two kinds of household in Yau Ma Tei, and there are some people who can think about this issue. (Luke 12: 32; Yohanna 10: 16) There is a number of people in Yau Ma Tei, and there is a number of people in Yau Ma Tei.

Of course, Allah the Exalted has chosen them to go more, they will be able to find more if they are safe.
The chief, who knew this, used the “false prophets” to “fend up” them.
(24: 24), The Holy Book, the Holy Quran, is not sure that they will be followed by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) until Jehovah has revealed to them that they are safe.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was the son of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.). He was the son of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).

This immaculate book description references to one Bayahude.
But the fact that she says “you” means that there are many people.
This means that Bayahuden is not just an individual but represents the crowd of innocent people.
Both men and women should know this and they pray to God for it.
They do not need to identify the names of everybody in this category.

If a man does not have a relationship with God and does not have a relationship with God, he will not give up to God.

What opinion should Christians have about themselves?
6 Bulus told Christians: “My dear ones, I ask you to go according to the name that you have been referred to by God.
How should they do this?

[The Holy Quran, 4: 1 - 3] The holy spirit of Jehovah helps his servants become stupid and misguided.
[The Holy Quran, 3: 12] Therefore, the hardships are not comparable to other people.
They know that Jehobah has not provided more holy souls to the sacrifices of his servants than any other servant.
And I do not think that they will learn more than everybody else about the Holy Book.
Additionally, they will not tell another person that he was injured and that he was henceforth busy with the wedding ceremony at Jesus Christ.
Instead, they are analysts and they know that only Jehovah can elect the people to go ahead.
7 and 8.
For example, if we are a Christian or not, why should we not?
7 Even if victims feel that they have been elected more than they did, they do not expect that the people should be respected for this reason.
[The Holy Quran, 1 : 18 and 19]
And they know that Jehovah has not told everybody that he should have a holy soul.
Hence, the victims would not be surprising if some people were not honest with the victims.
He remembered that the Holy Book told us to refrain from approving a person who said God had given him a special list.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 2] If he is patient, he will not be able to say that the people are more than any other people, and he will not be able to say that the people are more patient than any other people.
Sometimes, he could not tell anyone about it.
He will not grieve for the unscholarly things he will do when he goes up. — 1 Corinthians 1 : 28, 29 ; 1 Corinthians 4 : 6 — 8.
8 Christian peasants do not realize that they should stay together with other peasants only because they are in a group.
They will not seek proof of the Holy Book alone and they will not seek proof of the Holy Book alone. They will not seek proof of the Holy Book alone and they will not seek proof of the Holy Book alone.
(1: 15-17) The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household will not be together if the oppressors do so.
Additionally, this would allow the immaculate spirit that helps the people of God to have mercy and unity. — Roma 16: 17 and 18.

Why do you need to be careful about how you and the victims of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household are performing at the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) wedding?
(That’s how to look for the regiment: “The community is not offline. ” )
9 How should you think of your brothers and sisters?
Jesus told his companions, “You are brothers.”
He continues: “Anyone who can take revenge will get tired; anyone who can take revenge will get tired.”
[The Holy Quran, 23: 8-12] Therefore, we should not take respect for anybody even if he is a slain.
When the Holy Book tells us about elderly people, he encourages us to learn from them, but he does not tell us that we are the people of Adam, our Master.
[Ibranians 13: 7] The Holy Book says, "There are two dimensions."
But this is because they work hard to speak “with learns,” not because they are subjected to a sacred spirit.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 17] If we celebrate with the same sacrifices, they will not be rewarded.
Otherwise, we can make them great.
[The Holy Quran, 10: 3] No one among us should make a mistake like this.
What should you say with someone who is digging and cheating anably at the Conference on Jesus Christ?
(Take a look at the line from 9 - 11 )
10
How can we prove that we trust Christians?
10 How can we prove that we are respecting the people whom Jehovah has suffered from his immaculate soul?
We should not ask them how they act.
This does not affect us and we do not have the right to know.
[The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, and Quran]
This map is not false.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 12] We should not ask for questions.
For example, we should not ask the wife of the brother who was suffering from the holy soul of herself to survive eternally in the world without her husband.
We should be sure that in the new world, Jehovah will “between every one and every one” [The Holy Quran, 145: 16].
11
How do we criticize ourselves when we refuse to criticize people more than necessary?
11 We will punish ourselves if we are overwhelming more than any other brother.
How did she?
The Holy Book tells us that “brothers’ hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocritical hypocrisy of the Islamic Revolution.
[The Holy Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran, Quran,
[The Holy Quran, 25: 10 - 12] Therefore, if we refuse to advise more than necessary, those who have been subjected to a holy soul, those who have long served Jehovah, will not give up for the holy soul of the Iranian nation.
Instead of this, we will be honest with and we will continue to pray to Jehovah. — Yahuda 16.
How do we believe in the number of shadows?
12, 13
Why should we not be concerned about the number of people who are slandering and slandering on the occasion of Jesus Christ's death?
Over the past 12 years, the number of abducts and abducts has declined.
But recently, the number is growing.
Should we be concerned about this?
No.
Let us see what us should not be grieve.
13 “God knows his people. ” (2 Timotheus 2: 19) Jehovah knows those who are suffering from the holy souls, but his neighbours does not know how many people they are suffering from the holy shrine of the Holy Prophet of Jesus Christ.
Hence, there were more people in the country who thought they were infected but Jehobah did not infect them.
For example, some who are masqueraders and poachers have stopped with the backwardness.
Another figure is that they have a so-called problem with the minds of Christians and they thought that they would be deceived by Christians in the future.
In fact, we do not know how many drugs have been reduced in the world.
14
What is the Holy Book saying about the number of vaccines that will remain in the world of sabotage?
14 Shafaffo will be at the same spot — a spot in the world when Jesus comes and goes ahead with them.
The Holy Book says Jesus will “bring his angels with an outstanding re-appearance, and they will process his choices from four centuries, from that age to that age.”
[The Holy Quran, 24: 31] In addition to this, the Holy Quran says that in the last days, only the pain will decrease in the world.
[The Holy Quran, Ayah 12: 17] However, there is not an estimated population of more than one hundred people.
15, 16
What should we know about the 144,000 casualties that Jehobah had chosen?
15 Ayatollah Khamenei advised him when to choose a patient.
( Roma 8: 28 - 30 ) Jehovah waited in an eligible election after being brought about Jesus from death.
Just like the Christian mouth, it was the first time I was affected.
Several decades later, the majority of the people who claim to be Christians do not accept the principles of Christ.
Yet, in these years, Jehobah has taken on a number of Christian communities which have been following up the teachings of Christ.
Jesus had likened these Christians to those who were pure and noble people.
[Matth 13: 24 - 30] In the last days, Jehovah had continued his elections for a total of 144,000 people. [ 2 ]
Therefore, if Allah the Exalted gives righteousness to the finalists, we know that He is doing the right thing.
(Isaiah 45: 9; Daniel 4: 35; Roma 9: 11; 16.) [ 3 ]
We should be careful not to look like those who were worse in the way of their Lord and those who finished the last hour. [The Holy Quran, 20: 8-15]
16 It is not the case that the heads of the brassroots are contained in the “senior servants”.
[The Holy Quran, 24: 45-47] Ayatollah Khamenei used to teach a lot of people in the past, just as they did in the first century.
Only Armenian Christians were the first to write the Holy Quran in the Holy Quran.
Today, only a few guards have the right to save “their food in his lot.”
17
What have you learnt from this link?
17 What should we learn from in this regard?
God will bestow life on a majority of his people in the world.
But those who follow Jesus will survive better.
Jehobah blesses his servants, ‘Bahuden’ and ‘ten people.’
Both men should be honest with it and they should be together.
In addition, all of them need to work hard to retain peace in the circle.
As the end is passing, let’s continue to worship God and receive Christ as a sacrifice.

Campaign “Don’t Stop Disruption”
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "Aauna has a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, a lot of wealth, and a lot of wealth."
Meanwhile, when we are familiar with our neighbors, we think about their feeling before saying something or doing something.
We're going to show that we are ranking the people who are leading them — the people in the Jehobah community as much as we do.
Sometimes, some neighbors like the Betel’s guardians, servants, members of the Committee, the Holy Prophet’s (s.w.a.) Shahid’s (s.w.a.) office, members of the Committee, the Holy Prophet’s (s.w.a.) Shahid’s (s.w.a.) workshops and a group of assistants can visit our church or the festival where we are attendance.
In fact, we want them to be respected with women, and this is in fact good.
We do not want to be like Dioturifis, who has not married the friends who visited their church and did not see them beautifully.
[The Holy Quran, 9: 10] If we trace these brothers, will what we do to show that they are not superior to all of us?
How can this happen?
Of course, we feel happy to come together and speak with the friends who have come to us, we should not be like the people who are interested in sports.
For example, we should not photograph people without their permission, when they eat or when they do something.
Should we tell them to join us in our books or in our Holy Book?
Should we send people and think we took pictures with them?
How do you think that those who participated in our first meeting would be affected by this situation?
In fact, if we agree with our neighbors, we would not be showing such things.
Instead, we will show that we understand why they visit us and what hard they are doing for our sake.
What can help us know how to live with our neighbors?
First of all, we should remember that God is the only one that we should apologize to.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 11] Second, we think that we should appreciate these brothers and sisters, but we should not take them like an athlete.
These brothers love us like our brothers.
Third, we remember that Jesus says, â€œAgainst the people make whatever they like.â€.
(7: 12) If we follow these values, we will prove that we are honest with our neighbors and we will not be “insensitive”.
What is the meaning of words
Ten people will “ go together” with Bayahude: Both men betray to Jehovah along with these Christian chefs but do not expect that the chefs are their leaders, and they do not appreciate them exceeding value.
Instead, those who are treated by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are treated by the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Meeting God is a pleasant meeting.
“We are working with him and we pray to you not to receive divine blessings.” — 2 Corinthians 6: 1.
VICTORY: 75, 74
Why should we fight against violence?
What makes us happy?
How can we be close to God and the people?
Is he killing us?
1
Of course, if Jehovah is the Holy Prophet, what kind of power has he given to humanity?
JEHOBAH is the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and he is spiritual to all of us.
In addition to this, he has a lot of wisdom and power.
He helped Ayuba understand this, and Ayuba said, “I know you have the right to do something, not anybody who has come to prevent you from doing what you wanted.”
[The Holy Quran, 42: 2] Jehovah can do whatever he wants without the help of anybody.
But because he belongs to us, he encourages us to work with him to his purpose as well.
2
What was the important thing that Jesus had done?
2 Jesus Christ was created by God before he realized other things, especially human beings.
Jehobah advised Danny to work with him on the issue of materialistic matters.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said about Jesus Christ: "Everything is indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed.
[The Holy Quran, Colossians 1 : 15 - 17] Jehovah gave his son an important task and told man about it.
This is not a minority!
3
What was it that Jehova told Adam to do, and what should he do?
3 Jehovah asked man to work with him.
Adam, for example, gave his job to animals.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 19, 20] Without a doubt, Adam was so proud to do these things.
He took a look at the characteristics of animals and their behavior to give an appropriate name to them.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) achieved divine achievements in the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
May God and Adam become the hereafter of the world.
[The Holy Quran, Pharaoh 1: 27-28] However, Adam decided to stop working with God later and made it too difficult for his followers. [The Holy Quran, Pharaoh 3: 17-19, 23]
4
How do some people work with God in order to His purpose?
4 Later on, Allah instructed some people to work with Him.
Nuhu built an airplane with his family during the Regyawa.
Musa saved the people of Israel from Egypt.
Joshua brought —from Israel to the Territory of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Sulemanu built a basiji in Urushalima.
Mary became the father of Jesus.
Many of those faithful and faithful people worked with Jehobah in order to his goal.
5
What was the job that Jehovah recommended for us and we needed his help?
(Screenshot from page 27.)
5 Today, Jehovah invites us to try hard to support His Kingdom.
There are many ways to give in to God.
Of course, if our condition is different, we can pay attention to the reign of power.
Jehobah can do this himself, and he can speak to Adam directly.
In addition, Jesus says that Jehovah can tell people about Him and His Kingdom.
(1 Corinthians 3:9) The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said, "I work with him and we pray to you not to accept divine blessings.
Let us find a few reasons why we are happy about this.
Meet us with God’s blessings
6
How was it that the first child of God was to compare with his father when he used to work with his father?
6 Working with Allah makes the servants of Jehovah happy.
Jesus Christ came to God and said, ‘God has made me from the beginning of His path.’
And this is what I am doing. And this is what I am doing. And this is what I am doing.
[The Holy Quran, 8: 22, 30] When Jesus worked with his father, he was happy to many things, and he knew that Jehovah was close to him.
What we do?
There is no sense of responsibility for the Holy Book (Figure 7)
7
Why makes us happy having a basiji?
7 Jesus says we are happy to be gifted with and to be gifted with.
[The Holy Quran, 20: 35] We are happy to be sacrificed for the sake of God, but why are we happy to be sacrificed for the sake of humanity?
Let us see how happy the people are when they realize what the Holy Book teaches and how they interact with God.
In addition, we are happy to see that they have changed their perception and lifestyle.
Obscurity is the most important and the most valuable thing we have done, and it makes those who are friends of Allah to survive. [The Holy Quran, 5: 20]
8
Who said some people that they were happy to work with Jehobah?
8 I hope that God will bestow His blessings on him and on the people.
This makes us happy as well.
(1 Corinthians 15: 58 )
Marco, who lives in Italy, says: “I’m happy to know that I can try to go to Jehobah so he will not forget the job I have done.”
Eventually, Franco, who serves in Italy, reiterates: “By his remarks and other important points, Jehobah reminds us every day that he listenes to us and points that are very important for us, even if we think that this issue is very important for us.
He made me happy to work with God and made her life meaningful.”
LAST ARREST AND LAST ARREST - Khamenei.ir
9
What is the relationship between God and Jesus Christ?
9 When we work with those with whom we neighbors, we are getting closer to them.
We become familiar with their behavior.
We know what the bodies have created and what they are trying to do so.
Jesus Christ has worked with Jehovah for hundreds of years.
That is to say, they are extremely close to one another and they are not able to lose their relationship.
Jesus explained their relationship with God: “I have the same Uban.”
[The Holy Quran, 10: 30] They indeed have a bond with one another, and they have acted without any problems.
Waazie strengthenes our heads because it makes us remember what God has promised and what He has done.
10
Why should weakness make us close to God and the people?
10 Jesus prayed that God bestow His shrine on him.
What do he do?
He prayed, “To be the same as us.”
[The Holy Quran, 17: 11] If we live a happy life with the blessings of God, we will understand His evil behavior.
We will learn what is appropriate for us to rely on Jehovah and follow his ideals.
And Allah will get us closer.
(Scribbling 4 : 8 )
We approach our neighbors to face the problems that they face and the things that are making us happy are what makes our neighbors happy.
We work with joy and we manage to resolve problems with each other.
Another friend, Octavia, from United Kingdom, said: “Act with Jehobah makes me closer to the people.
She argued that now her friend with the people was about their loved ones and their dreams.
In fact, we have the same identity as one.
That is to say, the fact that we are moving closer to the brakes - the fact that our friends are trying to give good news to Jehovah - makes us get closer to them.
11
Why should we get closer to Jehobe and our brothers in the new world?
11 We are thankful to Allah and our neighbors now, but we will be closer to them in the new world.
think about the great achievements that will be made in the future!
We're treating those who were given to death and teaching them about Jehovah.
We will work for ourselves, people of the world.
The fact that we are working together under the sanctuary of Christ will make us feel very happy.
The hearts of Adam will get close to one another and to Jehovah, the one who will “bet for every one’s life” [The Holy Quran, 145: 16].
Meet us with divine blessings
12
How do we manage to do something that we should do?
12 We want to build our relationship with Jehovah so that we live in the world of Shia and we are immoral.
Therefore, we should easily think like the people of the world and we should act like the people of the world.
This stops going on in the caves of the rainfall and encourages us to go where we are not.
For this reason, we should try to move forward to a certain direction.
In fact, we need to try to deny the influence of the Shia world.
How do we manage to do something that we should do?
When we talk about Jehovah and the Holy Book, we focus our attention on important and important things and things that will not let our relationship with God pass away.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 8] The worship of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) encourages us to remember what Allah has promised and what He has done.
Additionally, he helps us behave in the way of which we need to separate ourselves from the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household. [The Holy Quran, 6: 14-16]
If we sit by saying something that is good to our neighbors, then we will stop feeling grief about our problems.
13
How did a Mashaidi in Osterelia hear about performing?
13 If we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy, if we sit by the enemy,
Another brother, Joel in Ostareliya, said: “It helps me know about certain events, such as the challenges that people are facing and the ways in which the Holy Book Fair has accessed me.
Waazie helps me try to be a loud person. It helps me rely on Jehobah and our brothers. ”
14
Why do we want to say that the spirit of God is with us?
14 We should be sure that the divine spirit is with us.
For example, you have been given a breakdown to the people around you.
This ban is not going to be done and you will spend the money of the army to bring the people to this burodi.
In addition, the majority of people do not like bread, while some people even dare to bring the bread to them.
Will you have long to do this?
You will not have enough time to do this. You will not have enough time to do this.
However, we are continuing to speak without restraint, despite the fact that we use our money and our time and that people use us without restraint and that they use us without restraint.
This shows that the divine spirit is with us.
Labor and management - Khamenei.ir
15
How do they speak about divine blessings for the sake of man?
15 How does the expression of beefs mean that God is for human beings?
It is for human beings to survive forever and does not change it for human beings to survive.
[The Holy Quran, 55: 11] Allah has prepared the way to save us from defeat and death.
How did she?
Jesus Christ came to the world and gave rise to God.
However, human beings should be divine servants in order to benefit from the sacrifice.
Jesus Christ was teaching the people what God needed from them, and he ordered them to do what they needed.
If we speak to the people and help them be friends of God today, we are working directly with God in his preparedness to tell human beings to get dead and to die.
16
How do worshiping have the most important connection to God's command?
16 Now that we have helped the people to their life, this shows that we are close to them and that we are living with God.
That is to say, Allah the Exalted will help the people to survive and bring them to the truth. [The Holy Quran, 1 Timothy 2: 4] Saad and a Bafris asked Jesus what is more important.
This is the greatest law, it is the first.
And the second thing that is equivalent to you is to compete with your loved ones like your thirst.”
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 37-19] We have followed these commanders during the hajj ceremonies.
17
What do you think of gathering?
17 Eventually, Jehovah blessed us so much that he provided us with a source of joy for making us close to his family and establishing a close relationship with him.
Additionally, this task insults us to show that we are committed to God and the people.
Jehobah has millions of people around the world, and the situation of all of them is different.
But whether we are children, elderly people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people, wealthy people...
Our view is based on a friend named Chantel from France who said: “Allah the Exalted and the Exalted, happy enough, told me: ‘ Go, speak with my words with the only heart.’
I would like to encourage you, I would like to read the Holy Book of Experts and I would like to offer you a lot of assistance to the people and friends of the world.
In addition, I am teaching you and I am not telling you when it is right.”
The great opportunity is for us to do what Jehovah has bestowed on us and we should work with God.
What is the meaning of words
We work with Allah the Exalted and we help them become friends of God so that they can live forever.
Of course Allah the Exalted can do these things without the help of anybody, but He encourages us to work with Him in order to humiliate ourselves.
It makes us happy when we go through such efforts. It makes us happy when we go through such efforts.

A history
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution described victory as a victorious servant.
Corwin Robison told the story
“I’ve been informed that I was thrown into a prison to refuse to go to the military.
I asked, “Can you put me in prison?’
The second day, I was ordered to go to the military in America.
I was killed in 1926, in Crooksville, Ohio, America.
Our fathers were not worshipers, but they forced us to go to the shade. We were eight of our fathers.
I've been going to a group called methodists.
When I am 14 years old, the cart pushed me for having an unusual year or less on Sunday.
Margaret Walker (second brother from the left hand) is my educational assistant about Jehobah
Meanwhile, a well-known musician named Margaret Walker took a visit to her parents and spoke to her in the Holy Book.
She was a loving man of God.
One day I stood up with them and saw the sights but my father said she was going out and saw them.
But I could try my best to listen to them.
After some time, Margaret asked, “Can you know the name of God?’
I said, “Everyone knows that Allah is His Name.
[The Holy Quran, 83: 18] Go and look at the Holy Book.
When I take a look at you, I see that Allah the Exalted is the Name of God.
I am about to go and visit my friend and tell them: â€œIf you come home today and see the Holy Quran 83: 18 in the Book of Godâ€.
That was how I used to speak.
I visited the Holy Book and Bastism in 1941.
Shortly after that, it was said that it was not enough to conduct a classical book review.
I encouraged my parents and relatives to come and attend the event.
But my parents didn’t want that.
Later, when he was 15, his mother and aunt died in the same year.
I have been extracted from the classroom and have received many books from the Shiaid al-Jobah.
One day my father appeared to me in my book and said, “Can you see these things?
“I didn’t want them to go here and you left my home. ”
I left our home and decided to stay in Zanesville, an unprecedented state of where my parents were in the state of Ohio.
But I went home to strengthen her parents and relatives.
The mother tried to prevent the elephant from going to the parade.
Sometimes, if she goes to a meeting, she will be thrown out and taken home.
But her parents would fly out and go to the meeting.
I told my parents: ‘Don’t be careful, he will grieve you!’
With the passage of time, he refused to send her to a meeting.
When I was inaugurated at the School of Humanitarian Affairs in 1943, I began to speak as a student in our Islamic seminary.
The advice that I received from my school was very good.
Military attacks on Saturday
During the Second World War, in 1944, I was ordered to join the Army.
I’ve been at a soldier at Fort Hayes in Columbus, Ohio State. I have done a few tests — and I have done a few tests.
I told my friendship that I will not join the Army.
They allowed me to go home.
But after a few days, another person came to my house and said, “ Corwin Robison, I have been given permission to arrest you.”
After two weeks, we went to the court and the audience said: “I’m about to raise your life for you.
Do you have any information? “
He said, “Dear God, my magnanimous judiciary, I want to be taken as a spectator.
I am living in my home and I have spoken about the Kingdom of God to many people.”
The client told the ten-two audience that they were present in this meeting: “Don’t come here to advise if this man is barely barely or not.
You come here to tell us if he believes he is in the military or not. “
Between 30 minutes, a crowd of public attendants decided that I was guilty.
I was sentenced to five years in prison in Ashland, Kentucky State.
Ayatollah Khamenei sent me to prison
I did my first two weeks in a prison in the capital of Columbus, Ohio. The first day I didn't go out there.
I pray to Jehobah: “I will not have five years in prison.
I don’t know what I was doing.”
Others and sisters allowed me to go out in the street.
He was a big tune. We stopped looking behind him.
He asked, “What are you doing here in the street?’
He said, “I am the Mashaidin Jehobah.
He said, “What is really?
What are you doing here? “
He said, “The witnesses of God do not come to war and do not kill. ”
“They put you in prison to deny the crime,” he said.
But they put some in prison for making a mistake.
Is this appropriate?"
He said, “Yes, this was not right.
“I was 15 years in a prison where I was reading some of your books,” he said.
When I heard this, I prayed and said, "Savannah, help me this man."
The fisherman, Paul, said: “If these people are suffering from you, tell me only.
I will speak about them.”
Therefore, there were no restrictions in the 50 prospects of this prison.
I was one of the God-given Shahids in a prison in Ashland, Kentucky State for refusing to play a role in war.
The latter came to me in a prison in Ashland.
It was where I met many brothers and sisters.
They told us the verses of the Holy Book that we read every week and we have arranged questions and answers for the occasion that we call the Holy Book Fair.
We were in a big room with thousands of rooms near the palace.
There is a brother who prepares a space for us to eat.
He will tell me: “Robison, you’ll be doing this to those who were given this garden and that garden.
This is your region.
Dear God, make them speak before they go.
That was how we interpreted the Islamic system of prison.
Scribblers - Khamenei.ir
After the Second World War, in 1945, I was held in a particular prison for a while.
I am afraid of my parents and relatives because my father had told me once, “If I can leave you home, the others will not be able to do so with me.”
After I was surprised to see that seven people in our home were coming to the ceremony and that a girlfriend was baftismed despite the harassment of my father.
I am living with Demetrius Papageorge, a good brother who first visited Jehobah in 1913
When the war started between South and North Korea in 1950, I was asked to go where I was taken a Fort Hayes soldier to join the military service.
After a test was made for me, the enemy said, “Stop trying very well.”
“This is OK but I will not go into the Army,” he said.
Timotheus 2: 3 And I said, "I am a Christian."
One day, when he was silent, he said, ‘ Go!’
Unfortunately, I have attended a symposium for service fans in Bethel at the Cincinnati General Meeting in Ohio State.
The brother Milton Henschel told us that there are a need for sweet men in Betel.
So, I filled the foment and it was invited to me.
In August 1954, I had a lot of services in Brooklyn and have since stopped serving in Bethel.
In Betel, I have done a lot.
For many years I have worked in the maritime industry where my office was built and where I have been working for many years.
In addition, I have worked as a pharmacist as well as at the Majorities of Theatre, New York.
I work at the sea service where a office was built in Bethel, Brooklyn.
I would like to organize things that are done in Bethel like worshiping, worshiping and visiting the Family Security Council.
The same is true of the families of Shahid al-Jobah.
If parents and children talk about religious matters with each other, they engage in worshiping and worshiping families and they engage in ceremonial meetings with each other, then everybody in the family is so close to Jehobah.
I have many friends in Betel and the Coliseum.
Some of them were wounded and went up.
They are not stupidity.
However, the servants of Jehovah are even egalitarian for those who serve in Betel.
If I have a problem with a friend, I think we are different from that.
I think about the Holy Quran in Matt 5: 23 and 24 and how we can separate the issue between us.
It’s not easy to say “hurt,’’ but that’s how many problems can be eliminated.
Congratulations on Eid al-Adha
Now, he's not able to travel home for old me. But that didn't help me.
I have learnt the language of the Caina people and I have been listening to the words of Caina people on the street a lot.
Sometimes in the morning, I administered 30 or 40 comments for the people.
I'm visiting the Caina people in Brooklyn, New York
I've had a comment on the Holy Book in Caina!
One day, a beautiful girl murdered me and showed me a sweet potato.
I murdered her and contacted the Security and Awake House in Caina.
She received and called her Katie.
After that, Katie came to my bed and spoke to me whenever she saw me.
I learnt women the names of some of the poachers and poachers in Nollywood and he replicated the words after being poached.
In addition, I would like to explain something to women about the Holy Book and what the book was achieved by the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
But after a few weeks, I did not see any more.
After a few months, I gave a girl who supported the birthplace and welcomed her.
The next day, she took to me and said, “Say a thing to Caina.”
He said, “I don’t know anyone in Caina. ”
But she got out, so I received the phone and said, “Savannah, my name is Robison. ”
I heard a cry saying, “Robby, it’s Katie.
I’m waiting now.”
He said, “What? ”
Katie responded to her,” he said.
Robby, the woman who didn’t broadcast her brotherhood.
Learn to me a lot of good things.
Dear God, teach her how to teach me.
“Kery, I can try it with you.
I am thankful to tell me where you were. “
“It’s not too late, I have spoken about the last time with Katie’s brotherhood.
I hope that wherever the two girls are now, they will learn more about Jehovah.
It is 73 years now that I have been living with Jehobah and I am happy that he has helped me not fighting and that I have been safe to live in my prison.
Meanwhile, my brothers and sisters told me that the continuation of my sacrifices to Jehovah, despite the harshness of my father’s behavior towards me, has made them stronger.
Later on, the parents and the six brothers and sisters made sacrifices.
My father stopped being excited about us and attended some of our meetings before his death.
By Allah's favor, our neighbors and our friends will be killed and live in the new world.
We will be very happy when we celebrate with Jehobah and those with whom we live forever! * — Change for more details.
Corwin Robison died and was trusted with Jehobah until his death.
Jehobah calls him “Aminina”
[The Holy Quran, 41: 8] You dear Israel, the elected Jacob, are the daughter of Abraham.
VICTORY : 91, 22
What is your message?
How was the knowledge of Jehovah and his actions that strengthened the blessing of Abraham?
What did Abraham do to strengthen his relationship with God?
How can you teach Abraham to build a relationship with Jehobah?
1, 2. (a) How can we know that human beings can be friends with God? (b) What should we discuss in this meeting?
The day when we were born to our death, we need to be treated kindly.
Humanity needs strong bonds and strong friendships, not only friendship between men and women.
But we need villages from the place of Jehobah.
Many people are unacceptable that human beings are unable to establish a relationship with God because it is Allah the Exalted and the Exalted.
But we trust it!
2 Stories of the Holy Book show that a man can build a relationship with God at an all-time high.
We should learn from them.
What do he do?
To establish a relationship with God is the most important element in our life.
Let us take a look at the example of Abraham.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 23]
How do they become friends of God?
Abraham was very brilliant and he became closer to God and he was referred to as “the brother, the brother, the brother”.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 11] When you search for his example, you will ask your, ‘How can I learn the lessons that Abraham had shown, and how can I strengthen my relationship with Jehovah?’
How is Abraham believed in divine blessings?
3, 4. (a) Compared you with what was the greatest and most enlightened test of Abraham. (b) Why was Abraham prepared to use Ishaq as an evil test?
3 Thought to Ibrahim Sadiq (a.s.) when he was born at an old age at an all-time high. [ 1 ]
His daughter Ishaqu followed him back. He was 25 years old at that time.
Ishaqu possesses oil palm, his father, and it is too much of it that it can use it as a source of palm.
Ibrahim had made the slightest trip in his life.
But not for the sake of the old.
He has all his power.
He had a duty to defend themselves because Jehovah had told him to sacrifice his son. [The Holy Quran, 22: 1-8]
4 Efforting this test is the greatest part of the test that Abraham had suffered.
Some say that Allah the Exalted has commended Abraham to give his son a sacrifice to him.
Some say that Abraham had accepted that he had done this in a life-giving order to not be committed to his children.
Those who follow this phenomenon are ignorant and do not know what the exact phenomenon is.
Meanwhile, they do not know how it affects one's life.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 14-16] Abraham was not after God without thinking, but he did it because he had a mistake.
He knew that Jehobah would not tell him to do what would lose his life forever.
Abraham knows that when he gives rise to divine blessings, Jehobah blesses him and his children in a evil way.
What was it that Abraham needed for his sake?
He needs to know God and witness what he has done.
5
How did Abraham appreciate the knowledge of God and how did he appreciate this knowledge?
5 Sense of God.
Abraham was noble in a city called Ur.
Whoever is involved in smuggling, including his parents?
[The Holy Quran, 24: 2] How had Abraham learned about Jehovah from that moment?
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) says that the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was the son of Nuhu, the Shem of Abraham, and he lived until Abraham was 150 years old.
Shem was a very isolated man and a very brilliant person who told him about Jehobah.
Of course we do not know what happened, but it may be that from Shem Ibrahim took the name of Jehobah.
Ibrahim achieved this obedience in the holy city of Jehobah and helped him victory.
6.7 How did Ibrahim's face strengthen his bench?
6 Witnesses of God's Guests
How was Abraham witnessing things that reinforced his backwardness for Jehobah?
Some people think that it means that one should be prepared to do something and that it means that one should take action.
Abraham’s blessings be upon God, the Lord of the Worlds, and upon his immaculate soul.
[The Holy Quran, 14: 22] The Holy Quran referred to such great fear as worship.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 7] We want to be afraid of God when we want to build a relationship with Him.
[The Holy Quran, 25: 14] This was how Abraham began to pray to God.
7 And Abraham and Saratus should leave the city of Ur and go to the land where they have not been before.
They are not minor children and will remain in the battlefields until the end of their life.
Of course Ibrahim knew that doing this would involve many combinations and praised Jehobah.
Hence, Jehobah blessed him and arrested him.
For instance, his wife Saratu is a good man. When her hand was buried and almost killed, Jehobah arrested Ibrahim and Saratu for more than one year after that.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 10 - 20; 20: 2 - 7; 10 - 12; 17; 18] These events made Abraham's body stronger.
8
How will knowing God and witnessing his actions strengthen our relationship with him?
8 Can we create a relationship with God?
My dear ones,
Like Abraham, we need a lesson for Jehovah.
However, we will even find what we need to know about Jehovah and his works are in the Holy Book.
Today the things that can help us know Jehovah are more than Abraham.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 4; Roma 11: 33] The Holy Quran contains a lot of things that we should know about “The Holy Quran, the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran.
What we have learnt makes us close to Jehovah and appreciate him very much.
That is to say, we are committed to God and we believe that God will help us benefit from God.
He will encourage us and strengthen our hearts. We are trying to help him do this.
If we live a happy life with our hearts and souls, we will be happy to live a happy life with God.
[The Holy Quran, 34: 8] When we learn more about Jehovah, we will get closer to him.
Addressing Abraham to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household
9, 10. (a) How can the relationship between the two men and women be strengthened? (b) How can it be revealed that Abraham took his relationship with God through divine blessings and that he built the relationship with God through divine blessings?
9 Therefore, we need to strengthen our relationship on a daily basis.”
[The Holy Quran, 17: 17]
And spirituality is not just like the clothes that are used to be adopted.
It’s like a beautiful cave that needs water and water to grow.
Abraham took his relationship with Jehobah and tamani, and his blessings were continued.
How did they do this?
10 Abraham continued his prayers to God, and he never stopped being after God's fear.
For example, when he travels to Canada along with his family and servants, he continues to observe the command of Jehobah according to his advice.
A year before the birth of Ishaqu, Ab-al-Qassem Ibrahim was 99 years old, Jehobah told him that he had kept his residents in custody.
Did Abraham doubt God or demanded any permission for refusing to observe the commands of God?
No, but he relied on God and made good deeds on the day. — Pharaoh 17: 10-14, 23.
11
Why was Abraham concerned about Saduma and Gwamarata and how Jehobah helped him?
11 That is to say, Abraham was always after Jehovah, even in small dimensions, and this strengthened their relationship.
That made him feel like he can speak to Jehobah about every thing and ask for his help when he gets busy with many questions.
Abraham, for instance, was concerned about the issue that Jehobah told him that he would destroy Saduma and Gwamarata.
What do he do?
He feared that the dreadful people would be killed together with the people.
The latter was afraid of Lutu and his family members who were living in Saduma.
Therefore, Abraham relied on Jehobah, the “Master of the world”, and expressed his concerns on him.
Jehobah took his believers in the sand and showed to him that he was humble.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said that before he was judging, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) had closed to the people. [The Holy Quran, 18: 22-33]
12, 13. (a) How was it possible to know that Jehova has helped Abraham in the past? (b) How was it possible to know that Abraham is honest with Jehova?
Knowing God and helping him, Ibrahim improvised his relationship with God.
When Jehobah told him to present his son, he knew that Jehobah was a sincere, sincere and safe person at all times. He also criticized his people.
Abraham is sure that Jehobah does not change his father's life.
Why should we say this?
13 Before he left his servants, Abraham said, â€œAgainst the mercenaries with yourâ€, and we shall go there with yourâ€.
[The Holy Quran, 22: 5] What does Abraham mean?
If he had said they would come back with Ishaq, would he be wrong when he knew he was talking about him?
No.
In the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), Abraham knows that Ayatollah could have Ishaq (a.s.) from death.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 19]
Abraham knew that Zeinab al-Jobah was the one who was born by his wife Saratu, despite the fact that they were old.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 11, 12: 18] Therefore, it became clear that Jehovah could not do anything.
Abraham does not know what will happen that day.
However, he was astonished that even if his child dies, Jehobah will have him to fulfill God's promises.
Abraham was called for “those who are honest with the truth.”
Abraham believes that even if his child dies, Jehovah will have him to fulfill God's promises.
14
What kind of problem are faced with when you offer a sacrifice to Jehovah and how Abraham will help you like?
14 Of course, Jehovah does not say we should interview our friends today, but he wants to interview him.
Sometimes, we will not understand why Jehobah ordered others.
Have you ever heard these things?
For many, praising makes them a lot of trouble.
Some feelings and feelings of duty to speak with people who are not used to them.
They are afraid of being bitter in their schools or local areas.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 25] When you are told to do something or not, remember the descendants of Abraham and the future of his life.
If we take a look at the examples of these immaculate people, we will be encouraged to learn from them and get closer to our Master friend, Jehovah. [The Holy Quran, 12: 1 and 2].

A relationship that blesses you
15
Why should we be sure that Abraham is not aware of his servitude for Jehova?
15 Did Abraham know he follow the command of God?
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) says Abraham: “And his life is in the best of years.
[The Holy Quran, 25: 8] When Abraham was 175 years old, he could think about the many years of his life in the world.
What do he do?
To take his relationship with Jehobah at a very high level.
Of course, the Holy Book says that Ibrahim “is a long-year-old,” who had been happy with his life, does not mean that he had no hope of living in the future.
16
What kinds of joy can Abraham witness in his society?
16 The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) says Abraham.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 10] Abraham is sure that he will see this city in a certain way, and that he will survive under the reign of God on a daily basis.
In fact, Abraham is deceiving the Kingdom!
Dear God, establish Your relationship with God on a daily basis.
He will be happy to know that the instance of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) has helped the people of God twenty years ago.
Obviously, you will realize that the lifestyle of Jehobah towards Ishaq is very important.
[The Holy Quran, 11: 19] In addition to this, it learns that the sincere feeling of being prepared for the sacrifice of his son Ishaq has helped millions of memorized people to understand that Jehovah used to sacrifice his son Jesus Christ as a sacrifice to humanity.
[The Holy Quran, 3: 16] The example that Abraham created helped us to express our gratitude for his sacrifice, and no one had seen such a shamelessness before.
17
What was it that you projected and what will we discuss in the near future?
17 Let us have to study the descendants of Abraham.
Like Abraham, we need to know Jehovah and witness what He has done for our sake.
As long as we learn about Jehovah and as long as we follow him, we will witness He's blessings and His blessings.
(6: 10 - 12 )
Let us continue to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah forever!
In the following chapter, we will discuss a few instances of the three mentioned men who established their relationship with God.
[ 1 ] [for the 3rd layer] In that time, Abraham, Saratu Abram, Saraya were called.
But in that circle, we will use the names that Jehobah had given to us in the past.
What is the meaning of words
If we want to be friends with God, we need to know him very much.
The more we learn about him, the more we feel and the more we appreciate.
That would force us to rely on him and follow him.
If we continue to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah, our friendships will survive.

“God bestows acceptance on those who follow him.” — ZABURA 25: 14, The Holy Book.

What is your message?
What lessons can we learn from the friendships of Ruth and Jehobah?
Why is Sarki Hezekiya a friend of Jehovah?
What behavior led to Mary, the father of Jesus, to be the believer of the Lord of the Worlds?
1 - 3. ( a) Why should we be sure that we can be friends with God? ( b) The story of which we should talk about in this meeting?
It is said in the Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) that Abraham is a friend of God.
[The Holy Quran, 20: 7; Isaiah 41: 8; Sacred Defense, 2: 23] Abraham was the only Booker, the Holy Prophet's (God's greetings be upon him) father.
Did this mean he alone become a friend of Jehobah?
No.
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) says that we can have this opportunity.
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) contains stories of many men and women who were faithful in Him and were friends of Him.
(Savannah 25: 14, LMT )
They were part of a “happy witness event” mentioned by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
These are different people, but they are all friends of God. [The Holy Quran, 12: 1]
3 Let us take a look at the three individuals according to the Holy Book: (1) the safe man from the Moab-land, Ruth, (2) Hazekiya, the immaculate woman of Judaism, and (3) Maryam, a woman who was the father of Jesus Christ.
What lessons can we learn from becoming a friend of God?
She Meets with Family and Faith
4, 5. What kind of counseling is needed for Ruth and why should he choose the counseling?
(Screenshot from page 9.)
4 Naomi and her immaculate wife, Ruth and Orphan, are on a short trip from Moab to Israel.
When they marched, Orpah advised them to return to their home state, Moab.
But Naomi summoned the intention to where she came, the country of Israel.
That turned Ruth into a very strange situation.
What will she do?
Will it return to Moab to accompany it or will it carry down Naomi to Betalami? — Ruth 1: 1 - 8, 14.
5 Ruth Danger lives in Moab.
They can come back to their position, and experts will be vigilant about it.
She knows the people of Moab, their families and their culture.
Naomi will not be able to prove she will be happy to live in Bai’talami.
In addition, Naomi is afraid that she will not be able to find a man.
Therefore, Naomi told Ruth to return to Moab.
As we saw, Orpah’s return to the area was about to her and to her.
(Ruth 1:9-15) But Ruth refused to return to the village with their false gods.
6. (a) What a good advice was given to Ruth? (b) Why did Boaz say that Ruth was seeking support under Jehobah?
6 Ruth lessons about Jehobah from her husband’s place or from Naomi.
She learned that Jehobah was different from the gods of Moab.
Now, she is familiar with Jehovah and she knows that she has changed her feelings and has served him.
Therefore, Ruth received good advice.
She told Naomi: “Dear God, your worship will be due to you.
When we think of the love of Naomi, our hearts are conscious. (Ruth 1: 16)
But what was worse is that Ruth is committed to Jehobah.
It undermined Boaz and eulogized her because she believed in Jehobah and “seeked security under his faces.”
(Church of Ruth 2 : 12.)
Boaz's comments remind us how an bird was applying for safety under his father's guests.
(Zahura 36: 7 ; 91: 1 - 4 ) Eventually, Jehobah paid the price for Ruth and blessed her for her brotherhood.
Ruth didn’t give good news to give good advice to Jehobah.
7
Who can help those who are treating self-sacrifice for Jehobah?
7 Many people are searching for the Holy Book but they do not want to seek assistance from Jehobah.
They sacrificed the sacrifice to Jehobah and acted as a baftism.
When you get busy with this situation, think about why you are busy with sex.
Everybody has something to say.
[The Holy Quran, 24: 15] Your best counseling is the counseling counseling to Allah the Exalted.
If you trust Jehobah, you show that you are sure he will help you.
It will also help you to continue to love him or face certain problems.
What God did for Ruth was here.
“He’s thinking about individuals”
8
Recounting what happened to Hezekiya Sa’ad
8 The treatment for Hezekiya was very different from for Ruth.
He was born in a society that was served by God.
However, the hearts of Israel were not pure.
Hazekiya’s father, the sarki Ahaz, is a man.
They do not appreciate Allah's greetings, and many people offer sacrifices to the ill-wishers.
In addition, he met Hezekiya’s brothers and sisters with his false gods while burning them into the fire.
He was not at all witness to evil and misguided things. [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 10-17, Ayah 28: 1-3]
9, 10. (a) Why can Hezekiya eat grassroots? (b) Why should we not eat grassroots with God? (c) Why should we not think that the way we are educated is that we are pure or pious?
9 Those that Ahaz does can make His son Hezekiya confused with Jehobah
Some of the people today who do not have to deal with what Hezekiya has faced do not feel that they are allegedly trying to do “third thing” or “third thing” or “third thing” with his association.
[The Holy Quran, 19: 3] Some of them believe that the poor and malevolent parents of their families should not do the right thing for themselves.
[The Holy Quran, 18: 2 and 3] But what is this true?
10 Heroes of Hazekiya asserts that this is not true!
There is no reason why we should be deceived by God.
To not let ill-wishers find people.
[The Holy Quran, 34: 10] The parents can teach their children to do good and bad things.
[The Holy Quran, 22: 6; Colossians 3: 21] This does not mean that the kind of education that has been raised for us is the kind of education that we are today.
What do he do?
For Jehobah, we have the right to do what we want, and this means that we can choose whether we should do it or not.
[The Holy Quran, 30: 19] How used Hazekiya this servant?
Many young people used to pray to God although their parents were not Shiaids of God.
11
Why was Hizekiya one of the best cities in Juda?
11 Even if his father had been in the evil chain of Juda, Hizkiya would be one of the most sincere chains.
(Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura al-Sura)
I don’t like an example of my father.
Instead, he listened to the prophets of Jehovah, like Ishaya, Mikah, and Hosiya.
He listened to their advice and remarks.
This has encouraged him to fix a lot of things which have not been done by his father.
He has strengthened the harassment, and he has prayed to God to bestow health and welfare on the people of these countries.
[The Holy Quran, 29: 1 - 11, 18 - 24; 31: 1] Later on, when Sennacherib, the Assyrian head of state, threatened to attack Urushalima, Hizekiah argued to be a bitter and bitter person.
He trusted Jehovah in conquering him and strengthening his people.
[The Holy Quran, 32: 7] On the one hand, Hezekiya became arrogant, but when Jehovah became arrogant, it became humiliated.
[The Holy Quran, 32: 24-26] We should learn from the Holy Quran.
He did not believe that his family had lost his life.
Rather, he argued that he was the believer of Jehobah.
12
How do many people become friends of God like Hizkiya today?
Therefore, today many children are noble, and many children are not accompanied by their relatives.
2 Timothy 3: 1-5) Of course many Christians today come from a home where their families are not well educated, but they have chosen a friendships close to God.
Like Hizekiya, they argued that educating their families would not show how many people they will live in the future.
God has given us the freedom to choose what we want, and we can choose whether we should and should go after it, as Hazekiya did.
“Happy Bird, my dear people.”
13 and 14.
Why can we say that the task that was given to Maria was not easy? However, what was the answer that was given to the angels of Jibril?
13 Several years after the age of Hezekiya, a cleric named Maryam came together with Kud al-Jobah and found a special job from his place.
It will be two days for Allah's greetings and greetings be upon him!
In fact, Jehobah belittled Maryamu and accepted it, and he offered it to her.
But why was it that she was told that she was going to be the same girl?
“Hold me, God’s favor” [The Holy Quran, 13: 14]
14 We have spoken a lot about the gift that was given to Mary.
But there are some things that are not threatening.
For example, the angels of Jibrailu say she will go after two without having a male.
But Jibrailu didn’t say he would tell her about her and her colleagues how to go after two.
What would they think of seeing her inside?
How could she tell Yusuf that she was not trusting him?
In addition to this, the reign of God's greetings be upon you and his household is not enough.
We could not know what Maryamu thought at that time, but we knew what she did after Jibra'ilu received a message.
She said, “Have me, my God’s favor, be for your sake and be for your sake.” – Luka 1: 26 – 38.
15
Why do we say Maryamu has so many differences?
15 Maryams have so many differences!
She prepared her mind to do what she had been commanded as a servant.
She proved that Jehobah would take care of her.
Mary's wife had such an outlook.
We have not been discriminated.
But we can be stronger than our Mary and we can be hopeful that God will help us.
[The Holy Quran, 5: 22] Mary worked hard to strengthen her midfielder.
How do we know this?
Let us take a look at our national interests and national interests.
16
What does it mean that Maryamu is not healthy?
16 Mary's death
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) says, “Everyone is distorting his hearts and is distorting his hearts.”
[The Holy Quran, 1: 19] Mary has been very miserable.
The Book of the Exalted states she has listened to what she has been told to women, especially what she has learned about Jehovah.
It took the time to take a look at these important points.
When Jesus was born, for instance, the enemies told Mary a message delivered by the angels.
Later on, when Jesus was 12, he made a statement that astonished Mary.
Mary stepped up all that time and paid her attention to what she heard. [The Holy Quran, 2: 16-19]
17
What lessons can we learn from the words of Mary?
17 What Maryam said in it
The Book of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) does not tell us how much Maryamu has spoken about.
It was mentioned in Luka 1 : 46-55.
This fury shows that Maryamu knows Nassosin Iranian well.
What do he do?
Mary’s prayers were almost identical to the prayers made by the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Sura al-Hajj (2: 1 - 10 ) Like Mary, her husband has lost her 20 percent.
Obviously, she was delighted to speak about what she learned from the site of her Chief Amin Jehobah.
18
In which methods can we learn from the beauty of Mary?
18 Sometimes, the Lord can tell us what we are looking for is an injury for us as it has been done to our Mary.
Let us learn from it, take responsibility in the table and rely on Jehobah help us.
In addition, we can teach Maryam how she looks different when we listen to God and speak about what we have learned about him and what he means.
When we do this, we will be happy to reveal what We have learnt to the people. [The Holy Quran, 77: 11], 12; Luka 8: 18; Roma 10: 15.
19
If we learn from the memories of the people mentioned in the Holy Book, what can we be sure of it?
19 Obviously, Ruth, Hazekiya and Maryam are fourth-floor friends of God, just like Abraham.
They were joined by the “happy witnesses” who pretended to be friends of God.
Let us follow the examples of these honorable people.
[The Holy Quran, 6: 11, 12] If we do this, we will expect to be friends of God forever.
Dear God, give good news to God.
think of the most important day in your life.
Was it your child's day? or your first child's day?
Is it the day you made sacrifices?
The day for you, in fact, is the most important and happy day in your life.
On that day, the brothers and sisters were very happy to see how you expressed your love for God with your heart, soul, humility and power. [The Holy Quran, 12: 30]
Without a doubt, since the day when you have been baftism, a lot of things have been happening in your shrine of Jehovah has made you happy very much.
However, the besiegers now have stopped making delight in their hostility to Jehobah.
Why did this happen?
What can help us continue to pray for Jehovah with joy?
Another reason is why I am happy about sex.
The rise of the rise makes us happy.
What do he do?
Before Jehobah has promised that his administration would soon abolish the ill-wishers and bring them to the world.
Zionism 1: 14 says, "God's great day is approaching, it is nearby, it is a sunlight, it is a sunlight, it is a sunlight, it is a sunlight, it is a sunlight in it."
If we notice that the end will be long before it comes, then we may stop being happy as we did right now.
As a result of this, we can benefit from God’s services. [The Holy Quran, 13: 12]
If we stay together with our brothers and sisters, then we will strengthen our commitment to Jehovah with joy.
The hegemony of the people of Jehobah has made us benefit from the truth and made us benefit from it with joy.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 12] But what might happen if some followers are training because they are not committed to God's claims?
This can force some members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps to celebrate and stop feeling happy.
The whole world can let us feel a sacrifice for Jehobah.
How did she?
The commercial and promotional plan that is carried out in this world can provide us with unnecessary supplies.
Jesus says, "No one is controlled by giving righteousness to two gods, whether he is opposed to one, or not, the same is true of one, or not, the same is true of one."
You do not have power to give in to God.”
[The Holy Quran, 6: 24] If we pay attention to the material, we will not be able to offer joy to Jehovah.
Later, when he was 15, his mother and aunt died in the same year.
For those who love Jehobah, he has not been served as a laborer.
Recalling that Jesus says, â€œAgainst your â€œYou who are hardworkingâ€ [The Holy Quran, 5: 3].
I hope you will manage to do what you are doing. You should learn from my place. I hope you will manage to do what you are doing.
It is necessary to prepare a light - a light, a source and a heavy burden."
[The Holy Quran, 11: 28 - 30] Life as a truly Christian will bring about happiness and joy.
Without a doubt, we have good reasons for having happy with the services of Jehovah.
Let’s speak about three of them.
We are rendering services to our Almighty, Allah the Exalted.
[The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, the Prophet's (s.w.a.) household, and the Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
Therefore, let us continue to be sacrificed for him with joy, maybe many shadows have exceeded the seeds we have bafted.
Héctor continues to be happy to remember his father's name and to be a cleric in his service to Jehobah
Pay attention to a brother named Héctor, who has been serving a panegyrist for 40 years.
He continued to pray to Jehovah with joy as long as he was old.
[The Holy Quran, 92: 12-14] Even if his wife's malnutrition prevented him from doing whatever he was doing, Hector would remain happy.
She said, "When a woman is sick and she is slowly moving forward, this makes me sad. Additionally, she is not easy to take care of her, but this does not prevent me from enjoying God with joy."
The Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds and the Lord of the Worlds.
I am trying to stay smoothly and I am looking forward to what the Kingdom will bring to me so that I can keep happy.”
Jehobah saved himself, making us happy in life.
The Holy Book says, “God is committed to the world until He has given His One to its own generations only because the one who is righteous is not destroyed but will have life forever.”
[The Holy Quran, 3: 16] Indeed, God will bestow His blessings on us, and we will be able to live in eternal conditions when we look after Allah's favor for us.
This is the proper reason why we should be thankful and this motivates us to be happy with Jehovah.
Jesus hastened his life and served God for many years with joy.
A brother living in Mesiko, Jesus, said: “I want to do a lot of things, I want to do a different thing at one time — it is not five things to do at all.
But I was doing this for the money I had.
When I took a lesson about Jehobah and how he gave his son to fancy Adam, I submitted my intention to kiss him.
I apologized to Jehobah and acted as a baftism.
It took me back when I was 28 years working for the company and serving it in a short period of time. “
Jesus Christ's greetings be upon Jehovah are here with joy
We have lived a good life for students, which makes us happy.
Can you remember how your life was before going to be served for Jehobah?
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) told Roma Christians that they were “the servants of unity” but that they were “the servants of justice now.”
In order to survive for the sake of students, they need to survive forever.
Romans 6: 17-22) We are also following the pilgrims of Jehovah and we do not even face the problems of corruption or lack of faith.
This is really a source of joy!
“All the years of my life are the years that I have been sacrificing for Jehovah. ” — Jaime
Pay attention to a person named Jaime who is not honest with God.
Jaime started participating in the event of Shahidun Jehobah and their sympathy was very encouraged to him.
To leave his final stage of life, Jaime asked Jehobah to help realise him.
Jaime reiterated: “I have slowly noticed that the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) is coming down and that he is humble.
The good identity of Jehobah has been closed to me so much.
That was to say, I did not change my behavior, and I was eventually killed like my psychological friend.
It was the years that I was most happy in my life when I was sacrificed for Jehovah. “
Stay strong!
What should we feel when we are waiting for the end of this dignified world?
Remember, we are towards Allah and we hope to live forever.
Therefore, we should not fail to do what is necessary in this regard. “So, we should not fail to do what is necessary in this regard.
[The Holy Quran, 6: 8 and 9] With the help of Yahweh, we should move forward in a steadfast way. We should behave in a steadfast way in order to survive in the “senior season.” [The Holy Quran, 7: 9], 13 and 14; Jakub 1: 2-4].
We are sure that Jehovah will bless us when we leave because he knows what we are doing.
Additionally, he knows that we are opposed to him and we are named after him.
If we continue to bless him with joy, we will be like the writer of Daud who says, “I pray to Allah the Exalted to bestow His blessings on him and I will not grieve for his sake.”
Your hearts will become brilliant. Your hearts will become brilliant. [The Holy Quran, 16: 8]

NAZARY TALFIN: 4 AFRILU, 2016 – 1 May, 2016
Dear God, bestow peace on God.
“God will stay between you and your daughter forever” [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Baqara, Ayahs 20: 42].
VICTORY : 125, 62
What is your message?
How is Jonathan, an Imam of the Age, an amnesty for Jehova?
How can we be faithful to Allah the Exalted when we see that any authority does not change our baby?
How can we feel faithful to Jehobah al-Sad and others make us underestimate or injustice?
Why are Jonathan and Dauda’s friendship a good example of security?
Without a doubt, Dauda's heartfelt power was so strong that Jonathan beheaded.
Dauda killed a young man named Goliath and brought this “of the Palestinians” to Jonathan’s father, the Imam of Israel.
Jonathan knows that God is with Daud.
Since then, Jonathan and Dauda have been friends of kudde.
[The Holy Quran, 18: 1 - 3] Jonathan had been trusted with Daud during his lifetime.
Of course, Jonathan knew that Jehobah had chosen Dauda to be the seventh son of Israel in the future.
When Saul tries to kill Dauda, Jonathan feels about his friend.
When Jonathan knew that Dauda had a forest in Horesh, he went to that location to encourage Dauda to trust Jehobah.
Therefore, Jonathan went to God. Jonathan said to Dauda: "Don't be afraid: the end of the day when Sauls household will not come to you: you will be the pure of Israel and I will be the second of you."

What was more important for Jonathan, and how do we know of it?
(Screenshot from page 14.)
3 We love faithful people.
But, should we love Jonathan for his trust in Dauda?
No, being trusted with God was more important for Jonathan.
In fact, he was trustworthy of Dauda and he did not expect Dauda or he would be trustworthy instead of him.
Jonathan helped Dauda trusting Jehobah.
Both men and women had faith in God and in one another.
They fulfilled their promise: “God will stay between you and your daughter forever.” [The Holy Quran, 20: 42]
4. ( a) What makes us so happy and satisfied? ( b) What will be debated in this meeting?
4 We should pay attention to our family, friends and relatives.
[The Holy Quran, 2: 10] The most important point is to trust Jehovah and he gives us life.
[The Holy Quran, 4: 11] We will be happy more and we will be satisfied more when we are trusted with Jehovah.
Additionally, we know that we should be trusted in God even if it is difficult to do so.
In this interview, we will discuss how Jonathan’s example will help us be trusted with Jehovah in the four-part areas: (1) when we see a dominant person, we must not be trusted with him, (2) when we stand firm against him, we must be trusted with him, (3) when a dominant person insultes our wrong understanding of us or makes us lack of justice, (4) the fulfillment of our promise is irrevocable.

Why should the people of Israel trust Allah the Exalted?
5 Jonathan and the people of Israel are in a difficult situation.
Jonathan’s father, Sarki Saul, was an obedient father and Jehobah denied him.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 17-23] However, Allah the Exalted has forced the saint to persuade for many years.
He has caused the people to feel faithful to Allah the Exalted, who had been selected to sit on “the seat of God” in a faulty way. — 1 Leader 29: 23
6
What does it mean that Jonathan is trustworthy of Jehobah?
6 Jonathan had an amnesty for Jehobah.
For instance, take a look at Jonathan's behavior towards peace and greetings be upon Saul's acceptance of divine blessings.
[The Holy Quran, 13: 14] At that time, a large army of the Palestinians had received about 30,000 soldiers to attack the Palestinians.
Saul had only 600 soldiers and Jonathan alone.
But Jonathan didn’t be afraid.
He remembered the words of the Imam of the Age (s.w.a.) which says, "God will not allow his crowd to be immaculate." [The Holy Quran, 12: 22] Jonathan told a soldier, "God will not allow him to do anything.
Hence, he and the soldiers attacked a group of Palestinians and killed 20 people in each.
Jonathan is brilliant and Jehobah blessed him.
Jehobah is deceived and the Palestinians are afraid.
They attacked one another and killed another. This is how the Zionists were fighting. — 1 Samuel 13: 5, 15, 22; 14: 1, 2, 6; 14, 15 and 20.
7
How was Jonathan with his father?
7 Even if Saul had continued to hate Jehobah, Jonathan would hate his ancestors whenever it happened.
For example, they fighted against the people of Jehovah. — 1 Samuel 31: 1, 2.
8, 9. How do we feel faithful to God when we follow the rulers?
8 Just like Jonathan, we can be trusted by Jehobah in rendering services to the country’s government at whim.
Jehobah has rejected the so-called “third powers” to lead us, and he demands us to follow them.
(Church of Roma 13: 1, 2)
When we are or fail to observe the laws, we should be obliged to follow the laws.
The Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the Worlds, and the Lord of the Worlds.
Our faith in the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household is one of the ways for achieving this faith in God.
9 A girl in South America, Olga, used to be a trustworthy servant of Jehovah when treating her husband or when she was prostituated. [ 1 ] ( View more )
Sometimes she becomes not a woman to speak out and sometimes she becomes a godfather.
He also told her that she would allow her to go with the children.
However, Olga hasn’t named “the fox”.
She could try her to become a wicked woman.
He comes with food and takes care of others in his family.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 17] Moreover, if there is an opportunity, it is appropriate for him to visit him and his friends.
For instance, if he wants to go to a city to celebrate his father, prepare the room for his defense and even if he is celebrated in a shrine, he is thrown out of the shrine.
After many years, Mr Olga continues her tourism with her behavior to be satisfied with the behavior she endured on her daily basis.
Now he is encouraging her to go to a meeting and he is leading to a meeting with her.
“Savannah Grass” and “Savannah Grass” are among the most pious people in the world.
10
How could Jonathan know who should be trustworthy for him?
10 When Saul said he was going to kill Dauda, Jonathan needed an injury counsel.
He wanted to be safe for his father, but he wanted to be safe for Dauda.
Jonathan knew that Allah was with Daud and not with Saul, so he chose to trust Daud.
Dauda might stand by and tell to Saul why he should not killing Dauda. — 1 Samuel 19: 1 — 6.
11, 12
How can our reliance on God help us stand by and advise to be trustworthy with Him?
11 A girl named Alice from Osterelia needs her very strong advice to who she can be trusted with.
When she is looking at the Holy Book, she told their families what she was teaching.
In addition, she told them to stop celebrating Christmas with them, and explained why she was going to do so.
At first, the neighbors were sad, but later they were argued with it a lot.
They thought that Alice had abandoned them.
Her parents said she didn’t want to see her again.
Alice says: “I’ve been astonished and I’ve been so sad that’s trying to survive our homeland.
Yet, I have planned to associate God with His children with my heart and I will baftism on the eve of the eve.” — Matth 10: 37
12 We should not believe anything, like a basketball, a gymnast or a country where we live, is more important than our devotion to God.
For example, Henry is delighted to take a match called school chests and wants to win a champion for his schools.
However, to perform chess at the end of a week, he didn’t even go away or attend the summit appropriately.
Henry says he noticed that he had paid the school more than his worship to God.
Hence, he has decided to stop the schoolchildren’s chess game. — Mat 6: 33
13
How can being trusted with God help us face problems in our family?
13 Sometimes it may be enlightened by the heads of our family members at the same time.
Ken, for example, said: “I want to recommend a visit to my older father who had come to my hotel room with us at an appointment.
But the dad and the lady are not prepared. “
He continued: “If even if I want to make a victim happy, I’m going to make a victim happy.”
Ken refers to what the Holy Book says and understands that in such conditions, his wife should be happy with her.
Hence, he decided to have an astonishing advice for his wife.
He explained to his wife why she should love his father.
He should explain to his parents why he should be a woman. — Corinthians 2: 24; 1 Corinthians 13: 4 and 5.
Everybody should be vigilant in this regard. Everybody should be at the service of justice.
14
How did Saul disjust Jonathan?
14 We shall be trusted with God if a brother in our tribes oppress us.
He was appointed by Allah to the Exalted, yet he did not have his children appropriately.
I don't understand why Jonathan is listening to Dauda.
So, when Jonathan tried to help Dauda, Saul paid a lot of money and made his son shed tears in front of many people.
However, Jonathan still welcomed his parents.
Moreover, he was trusted in Jehoba and Dauda, who had been first chosen by God to be the head of Israel in the past. [The Holy Quran, 20: 30-41].
15
What should we do when a brother makes us lack of justice?
The 15 brothers in the universities are trying to beat everybody in an appropriate way today.
But these brothers and sisters are stupid and they will not understand why they are doing something at a particular time.
[The Holy Quran, 1: 13-19] Therefore, if we are blatant or inaccurate, then we must be trusted with Jehovah.
Scribbling and fulfilling our claims
16
When will we have faith in God and cannot we love it?
16 Saul loves Jonathan to be an infallible servant instead of Dauda.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Shafa, Ayahs 20: 31] However, Jonathan is committed to Jehovah, and he is trustworthy of him.
Therefore, instead of becoming a kind of self-pity, Jonathan becomes a friend of Dauda and fulfilles his promise with him.
In fact, any religious believer who is committed to Jehovah is “filling the promises he made or not.”
[The Holy Quran, 15: 4] We will fulfill our promises because we have trust in God.
For example, if we make a business agreement, we will do what we have promised or what is wrong.
And if we face a lot of trouble in our marriage, we will feel committed to Jehovah who is committed to our husband and wife. [The Holy Quran, 2: 13-16]
If we make a business agreement, we will do what we have promised to do because we have trust in God.
17
How could this research help you?
17 We should have trust in God even if it is a bad situation, just like Jonathan.
Therefore, let us have respect for our saved brothers who have lost our life.
That will make us feel happy and that will make us feel happy more.
[The Holy Quran, 27: 11] We are sure He will bless us.
We will learn lessons from certain people during the time of Daud, who were safe and who did not do so.
[ 1 ] (Figure 9 release ) Some names were changed.
What is the meaning of words
Presence and greetings be upon Jehovah: We love Jehovah, and we follow him on a daily basis.
In extreme conditions, we think about what Jehovah wants us to do and follow him because we are committed to him more than anybody else.
“Holding people”: Governments, their officials and Jehobah had control over us.
They want us to stand by and follow them if they want us to do whatever is in line with the command of Jehobah to us.

“Why is it that God gives righteousness to the people and gives righteousness to their hearts and gives righteousness to their hearts?’ [The Holy Quran, 6: 8]
Scribblers: 63, 43
What is your message?
Who could change us from showing trust in him?
Why is Jonathan’s approach to Dauda different from Abner’s approach to him?
What kind of behavior can help us be trusted in God and how can we do this?
How did Daud say he trust God?
(Take a look at the image on this page.)
SAUL and his 3,000 soldiers searched for DAWA in the Jewish forest to kill him.
But one day and one night, Dauda and his friends noticed that Saul and his troops had set their battlefields on the scene.
When they flattered to the battlefields, Dauda and Abishai went to the battlefields, and they moved to the battlefields.
Abishai told Dauda in a statement: “Say you not to let him end up with my body, let me lose one piece of his body and let me lose another piece of his body.”
But Dauda didn’t allow him to kill Saul.
He told Abishai: “He should not be defeated: after having passed his hand on divine charges, he is guilty of crime.”
He believes, “God has bestowed hands on God’s neck.” — 1 Samuel 26: 8-12.
2 Dauda understands what it means to be kind to God or be kind to God
He knew that he wanted to extend up to Saul and he should not think about weakening him.
What do he do?
To Allah's favor, Saul will be the head of Israel.
Today too, Jehovah has demanded that his servants be trusted in Him and that they should receive power. [The Holy Quran, 6: 8]
3
How was Abishai trusted with Dauda?
3 Abishai approached Dauda to know that it was God who chose Dauda to be the Exalted.
However, after that Dauda became a bigot, he tried to scare a bigot.
In the meeting with Uriah, he told Joab that Uriah had probably been killed in the battle.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (2), Ayah 14 and Ayah 15] Joseph was the brother of Abisha, and that is why Abisha heard the actions of Daud.
Additionally, Abishai is the head of state and can use his power as the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), but he did not do so.
Instead of this, he served Daud and expelled him from his neighbors. — 2 Samuel 10: 10; 20: 6; 21: 15-17.
4. (a) How did Dauda make instances of trust in God? (b) What instances should we discuss with?
4 Dauda had been safe for his entire life.
When he was young, he killed the daughter of Goliath, who is the deceased of Jehovah and Israel.
(1 Sama'ila 17: 23, 26, 48 - 51 ) When Dauda was sleeping, Jehobah sent the prophet of Nathan to consume him.
Meanwhile, Dauda agrees that he is kissing and kissing.
[The Holy Quran, 12: 1-5, 13] Later on, Saad and Daud had spent a lot of valuable achievements in order to use them to reconstruct the house of Jahobah.
[The Holy Quran, 29: 1-5] Daud had indeed made hardships in his life, but he did not stop being trusted by God.
[The Holy Quran, 51: 4], 10: 86: 2] During this period, we will discuss the examples of Daud with some people and we will learn how we should trust God instead of Adam.
In addition to this, we will discuss certain behaviors that will help us be safe.
How can you reduce your trust in God?
5
What lessons should we learn from the mistakes that Abishai made?
5 When Abishai wanted to kill Saul, he wanted to show his backwardness to Daud.
However, Dauda knew that killing “divine treachers” was a plow. Therefore, he did not believe that Abishai had killed the shrine of Saul.
[The Holy Quran, 26: 8-19] The important lesson that we will learn from here is: When we need advice on whether or not we should follow him, we need to reflect on the books of the Holy Quran that will help us.
“We are more important than everybody else than everybody else.
6
Of course, if we want to make respect for our neighbors and friends, why should we act like this?
6 We want to make respect for those in our neighborhood, including our friends and neighbors.
Of course, as far as we are, our hearts can manipulate us.
[The Holy Quran, 17: 9] Therefore, if we are determined to do something that is not appropriate and forgetting the group of Jehovah, we should remember that being trusted with Jehovah is more important for all people. [The Holy Quran, 22: 37]
7
How can a friend be trusted in God during a difficult time?
7 If a person in your home is humble, you can show to Jehovah that you are trustworthy about him.
For example, an elder named Anne was asked her to visit her. [ 1 ] ( Check out more details )
Her father, Anne, said her day was gone and everybody in the family refused to speak to her.
She was not happy and told her parents that she would be writing a letter to her.
Before writing the letter, Anne took a look at the Holy Book Fair.
(1 Corinthians 5: 11; 2 John 9-11) He wrote the letter and made it clear in an enlightened mind that the father of her father had abandoned the seventh family.
She told her parents that she was willing to come to God and be happy about it. [The Holy Quran, 4: 8]
8
What behavior can help us be trusted with God?
8 Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the destiny of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) during the time of Daud.
Let us talk about how these actions can help us be trusted with Jehovah.
We should lay down our walls.
9
Why was Abner trying to kill Dauda?
9 Dan Saul, Jonathan, and the head of the Israeli Armed Forces, Abner, saw when Dauda brought Goliath to Sarki Saul.
Jonathan became a friend of Dauda and was kind to him.
(1 Samuel 17: 57 – 18: 3 ) But Abner did not do so.
He helped Saul when he wanted to kill Dauda.
[The Holy Quran, Sura al-Hajj (22), Ayah 5] Jonathan and Abner knew that after Saul, Daud had been elected as the son of Israel.
However, after the death of Saul, Abner did not support Dauda.
Instead, he triumphantly attempted a Saul named Ish-Bosheth to become a shrine.
Later on, Abner tried to make a self-sacrifice with the opportunity to meet one of the women of Saul.
Why were Jonathan and Abner different from Dauda?
Because Jonathan has been trustworthy of Jehobah and he is a tawali.
10
Why is Absalom not trusted with God?
10 The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Absalom, is not trustworthy of God because he is not trustworthy.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 1] Therefore, therefore, he is willing to prepare the ground for himself, and therefore, he is willing to prepare the ground for himself, and therefore, he is willing to prepare the ground for himself.
He even tried to kill his ancestors even though he knew that David was the head of Israel. — 2 Samuel 15: 13, 14; 17: 1 — 4.
11
How can we benefit from the story of Abner, Absalom and Baruch in the Holy Book?
11 If a person is not loud and seeks more dignity, he will be trusted with Allah the Exalted.
Of course we are opposed to God and we do not want to be honest with the gentlemen like the Gentlemen, Abner and Absalom. We should make efforts so that we fail to take care of the money or the duty that will make us take care of.
This will destroy our relationship with Jehobah.
The secretary of Irmiya’s Baruch promised to be unaware and, therefore, stops his worship ceremony with Jehobah.
Now, the thing that I have built is I will demolish, the thing that I have built is I will fall down, this is all in the country.
How do people speak about bigot?
Don’t kill them. “
(Irmiya 45: 4, 5 ) Baruch listened to God.
In fact, we should listen to God and succeed in destroying the storm of the world.
When you advise your brother to go and tell your older brother what he has done, you should help him and be kind to Jehobah.
12
Show us why we cannot be trusted with God if we are sincerely.
12 brothers in Mexico, Daniel, face the issue of living with trust in Jehobah
She wanted to be a woman who was not living with Jehova.
Daniel says: “I have continued to write women even though I have stopped serving practitioners.”
But he realized he was doing the right thing to love the heart.
He does not say to God and he needs to be a taboo.
Hence, he told a senior who had previously asked about the marriage.
Daniel says, “He has helped me to understand that I need to be trusted with God and stop writing the letters to women.
After praying with a lot of people, I stopped writing to her a letter.
“It’s not too late, but I’m so happy about my services. ”
Now, Daniel is marrying a woman like Jehobah and serving a lawyer.
Peace be upon Allah's pious servants, and blessings on us.
If you realize that your friend is doing a hardship, would you advise him to go and help him and you will be sure he is doing this?
(Take a look at page 14)
13
How was Nathan trusted of Jehobah and Dauda Sad and Dauda?
13 If we had trust in God, we would have trust in others and help them tread the right path.
The Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) was a source of hope for Jehova and Dauda.
After that Dauda murdered the wife of a man and killed him, Jehobah sent Nathan to warn Dauda.
Nathan inspired the heart and followed the command of Jehobah.
But he showed wisdom in how he spoke to Daud in an unknown way.
He wanted to help Dauda to know that Dauda had done a hardship.
Hence, he told him the story of a cowardly man who caught a cowardly truce.
When Daud heard these things, he was very excited about the achievements that the economist made.
Nathan said, “You are the man.”
Dauda became aware that he was in favor of Jehovah. — 2 Samuel 12: 1 — 7 and 13.
14
How can you feel faithful to Jehobah and your friends?
14 You can also be trusted with Jehovah and you can also be trusted with others in support of them.
For example, you can be asserting that your brother has suffered a serious infection.
Of course, you will not want to miss the bond of friendship between you, especially if you are your friend or friend.
You should know that trusting God is the most important factor.
Therefore, pray to God and help your brothers.
Tell him that he is going to tell my older brother what he has done without missing time.
If he refuses to come, you can tell my daughter about it.
When you do this, you should pray to God.
In addition, you can help your brothers and sisters so that they can help strengthen his relationship with Jehobah.
They will re-establish it in a conscious way and in a conscious way. — [The Holy Quran, 5: 1].
We are pure and pure, and we trust God.

Why had Hushai needed power to trust Jehovah?
15 Hushai is a very good friend of the Exalted Daud.
If people are interested in the name of Absalom, Hushai wants to trust Dauda and Allah the Exalted, but he needs sincerity to do so.
He knew that Absalom went to Urushalima with his Armed Forces and that Dauda had escaped.
[The Holy Quran, 15: 13] But what was Hussein (a.s.) doing?
Did he turn his account into Dauda to support Absalom?
No.
Of course, even if Dauda was already old and many wanted to kill him, Hushai used to trust Dauda because Jehobah had named the name of that great personality.
Hussein (a.s.) was therefore to find Dauda in the Holy Quran. — 2 Samuel 15: 30 and 32
16 Dauda told Hussein to return to Jerusalem and showed that he was supporting Absalom and he would listen to his advice instead of Ahithophel.
Hushai paid his heart and spent his time in unity to pray to Dauda and be in trust with Jehobah.
Dauda prayed for the sake of Jehobah to help Hushai and what happened here.
Absalom advised Hushai instead of Ahithophel. — 2 Samuel 15: 31; 17: 14.

Why should we have sincerity in order to be safe?
17 We need to be firm and kind to God and not to do what our homeland, our colleagues and our government wants.
For example, a Japan-based brother called Taro has told his parents that he had been living alive when he was old.
He is kind to them and is committed to them because he is committed to them.
However, when Shahid Sattari and Zeid al-Jobah used to view the Holy Book with him, his parents tried to deny it.
That made him sad and praised them of going to attend the summit.
Taro’s brother said: “They have lost my life very much and they have barred my visit home for several years.
I prayed to God for strength and forgotten my advice.
Now they have changed their view of labor and I am visiting them in there." [The Holy Quran, 29: 25]

How did you benefit from the search for this link?
18 Dauda, Jonathan, Nathan, and Hossein were kind to God and they were happy. We will also be happy if we do so.
We should not be like Abner and Absalom.
The truth is that we are injustible and we make the mistakes.
But we submit to the intention of being trustworthy in God and show that doing this is more important in our life.

What is the meaning of words
If we have faith and selflessness, we will pay attention to what Jehovah wants us, not to what we want.
If we were faithful and noble, we would be asking for the help of the people and we would be asking for them how Jehobah wants.
If we have security and heartfelt power, we will be serving of Jehovah, if it is wrong or if we are struggling to do so.
