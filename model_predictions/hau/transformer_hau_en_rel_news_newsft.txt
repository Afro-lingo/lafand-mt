However, this goal is to be a resistance.

Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps on the issue of Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps
After a long time and re-appearance of Iran and academic senior officials in the country, the people of Iran have been joined in a clear agreement with the agreement between the two countries.
Leader’s Speech to Iran in a meeting with the Armed Forces.
Each year during the hajj, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the important issues of the Islamic Ummah are involved.
How do you think the philosophy in this regard?
To answer this question, First of all, it is necessary to clarify the issue.
First of all, hajj is one of the essential things that he wants to make.
The greatest goal in the hajj is to disgrace the people of the Holy Quran, the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the Prophets.
The Holy Quran describes each one of those occasions when it says: "Intes during the presence of the Holy Quran, all those who are bowed down to the path of the prophets and who came to the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.), and he said: ““They will be brought to the blessings of Abraham and the divine divine messengers."
He said: “Lalle, the president of the population of the people and I am the leader of the Islamic Republic.
He said: “Soy and descendants of the country - is the manifestation of the headship of the Islamic Republic.
The second goal which is based on the path is to bring about a movement in the arena of hajj and its main goal. It is in fact a clear clear and clear path to Allah the Exalted.
All these things are the manifestations of the people and the chaos of the Islamic Ummah.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this meeting with Imam Khomeini (r.a.) during the hajj ceremonies.
The philosophy of the immaculate â€ â€ â€“ which you ask â€“ the reasons why the Islamic Republic and Islamic denominations are very important.
Commendably, hajj means the movement of the nations.
It is necessary to congratulate: Hajj is the flag of Islam. What is meant by the flag of Islam?
During the Sacred Defense Era, this is the meaning of the Army.
Therefore, hajj ceremonies and the souls of the hajj are one of the lofty goals of the Islamic Republic.
Therefore, the message that the Imam (r.a.) re-appearance was broadcasting and added to the significance of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
I would like to congratulate all of the signs which are not given to the hajj ceremonial importance. Unfortunately we cannot understand the greatness of this fact, it is not enough to understand the significance of all those who are
There are reports of social and cultural organizations that are carrying out their duties, but they do not manage to improve their identity and importance on this issue.
It is necessary to prepare all the media, all the branches of the country.
It is necessary to increase our efforts in this regard.
No, this situation does not exist.
Since the birthday anniversary of empathetic ceremonies is carried out by the people?
But after the conflict that â€“ which has been imposed on the people of Iran for the past few decades, the same is the same as the beginning of the speech delivered on by the people of Iran.
The agreements that from that time to time, the meetings of the Aban should not be held in Makkaka, but on the occasion of hajj ceremony â€“ â€“ â€“ in the immaculate, the people of Iran should not make a great meeting in Making meetings for the Islamic Republic of Iran.
On the other hand, Imam Ali (a.s.) was applied to the agreement, and after all, he was applied to Dub al-Kubra's (s.a.)
We claim that hajj is accompanied by Muslim nations.
Is it possible to do this?
First of all, there are many foreign denominations.
The second point is that it is presented on the scene and that it is interpreted in different sectors during the hajj, in Mina, and he enters the arena
It is also promoted in different languages in order to influence the good news of Muslim nations throughout the world. On the other hand, the world of Islam and Islamic systems are trying to deploy the influence
At one point, this message was published in the newspapers of England and all the Zionist regimes deployed after this magazine, where they gave birth to women.
In what year did this happen?
The Zionist regime is trying to prevent the peaks.
The same is true of the government, and it is not enough to help, but it has been defeated in certain years. Sometimes people have been defeated.
Of course, in the past, this kind of patience has been reduced. Tomen, whereas they are trying and when they are at the end of this message.
We may occasionally try to explicit the message in the newspapers, but we are not printed.
A number of newspapers do not believe or give exemption.
I deem it necessary for Muslims.
For example, they do not let down, but as I said, we should show our patience.
What is the nature of this message?
There are the representatives of the entire Islamic Ummah.
The fact that the establishment of the country is a manifestation of the administration of the people - the camp of all Muslims and the goal of drawing close to God.
It is necessary to pay attention to it.
He takes care of the tongue.
The things that are forbidden to eulogize, the things that are illegitimate.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated: "In the past, if you would like to introduce me to you, I would like to introduce
If you look at the guidance of the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, you will see that the first point that it is presented in this issue.
This is the meaning of the messages of Islam during the hajj.
As an example of the hajj ceremonies on the basis of the weakness of the Islamic Ummah.
The following is one example of the hajj ceremon
Leader's Message on President - Khamenei.ir
If we pay attention to the origin of the hajj, the identity of the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
That is to say, the entire group of people are going to pass judgment on the basis of Allah the Exalted and this is
The first point that is being discussed in this issue is to be the focus of the hajj ceremonies in the history of the Islamic Ummah.
The second point is that hajj is accompanied by sincere and righteous behavior of the people.
This is one of all the benefits.
Of course, since the beginning of the message to the end will be discussed with the issue of purity and benefits of those who have a relationship with the hajj.
The third point of this message is the value of Islam and the message of Islam.
The same is true of the Islamic Republic of Iran's problems with humanity.
The next point is related to the issue of Islamic Awakening, especially in the message of the Islamic Revolution, the most important point of the Islamic Awakening on the scene.
In this regard, Islamic Awakening and Islamic Awakening is an effort to promote Islamic Awakening.
It is also mentioned in this regard. It is the kind of clothing that is being made and the path that is being recited and puts on the scene.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the unity of the Islamic Revolution. He stressed: "There of the Islamic Republic is a symbol of monotheism and
The same is true of the clear indications of the depth of the power of the Islamic Ummah and of the material and spiritual capacities of the world. They remind the nation of the great potential of the enemies who are trying to weaken it.
The same is true of the important issues that the arrogant powers do.
In all these cases, the evil and arrogant powers of the world have been mentioned to eliminate the Islamic Ummah and the reasons they are doing.
The important things they are doing and the important issues of the Islamic Ummah, they have strove about the issues and issues that they have made and they are trying to create discord between the ethnic and tribute and murder of the Islamic Ummah.
The threats of those who were after the falling of September 11, champions appeared on them.
This is because the enemies of the Islamic Revolution and the awakening of Islamic Awakening have been able to deploy the plots of the arrogant powers of the world and they have managed to advance the enemies' plans for the Islamic Ummah and its cooperation.
Therefore, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution described the greatness of the world as the enemies of the people, the leaders of human rights and the support of terrorism and the hypocrisy of the Islamic Republic of Islam and of Tabbas is one of the important things that has been imposed on the people of the region and the goals of those in the region.
The final point is the liberation of the Islamic Republic as an example of success in confronting the arrogant powers of the world and the role of Islam in all life and calling towards the unity of Islam, the role of the Islamic Ummah, the role of religious and the chairmanship of the world.
What effect do these things have on other countries?
Is it possible to have a position between the experts and the political figures of the Islamic countries or political figures?
In all the trips and each year we attended â€“ every year and visited the 50-Madets of the people and groups of special denominations of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps and the international denominations â€“ all those who have been present on the basis of this issue and the events that we have made.
That is to say, no matter where we are faced with this issue, where there is a great impact on this issue.
Today the issue of global democracy is one of the things that is happening in the world. The country is speaking to the people.
Can the hajj ceremonial purity of the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Revolution?
Of course, one of the good intentions of the Revolution is the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
One of the ways to strengthen the gathering of the hajj and to reconstruction the role of the hajj and the kind of Islamic Awakening is one of the things that is happening in the world.
The point is that many people of the country have been suffering from distant places, but they do not fully understand the message behind the hajj.
We have a broadcasting: " The hajj ceremonies will continue without sin. The light of the hajj will continue with it and it will continue to be accompanied by
I hope the hajj will make efforts to raise the hajj ceremonies for the hajj ceremonial
Leader’s Speech to Teachers - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Kermanshah.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings
Allah the Exalted said: " My name of Allah the Exalted, the Beneficent, the Merciful.
They are afraid of Allah's favor, and they are afraid of everybody, and they are indeed God. And Allah is
A meeting with honorable teachers who are rendering services in different parts of the country and with the youth who are prepared to train themselves in religious arenas and innovations.
Fortunately, today the dear brothers and sisters and outstanding personalities of the province of the Aban and Shia and Sunni are all present on this meeting. This is an opportunity for me to benefit from it.
I would like to discuss the points that I would like to discuss with them, but before I would like to speak to the esteemed lady of the world who is in the direction of the commander of Brujerdi, made his life in the province and made the prize of a martyrdom.
I would like to spend a few meetings with him in Kermanshah at several times.
We also promoted it in certain meetings. The clergy of the Islamic Republic, which was held in Tehran's Navy in Tehran, also from Shahid Sadduceite.
The meetings were held in the universities of the Iraqi Armed Forces because they were in the war veterans
His humility, being free of the world, indifference and indifference, all these things are one of the qualities that belongs to them.
By Allah's favor, Allah the Exalted gave him a reward. By the end of the long life, God
I have repeatedly said that the death of a criminal is a lot of money.
Of course, there will be a period of time when life will end " the meaning of death". [The Holy Quran, 3:185]
We too are interested in having the right opportunity - and it is a source of great gain for us.
[The Holy Quran, 9: 111] Allah the Exalted is the Source of life, and this is a
In the same province, the oldest of hajj pilgrims of the martyrdread of the Imam of the Araraki and the people who were among those who were martyred in the right way.
The Imam (r.a.) was one of our friends in Kum.
God showed mercy to these two martyrs.
I would like to address the high-ranking and humble teacher of Hajj - who is a student of hajj pilgrims in the school of our friends at Hujjae - who is a sincere and sincere student of Hujat - who is in the school of our friends - is a pure and sincere person.
God has shown mercy.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, before I became the president of the country, I visited Kermanshah and left his home and witnessed its practices.
And after the death of the Imam (r.a.), he sent me and his work.
I would like to write a letter to me that I would like to congratulate him and say, "We should know who is the leader of the people and who is the leader of the country and who starts reading his thoughts before he reads a portion of my table so that we do not forget
He wrote this to me in a beautiful book and I placed him in the future.
This is the problem with our work.
You dear youth, you dear men and women. If you want to be like a talented panegyrists, if you want to be like the eye of those who are not obliged to do not, they will kill the people.
The great and impressive presence of teachers is one of the people of Iran. [The Holy Quran, 35: 30] The fear of God is one of the characteristics of teachers and teachers.
Of course, teachers have certain icons, but there is reverential fear of God.
The fact that knowledge is to say that one is a source of blessings - to God in the heart of
It is necessary to achieve this identity. You dear youth who are in a position to do this. When you reach the years, if you do something else, you will benefit from it, it will benefit from this.
This is a life that will be carried out by others, and others will not achieve this.
You should know that the increased attention between the 20-year trek of 70 years and societies over the past - that is exactly what we have been doing - will be like the
When a person is in his late 20 " s, he feels that there is a lot of time to 70 years.
I would like to spend a lot of time, and I would like to say that in order to do something, they should manage to do something.
Therefore, I would like to address the dear student to you and speak of God, fear of him and try to draw closer to the God who is in the heavenly calling, the main foundation of knowledge.
If knowledge is carried out, knowledge will be valueless, even in the face of a dead person.
We have a teacher - who is religious and non-religious - who does not benefit from knowledge. It is also a tragedy.
The spirit of a close relationship with God is what is necessary for knowledge and teachers.
To Kermanshah is a very important town.
As the teacher of Ulama (s.a.) said at a long time, Kermanshah was a prominent role model. Like the family of Algha, the families of Jalili, the family of students and other prominent schools in the country, not just one or
The same is true of Kermanshah, the people of Kermanshah and the people of Kermanshah and the kind of people who are very interested and kind to those who have come and showed mercy to the people who have a particular characteristic of this image.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) - who was one of his father " s immaculate fathers - came to Kermanshah.
Of course, they did not mean it, but they did not want to continue. They did not mean that they were among the families of the Agha.
One of his many children is one of the teachers.
This is an example.
Another example is the Speech of Agha's Aussain Hai, who was at the end of his life and came to Mashahad.
I still think about it.
The brothers and sisters of Aghagrei, Isfahan, the household of Isfahan and the household of Isfahan, the people of Isfahan, the people of Isfahan, who have come from Iraq and who have been in Kermanshah for many years.
He was the one who was sitting in Isfahan.
This is the case with Allah and calculation.
He was one of those who received training from the Akhund of the Fatul Zahi President, the President of Eid al-A.
Another teacher is the scholar of Kabuli
The book that is written about it is a beautiful book for many years ago.
For the past 60 years in Kermanshah. Majlis and teachers benefited from it.
I read in this book that the vote of Hajj Aughajin Mohammad Kam (a.s.) was present on his journey to the holy places and in Kermanshah province.
The writer of the book said that I would like to be two witnesses - that I would like to say that he was with me. He said that he was reading the book of the year.
This is an important point. One is learning during the time of the auspicious Imam of the Age (a.s.) in the immaculate and innovative position of the Imam of the Age (may
That is to say, it is not a matter of opposition or blemish to a great teacher and a source of pride.
We should learn what these things are. You dear youth should follow this path and make progress.
The man of Kabul, grew up in India, and moved to Kermanshah to Kermanshah and was welcomed there.
In Kermanshah, Kabul 60 years ago held in Kermansha
One of the instructors of Isfahan is one of the instructors of Isfahan.
This is an advantage which shows that the hearts of the people who are enlightened by religious scholars and teachers are interested in teachers.
When they find a person and understand what he is doing, they will respond to the fact that they will not believe that they will not
As the man of Isfahan, he felt like Kermanshah. He was the man of Kermanshah.
These are the things I said about the scene.
I would like to discuss certain issues.
The dear teachers, the dear youth, the dear youth of the future.
For two reasons: First of all, I would like to congratulate Islam in the world - whether in the countries of Islam or the non-Muslims.
Therefore, it is necessary to be vigilant.
Today you are in this situation.
You should not be afraid. They are afraid ofS and do not fear each one of them.
Do not be afraid to re-appearse their path.
You do not want to say that there is no injustice, but you should not be afraid of those who are suffering.
Dear God, do what is expected of them.
Did this happen in Iran?
The Iranian nation has been adopted in a different way. They will spend a lot of time and hour each day without it, no matter how insignificant they are.
Each person will say that this work is not done.
I would like to tell you that some of our resistanceers say that he will not do anything.
Ayatollah Khamenei said that the Imam (r.a.) said that the war was a war against the Shah and that he was not going to leave.
He did not believe that the Shah could be removed.
He told me this.
The Imam (r.a.) said that the Shah would be removed, but he was removed from it.
It was not just after the Shah, the United States had passed away, and the west went through the west and the arrogant powers were dissatisfied.
Nobody believes in this.
Nobody feels that the great Revolution of the Islamic Republic will take place in Egypt.
It is a very strange thing to do so in a different area, but nobody thinks about Egypt. But the Revolution took place in Egypt.
These are among the things that we should place in the heart.
We should move forward in a way that the things that we expect will not be done.
You should be determined to achieve heavy burdens so that you will be able to carry out everybody's responsibilities.
The answer is: " The praise of God is enough to be His people. They should not forget God.
And Allah is deserving of Him.
This is our path.
In this meeting, we are vigilant, as teachers - and we are committed to "When by Allah's favor, by Allah's favor, the Holy Prophets's (s.w.a.) household,
Allah the Exalted said: "They are like those who have been trained by the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), they are speaking to the people and the demons.
Dear God, if they do not do what, you will leave them with the right thing. [The Holy Quran, 6: 112]
Therefore, if you and I have been prepared to accept the divine message, we will be prepared to settle in the face of the demons and the people.
They will attack us, and we will be prepared.
In the arena of spirituality, we should create a strengthening aid for ourselves - which is a large shield of faith and faith - to prevent us from defeating it and conquering the peaks.
Greetings and dynamism originate from fleeting and from taking part of our country.
I would like to congratulate you.
If you are not defeated in your heart, nobody can achieve victory for you.
It is necessary to establish your hearts and strengthen your faith in God." [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Kubra's (s.w.a.) household, reliance on Allah, the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
[The Holy Quran, 39: 36] These are a lesson for us.
We should read the Holy Quran with all thought.
The witness that is being present on the basis of the methods of the system of things, the days and the days of the systems of communications and the organizations of the system of things.
I have an example in this regard.
These are the reports of the non-Muslims. In some Muslim countries they spend a lot of money in order to organize meetings and organize the meetings with Allah the Exalted.
The same is true of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a
These are the methods that they follow.
This is because there is a great blessing for them.
I would like to tell you that Shia and Sunni are the people who live with each other.
The teachers of Shia and they arrange meetings with each other and speak among them.
We have the responsibility to associate with them.
You can buy out your panegyrists, but you should work out your company.
If they want to do research, they do not do so.
I believe innovations, innovations, innovations, innovations, innovative studies, innovatives, innovations, innovations, innovations and innovations
But despite these things, there are certain things that have been associated with them. There are diseases that have been associated with innovative
The teachers of Shia speak about the people and speak to them in his public, using this power with their words to resolve the difficulties that were associated with.
Today the Armed Forces are not ashamed of.
It is necessary to pay attention to the issue of the Islamic Ummah.
Therefore, this responsibility that we have spoken about is the result of all these things.
Another responsibility is the responsibility of reading.
I heard that Kermanshah and his students were attending Kam - whose brothers were in charge. They were in exile, and if they did not return to them, they would have to go to their two months.
Therefore, knowledge is very important.
Of course, there is an important issue for scientific advances.
There was another point that was presented to the point that I was giving.
Once again, I asked him what I was doing. He said that I was outside the cities of Khorasian - I was preaching there. What happened to you, and he said, "I did not know where I would benefit those people."
This is understandable.
Today look at the peaks of our youth.
In Kermanshah, the graduates are very busy.
Sometimes they did not.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, all of Kermanshah, the graduates of the high-ranking school were not long enough.
But today those who have been enlightened are ten times more than ever before.
These youth are faced with a number of propaganda, and there are questions that they ask.
You should pay attention to their questions and prepare them for their answers.
Dear God, speak to those who are talking to you and understand their thoughts and thoughts and about the things that they need to learn from the Holy Quran and from the Holy Quran.
Mr. Mamduhi said this and said that this is the case: “The Holy Quran, the book of Mizan, the book of Mr. Qara'ati has been prepared to address the needs of the youth.
You should be vigilant.
It is necessary to do these things.
Think of the training that you have received from a heavenly representatives.
Sanctify the hearts of those who speak and encourage them.
As I said, "Doman who gives birth to a nation, has started reading about it before he reads it.
It is necessary to carry out this difficult task.
The teachers should enter the arena of role models, but the important point is that teachers should enter into the arena of role models.
The role of teachers is that they play in the arena of morality, morality, kindness, kindness, and behavior. They try to attract the minds of the people who are speaking to them.
It is the entire reform.
A person who is stricken by all his blessings would be able to preserve his relationship with Him.
It is a very important thing.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on those who speak with them.
This meeting is an integral meeting for each year. I do not know whether it is presented in Kermanshah or not.
Shia and Sunni brothers should not foil Shia and Sunni brothers.
Go with one another.
There are certain things that have been associated with.
If this happens, divine teachers will continue.
I would like to tell you that when the Revolution prevailed, Islam had a new spirit in the world.
Is this kind of intensified economy that it has been possible to create such a great event that has shaken the west?
The victory of the Islamic Revolution and the magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was severely shaken.
They returned to the Holy Quran and found certain points to Islam and they were interested in Islam.
At that time, they started fighting against Islam and the second stage of the movement.
Greetings in the Islamic countries have been among the most pure and sincere people who wished the government in different ways. They thought that if the government is established, there will be an end to poverty and injustice from their countries.
Some of them are righteous, but they do not believe in Islam.
They thought that there was a hope for people.
But when a crippling between a few decades, they saw that the situation was different, and there was no principle.
Therefore, they went through Islam.
They are all the families of the youth who have seen in Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen and other places. Both in the past and in the 1960s - in the late 1970 " s - that is, they slogans of the youth who have seen in Egypt and who are smeaning the Islamic Republic.
This is the case in our country. I do not want to mention them.
There are people who are speaking about Islam, but in the real sense of these things, there are people who are familiar with Islam.
They look at the Holy Quran and watch the Holy Quran as they look at the Islamic Republic and look at the flag of Islam. They look at the Holy Quran
In a system that is based on Islam, the Islamic view of the present system of things is being carried out, and the blood of the people is fighting against it.
These people who are trying to do whatever they need, but they do not find themselves, they see what they are looking for in Islam.
What are the things that happen?
They want to do this. They do not want to be treated.
In the United States, in charge of the economy of the economy of the US, New York, and in the streets of Street, the source of global power, thousands of people gathered together to show that they are not interested in perpetrators and that they are not
Well, this is what we have said, "In the past, we have said that the Iranian nation is not present on the scene, and we do not believe the order of slogans, and we do not believe in it."
You should pay attention to this point.
Islamic teachers should be prepared.
I would like to congratulate the Holy Quran and the Holy Quran, the statements of the Holy Quran and the statements of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the people should pay attention to their needs. They should pay attention to their needs and
If you do this, you will see the depth of love for Islam.
I would like to express my sentiments to you. I would like to say a lot of things to do.
Dear God, make religious scholars of the things that you believe.
Dear God, bestow success on these dear youth and youth - in Kermanshah and Kermanshah and Kermanshah.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on all of us.
Dear God, make the heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).

Sayyid Ali Khamenei

(French only),
Leader’s Speech to Exemplary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.)
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on June 4, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution on
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate, immaculate and pure household, especially the one that is accompanied by Allah's favor in Mahdam.
We are thankful to Allah the Exalted who has given us another opportunity and for years to re-appear our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and to
Although the Imam (r.a.) was still alive in the hearts of our people, the day of Khordad was a manifestation of love for the Iranian nation towards the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
This was the day of the martyrdom of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) re-appearing Imam Khomeini (a.s.)
This year, the year 1342, was the beginning of the Islamic Revolution, and the beginning of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps was very important.
The 15th of Khordad is a very important day and a week.
I would like to talk about it before going to the main point and speak about it.
The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement of teachers and the people.
Before the 15th of Khordad, there were some important issues that happened in the year 1341 and the message of the year 1342.
For example, the events of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution met with the beginning of the year 2,42, with the issue of stabilizing and infidelity of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps.
Before the year 1341 B.C.E. The issue of the judiciary people in the marketplace of Tehran was clarified, and the people were
These are all the facts that show that the movement of teachers in the year 1341 and early as well as the chairmanship of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps has increased its power in the educational system.
However, the day of Khordad is a very important occasion.
Therefore, what happened on Khordad 1342 is an indication of the relations between the people and teachers at that time.
On the day of the year 13th of Khordad, Imam Khomeini delivered a very important discourse in Palestine.
Later on the day of Khordad, in Tehran, in Tehran and other cities, the people appeared on the streets. Gulf of Damascus, the army and the police stationed the people on the 15th of Khordad ems.
One point is that such relations are the result of the progress of the movement and the movement towards victory.
Wherever a movement is supported by people and traveling with them, the movement will continue.
But if the people do not enter a movement, they will not achieve victory.
As was true of Iran during the episodes of the government, valiants and tyrannical people managed to defeat them. Because they had not been with them.
When the people entered the arena and they supported the movement and thought that the movement would be with him, the movement will continue and achieve victory.
This is what happened on Khordad.
The presence of the people who were in Tehran and from other cities was captured to Imam Khomeini (r.a.), the people were forced to enter the arena with the people.
The blood of God " s servants and the youth of the Islamic Republic have been filled with the blood of God's servants.
On the 15th of Khordad, innovative and indifference, the faith of the Revolution became clear.
Another issue in Khordad - which is good for our dear youth and our dear people - is that in Tehran's bloodshed and other cities, there is nowhere else in the country, those who call on human rights and those who are in charge.
People and teachers should not give up in the arena.
They claimed that they are an evil movement. They claimed that they have supported the resistance of the government - and they have made the movement against it. They
When those who are looking at optimistic people who have been dissatisfied in the battlefield, they reproach us and those who are fighting in the battlefield.
They said, "They are the people of the country. They said that they are a movement in a different way. Imam Khomeini (r.a.) managed to achieve this movement, and he has promoted the world as a religious denomination and academic
The Imam (r.a.) had three things that he believed in, those who gave him determination and resistance. These are the three things: faith, faith, and power of the people and those who believed in the arena of faith and self-confidence.
The Imam (r.a.) was speaking from the midst of his heart, and the people responded to this call by him and all they had done.
They entered the arena and resistance.
They carried out this movement, which is no part of the world, to victory.
I would like to discuss the three-and-hearted Imam (a.s.).
These are some important factors which if we understand them, they will illuminate our path.
The expression "We are the people, the people have gathered together and they have been gathered together. You should be in fear of them.
They said, "The Holy Quran, Sura al-Kubra's (s.w.a.), the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the Holy Prophet (s.
He spoke about it because God spoke about it and acted in a way that "Intensified God will help you." [The Holy Quran, 47] Allah's promises, which will be fulfilled, no matter how insignificant it will be.
The Imam (r.a.) understood the meaning of this word.
The Imam (r.a.) said that the Iranian nation is a nation, a nation, a faith, determination, and firm determination. If anybody wins a champion, it can reveal itself in all arenas of the sun.
Imam Khomeini delivered the people of Iran, but at the time the people of Nadeli Age (a.s.), the people of Iran had been oppressed by the people of Iran.
He understood the Iranian nation and made them lie.
The fact that the people who are familiar with the Islamic Republic is an example of resistance and insight.
The people enjoyed their favorite presence in the Imam of the Age (a.s.) and the enemies of the Iranian nation.
This is why Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was not present at the palace of colonial and colonialists because they were opposed to the culture of the country and Imam (r.a.) viewed the people as enemies.
The Imam (r.a.) taught the Iranian nation that we are in a position to cooperate with them.
On the day of the 1342, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) appeared before the Mediterranean and the people of Iran in the Islamic seminary, and they trusted in the United States and independent people of Iran and those who were active in the country.
One scholar was in the city of Kum, who did not have any weapons or support for international assistance.
Faith in God and trusting you will be the basis of this regard.
When the Imam (r.a.) returned from exile, Beheshti Zahra (s.a.), the people of Bakhra (s.a.) said that I would be fighting at the Bakhavior of Ba
The Imam (r.a.) managed to address the needs of the Imam (r.a.)
The Imam (r.a.) accepted his invitation to the people.
Some believe this. One of the powerful weapons that the enemies have made in order to prove their power against other nations is to say that it is impossible to do so.
Thus, the Iranian nation has been sustained for many years in political, scientific, economic, and other areas of life.
He said to the Iranian people that you can achieve success.
He returns to us and restores us the kind of resistance in the right direction and restores us to his self-confidence and self-confidence.
I would like to congratulate the Iranian nation, the people of Iran for the past 30 years, and I will speak about them in all areas.
They believe in Imam Khomeini (r.a.) and the people who believe in, faith, and self-confidence, and self-confidence.
At the beginning of this resistance, the three faithless people gave the Imam (r.a.) to the Imam (a.s.).
The same is true of the time when he was forced to flee to Paris and when he returned to Iran.
The three things that they gave to Imam Khomeini's return to Tehran in a similar situation.
This was the case in Bahman of the year 1357, when the Islamic Revolution announced the establishment of the Islamic Republic during the past few years, Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
The Imam (r.a.) was the source of the power of the Imam (r.a.) and all
Until the end of his life, nobody has seen a sign of weakness, tiredness and fattenance in words and deeds of the Imam (r.a.)
For many years, the arrogant powers of the world were trying to pressure them to start confronting them in what they were doing.
At times, they returned from the backwardness of the statements that they had
The Imam (r.a.) spoke at the end of his life during the year 1342 and his discourses were far stronger than they had been.
He was old, but his heart was a youth.
This is the firm determination of the Holy Quran, which says: "They are well-established on the path and they are imposed on the path." [The Holy Quran, 72: 726]
In a different verse, he said: "The people who have said: "They are really Allah, they are in the right direction, the angels who are in the arena of you should be in fear, and you should not give birth to Paradise and the hope of the Imam of the Ayat."
The Iranian nation changed their heart, and Allah the Exalted changed their situation." [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Kubra's (s.w.a.)
The Iranian nation managed to correct their path, Allah the Exalted, helping them and extend their assistance to them.
What was the result?
There are many things that our youth should know about the reliance on the government of Pahlavi regime - which is the most important of the kingdom of the Islamic Republic of Iran - to do with England and the United States.
This self-confidence achieves shame.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the presidential officials of the US, said, "We are the things that are necessary and they do not need."
They tell him that you should establish and strengthen your relations.
For example, if you don " t sell the product of oil, you will sell it and do not sell it to yourselves.
In such a country that is trusting in others, it has been returned to an illegitimate country and it is accompanied by illegitima
The corrupt leaders, the policy of those who are involved in the domination of the country, but they have been replaced by the representatives of the country.
They were replaced by the officials and the people.
Over the past 30 years, the officials of the country and the issues of the economy of the country are the people of this country.
They do not vote their commitments to the people, when they speak at the end of the government - they are more important than others.
The corrupt and evil champion of the enemies and their wrath towards the people and they have transformed themselves into the arena of knowledge.
Before the Revolution, we had no success in the arena of knowledge in the country.
Is this a source?
Commitments of the world's denominations say that during the 2017 due to 2017, Iran will reach the peaks of knowledge in the world.
Is this a source?
If we want to build the streets and technical products, we should pay attention to certain products. We should pay attention to certain products and build up the streets.
Today the youth of this country and the youth who are not content to rely on the ground and see that they build thousands of councils, explosions and basijis in the country.
Is it necessary to avoid all these things?
In health and medicine, for example, we should move our patients to North Europe, if they do not have to do anything, if they do not have to die.
Today the most important and important work is being done in Tehran, not just in Tehran, but in other cities.
The Iranian nation does not need certain foreigners in this regard.
We have achieved self-confidence in this important
Many of the countries of the country were neglected at that time.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, I visited several cities and numerous regions of our country, and the country had not managed to be cared for innovative areas.
Today there are different kinds of services throughout the country.
Today, nobody can say that outsiders neither give electricity nor legislative means.
During the winters of the Revolution, the number of 30 million people of the country were during that time.
Today the number of people has doubled the number of our government officials over 20 times.
The importance of our officials means that teachers and officials should pay attention to them.
Each town in the same city, there are two of the people who are active in the arena of
At that time, a high-ranking number of high school students did not make a lot of achievements.
Today, there is a city in which there are officials in charge.
This is the great movement of the Iranian nation, the efforts of the youth and the efforts of our youth and our officials during the past 30 years.
These are important things.
The blessings of the Revolution were made and many important achievements were made in the country. Thousands of thousands of panegyrists have been created in the country.
There are many kinds of people in the country.
It is necessary to look at these things.
These are the blessings that the 13th-century Imam (r.a.) household and greetings be upon the people and souls of the people, faith, faith, and
This is not to say that we are not saying these things because the
No, it is still great in our vanguard.
I would like to tell you that if we compared ourselves to taghut, we can see that the success of the country. But if we compared ourselves to the Islamic Republic, the Iranian nation and the people who are interested in seeing the glory of the world, the sense of dignity and morality.
I would like to say that this is because of our dear people and outstanding personalities and outstanding personalities.
They know that there is a long way in the near future.
You can continue following this long path until the peaks.
I speak these words because you know that the efforts of the enemies are trying to deploy the enemy in our hearts. This is because of
The chain of the path is ahead of us.
We have a map.
What is the map?
The teaching of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was the result of the training of the magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and the message that our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was among the people
I would like to congratulate the name of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
The chain of the path was with Imam (r.a.)
The Imam (r.a.) is the resistance of the Islamic Republic, the Islamic Ummah, the most policies of the countries
The Imam (r.a.) was with us.
The discourses and writers - who were gathered together in the book - were with us. In the arena of cultures, Imam Khomeini (r.a.), innovative and innovative cultures.
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was the champion of economy, reliance on the grounds of resistance, self-confidence and self-sufficiency, innovative and innovative state of sanction, inflation and innovation and innovation, innovative
The Imam (r.a.) demanded that we accept the economic economy of the world.
The Iranian nation can reduce this kind of production by relying on the foundations of faith and enduring in the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
The Iranian nation can continue.
From the perspective of the power and experience, our prominent people of Iran will continue following the path that has been established in the past thirty years, and by Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will be able to follow the path of the Islamic Ummah throughout the past 30 years.
Of course, the issue of elections is the issue of progress.
My dear brothers and sisters, you dear people of Iran,
It is the symbol of all these three faiths associated with our Imam (r.a.), and it is the symbol of faith in God.
Our goal is to play a role in our country.
The Iranian people are responsible for this responsibility.
It is a sign of trust for the people, for the elections are a symbol of humanity.
It is also a sign of trust, and everybody who casts his illegitimate rists into the bottom of elections feels that he has made donations for the country.
This is an important point.
Therefore, elections are a sign of trust in God.
Anyone who is involved in the arena of vigilance - the eight-year group - who are present on the scene - are not against the Islamic Republic.
Each member of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is a vote for the Islamic Republic.
He personally entered the arena of elections, whether those who were taking the lead in the country or those who were elected by the flag of the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Republic.
I would like to congratulate you, the brothers, the members of the Revolution and the other participants of the country and the rest of the country.
Our enmity towards the Islamic Republic is a great opportunity for the Islamic Republic.
They are not doing all the right to do, but they have the opportunity to say that the Islamic Republic or they are present on the scene in the year 1388.
This is what the enemies of this nation hope.
Of course, they do not know the people of Iran. The enemies of our nation have forgotten the day of Dey (30, when the Iranian nation entered the arena in order to support the Islamic Republic more than the fitna of the year 1388.
In order to reduce the cover of this election, they have organized other scholars who will be able to express themselves through the media.
On one occasion, they said that the elections of the people have always been organized. They sometimes say that they are not in elections, they say that they do not believe in the eyes of the people.
No, they do not know our people, and they do not know our elections, and they do not understand the Islamic Republic's
Is this possible in countries so
Unfortunately, if you are not involved in two or three intellectuals, you do not have to support the legitimate ethics and their occupations and their occupations and occupiancy.
There are certain people who do not support the Zionist regime and do not support the bloody people of the world and whatever they do, they cannot enter the arena.
They did not have the media with them, so they did not have to beat their panegyrists.
Therefore, they will be killed on the shoulders of their shoulders.
In our country, they will not manage to spend a lot of time with the people.
Where are the conditions common to the world?
What is right in the arena of elections is the only laws.
According to the laws that some may enter the arena of elections, others cannot enter the arena of elections
The Law made possible a lot of things to do, and they deserved their stand.
This is the basis of the laws.
They said that they used to say something. They said, "Well, if they said, "We do these things. They say, just as I have said, some ungodly people are trying to emphasize these things.
By Allah's favor, the Iranian nation will respond to the efforts of those who are in the arena of resistance, and they will respond to the re-appearance
I would like to speak to a group of politicians who used to support the academies of the auspicious clerics of government, this responsibility is their duty.
They do whatever they see, but they do what they see, they want to do what is right, and they are determined to do what is right.
They should pay attention to this point. I do not have any support from a foreign mediator because they want to say, " I am better than anywhere else."
I would like to call the brothers who are trying to attract the minds of the people to a group and speak about it.
They did this, but they did not mean that they did not mean an evil act. They did not mean the government, neither in this government nor in the past.
They should not be the meaning of the economy of good deeds.
Everybody who is active in the country does not need to work at the beginning so that hundreds of achievements have been made.
Over the years, different governments have been managed to build a lot of countries.
These things should not be ignored.
All these things should not be done simply because the issue of economy and economy is the result of all those activities.
Of course, if we have some problems, we should not ignore all the things that have been done in our day.
Of course, we should not perform unrealities.
I would like to tell all the children what they did during the year 13 years when they spoke to them and they would not be ashamed.
If you are present on the scene, you will not be patient with them and if you are present on the scene.
Dear God, do what you can.
In our country and on the basis of the guidance of our government, the president of the country has great power.
The presence of the Armed Forces in the Sacred Defense Era is a great source of power.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is one of the things that is happening in his hands. The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps
The president of the country had a lot in different events.
It is the best possible possible.
That is to say, the Law will do more than anybody else.
The Law was a basiji, and the
The people who speak to the people should tell them what they want and what they need.
If they are prepared and organized, they will tell them what they are doing in order to carry out their efforts in order to manage the government, protecting and taking advantage of the power of the laws and regulations by using the laws and regulations, they will not carry out their responsibility in this regard.
Some people have a mistaken thought that we should provoke the enemy so that they
The goals of those who have
The enemies are due to the presence of the Islamic Republic because the presence of the Imam (r.a.) because the Imam (r.a.) was alive in the hearts of the people and innovative.
This is why they are angry.
If our nation has stood firm, it has reduced the needs of the country, which is managed to resolve its problems, today the issue of economy is the path of the economy, the enemies will not be able to stand before the Iranian nation.
In any case, what is important is the determination, faith, and trust of the people who are in the arena of self-respect, whether you are yours or not.
My dear children, the ten days of those who go to a great test, I hope Allah's favor, and this great test of the people will bring about their blessings.
Necessity or power is a source of power and power.
Leader's Guards Corps - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
To All the Young People - Europe and North America
The recent recent war in France and its other countries, they made me feel the right to speak to you in other countries.
I speak to you, O youth, not to your parents, but to you, but to you who are the future, the future of your nation and your country - and because your hearts are full of knowledge.
I am not speaking to politicians and government officials because I am determined to judiciate the idea that they have deviated from the path of truth and they are completely removed from the path of truth.
Commenting on Islam is especially one of the things that is presented in the Islamic Republic.
Thirty years ago - from the beginning of the 19th century - has been the most successful efforts to explain this great religion as a fear-inspiring religion.
Unfortunately, this situation has been a source of fear and stability.
I would not like to speak about different kinds of phenomena and different kinds of fear that have been imposed on the hearts of nations in western countries.
If you go back throughout history, they will see that innovative history they have been cured by the injustices of the people and nations and nations throughout the world.
The history of the United States and the United States was dissatisfied because of the worship of the people and the oppressors of those who were not Christians.
Experts and teachers are among the shamefulness of the bloodthirsty between the believers, the Catholics and Protestants and the name of foreigners and those who live in different parts of the world.
The purpose of the Army and the aspect of the long history of this long ago is not by nature, but it is the purpose of the events that I am trying to raise with your scholars and ask whether I am held back for a few years or after the conscience of the people of the west and those who have been awakened from them.
Why are the consciences of people shown to the events that have been happening in the history of the past few decades?
Why are people in general regard for the important things such as they engage in culture and thought of Islam?
You should know that the indifference and kindness of the people of the bottom are the result of having been associated with all kinds of oppression and violence.
I would like to ask you, Why are the embodiment of the long-stricken politicians returned to Islam and Muslims?
Why does the world " s system of things now reflect on Islam?
What are some things that they are thinking and teachings of Islam that can be a source of security for the countries of the world, and what will they do to dishonor Islam?
Therefore, the first need is to ask a question and ask the purpose of this great movement of the Islamic Republic.
The second need is to respond to such a great source of propaganda about Islam and its propaganda efforts. You should try to identify this religion with a clear understanding of it.
The health of the people is a source of terror for the sake of God and for you. I am not saying that you believe in Islam, but you do not know what Islam is doing and what I do not believe in it.
You should not let them tell you that they have their authority as Islamic representatives.
You should try to identify Islam from its origin.
You should understand Islam by means of the Holy Quran and by the life of the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.) and his
I would like to ask you, Whom have you been reading directly from the Holy Quran?
Have you carefully read the teachings of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and his household be upon him and upon his blessings and blessings?
Are you now aware of the importance of Islam's message in different parts of the world?
Have you ever asked yourself to do this?
I advise you not to allow political and intellectuals to deploy you from the truth and to eradicate the existence of justice from you.
Now, by the establishment of the organization, the organizations of the country have deployed its walls, do not
Of course, there is nobody else who is present on the basis of this system of things, but any one of you can achieve justice in this regard.
Despite the challenges that have been made between Islam and you young people, you are faced with a sincere and sincere challenge. But this is a source of sincere questions in your hearts.
The answers to these questions will help you to identify new truths.
Therefore, do not let this opportunity come to an accurate understanding of Islam to you so that you are weighed down with this responsibility in your ears and nations will record the history of this intensified labor without suffering.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
Leader Meets with the Islamic Republic - Khamenei.ir
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this afternoon with Ayatollah Khamenei as the chairman of the Islamic Republic.
The following is the full text of the guidance given by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
Honorable Mahdavid Ahmadine (Allahh)
Basically, your valuable efforts have been made for eight years as the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran and your experience in this regard.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 20, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a thousand people in the city of Ridha.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household, especially the one who is in the country.
I would like to thank Allah the Exalted who gave me another opportunity to meet you dear people, the dear people of Mashhad and those who visited the country and the dear brothers and sisters in the holy city of Eid al-Kubra (s.a.).
I would like to congratulate the blessings of the new year, and I hope the year that we entered will be a year full of blessings and good deeds for all the people of Iran and the work that was being done by Allah the Exalted and by Allah the Exalted.
There are certain points that I would like to discuss with you dear brothers and sisters.
The first point is to be a champion on the events that happened to us, our nation , our country , and the events that affected us in the region and in the region.
Our goal of the events that happened in the year 1390, especially the achievements that the Iranian nation enjoyed in this year is because of the plots of the enemies and the enemies of the Iranian nation.
The leaders of arrogance, arrogance, self-confidence, self-confidence, academic and self-confidence, academic and the pious power of the Iranian nation and making them tremble.
Anyone who follows the propaganda efforts of the Iranian nation can make such efforts in the arena of economy, economic valor, economic, and political personalities and other such things threaten the Iranian nation towards the progress of the country and its progress.
They really want to democracy that the Imam of the Age (r.a.) teaches us and that the Islamic Revolution has given us the power to address the people from the heart and to it that you should not be able to do anything.
They made all efforts to achieve this goal. The year that they made a lot of progress, they managed to do this.
I would like to know that they hope the Iranian nation will move ahead on the path that they have made and their progress they have made and they have made them give them their best in the world, including the enemies.
The reason that we speak about the potentials of the countries that have been made is that the Iranian nation has made use of such power and that it is independent of the Iranian nation. They
Of course, we are not in the arena of weakness, but in the face of weakness, we are far more powerful than the things that we have made.
We gave the year 1390 a name for the year 1390 [The Year of Economic Jihad and the year 1390]. Therefore, this year the issue of economy is from economic matters.
The movement that the officials of the country have made in economic arenas and the behavior of the people that they have received throughout the past is a very important point.
Among the things that can be said in this regard is the government's political goal.
The issue of the economy of the economy - in the past - or in this government - has been imposed on the issue of this government. Everybody believes that this is the case.
Of course, this event has been associated with the issue of suffering, but the situation has been different from the things that have been done in the past. But the government and the Majlis in the past, the organization and the system of sanctions that
It is not an organization, but what has happened to the officials of the government - in the government orientation and in the council - have been supported by the people and have been supported by important achievements.
All our people feel that they are hearing, but they should think about them. This is a great duty.
One of the goals of this system is to separate the people from government officials in a fair way.
In a discourse, I explained that in the past, different sectors of the country are separated from different sectors of society.
I would like to learn from different parts of the country that shows that this has influenced the lives of the innocent people among the country.
This is one of the goals of this system of things.
Another goal is to improve the quality of the country.
Basically, the economy of economy - which all of them associated with - has been adjusted by the purpose of improving the quality of production.
Another goal is to use discipline in the right way.
As long as we have been blessed by Allah's favor, we are used to perform feminine phenomenon.
Our use of these blessings is one of the opportunities of the world.
I believe that if we are not present on the scene, the organizations of the country make up the country, the organizations that are not used in this regard.
What should we do?
The Iranian nation should pay attention to the hand of the enemies and enemies.
But as a result of this work, our nation has managed to do more than ever before, the movement that is used in the country is in the best possible way. It is necessary to enter the arena.
This is the work that has been done in the year 1390. When our enemies
The youth in our society made efforts, and they managed to meet the plots of the enemies.
A crucial and important work that has been done in the past, the result of the efforts of the people is what is done in the arena of knowledge and
The fact that knowledge and skill is one of the main pillars of economic valor and establishment of the Islamic Republic.
When a nation achieves knowledge that has increased in modern technology, wealth will be achieved and policies, it will become a source of power and power.
Because of the importance of scientific progress and artistic advances, I would like to present this issue in particular.
I would tell you that the progress that has been made in the country is more than ever before.
According to the report of the world-based scientific organizations - which is not the centers of knowledge - is the most quickest of scientific progress in the world.
In the year 1390, which was apprehensive about 2011, reporting the educational systems of the world in 2011 - which was the three months leading up to the Iranian nation.
This has been achieved when the enemies of the Iranian nation managed to remove the Iranian nation's sanctions, but the Iranian nation managed to do such things.
In the past, the Islamic Republic's Guards Corps is one of the most reliable organizations in the world - which is the first one in the arena of scientific progress, and it is in all the world.
That is to say, some people who have been present on the issue of innovations. However, they said that the year 1390's Guards Corps have made progress in the art of Nanono's system, in the field of technology, we have made progress in the year of the year 13888.
In the year 1389, the organizations of the Islamic Republic and the rest of the population of America and other such things were a source of vigilance for us.
It is necessary to prepare the ground for twenty-five-percent fuel. We should pay attention to our research in Tehran
They placed a number of spectators in order to provide information for us, but we accepted it.
The Brazilian and Turkey came to the front line with our government officials and joined the agreement.
However, after the agreement, the Americans do not want to sign it. They want to use their power to help them achieve their power.
As a result of the lack of vows made by the United States, the people of Brazil and Turkey were ashamed. This was the issue of twenty percent.
Last year they managed to bring about 20 percent to benefit from the nuclear negotiations and announced it to the world, and our enemies entered into a lot of trouble.
Of course, they knew that the origin of Tehran is because of the need of patients and thousands of health-care professionals - and even if they prevented it from giving back to Tehran.
Our youth managed to achieve this.
It is a difficult and difficult work that is carried out in Tehran and the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are being carried out in different kinds of production.
This is the case in the year 1390.
During the Sacred Defense Era, the Russians and the Majlis (a.s.), the Russians and the three-and-a-half-year denomination, the Russia rose about 20 percent.
This is the case in 1390.
The program that was carried out by the Iranian nation throughout the year 1390 was six times, innovations and innovative practices of the country and innovative
These are some aspects of the achievements that have been made during the year of economy of economy and economy.
These are the scientific progress, scientific progress and the materials that point to knowledge, but all of them have a clear influence on the issue of economy in the country.
By the end of the year 1390 - that is, in the last week - I stepped up the center of scientific research.
I have seen many of the things that have been made in different arenas of knowledge, which are also common in different areas. Therefore, one can say that it is not enough to achieve such progress.
First of all, it is the spirit and the thoughts of the people who are in the hearts of those who are carrying out this responsibility.
They are the kind of people who are fighting in the battlefield because they are in the arena of God.
There is a difference between the people who are working for the right, fortunately, in order to achieve knowledge and jihad among the people who are working for the sake of God.
This is a very valuable thing.
The second point is to see that our government officials have managed to jump the issue of sanctions
During the hajj, some people said that we are thankful to God for their sanctions.
This basiji spirit teaches us that the sanctions of the enemies are valuable and important.
The third factor that I witnessed at that meeting is the kind of trust that has been placed on her.
Some parts of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are not limited to the complexity of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Over the years, we need to teach her the arena of those hard and difficult jobs.
But if I see that they have said that we are indeed.
This kind of trust between a nation and other youth is very valuable.
Another characteristic is the trust of the youth.
This is because labor is in the hands of the youth.
And you dear youth are the foundations of understanding.
Another characteristic is the relationship between scientific and government officials.
I would like to congratulate the officials of the different sectors who have been associated with the government and who have made efforts to establish the relations between scholars and officials.
Fortunately, I noticed that this relationship was strengthened.
Of course, if this is true of all our scholarship and officials, it will help us to make progress in the arena of knowledge and innovations.
This is the issue of economic activities in the year 1390. Since its beginning, they are threatening the efforts of the enemies. Sometimes they threaten the pressure of politics, they are at obscure.
Today the US government officials are trying to denominate their sanctions in order to deploy the Iranian nation and bring about discord between the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic.
There are certain victories that have been made in the year 1390.
Dear God, the meetings of the Islamic Awakening, the Palestinian, the meetings of the weapons, the international ceremonies and the terrorist activities of the youth and the youth in the Islamic Republic - all of these are the ones among the things that have been done in Tehran.
The Islamic Republic is a center of vigilance between Muslim nations and the world of Islam.
In economic arenas, thousands of homes and homes have been built in economic arenas.
This is a very great number. It is necessary to build houses in the country, innovative, influential and influential areas.
These are the things that have been created in these years proved righteous.
In spite of the enemies' threats, the Iranian nation has stood firm and made such progress.
Of course, it is necessary to realize that until now the elections are not finished. I hope the people will bring their dignity and dignity during the second election.
This elections are very important.
I would like to tell you that in the past, I said six months, they were trying to kill the people so that they could not get out of the country.
Sometimes they say that there will be a lot of propaganda in order to deploy the people who are opposed to the enemies' opposition to the Iranian nation. They have made different propaganda efforts to prevent people from voting.
During the time of the killing of our scholars - who were in the past six months and six months - they were trying to kill our people.
Thirty years ago the number of people during the Sacred Defense Era (a.s.) was not one of the 40 percent.
Well, try to compare this with the Iranian nation,
By such pressures, by such athletes and threats, the threats and threats of the bloodthirsty in Esfan and the elections of the Assembly of Experts, the members of the Assembly of Experts and the Islamic Republic should be separated from the people and the Islamic Republic.
This election is a source of power and power.
They have been exposed to the propaganda that is being delivered in Iran and that they have spread the message of truth, but they are not in the best possible way.
It is the case with the eyes of the people.
This election was like a powerful mediator who used to clarify the realities of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic towards other nations.
These are the events that happened in the year 1390.
These are the things that the Iranian nation has experienced during the year 1390.
Since the nuclear issue has been introduced, the enemies have been present on it.
Of course they know and say that Iran does not want nuclear weapons.
This is the truth. We do not have any reason to do so. We do not try to make nuclear weapons. We do not know that this is the case, but they do not know what to do so. They
What is the main issue?
The main point is the resistance of the Islamic Republic in order to defend the wealth of the Iranian nation.
The future - such as the firm determination of economic, political, scientific and scientific advances - have been the kind of self-respect and blind manpower.
Even in the past few decades, the people of the world will need to pay attention to the Islamic Republic.
The arrogant powers know that their life is a product and athlete.
When the existence of a living person is lacking in an aggressive environment, they are faced with a lot of hardships and they should pay attention to their needs. Such a day will be disastrous for them in the west and they are faced with a difficult situation on the basis of this system of things.
During the past six years, a few years ago, they should pay attention to the needs of the country and the capacities of other countries. They should pay attention to these products.
The US that has calculated the $ 30 billion billion, according to the calculation of our scholars - which is trusting in the number of Americans - has been imposed on 20, 21, 20 years ago.
They will at that time rely on the episodes of the Persian Gulf that appeared in the region and 50 percent of the world.
At that time, they were relying on the three corners of the region and the seashore. One of these pillars was the country and the one who would explain it.
In the midst of the countries of the world - not just the Persian Gulf - the country that is more powerful than ever before - is the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Some countries are superior to us, and some people are better than we do.
The blessing of the airplane is the second part of the world - the first part of the Russian country - in the arena of the economy and the countries that have been imposed on us by the countries that are far more valuable than the world, but if
This is an example of paying attention to countries that are using oil for the arrogant and innovations of the arrogant powers and those whose entire life is embodied and blind.
For the past five years, the Islamic Republic has been safeguarded by the blessedness of the Islamic Republic.
What do the arrogant powers want?
They want this country to be dominated by a government and a system that will be like a illegitimate in the hands of other countries. They have a gift, but they do not want to do whatever they can.
If in Iran, which is a illegitimate organization, a government that stands up against the arrogance of arrogance in Iran, it will stand up against the arrogance of this wealth and will be defeated by the enemies of the Islamic Republic.
The people who think that if we take a firm stand against the nuclear issue, the Americans will bring the end of their enmity, they will be able to quench them from this fact.
The problem is not a nuclear issue.
There are also nuclear powers, but they do not care about them.
Therefore, the issue of nuclear weapons is not the issue of negotiations, nor is it the issue of human rights.
The problem is the Islamic Republic, which stands up against them like a lion.
If the Islamic Republic is like other countries of the region, it is prepared to deploy the people, let them
The issue is the kind of pride that they have against the Iranian nation.
Of course the Americans make mistakes.
It is a serious mistake to think that by exercising firm determination and threats, the Islamic Republic of Iran will be forced to resolute the Islamic Republic from the arena of
Weekly do not allow their nations to identify the kind of calamities that they can stand up in the arena of blessings.
They do not want their nations to understand what they are looking forward to in the issue of the economy and they do not want to tell the nations about these things.
They thought that they would not be able to do so by exercising their enmity towards the Iranian nation.
I would like to inform you, dear brothers and sisters and you dear people of Iran, the Americans and all the kinds of power that are imposed on you and that they are in the arena of weakness.
I do not want to create excuses for my artistic information or other experiences in particular. What I would discuss is the subject of two calculations.
Look at the US President is the result of his terrorists.
What does it mean to be patient?
I would like to transform this situation.
If the people of America are opposed to their prejudice, they are not prepared to participate in the arena of volence, but they are careful not to jump to their wishes. They
The effect that the oppressed people of the country showed that they are committed to the behavior of the Americans. When the man stands up, the Americans stood up up and made an evil situation for them, he promised that he would bring them back to life.
Therefore, it is believed that they are extremely dangerous.
I did not want to say this, and the Americans showed themselves that their situation was worse.
This is to say, it is necessary to see that the man is at the end of the government.
Has it been possible to change this dangerous situation?
This debt is accurate and accurate.
This is a great problem for a country.
This is the case of the politicians. They were forced to leave Iraq without defeat. In Afghanistan every day their situation is worse.
Muslims in Egypt, in northern Africa, in Tunisia and the Americans have poured out on their hands.
Basical to all these things, the movement of Wall Street which has been imposed on the US.
Is this a good situation?
Therefore, America is in a very difficult situation.
The Americans were threats to other countries, and they bowed down.
I would like to announce that we do not have nuclear weapons, but we will protect ourselves against any enemies against us. We will respond to the attack against the enemies of the country. We will
The Holy Quran promises us: "Soves and those who have strayed away from you and who have turned their backs on them, and they will not receive any discipline.
By Allah's mercy, you will not have access to the path of God which is oppressed by the oppressors. [The Holy Quran, 48: 2223]
Nowhere in the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) said that if you start a war, you will be successful. You will be successful.
But he promised that whenever the enemies attacked you, they would be defeated.
This should not be expected to be done at the beginning of Islam. No, "Hear Allah's favor, and you will not be defeated by Allah's assistance to their oppressors, they say
The Iranian nation has made a lot of progress and it does not mean an attack on a certain country, but it is associated with the love of its people, her wealth, Islam, the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Republic.
That is to say, when you use domestic products, you help them to do the work of the Iranian nation, you assist the progress of the Iranian nation.
There are certain aspects of our nation - whether in the past - which we have been wrong and what is happening in the country - that is to say, our magnanimous nature is harming our country and our future.
Each of us has a duty to support and strengthen our domestic products.
Today the officials have a good example in the country. They can use this to strengthen domestic products.
The same is true of the people - whether those who are weak or who are able to do work - should move on the same path.
It is necessary to pay attention to the domestic products.
It is not a source of pride and error, and it is a source of pride in our home and in the things that we need in our country and in the best possible way of the domestic products.
I heard that some of the productions in the country had been on the front line and that some of the facilities were returned to the country.
If they were sold in this way, they would not like to be dissatisfied, but they had a sign of company in which they used to buy the graduation or to do so.
The domestic products are very important.
In the arena of production and management, the management of the management of the people is another side of the issue of improvement in the way the country and the people of Iran should call our people on it to him and what aspect of the economy of progress we have made in the year.
Dear brothers and sisters throughout the country, we need unity and work together.
There are things that create discord and discord.
Sometimes the idea that the two people consider is different - but they should not be dissatisfied.
On a particular level, a person has a different view of different opinions and does not have to cause discord.
The Holy Quran reads us: " You should not fight and do not let yourselves be discorded." [The Holy Quran, 8:46] If
In the past, our enemies have been the result of the discord between us and our enemies.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) teaches us, saying: "We are the truth, but they do not make a mistake, and they do not believe it."
The sincere efforts of the Islamic Republic are sincere, and they want the Islamic Republic to love and love the Islamic Republic and Allah the Exalted, but they do not make mistakes.
It is different from the kind of person who is familiar with the Islamic Republic and is opposed to the Islamic Republic.
Dear God, by relying on and expressing love and affection for each other. Unfortunately, the media and the media offer people a lot of information about each other.
The main reason is that we should all feel that we should be careful about the principles of Islam. We should respect the law.
Of course, this statements should not be made as a consequence of a number of people to judicise and accusations that the youth of our Revolution should not be viewed as a ceremony.
I would like to congratulate all the dear youth of the country, the faithful and sincere youth of the Revolution and the youth of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps. I would like to extend my support to all the dear youth, the youth of the Islamic Revolution.
Everybody should respect the law.
The Islamic Republic's Guards Corps is one of the goals of the Islamic Republic.
The same is true of the officials of Iran.
The government honors the chairmanship of the council and the chairmanship of the government and the leader of the country.
This does not mean that all of them should think and think that if they have
I hope the year 1391 will be one of the many years that has been imposed on the people of Iran, achievements, and joy of the Iranian nation.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and his household, bestow Your dear youth on the path.
Dear God, deploy the enemies of this nation.
Dear God, make us benefit from the prayers of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) and make us benefit from his prayers.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a thousand people in the city of Ridha.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings
Greetings be upon Siddi Sheol, Fatima Zahra (s.a.), and Allah's grace be upon her husband and children.
I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this great meeting.
I hope Allah the Exalted will prepare our hearts and our tongue to acquiring his approval.
This is a good example for me that each year on the occasion of Norouz, in such a happy and exciting day, I would like to spend time with the people on the issues of the country and the events that have taken place in the year and the events that will take place in the future.
Our dear brothers and sisters should know that the Iranian nation is not interested in the things that we do and that we are doing for them. Some of the people who are looking at our
There are certain nations that are benefiting from our experience. They look at the capacities of the Iranian nation.
If we manage to achieve victory, they feel that they are successful, they will be defeated and they will be shouting in pain.
The same is true of certain people in the world who are looking at our activities, but they are discorded at the beginning.
They hope the Iranian people will be disappointed in Iran.
They have always been the source of power for the country throughout the past few years. They have always been able to manage all the issues
The Revolution came and put an end to the hands of the Islamic Republic.
Therefore, they are opposed to the Revolution and the Revolution.
Therefore, we are looking at a large number of humanity.
Therefore, when we look at the things behind and in the future, our view of labor and management should be the main focus of our view of labor and management.
Some of our people were looking at the conditions of the country, not what they saw, but the weakness that was being carried out.
They do not see in less expensive products, domestic products and under the pressure of the enemies.
I have a different opinion.
When I look at the conditions of our country and see that the arena is challenging, the Iranian nation managed to succeed in this regard despite the enemies' responsibilities.
The problems that exist in the country are a source of security. They are among the people of the world who are active and active in the workplace of the Iranian nation.
The experienced woman who was in charge of the affairs of the Americans and whose network is broadcasting the issue of sanctions is saying that we want to fuel the sanctions of the Islamic Republic.
I would explain how they did and what they did in the future.
Therefore, on the other hand, there are one side of the plots of the enemies in the arena of the resistance of the Iranian nation towards the enemies, and there is a great achievements that have been made by the Iranian nation.
When a person looks at the scene, it is like a field of sports that is an effort, but it is a champion that will lead to success and other people's success.
The dear people of Iran are the people of Iran.
Anybody who looks at the front lines and whose research is well-established will be a blessing for the Iranian people, just as we
There are politicians, government officials and all those who know where the world is and who are active in the arena of the Iranian nation.
It is necessary to pay attention to all the efforts that have been made throughout the country and with the results of their efforts.
Who are these people?
Later, I will shed light on this issue.
The enemies who do not hope to see the Iranian nation achieve these progress in all areas, they have two main organizations: the first means that they can do all the things they can to see the Iranian nation do not achieve such progress.
They will do this by relying on sanctions, threats, government officials and other activities after the arena and by removing the thoughts and feelings of the Iranian nation from high-ranking and important achievements. They prevent the Iranian nation from developing a double life in order to increase the progress of the world.
The president of the United States, the president of the US, spoke about the economic problems that Iran has faced. The same is true of the success of the country.
He said that the value of the Iranian nation has made a lot of economic problems in this regard.
However, he did not speak of the good deeds that had been done in the country, as well as the achievements that the Iranian nation had made in the past 30 years. We were faced with similar challenges - which I would later
This year 1391, and it was one of the years when our enemies were bombarded with their policies.
They said that we wanted to divide the Iranian nation through sanctions.
This is because if the Islamic Republic stands on its foundations and makes progress, it will be lost.
Therefore, if they do not, they should not allow themselves to do so. If they do not, they are trying to spread the news with their propaganda.
Today these two activities are not like the hands of a child. They are trying to prevent the efforts, threats, sanctions, sanctions, sanctions, and other such things through their propaganda and propaganda tools.
We said that there are enemies.
Who are these enemies?
Where is the main pillar of the Iranian nation?
The answer to this question is not difficult.
Today the same is true of the year 30 years after the existence of the episodemies, the people of Iran are forced to re-establish the US government.
The American officials should know that over the past 30 years, the Iranian nation has seen a number of events which have been mentioned in the name of the Americans from the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
This is a very important point which every government wants to live on earth should pay attention to this issue and its point.
They are the centers of the plots of these enemies.
Of course, we do not see that they are the enemies of the Islamic Republic.
The Zionist regime is an enemy, but the Zionists do not stand up against the enemies of the Iranian nation.
Sometimes the Zionist regime threatens against us and threatens the threats of bullying us. But if they know, if they do not know, they will know that if they do not know, if they do not know, if they do not know, if they will come up against us and the Islamic Republic will be
The corrupt government of England was oppressed by the Iranian nation.
England is one of the most powerful enemies of the Iranian nation.
It is the government of England that does not have its own interests, and no one else else is the kind of hegemony.
There are other governments that show enmity.
I would like to tell that during the recent years of the government officials, the people of France used to show their enmity towards the Iranian nation.
A person is particularly cautious, especially in the political sense of what he knows should not turn back a person who is not being slapped as a champion.
We did not have a problem with the government and the country, the government and the country, throughout the past and during that time. However, this mistaken actors and the people of Iran awakened from the time of the Kingsley.
This is a mistake, and the lack of reasoning is futile.
When they speak, the Americans say that they have made a name for certain people that they are part of the world. They are the US, the Americans and their occupations of the Zionist regime, England and other other countries.
In the past, we should know that since the beginning of the year 1391, the Americans did not have a new role in the presence of Iran and the people of Iran and the people of Iran.
Since the beginning of the year 1391, they started to have a strong foundation on the Iranian nation. The sanctions, sanctions, sanctions, sanctions and restrictions among the Islamic Republic and the rest of the country have made many things in this regard.
They would not believe that they are enemies and that they are not enemies.
During the past few years in this meeting, Imam Ali (a.s.) said that you should not ignore the fact that you would like to do something that you would like to make innovative.
The American government raises certain people of particular individuals who will speak to the countries of the world and go to other countries to discuss with the heads of the deploys so that they can establish a relationship with economy of economic economic and
They should pay attention to each other's relationship with the Iranian nation and with the Islamic Republic.
They began this work since the beginning of 1391, particularly from Mordad, where they had been persecuted.
I would like to say that in the past few months, the Americans say that the Americans believe that the sanctions have influenced the sanctions. The sanctions of sanctions should not influence them if they want to be happy.
Our capacities have faced the problem of relying on oil.
We should divide our economy and rely on the economy. Our governments should make this in their hands.
For the past seven years, I told the government that they should do something whenever we would like to cover our bodies.
At that time, they laughed at the service of the people and said that this is a very popular thing.
Of course, it is necessary to do something and protect it.
Whenever a economy spends a special role in a country, the enemies will be careful about this.
The sanctions have influenced, but they are not influenced by the enemies.
I would like to discuss the issue of economy in political arenas during the past few years. The enemies did all they could to compensate for the Islamic Republic of Iran as they did.
The Islamic Republic should not allow the Islamic Republic to influence its political and regional policies in this region.
They disagree with what they want to do.
Our brothers and sisters were among the three parts of the world, and the leaders of the Islamic Republic attended Tehran's Guards Corps.
All of them are the people of Iran.
They said this to us, and they believed that it was after they returned home.
That is to say, the differences of the enemies of the Iranian nation hope.
They failed to do something.
In the arena of politics, the goal of sanctions is to put an end to the hearts of the Iranian nation on the path of the people and the Islamic Republic. They should discord the people and the Islamic Republic.
On the day of Bahman, the Iranian nation gave them across the slogans and showed their love for the Islamic system and the Revolution.
In the arena of security, they have been able to do all the things that they can throughout the country, which government officials have tried to clarify the contents of the media.
In the regional arenas of the region and they have tried to deploy the influence of the Islamic Republic.
In the regional arenas, they have proved that there is no problem in the region that it can be solved without the presence of Iran and approval of Iran.
The attack of the Zionist regime, the Zionist regime, like the Iranian nation after the arena of Iran, added: "The Zionist regime is against the Palestinian resistance."
They did not tell us that if the presence of the Islamic Republic and its power, the resistance of the Palestinians cannot stand up against the righteous nation, they did not speak the same thing about it.
This is because during the eight-year war of the Zionist regime, they managed to feminine the nation of Israel.
I said that the efforts they made were not to affect, but on the other hand, it was a source of great success for us.
That is to say, the sanctions of the Iranian nation and the capabilities that they have managed to do. If they do not, they do not happen.
Our youth have been defeated by the sanctions of sanctions, and we have not managed to defeat the country. In the arena of construction projects, which I will explain, in 1991 we have made progress comparable to the past years.
Many progresses have been made in the arena of production, innovative, innovative areas, innovative, innovative, innovative areas, innovative areas, innovative and innovative areas, in order to increase the production of power and management of our economy.
We made a great progress in the arena of knowledge in 1391.
In scientific and artistic arenas, the past year the great movement that will bring about the joy of those who believe in the future and the future of the Iranian nation.
That is to say, our dear youth and our dear youth and outstanding personalities in the year 1388 were sent to the expansion of the country through the hands of the Peshefall, and
When the creation of the living creature was transferred to a heavenly sense of vigilance, he returned to his soul and in health, First and influential scholars in the world denied this because they were awe-inspiring for them.
But after the truth, they saw that they did not have anything to do.
In health and medical matters, there is also great work that is associated with the health of the people.
In the art of nature, we managed to plant in the region.
There are great achievements, innovations and innovations.
All these things have been done during the year 1388 and the people of Iran are condemned to a good and successful life.
In the year, we were in the early stages of knowledge.
In the arena of knowledge and skill, the country has made more than 30 percent comparable to the past.
In the year 1391, the prostitute was held at the beginning of the Revolution.
That is to say, the number of our students - who were active in the arena of higher education during the last year.
This is a great blessing for the Iranian nation.
In the arena of water, innovations, innovations, innovative products, innovative and innovative products, innovative and innovative areas, the country has made great achievements.
All these things have been achieved during the year when the enemies of the Iranian nation have made what they can do to you.
There are valuable lessons in the events that happened in the year 1391 and that this lesson is that any nation that is alive will not be threatened with the pressures of the enemies.
It tells us what is important to a nation, reliance on Allah the Exalted, reliance on the enemies and not on the enemies.
That is to say, the future will be bright.
In the year 1391 it was another facet of trials and occasions.
Of course we understand the weakness we have. This is the characteristic of the
During the Sacred Defense Era, the Army clarified their capacities and the weakness they had in order to cure it.
We understand our weakness.
This weakness originated from the dependence of our self-confidence - which I said that this is one of the weakness we have - political, economic, and social activities that are being committed to everyday life.
The officials of the government - who are present in the arena of power and the government officials who will come after the elections of the country - should pay attention to this issue.
One important point that we have made is that the foundation of the country is a strong foundation.
When the foundation is firm, the plots of the enemies will not prevail.
If the officials of the great country and such a strong foundation are aware of their responsibility, they will be able to offer any threats to a foreign country. As in the year 1391, we have turned
By Allah's favor, the decisions of the officials of the country and the people in the year 1391 will be seen in the future.
Of course the economy is an important point which has been made in the past, but the economy is not a very important point. The security of the country is important, the progress of the people.
Therefore, if knowledge prevails in the country, all the things that they will later do will.
The importance and dignity of the country are important and the lack of intelligence and intelligence.
In all these areas, we have made progress.
It is internal or infidelity, in the best and influential and influential and innovative organizational problems that exist in the country.
By such progress, our nation proves that the lack of the authority of the Americans does not mean turning back. This is a very important point.
Dear God, the world and the domination of the colonialists - today the US wants to show the people of the world that if you want a good and successful life, you should be under the influence of our power.
The Iranian nation proved that this was a lie.
Our people showed that the lack of self-confidence of America and other major countries is not enough to make progress.
There are similarities in the countries that have made themselves available to America.
We have a similar experience. Let us see how the Islamic Republic has been in the past 30 years and what the Islamic Republic has achieved and what these countries are.
Anybody who ignores this issue will realize that the lack of self-confidence of the major world is a source of threat to a nation.
Thankfully the Iranian nation has been blessed with its power and good sense of power and
Later, we managed to do so at a certain point.
This is the issue of the issue of the economy of twenty nuclear negotiations in Tehran.
The taking of oil requires twenty-one during the time of the year 1388.
They should establish the foundation of this need for the country and they should try to force the Islamic Republic's interests and their needs.
But even before the situation becomes a problem for us, our youth and outstanding personalities managed to bring about 20 percent of the fitna of the fitna of the country.
Our opposers do not expect to do so.
The officials of our government managed to understand this need, and they managed to strengthen this progress of the Iranian nation and we managed to
When they think that the Islamic Republic will come to them, they will give rise to twenty percent, and the Islamic Republic tells us that we have made the money to do so.
If the experts and our youth do not do this work, they will be free to spend the costs and spend the cost of expensive expenses on the people who are opposed to us and introduce them to the needs of health and medical care.
The students of the country realized this, and they realized that they did what to do.
Therefore, we should succeed. This is the government government government in all matters related to the country. The government officials, intellectuals, farmers, businessmen, businessmen and management, industry, industry and innovative officials should be vigilant.
The plans that they should write, they should be in this regard. If they do research on
If they carry out scientific and scientific activities, all of them should be the same.
The responsibility of all of us is to try to build the country in a way that the enemy cannot be controlled and influenced.
This is one of the economy of resistance that we have made.
In the face of resistance, one of the most important social groups is the source of economic threats.
The economy should be a threat. It is necessary to achieve all kinds of threats from the enemies.
This is the first point that I should tell you.
The second point: The Americans send us to different kinds of slogans. They send us to discuss the issue of nuclear network. They send us to discuss the issue of nuclear negotiations, and they
In certain cases, they tell us that you should join the issue of nuclear negotiations, the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps and the United States to sit at the nuclear negotiations of nuclear negotiations.
Why?
The fact that our experience shows that the issue of the US is not just the best way to identify the right path and the right path. This does not mean something.
What they mean is to sit down and discuss what we say.
Therefore, we have always announced that this is not a matter. This is necessary, and the Iranian nation will not achieve victory.
I do not have any hopes about these things.
Well , there are other matters to be free:
The first point is that the Americans are repeatedly sending this message to us, sometimes in the writings, and they say that we do not have the goal of the Islamic Republic.
The answer is that we do not care about the goal of the Islamic Republic or the goal of the Islamic system.
At that time, you would like to congratulate the Islamic Republic and you would tell you that you are not doing anything else in the future.
The second point is that the Americans are sending this message to us in the matter.
That is to say, we would like to talk to you and discuss the appropriate points.
I would tell them: " We used to tell you that we did not mean guiding the front lines of the country, but you said that you did not believe.
What about you?
If you are not prepared to accept a clear and accurate statement, which is not the reason why we should agree with what you have said during times that you have proven their discord?
Knowing us in this advice, the Americans are introducing the issue of deception and attracting the minds of the people of the world and the people of our country.
You should prove that this is not the case.
Can you prove yourselves righteous?
In this meeting, I would like to tell that one of their talents is that they sometimes believe that certain people have been present on the scene.
This is a kind of propaganda, and it is futile.
This is one of the things that he has discussed with them.
The third point is that what we know, the capacities and capacities we have made are the fact that America does not want to end the nuclear negotiation.
The Americans do not want to be free of the nuclear negotiations and if they want to judiciate the end and the solution, the path of the
The main goal of the nuclear negotiations is to accept the responsibility of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, which is
The fact that the Iranian nation is active in the country is responsible for the sake of peace and self-sufficiency in the country.
This is a great hope. We do not want it.
They say that we are anxious that you will be like a nuclear attack.
They are the people of certain countries which I mentioned in the Name of the country. They call themselves on the name of the world.
They say that the world is in need.
No, the countries of the world are inexhaust.
For most of the countries of the world, they support the Islamic Republic and the needs of our country because the Iranian nation is in need of truth.
They accept the responsibility of the Iranian nation to dissuade the culture of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) in order
Whenever we are close to the solution, the Americans will make a firm stand against this path.
They want to do what they want to do. They
As they said, they will not be able to confuse the Iranian nation. They will not be able to confuse the Iranian nation.
I would like to extend my condolences to them.
This is the path: the Americans will definitely jump to the end of their enmity towards the Islamic Republic and the
If they want to end the problems that exist in our country - just as they say, they want to create problems between Iran and America - and they bring the end to their enmity towards us.
Thirty years ago, the Iranian nation managed to deploy the Iranian nation.
Since the beginning of the Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, they have been vigilant.
In the arena of security, they have managed to deploy our security. They have managed to corrupt our country. They have supported the masses of our heads for many years. They have managed to deploy our economy
Therefore, I would like to address the officials of the United States. If they are looking for the right path, they will improve their political positions, they will correct their efforts and end up the fitna of the Iranian nation.
There is a different kind of organization which is to be mentioned in the light of the importance of elections.
Among our country is a symbol of politicians.
The identity of the Islamic Republic is a symbol of political determination. A symbol of the resistance of the Islamic Republic is the symbol of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps. The Islamic Republic is among the people of Iran's government officials.
Physical democracy is a symbol of Islamic democracy.
Therefore, paying attention to the importance of elections is to place the enemies of the Iranian nation on a daily basis in elections.
They have planned to prevent the people from going to elections, killing them and fighting.
Our efforts have been made by elections throughout the years - the elections of the Majlis and the president of the country - have always been trying to see the elections. This is because of the importance of elections in the country.
I would like to discuss things in the base of elections, but there are two months
Now I would like to discuss things with others.
First of all, the issue of elections is that the Revolution is a very important issue.
The presence of the people during the time of elections can reduce the influence of the enemies. It can cause the enemies to stand up and fight the security of the country.
Our nation should know that there will be a great difference in the elections of the country throughout the country.
This is the first point. By Allah's grace and efforts, the Iranian nation will be a great blessing.
The second point is that all those who believe in the Islamic Republic should join the elections.
This is the responsibility of everybody, and this is a responsibility.
They do not belong to one or a political denomination.
All those who believe in the Islamic Republic and those who are part of the country should pay attention to the significance of the destiny of this country and the national progress of the country.
The Islamic Republic's Guards Corps should be appropriate in this regard.
The third point is that the views of the people are the result of the elections.
Dear God, make decisions with those whom you believe, making the right opportunity to identify the right person who is superior to you.
I do not have a single hour.
I would like to congratulate my dear people, and I would like to congratulate it.
It is the kind of person who is looking after the secretary of the elections and when they call on me and understand who I am not unsteady.
If anyone says this, it is not true.
Of course, in these moments and in this academic news, the message of enlightening and societies - is accompanied by the message of specified and consumptionality.
It is the one who has sent thousands of panegyrists.
I was reported that they were during the elections, the people
Therefore, do not pay attention to these things that are sent out.
Of course, nobody or political democracy can try to attract the minds of other people to it - not against it - but against this, nobody will hear anything from me.
People can make decisions and help each other to identify the best possible person.
Of course the principle is the view of the people.
The continuation is that the issues related to elections and those who are not elections should all submit to law.
The event that happened in the year 1388, after the elections of the president of the country - which has been imposed on the country - has resulted from a lack of respect for the law of others.
It is the idea that people are familiar with what I want, but I should respect them.
It is necessary to respect the superiority of the society.
It is necessary to use these legal methods.
We should call people to the streets for what happened to us and what happened to us in the year 138, and this is one of the shortcomings that cannot be lost.
This is a lesson for the Iranian nation, and the people of Iran will stand up to confront the issue.
The final point is that everybody should know that what we need in the country is the good and the good things that they have done without what is being done.
Everybody should know that the present-day leader should be good and good.
Everybody is in his power and in the arena of weakness.
The heads of the country - whether now or the future - have a lot of power and weakness.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should be aware of what is being done today as part of the government and the president of the country.
That is to say, those who are present on the move should be the path of progress and the conclusion of one another.
Those who are prepared to enter the arena, must enter all their power, reliance on God, and reliance on the capacities that the Iranian nation has.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on this nation.
Dear God, make the immaculate soul of the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
Dear God, make the immaculate soul of the Imam of the Age (a.s.) and the souls of our martyrs.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on you and your
Leader’s Speech to Exemplary Economy - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 17, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
First of all, I would like to extend my service to the dear brothers and sisters in different areas of economic valor.
In the modern-day meeting, the symbol of the importance of the economy of the economy of the economy of the world, the region and the country.
We want to pay attention to the issue of economy and services on the economy of the government, in economic economic and social areas and in different areas. We should pay attention to these things and make efforts in the country and in order to ensure that the measures should be made on the economy of the economy and the economy of
This is the first point.
The government officials are the economy of economy and the economy of all the areas of the country.
The second point, which has been arranged for this meeting and thankfully is that the issue is not enough to those who are not government officials to present a report on the realities of the country and make progress in the country.
I am not saying that everybody knows what I am doing is not enough to do. I believe that the achievements that have been made and that the people should pay attention to it.
I would like to tell you that I am in contact with the people. The people do not have the kind of progress that has been made.
These are the things that I have written in different parts of the world and they will be prepared to report on this issue in the past.
In the country, this is a source of pride for the Iranian nation.
The Iranian nation is moving forward in this regard.
We made good progress in the area of production, in the field of service, in scientific and other areas.
It is a good thing to hear this from government officials who are not government officials and those who are not government officials.
We should all appreciate that today the path of the enemies is to kill the people of Iran.
Nothing should be said of killing the wishes and enthusiasm.
It is necessary to feel that we have an important role model.
The first point is that we have placed the year 1390 in the year 1390.
The arrogant powers are the harm of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic in economic arenas.
Of course the issue of nuclear sanctions is not a source of nuclear sanctions, but the issue of nuclear sanctions is not
You can recall that when they were at the beginning of sanctions, the sanctions of sanctions that they placed in the country - even when there is no nuclear issue in the country.
Although they are not important sanctions, they are not even more important than ever before - the name of sanctions and sanctions - which is the name of the US, is the time of the nuclear sanctions
The objective of sanctions is the issue of economy.
Of course, it is proud that the Iranian nation had been coping with the sanctions over the past 30 years.
Of course the sanctions have been undermined in the past, but they have been defeated in different kinds of developments in the country. They have proven that they are not at the beginning of the sanctions, they have
Therefore, it is necessary to be prepared. It is necessary to identify the enemies of the Islamic Republic, the people should know what they are using and they are using their methods.
Of course, this requires jihad of economy.
It is not everyone who calls jihad.
It is a movement that is used by some people.
The pressures of such a sincere and sincere effort are one of the main pillars of Mahdaviat.
Such a movement is his name.
Therefore, the economy of economy means the movement which has been imposed on the Iranian nation and the purpose of destroying the fire of the enemies.
Another point is that in order to advance the country, we manage to move ahead - which is a very important and important organization - prepared the country for the future in important areas of life and management - we should achieve this position.
And other nations will not sit down and look at us for the beginning. They are carrying out their movement.
Of course we are not using certain methods, and we will not use them. We are following the right path.
Therefore, this is the issue of Mahdaviat.
This efforts should be made and it is necessary to think that we can reach the first position.
This issue is not to the first point that we are not faced with the first position. No, the future of the nations are relying on this issue.
If a country that is in economic arenas, scientific progress cannot be satisfied with what the need is and what it is necessary, it will continue to feel pity.
We do not want to be oppressed.
Two years ago, we were faced with violence.
The role of the chairman of the ideals and the plots of the enemies is the main reason for this oppression.
Since the late 1800 " s, England had been in charge in the political systems of the country and their statements, and they have been closer to other countries since the beginning of the year.
The late 1800 " s was the first visit to the country - which came from India - from the same time that the Indian government was in charge of Britain and the center of the government - from the same city of Brohrach and started to give a bribe to a number of people.
All those sons of the king and kings who have quickly come to this man in Lair and whose enemies have awakened from the country. They have allowed the enemies of the people to turn their back on this path. They have allowed the enemies to attack the enemy in the country.
We do not want this to continue.
The Islamic Revolution created a large wall in front of them.
We want this wall to increase its power.
We should not allow them to be in every way, in economic matters, in our culture, in political, and in our country.
One of the sources of domestic power is economy.
This is why we say that we should be vigilant.
He did not say that Iran should be the first one in this region. No, for the future of this nation's blessings.
Therefore, we should make efforts and efforts in the arena of the heart, influential, and influential areas, which should be utilized in this country.
We heard this and saw the progress of the country during the Revolution.
What happened in the arena of the country, before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, nobody would agree that this will happen.
The same is true of the developments in different areas. The same is true of the events that are happening in the country as well as the events that have been imposed on the country, at times when there is no doubt that they will happen, but today we see that they are in front of us.
I say that this is the result of the training I have received from different parts of the country and that there is no part in our country and our youth who are not able to compensate for them on the scene.
This is an important point.
Our economic capacities are important.
Sometimes I said that the blessing of the country is comparable to the level of our society and the people of the world.
The people of the country are a source of material and material benefits for the people of the world, just as the Armenian of the country is a source of blessings for the people of the world.
These are important and valuable things.
The same is true of the modern-day development of the country. The same is true of us - we are opposed to the storm of water - but they can solve the problem in order to improve the quality of the educational system, which some of the brothers and sisters mentioned in the recent years. The same is true of the
Therefore, in the real sense of the country, the country has a lot of
The same is true of our region.
We are a very important place.
The two-hore and the weather and the weather and regional relations between the west and Asia and Europe are among the most important aspects of this region.
All these things are good for us.
Today, as mentioned in this meeting, we have been defeated in the past 20 years.
That is to say, an organization that has been prepared for five years is not the beginning of plans.
Of course many things have been done in the plans of the past.
As the report that they presented and listened to, the same is true and important. But the
Progressive policies have been announced in the arena of orderly and innovative activities, political and political arenas that have been announced in order to manage in order to manage one another.
If we manage such things as the organization, we can benefit from the blessings and blessings of those who are referred to.
Political policies can create a ethical and economy.
Of course, some of the things that have been planned for many years have not been thwarted.
Economy such things as 8 percent, or less empathetic production and the cost of expensive products - which I mentioned in this meeting - all these things were not done.
That is to say, we should pay attention to the needs of the past five years.
On the basis of this law, we should study in the arena of government and economic activities.
Fortunately, the purpose of creating a economy which is filled with the marketplaces and technical in economic arenas.
They calculated that the capability of the five, each year is more than 160 billion
It is necessary to achieve this.
The framework of the law has not been good, but they are not valuable. The issue is not just the organization of economy. We democracy is that we democracy, and that there is a duty to do what is necessary in order to do and what is necessary to do in order to do what is necessary and what is necessary to do in order to do
There are always good deeds and bad things.
For many years, I spoke about the issue of fighting the economy of economic resistance.
When I introduce this issue, some people have come to me and say that they are constantly doing the issue of economy on the issue of economy and economy.
I would like to say that they will be discorded.
Anybody who wants to get well-established and who wants to provide for those who are law-appearance should not be ignored.
We are opposed to the officials of the government, and the people who have managed to do whatever they have. We should strengthen the efforts of the country, the skills that are supported by the people, the organizations, and the material resources that are working on this path, and they should try to eulogize the issue of economy
Fortunately, this is the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy.
They heard what they said and heard - the kind of people who spoke about the good news and who spoke about it and the decisions they spoke about. I would like to address them. I would like to address
We should not allow the things that have been said to be safeguarded here.
Of course, Hazrat says that he does not say what is wrong in the wrong way. Why should we not speak to us when the decisions are made, the decisions should not be made. This does not mean that
If the advice of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is clear, it is helpful to consider the practical points that have been presented in this regard. There are many things that I would like to discuss with these two issues. I would like to discuss
First of all, the issue of employment is the issue of employment and production. The issue of economy is the issue of economy.
The issue of executive organizations and government officials should pay attention to the needs of the daily needs and innovations, which are supported in the arena of domestic production. It is necessary to pay attention to the
Of course, some of the government officials who spoke with them did not need 30 percent.
The same is true of other areas, but the issue of domestic production requires support of government organizations and organizations.
We should benefit from this.
Unfortunately, the same is true of the marketplaces in this regard. They have a responsibility in this regard. They use
One of the government officials said that some of the government officials did not do something that they used to used to used to used innovations. They used
It is necessary to pay attention to this issue.
Of course the issue of government is a very important point.
Of course, we should pay attention to the individuals whom I have mentioned - that is to say, they are not present on the basis of what they are doing.
It is necessary to face this issue with all its power so that the sincere and sincere people will manage to do their work.
The following is the issue of entering production. That is to say, and I have repeatedly spoken with many of our officials on this issue.
Nobody is opposed to material things, but the situation should be prepared.
It is noteworthy that we should not allow ourselves to be an example of the day near the festival to Eid al-Adha as an objection to the marketplaces, and it is a great reason to
It is necessary to pay attention to domestic products.
Of course, if there is not a product of domestic products, the product of domestic products will not be applied to the beauty of domestic products and the product of domestic products.
I think that this is not a source of power.
The issue of entering production is particularly acquisition of material products, and the issue of transporting products is a need for more than what is expected to be done today.
In the fields we have goods.
One of the teachers introduced a report on the benefits of the gardeners.
Our presence in this region is one of the world's countries.
We should increase our production.
I would like to congratulate the materials of the fields and garden so that the world may be able to enter the arena in Iran. We do not want to start such materials from Latin America and other items as an ordinary product that we do not have in this regard.
The following is the issue of production.
Of course, the government is responsible to help those who carry it out.
Fortunately, as the brothers and sisters mentioned in this meeting, we have seen that the products of the oil that are not transformed into a prostitute and the future will be increased. We hope that we will continue to make progress in the way that the principles of our country will benefit our country.
We should move towards the goal of reaching the peaks.
One of the major phenomenons that are faced with the economy of our economy and the economy is the self-confidence of the economy
In the past, I said - although at that time the government officials did not respond - we should reach our position if we were to a particular day because of the political issues and economic issues of the world, decide to sell our oil as an example of five days or a month.
Look at the scene.
Today we do not do this, and we need these pillars.
During the economy of the country, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will have a powerful influence on the world.
We should pay attention to this point. This is what we need and support. It is necessary to pay attention to it.
The same is true of all the countries that we have to do in this regard. They have a responsibility in this regard. They have a responsibility towards all the countries that we have to do in order to counter these countries.
In the world, over the past and 50 years they have been producing goods and selling them to those who have monothetics as well as
As an example, a German company or Swiss estimates 50 years ago by quanting and selling products and selling valuable products in our country and they have valuable products in our country and in our country.
Why?
It is necessary to pay attention to these things.
This shows the need of a culture, culture, production and management for domestic products.
The issue of confronting the issue of economic activities is very important.
If they do not manage to corrupt a person in a government that will help him, they will not manage to achieve economic independence.
Therefore, government officials have a duty to prevent economic disruption in the organizations of the government.
As an example, when you realize that a chemy in the fields, there is no kind of mercy and sympathetic treatment that will be shown by you. You know that if you do not know that if you do not do this, you will fail to do more than you can, they do what is happening to thousands of people, they will because they do not benefit from this.
This is the case with economy.
If you are inside the organizations of the government, listen to or see a sign of economic valor - I speak to the officials of the government - you should not give the right thing to do.
It is necessary to pay attention to economy and economy. It is necessary to pay attention to these dangers.
One of the things that should be done is to prepare the ground for the intensified quantities of the country. One of the 44-year denominations mentioned in this issue is one of the things necessary to do this.
We need politicians in the arena of resistance.
As one of the brothers and sisters mentioned in this meeting, there are other forms of denominations that give to you and others. This is the best way to do so.
The main point is that we should pay attention to the issue of spectatorship of domestic products.
That is to say, the entertainment industry should not be an advantage.
Those who have experiences will do what is wrong.
The information should be for everybody.
Of course, in the past, the government was presented in different countries, and they did not benefit from this.
It is necessary to increase our enthusiasm in this regard.
There were certain things I wrote, but I would like to deliver them.
I hope Allah's blessings will increase the determination of those who love the country, the Islamic Republic and the future of this nation. I hope Allah's blessings will increase their determination, insight and understanding.
This is the case with the issue of economy and intensified labor in the past, and it is necessary to see the issue of economy.
I hope all will increase.
The movement of the country is a very valuable and powerful organization that the country enjoys is a great achievement.
Thankfully, there are good hearts and faith and power in the country.
This country has many opportunities to call this honorable country in the world.
Our history, our inheritance of culture, the capacities and capacities of the people and the country are all the things that they mention for us.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a thousand people in the city of Ridha.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure household and chosen household, especially the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.)
I would like to thank Allah the Exalted who gave me a long life and understanding of the role of this blessed region. I would like to congratulate the Imam of the Age (may our magnanimous Imam Ali (r.a.
I would like to congratulate the congratulation of Eid al-Kubra's (s.a.) and the dear brothers and sisters who were gathered together in this meeting, and this is a very great economy. I would like to congratulate all the brothers and sisters who
This is an example of the people of Iran on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, and we dear people from different parts of the Armed Forces during the Sacred Defense Era,
There are also brothers and sisters in the area of Mashhad.
I would like to extend my congratulations to each and everybody.
Nurouz of the Islamic Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran's people and other Muslim nations who are present on the occasion of honor and respect for the Islamic Republic.
The Islamic Republic means that we should benefit from all the opportunities that have been made, innovations, and innovations, in order to make progress in the world, in order to make progress, in the world, infrastructures and innovative. We can benefit from the work that Islam has commanded us to do.
Let us inform ourselves of the lofty goals of Islam.
During these days, it is an opportunity to be disfellowshipped, return to Allah the Exalted to listen to the good words of the people and assemble in religious places.
This is the case in particular during the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the people of Iran used the Eid of Norouz to draw closer to Allah the Exalted.
The main reason is that if you look at the beginning of the new year, you will see that the majority of the people are gathered together in the company of worship, the kind of visiting and praying and praying for the sake of God.
This means that the Iranian nation should benefit from this sign and religious celebrations.
We do well to imitate this example in all areas, and we should use Norouz to increase our knowledge and spiritual values.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of us throughout the Iranian nation.
Today when Allah the Exalted has created it, I will speak about three issues.
The first point is related to the events that have been done in the year 1389, during the year 1389 and in the year 1389, the Iranian nation and government managed to do two things in the year 1388 and the year of Eid al-Kubra's (s.a.).
The third point is related to the events happening in the region. The events that are happening in North Africa and the events happening in the region and the events happening in the region of Islam, the efforts of the enemies of the world of Islam to do what is really happening.
I would like to say that the name that has been given to the year 1389 - namely, the year 1389 - that is to say, "The Year of Effort and Labor" - has been observed during the year, and the people in different parts of the world showed the zeal of the year.
Of course the efforts of the great and great eulogy will be achieved in the future, but the first view of the year 1389 and the work of the officials of the country and the people with the help of their officials can be manifested in the arena and intensified labor.
This is the case in many areas.
Let us start from a knowledge of knowledge and art.
By the beginning of the year 1389 - on the occasion of Eid al-Godication - I was able to make a visit to the country and the end of Esfan and the end of the year 1388 in order to re-appearance in the educational system and industriment for the country.
The progress that has been made in the arena of knowledge and art today is not far more than what is being announced in the country. I can tell you how to do this.
Since the beginning of the great movement in different arenas, which is a source of happiness, has been made on a daily basis.
I would like to extend my congratulations to the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) household and added: "Islam is the power and knowledge of the country and knowledge of human power."
Well, knowledge and art are like this.
Today the movement of the country in the arena of scientific and artistic areas is particularly innovative areas.
In various areas, in the arena of knowledge, in the arena of the universe, in the art of Nanomen, in the arena of nature, in the arena of production and management, in the arena of production and management, in the fields of management, in the fields of management, in the fields of management and management that provides for the country.
As I said in Nurrouz on the night of the organizations of the world, different organizations show that the path of the country is superior to the countries of the world and the progress that has been made in the country is moving towards global progress.
There are two crucial issues that are presented on this issue of scientific progress, scientific and scientific advances.
The first point is that the majority of the people who are active in this arena are young.
For the past 30 years, many of them - who are young and old - have to rely on these youth. Tabbas, outstanding youth who are active in this arena and who are active in this arena.
The next point is that those who are active in the arena of spirituality are the people who are relying on themselves.
The main passage is the power of the people.
Our youth are doing this in the best possible way and they believe that all these
The issue of scientific progress is that the production of knowledge, art, and production of knowledge - which is very important and important - is the quality of progress that is made today.
That is to say, production and management are promoted in order to achieve knowledge, innovation, innovative and innovations and innovative organizations.
The path of production is to capability and wealth.
Our dear people should know that the issue of economy is a economy that the issue of economy is economyed by the people of economy and the economy of the government.
This is an integral part of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Thankfully, this work has been started.
The fact that the government and people in this work are definitely involved is a very good achievement.
The presence of the people in the arena of the movement is in fact a positive movement. The movement will gradually be manifested even though its influence is still well-known.
The important goal of this work is to separate the people from the government in a fair way.
This is a great step that is accompanied by establishing justice.
Another goal is to promote national blessings.
Two years ago, we named the year "The Year of Economic Jihad and Effort.
This is one of the ways to improve the quality of our national blessings and to improve the quality of the Islamic Republic.
A few months after the arrival of the government, the organizations and the organizations and the organizations of the country - which have been imposed on the country - will benefit the country.
The use of bullying and dynamism - which is a great blessing for the sake of God - has been imposed on it and it has been
This is one of the things that have been gained by Allah's grace and blessings in the future. The same is true of the economy of economy.
The same is true of the work that shows the zeal of the economy of the economy of the economy.
Unfortunately, over the past, our country has been relying on oil.
This is the case with the economy of economy. The path of the economy is common in our country. The path is used to be carried out and it is a wrong path.
For a few years, I said that my hope is to raise a country without selling oil if we did not need to change it.
Of course, it is not the kind of work that is intensified of suffering.
The kind of products that are not empathetic and eulogize us with the goal we have.
There were great achievements in the year 1389 in this regard.
The same is true of the issue of scientific and economic activities that the government officials in the arena of economic arenas, the sanctions of sanctions, the west, the U.S. Commander of the US and the obedience of other government officials.
Since the beginning of the year 1389, the sanctions have increased on the sanctions
They have calculated themselves during their calculations - which tells us that the sanctions of the five months will pass over over the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
They remember that by means of their sanctions, they will make sure that they are suffering from the Iranian nation and those who are in the arena of vigilance to the Islamic Republic.
One of the things that is done is in order to deploy this sanction by the enemies of the Islamic Republic.
The enemies failed to achieve their goal through these sanctions.
Today, the people of western countries said that the sanctions are not good.
One of the things that we have been doing is to say a lot of time, but we have been outside the country.
Therefore, they say that this is the violation of the Islamic Republic, we will not let the people enter the world.
As a result of the sanctions of our officials, they entered into the thoughts, and they made efforts, and we did not need to enter the arena with oil.
That is to say, I have heard from the youth who were visiting the country throughout the year of Efand.
They told me that we wanted to do something that they wanted to do. They said that we were not under the sanctions.
We returned home and thought, "In the people, make efforts, and we worked hard on this project without relying on foreigners.
The report says that during the year 1389, there have been a million and six thousand laborers. If the report is on this issue, the average of five thousand dollars (U.S.).
In the arena of domestic production, innovations, innovative cities and innovative areas, innovative and innovative areas, innovative and innovative areas - these are all the things which are based on spirituality.
This is at the economy.
In other areas, the amount of work is to be done away with.
In the year 1389, I would like to congratulate this year, thankfully the year which has been imposed on the word, the year 1389.
Of course the year 1389 did not have an advantage, and this year was a year, and the year 1388 and their laborers were in charge.
The Iranian nation and all government officials should make efforts in the arena of zeal and intensified labor so that they
However, in this regard, the issue of economy is more important than anything else.
If our dear country achieves the victory of the economy in economic arenas, this great movement will undoubtedly influence the country and the progress of the Iranian nation.
The important thing in this arena is the progress of the country on the path that has been prepared for five years.
The great issue will affect our capabilities and capacities in the country.
During the past two years, I talked to the issue of panegyrists and the issues that were being used in the country.
It is necessary to identify these things.
I advise the officials of the country to inform the people of the economy of economy. They should explain how important the
This is not something we want. Islam does not approve of.
They should make efforts and efforts to advance the country throughout the past five years.
The amount of employment and exemption from the country is one of the important and important issues of the country.
The same is true of the important and important elements of the marketplace and the assistance of the marketplaces in order to create opportunities for economic valor. They are among the important and important issues of the country.
It is necessary to establish a foundation of laws.
This means supporting progress.
The same is true of the blessings of the country, in which there is an appropriate and appropriate use of water in the country. Today our country is used in the country.
Look at what will happen if the government will have an opportunity to repair the path of water if it is reduced to 10 percent of the fitna of this fitna.
Basically, the fields in all parts of the country - domestic products and other areas where the need is greater - ten percent of the water that is being used only in these areas.
In fact, the benefits of watering from outside the country will be doubled twice.
The existence of the people in the arena of economic valor is
If we want to take advantage of this great movement in the year 1390, there are certain things that must be done in this regard.
I will introduce the list of these requirements.
First of all, the spirit of jihad is necessary.
Since the beginning of the Revolution up until today, wherever she enters the arena with the spirit of jihad, we see that in the arena of progress, we have seen this in the arena of power and in scientific arenas.
If we have a basiji spirit, if we have a basiji spirit in different areas, that is to say, if we act in behalf of God and performance in the hands of a child - not just as a duty - should not just be carried out.
Second, it is the source of spirituality and religious faith in society.
Everybody should know this. Armenian and youth should all be aware of this.
It is not to assume that the influence of the pious, the influence of the pious, the influence of the youth is the only one that will appear at the time of hajj or in Dua-Roshan.
If the youth of a nation become religious, they will be ignorant of fornication. They will be humiliated. They will
The same is true of economic arenas.
The religious network of religious faith is a great dance.
The following is the issue of lack of concern for the people in the arena of the arena of the arena of action. See that there is a lot of occasions in which everybody should be careful and important.
This will be like a captured captured country that is moving towards a particular country, and it is not enough to make it appear in the midst of the country.
Therefore, it should not be carried out after the arena in the arena.
The other point is to preserve unity and understanding.
The fact that the people are active among the people and government officials are interested in the government, they support them and cooperate with them, and they are familiar with each other among them, but they need to increase the presence of the people in this situation.
One of the plots of the enemies of the Iranian nation is to create discord and discord among the people of Iran. They exploit the issues of the sector, political, and other matters.
Fortunately, our people are awakening.
All those who love the country are interested in religious democracy, which is a source of pride for the Iranian nation - should prove to be among them.
The government officials should try to see that there is a lot of differences between them and if there is a disagreement between them and the organization and the parades of the Islamic Republic. They
I would like to pay attention to the officials of the government.
The most important point of the world's compensation through the discussion, these issues are not important.
Of course, I would like to congratulate this point. The same is true of our year, and I would like to witness the pillars of the Islamic Revolution in Tehran and other cities.
This is futile.
What are they doing in this regard?
I would like to see in the people and government officials who listen to this issue and make efforts so that they will
There is no need to do a lot of work that will be put to death
Of course, the issue of economic valor does not mean that there are other areas.
In other areas, especially in scientific and artistic areas, it is necessary to help those youth, to make great achievements.
Of course, the events that happen in the region - in the past - the events of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Bahrain - are very important.
This is the manifestation of Islamic Awakening.
This is the case in the Islamic Republic, the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown itself in the face of many years. There are two characteristics of the people. The first point is the issue of the presence of the people and the other side of the world.
These are the things that I used to do.
The presence of the people in the arena of this situation during the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Those who live on my desk and those who are working on my table and in the immaculate homes and those who are active in the arena.
Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) managed to join the people in the arena.
Today the same thing is happening in countries.
In Egypt or Tunisia, people entered the arena with themselves. If they did not even speak in prominent figures and in large homes, they used to address them. They used to address the people, they used to be extremely concerned about these things.
They are the people who have joined the arena in the arena and in their religious goals.
That is to say, the people who are active in the arena of jurisporation are the name of Allah, religious scholars, and intellectuals of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps. They enter the arena and enter the arena in the arena.
This is the characteristic of this issue.
Why do they come from?
In Egypt, in the country of Tunisia, those kings and oppressed rulers have poured their lives to the people.
As an example, the people of Egypt thought that their leader would pay attention to the demands of the land of Israel.
If Husbands of the people of Gaza were not involved in an excuse, the Zionist regime would not have acted against the people of Gaza and the people of Gazan.
On the other hand, Hosspital Median came into the arena and helped cover the path of entering the arena and out of Egypt
When the people of Gaza went through the country and entered the arena with the needs of the country, they refused to do what they wanted, and the
This is the case of Hosssse.
The same is true of other countries.
As an example in Libya, despite the fact that during the early years of his reign, Gafi showed indifference and policies of the west, but in recent years he has adopted a great service for the west.
If they saw that the terrorists were threatened, they managed to collect all the nuclear achievements that he had made them in the train, he asked the people to go with them.
Look at the position that our nation has, they should be viewed as members of the Islamic Ummah.
The officials of our country do not just give up on what the enemies want each year, but they do not want to do what they want to do.
The kind of progress that is prevalent in all the countries that people have made.
This is what is necessary for us.
After these events, they did not know the issue. They did not know the people, but they did not know what they did.
Of course the current events that have been seen from the United States in different countries are the support of the leaders of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) high up to the end of the country, but when they see that they are not able to do so, they have
This is a lesson for the leaders who trust in the United States to realize that they have not been able to do what they have to do and that they are not benefiting from it.
The experience of the west and the Americans is one of the things that they will not accept.
Egypt is one of the main pillars of the US, and they trusted in this policy.
But they failed to preserve this foundation so that they could continue its progress.
If human beings are awakened, they will be able to rid themselves of this machinations and destroy it.
The United States made efforts to see that they had lost mistakes in Egypt or Ben Ali, and they were trying to defend the government.
By Allah's favor, America will be defeated in this region.
After they lost the people in these countries, they placed two things that they wanted to do in front of them. The first is to wait, and the second is to create such an environment in certain places.
They have been defeated in this regard.
Second, it is applied to this. The point is to create a capability in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya in other countries.
The main point is that they do what they do.
If the dear people of our country realize that the American President has sent the people to tell us that they are supporting you. They claim that they are opposed to the Islamic Republic, they
They are not just kind to other nations, and they do not benefit from it.
The US President has used billions of dogmatics in such economy so that the Americans are struggling to retreat.
They do not pay attention to the traditions of the people on the basis of their behaviors. Therefore, they do not pay attention to their nations.
Today the American nation is in economic valor and they do not
Labor and other places where the people are at obscure and what they are doing in different areas is the same.
People do not understand these things.
What do the American President know?
Did he really know who is behind the arena of politics or who does not know how to those who are in the arena of
He said that the people who are on the Wezadi and Web site are the people who are present on the website of Egypt.
Well, it is true that every month of Bahman, the people who gather together on the Web site will be "llah the Americans" [The Holy Quran, Sura al-Kubra's (s.a.)
The issues that are taking place in the region, the Islamic Republic's Guards Corps are open.
Our goal is to support the nations and their responsibilities.
This is the Islamic Republic's Guards Corps.
Our hearts are the result of these, the wisdom and the things that we have spoken by the people and by the officials of the government.
There are two places where we should pay attention to this point: The first is the Libya, and the second is the Syria of Bahrain.
In the Libya, I would like to congratulate to the people of Libya, spending time with the people whose legitimate killings over the cities and making them enter the United States and other countries and tyranny.
They claim that we have joined the Libya to do what is acceptable to the people.
If they were so supported by the people of Libya, they would be among the people of Libya. If they were present on the basis of the behavior of the Libya, they would have been exposed to the people of Libya.
If you want to help them, give them a measure of tools, and give them a measure of equipment, airplanes.
Instead of letting go to death, you will enter the arena in Libya and you want to go to the country. You are interested in improving the quality of the Islamic Republic of Libya, and you want to prove your position in Libya.
You want to have a foreign background so that you can use it to create a society that will be established in Egypt and Tunisia in Egypt.
It is your firm determination.
The Commander-in-Chief of the World Translation, which should be a minister of nations, should be a weapon in the hands of these people.
This is a shame for the Commander of the World Commander.
Therefore, the presence of the Armed Forces and the presence of the West and the presence of the Armed Forces will not be accepted.
If you want to help the people of Libya, you will be able to help the people, they will be able to deal with the problem that exists among them, the people of the country and Gather, why have you entered into it?
The greatest needs of the country are the people who are committed to elections. Is this a great need?
What a great hope is being done in Bahrain, but in the face of the people, they do not have the right to do so. They are oppressed.
Well, in the west, western civilization have an opportunity to deploy the region through the introduction of a new chapter, which is the case of Shia and Sunni.
Because the people of Bahrain are the kind of Shia and therefore no one is responsible to support them.
Those who are involved in the events that are taking place in the region, but they see that the issue of Bahrain and they do not report the blood of the Bahrain of the people of Bahrain.
And some people were gathered from the Persian Gulf - politicians or newspapers - and they used to tell him that the issue of Bahrain is the issue of Shia and Sunni.
The injustice of a nation and the oppression that has been practiced in Tunisia was similar to what happened in Egypt, such as the events happening in Libya, just as the case of Yemen.
The Americans were happy that they managed to call this issue to be discord between Shia and Sunni through their propaganda and propaganda tools.
They said that the people of Iran supported Bahrain.
We supported all of them.
We have been supporting the Palestinian people for over the past 30 years. One government has given such support to Iran for the past thirty years.
Is the People of Palestine a Shia?
Our youth went to the airplane to give them the opportunity to travel to Gaza.
They were prepared to go to Gaza, and they attack Israel.
We said that they should not go.
The people showed their support to the people of Gaza, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and they were not Shia.
Therefore, the issue is not Shia or Sunni.
Bahrainists try to clarify the issue of Shia and Sunni.
Unfortunately, some people who think that they have no wrong intentions to trap their traps.
If there is hope, I would like to inform them: "They are not Shia and Sunni. This is a great service to the US, which is a great service to the enemies of the Iranian nation who interpret the great movement of a nation as a wrestling in Shia and Sunni.
There is no difference between Gaza and Palestine, Tunisia and Libya, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.
Each movement of the people who sing the flag of Islam and trying to eulogize what we want to support it.
The chief of America is one of the reasons why they do not believe that they are not going to kill the people of Bahrain and democratically, but when they say that when they are in the house of the country, our nurses, they
Is this agressive in domestic affairs?
This is the case with the government, the government of oppression that I am not to kill your people. The government is an integral part of the country, and it is indiscriminate that America and its occupancy and its occupations
The United States had hundreds of thousands of miles from this region.
Anybody who does this work should make a mistake.
What I would like to believe is that by Allah's favor, a new movement will reach the region.
As God promised, this movement will be successful.
The Iranian nation is a source of pride and apprehensiveness.
The youth who came to the Revolution did not see the Revolution. But if they did not have the same determination to the youth, they did not know how to do so.
Dear God, bestow mercy on this great nation.
Each day, continue to honor those who are rendering services to this nation and this movement with Islam and Islam.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age satisfied with us.
Dear God, by the blessedness of Muhammad (s.w.a.) and our magnanimous Imam and our magnanimous Imam (a.s.) managed
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 7, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Guards Corps.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet, Ab-al-Qassem Muhammad, and upon his immaculate and pure elections
I ask Allah the Exalted to bestow His blessings on you.
We are thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us the opportunity to re-appearance and organize the meetings so that we can cooperate with the important issues of the country.
I separated the words that I would like to do for three days: the first point that I would like to do is to say, the organization that I would like to do is related to the situation in the future and in the future.
The final portion of the events that are taking place in the region will be of interest to us in the events that are taking place in the region.
The scholar of Hajj Mr. Mr. Maliki Tabrizi - who is familiar with the knowledge of the Lord and who is a well-known book - says: fasting at the service of Allah the Exalted will bestow His blessings on His servants and upon His servants.
What he said is that they are not at obscure and a source of honor and appreciation for it.
One of these things or the most important factors is to say that the one who is more involved in all sorts of people is that the hunger and thirsty are enlightened by the hearts of a person who is involved in reflecting on the idea that he has come in the immaculates of the Islamic Ummah throughout the year.
This thought is one of the essential things that can be a source of spirituality and spirituality, which reveals the truth, truth, and wisdom. It is necessary to reflect on the past.
They have been the main pillar of everybody.
It is possible to achieve all narrations throughout the lifetime - which is the season of your day. This is an intelligence that can undermine the culture of eternal and Paradise.
Therefore, we should reflect on this life course that they have been traveling for years.
We should pay attention to the amount of time we spend on our lives and day.
We should pay attention to the kind of life which is accompanied by day-to-day life.
Gradually, this taghut is moving forward towards us, and this
How do we use it, and where do we use it?
Thinking of death, walking from the world, the spirit of the soul and the meetings of the martyrdom of death will be an opportunity for each one of us. This is the meaning of death, and all of us will be able to do so.
What should we think of when we are at that time?
Another example of thought is this prayer.
The prayers of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) were very strange. They said that the prayers of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) are recorded in the prayers of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and the
Therefore, these prayers are very important.
Commenting on the people who have heard and reminded those who have not yet heard: “tore is the best prayer in the book of Sahit-Sajja and the prayers of Mohlak.
The message of this prayer says: "Allah and you should pay attention to Muhammad and Alay Muhammad (s.a.) and adorn the services of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), and I denominate about my faith in God. You should make me benefit from the faithful and godly servants of God.
What does it mean to be a good servant of God and to those who are
I would like to congratulate the athletes of Allah's favor, the people who are involved in other things: "In these things, the people should prove righteous in society, justice, justice, justice, and justice and the purpose of separating the people from the country, righteousness and
The fear of God that is expected of us is one of the pillars of this godly fear.
Sometimes a person is used to be an ordinary person who is not carrying out a responsibility in his society and who is not committed to the responsibility of the responsibilities of the people and whose behavior is against you, innovations affects one of your members, or those who are members of the families of the country and who are
When you are angry with a certain people and speak about a particular person, the influence of your anger and your fury with a lack of responsibility, it is not enough to provoke a particular person.
Dear God, we should not do anything in a provoked state.
Forgive us our sins in our case.
Dear God, the fire of security.
Everybody should try to kill this fire.
The reason that we should always give attention to the officials of the government, to those who are taking the lead among the people who are speaking in the country or to the other part of the country, should pay attention to what they have to say and what they should because of this issue.
Sometimes we would not even shoot the flames of the fire that they used to fuel the flames of power.
The people in the midst of the streets should try to find out where they are concerned. We should not let our actions and words be removed from the people who are in the midst of the ways to stop believing.
We should not separate those who are in the company of the Islamic Republic.
When there is discord among people, we should try to resolve them.
When a government takes action, try to explain it.
We said many things about this issue.
This is one side of the issue of this prayer. Political prayer is a source of twenty-one value. I now speak about six of them.
May Allah the Exalted bestow His blessings on us and on us.
These are aspects of reverential fear of God.
This is the first point that I want to speak about.
The second point is to consider the future in the case of the country.
This report, which has been presented by the president of the country is a report that has been presented in many areas. There are many important points in the report that they presented in the report, saying that they should know how to make efforts and how to carry out their efforts.
I would like to discuss the situation in which the country is very important to us.
Why is it important?
First of all, if we are familiar with the situation of the country and where we are, where we are, we should move forward and what is important is the right path. But today, it is important to be aware of the conditions that exist in the world
First of all, the situation of the region is like a welcome.
The Islamic awakening of Islam and the great things that are happening in the region are not seen from the beginning of the Revolution until today.
In a nation like the people of Egypt made such a great movement, a nation that was opposed to the Islamic Republic, and it was a source of threat to the destruction of the region, and it was indifferent to all those events that are taking place in the region.
This is to say, in these conditions, we find ourselves in a position to organize a very strange situation with the Islamic Republic.
The issue of the economy which has been imposed on the arrogant powers of the west and is moving forward towards a great movement.
This is the case with the issue of episodes of the economy of the economy of the episodes of the economy of the West,
Political and political figures in the arena of the world - which are often involved in the media - are not at all at the service of the world. They do not want to see the issue in this regard.
By the end of the speech, I will shed light on this issue.
The same is true of other countries, such as the recent civilization and terrorist activities in western countries, especially in Western countries, as Nazis and innovatives of the Americans who are the same as the US and the American government officials who used to do what they used to do. They speak of their national interests in the country.
Later, he attacked the Islamic Republic.
There are other things that they want to do, but Allah the Exalted did not give them any opportunity.
These are important things.
The event that happened in Norway should not be the
In such conditions, we should re-appearse our situation in a similar situation.
If we do not look at this opportunity and appreciate it, we will not do what is right and if we do not work with it and if we do not benefit from this opportunity, we will
Sometimes he apologized for an opportunity to make a threat, and he
Therefore, there is no problem when we look at the future issues in the country and this view.
We should not make a mistake. We should pay attention to these things. We should pay attention to them. We should not make mistakes. We should pay attention to them. We should pay attention to them. We should pay attention to them.
The same is true of the media.
From a person's words, they say that you are not present on the scene.
You would like to say that this is the case with the other party. We want to say that we are really trying to
I would like to congratulate ten newspapers each day.
Some of these journals each day have experiences that each of them reaches the heart of a weak person.
We are not at fault with anyone, but we are in fact a mistake.
The same is true of this.
It is necessary to look at the side of the issue of weakness with the kind of intensified power.
It is necessary to pay attention to what government can and which is committed to it.
Therefore, if we want to understand the realities of the country, we should preserve the weakness and the power of the Islamic Ummah.
Today I would like to introduce a clear information on this issue, but there is a need to be done in this regard.
They can show us a lot about our opportunities in this country.
These are the things that we should do and what we should do.
When we make these things together, this is a source of light for us. We should identify the path.
I would like to write five different things to six, a movement that has been made throughout the Islamic Republic throughout the past 30 years - that is to say, some of the countries that have been imposed on the country throughout the past.
The first point that is one of the good things and managements of this system of things is the success of different kinds of threats against different kinds of threats.
During the past 30 years, we have faced various threats of political, threats of security, and economic threats as well as the threat of this system.
They want to be forgiving towards the government, but they do not want to stop the same government.
All these threats have been defeated in the face of all these threats.
Some of these things prepared themselves. Some of these things prepared themselves, like the sanctions.
The sanctions of sanctions have been fueled for years, but in recent years they have increased their sanctions. They
The sanctions of the Islamic Republic - particularly in the hands of the people - have placed this sanctions against us.
These are the things that are related to foreigners, who are directly involved in them.
The same is true of the threats of those who have responded to the results of domestic events. Although the enemies have used this issue in the country as an example, they have managed to manage all these things in the country.
I feel that this is one of the most valiant aspects of our power.
We should pay attention to this point when we consider the issues of the Islamic Republic's Guards Corps.
This system of things does not mean that it does not belong to all those countries and that it is independent of the global powers of the world, which has faced various threats over the past 30, but it has proven this to be a source of threat to all these threats.
I feel that this is the first aspect of the Islamic system.
Second: it is the relationship between people and government.
