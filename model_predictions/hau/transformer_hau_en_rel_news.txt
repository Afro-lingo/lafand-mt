The result of the persecution of the locusts and the re-appearance of a famine-stricken region in Soviet Union, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution met a meeting with a clarification of all the people in this kind of kindness and understanding.
Here the interpretation of the pronouncements belongs:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
One of the most difficult times in the region of African countries, especially Somalia and many other times, was faced with the greatest hardships of the past and aggresive stain in the area where a country has come to see and what has been held in a shortcoming.
His Eminence stressed that the presence of the Islamic Revolution was not limited to the help of the people who were hungry in Somaleleli, called Muslims and those of Soviet Union to help the Islamic Republic of Iran in this regard.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution met this meeting with a group of people and added: "By Allah's favor, the Islamic Republic of Iran is a source of power in the country, and the people should pay attention to it."
The following is the full text of the inspired words:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
Dear God, the Creator of all things, the Creator of all good things, the Creator of all things, the Creator of all things, the Creator of all things is the one who
As long as the Lord, they congregated their justice, they braved their thirst and insulted him.
I would like to congratulate all nights and day after day, and I would like to congratulate from the congrat, and he would not be able to approach him in a knowledge of God.
When the orders and prayers of the world of life become fertilization and the Islamic miracle can explain in a spiritual sense.
It is a manifestation of this event.
Adddressing the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) is like a re-appearance.
Fortunately, the situation of Islam is bright and accurate and accurate and
Such a view should be viewed as a result of
He added to the source of life and power.
And wherever life is found, it is the very foundation of life.
It is necessary for him to have a solid foundation in the regional cities, in schools and officials, and in places of work and throughout the streets and places and in order to capacities, and intensors, and infrastructures.
I should pay attention to him even if he is to be extremely careful.
It is necessary to pay attention to the management of a student who is a source of wisdom and insight.
Instead of letting him know what is right, the responsibility of material things and the world of Islam and the people who are weak, the people and our government officials will disapprove.
I hope that this day will pay attention to the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for him.

Well, it was the only thing to set up a bag for Israel " s illegal violation of Israel (a.s.)
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that Lebanon was the only one of the people who had been able to win the battle against Israel and said: "Int is just what the enemies of Lebanon have experienced.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the greatness of this kind of greatness.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution reiterated: "Isolence has continued until the death of the enemies of Israel and has continued to exist in Lebanon."
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the joy and excitement of his economy on the economy of Ayatollah Khamenei said that Ayatollah Khamenei added: "By Allah's favor, the Iranian people should continue to strengthen this relationship."

He added: "The Gulf of Lebanon is eager to see the relationship between the two countries increase the strength of all the economic and political environments."
In fact, Hariji went on to say that the government governmental policies were established, saying that any discord and dissatisfaction among the people of Lebanon would use the corrupt Israel.
Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
After spending a long time and re-appearance of Iran, they had been able to communicate with the patients of the two countries.
Leader’s Speech to Members of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is one of
Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
How do you feel about the philosophy?
To answer this question, First of all, it is necessary to discuss matters.
First of all, he was one of the hajj pilgrimage of Islamic works, and he had other important goals that he wanted to
It is the greatest and most important goal in the hajj, just as we have seen in the Holy Quran, the Islamic Ummah and the actions of the Prophets. He has seen in the history of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.).
The Holy Quran embodied each one of these times, saying: "The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) is the utterance of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) when he calls attention to the path of the prophets and to
He said: "Lalle, I am your leader.
He said: "Bys and descendants of the country are the manifestations of the dignity of the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
The second goal which is based on the path is to bring about unity, and it is to restore the path of the hajj to its roots.
All these are the manifestations of humanity and of the Islamic Ummah.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) was a long time.
But the philosophy of the philosophy of â€ â€ â€“ which is the cleric of â€“ which is the main reason for the Islamic Republic and
Of course, the hajj means to make the movement of the Iranian nation.
He said: Hajj is the manifestation of Islam. What is meant by the flag of Islam?
During a period of time, this is the meaning of the Army.
Therefore, the hajj and return to the spirit of the hajj is one of the lofty goals of the Islamic Republic.
Therefore, the Imam (r.a.) was a manifestation of divine backing.
But from all the signs that have not been given to this point of importance to the hajj, it is clear that we cannot understand the greatness of this kind of greatness.
The news is based on religious and cultural backgrounds and other factors, but they do not manage to compensate for their activities and the importance of this message.
It is necessary for all the media, including the Iranian management, the media, and the Iranian nation's competitive powers to achieve all the power that is due to the advantages of the world.
It is necessary to increase our efforts in this regard.
No, this was not the case.
Since the first day of the barley is a manifestation of disapproval for the people?
But after the Revolution â€ â€ â€ â€ â€“ the people of the Canaanites had not been able to visit the hajj for a few years after the conversation became part of the conversation.
The two of them went on to say that the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should not be held in Labor, but in the day of hajj â€“ â€“ I would like to congratulate the people of Iran, and the people of the people should make great meetings for this great meeting.
No, he is the agreement with Duemmat and was defeated. This is the opposite of all discussions after all disagreements.
We are convinced that the hajj is accompanied by Muslim nations.
Now, it is a source of influence and influence.
First of all, the people of different countries are coming.
The second point is presented on the scene and is interpreted in different sects during the hajj, and he has entered into the hands of all the Islamic Revolution.
This is the result of many different languages in order to influence the good news of the Islamic Ummah. On the other hand, the world of Islam and Islamic governments try to deploy the influence of this system of things.
At one point, this message was published in the newspapers England, and all the Zionists were exposed to the aftermath of this magazine, where they gave birth to her.
In what year did this happen?
The Zionists try to dissuade this message.
The same is true of the government that has not been able to do so only in some years. Sometimes people have been arrested.
Of course these things have been reduced. Tomenmen, but I try to increase the stress that they have spent in the past.
Sometimes we try to get out of print in newspapers, but we are not printed.
Many of the newspapers did not believe or have been granted.
I am determined to follow the Islamic Revolution.
For example, they do not let down, but they tell us how I have spoken about it.
What is the nature of this message?
There are the representatives of all Muslims.
The fact that is based on fact in truth is a manifestation of the administration of the people - the camp of all Muslims and their goal to draw closer to Jehovah.
It is necessary to take care of him.
He takes care of the tongue.
The things that I was forbidden to immaculate, and this was the result of illegitimate
The following is the full text of the speech delivered by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
If you watch the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, you will see that the first point in this issue is the re-appearance of the hajj.
This is one of the reasons why the Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps was
As an example of the hajj's role model in the role of the Islamic Ummah.
The following is the example of the hajj.
Ayatollah Khamenei referred to the clear message of the Islamic Revolution.
If we take note of the origin of the hajj, it is to be accompanied by Allah's Guards Corps.
That is to say, all people should go through the decisions, and Allah the Exalted will do so.
The first point that is being discussed in this issue is to be the focus of the hajj in the history of the Islamic Ummah.
The second point is that the hajj is accompanied by dignity and kindness of the Iranian nation.
This is one of all the benefits.
Of course, since the early stage of the purity of the heart will be discussed as well as the advantage of the opportunities that have been found in the holy place of the hajj.
The third aspect of this message is the value of Islamic dignity and its message.
The same is true of the ways that Islam has solved the problems of humanity.
The following is the full text of the issue of Islamic Awakening and the
This is the goal of Islamic Awakening.
It is also referred to in this regard. It is the kind of clothing that is presented in different areas, the course that is accompanied by the same media and other factors.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution referred to the fact that the Mediterranean is a manifestation of theology and a manifestation of the message of monotheism.
The same is true of these events that have been explained in the formation of the great power of the Islamic Ummah and the spiritual and spiritual powers. They remind the nation of the great power that is behind the enemy forces try to weaken.
Similarly, one of these issues is the secret of the arrogant powers.
These manifestations of the evil and propaganda of the arrogant powers of the world do to eliminate the Islamic Ummah and the reasons for their actions.
The work they are doing and the important issues that are taking place in Islamic countries, which are embodied by the fact that they have immoderate their behavior and efforts to produce discords and tribunals as well as the murders of the Islamic Ummah.
All the threats of those who were behind the fitna of September 11, guiding him and explaining them.
Fortunately, the enemies of the Islamic Revolution and the awakening of Islamic Awakening have been able to demoil the plot of the arrogant powers against the arrogant powers, and the enemies have begun to take a stand against the Islamic Ummah.
Therefore, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that the greatness of the world is revealed in the sense of the power of the people, and those who have been oppressed by terrorism and the hypocrisy of the Islamic Republic in Tabbas and from the important things that have been immeasurably democracy and
The final event is the determination of the Islamic Republic as an example of success in opposing the arrogant powers of the world and the role of Islamic Awakening in all life and calling on Islamic unity, as well as the role model for religious arrogance.
What are the influences of these countries?
Is it possible to have a position in the arena of Islamic scholars and politicians ?
In all the trips and the meetings that we attend â€ â€“ â€“ each year, I visited the 50-Modime Ministers and clergymen of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the esteemed â€“ all of these things and the good things that I have spoken about.
That is to say, no matter what weakness we may have in this regard, but wherever they have been presented, it has been a great influence.
Today the issue of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is one of the most
Are the hajj ceremonies of the Islamic Republic, and this is one of the ways to follow the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Of course, one of the best ways to address the issue of the Revolution is that of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
One of the ways to strengthen the gatherings of the hajj and to respond to the efforts of the hajj to ride the spirit of the Islamic Ummah is one of these things.
The point is that many of the people are coming to a remote area, but they do not fully understand the message of the hajj.
We have another reason to say: " The hajj ceremony will continue to be without sin - that is to be brought back into the light of the hajj, and this light will continue to be with him in his dealings with the people until he has committed sin.
I hope that the hajj will try to achieve this enlightening understanding and their efforts to fulfill the hajj as a result of hajj.
Leader’s Speech to Teachers - Khamenei.ir
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on October 12, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
Allah the Exalted said: " My name of God, the Beneficent, the Most Holy One of the
Those who are capable of Allah's favor, and they are afraid of Allah's favor, and they are worthy of Allah's favor." [The Holy Quran, 33:
One of the interviews with honorable teachers is to interview with the honorable teachers who are carrying out the ministry in different different areas of the country and the youth who are busy in religious uprisings.
Fortunately, today the brothers and sisters and the honorable honorable honorable honorable teachers of the province of the Armed Forces, all of them gathered at this meeting, and this was an opportunity for me to use it.
I would like to discuss the points that I would like to discuss, but before I would like to say, I should pay attention to the greatest Teacher of the Islamic Revolution who was present in the province of this province and made the prize of a martyrdom.
I had the opportunity to talk to him in his home in Kermanshah several times, and we would spend two days with him in our presence.
We also adopted him in certain meetings.
The meetings were held in the hegemony.
His humility, ride of the world, dissatisfaction and physical things, all these things are among the characteristics of its own father.
And Allah the Exalted rewards him. By the end of a long life, God has rescued him and his death.
I have seen that the death of a martyr is a life-threatening process.
Of course, there are times when life will come to an end to " the soul of the soul " is the result of death. - Acts 3:185 .
We too have a great benefit for those who love it.
Allah the Exalted is the One who makes progress.
In the same province, the oldest of Hajj Ahaghazade and his household was among the people who were martyred.
The Aghalogian of Hajj is one of the most famous Imams, and one of our friends in Kum
God showed mercy to these two martyrs.
I would like to mention the esteemed teacher of the embodimental behavior, humility, and sincerity and sincerity of the Imam of Hajj - who is one of our friends at the school of Hjjat.
God showed mercy to him.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, before I became the president of the country, I visited Kermanshah and went to his home and witnessed his achievements.
Similarly, after the death of Imam Khomeini (r.a.), he invited me to join him in his actions.
I would like to have him who wrote to me in this regard and said: "The people of the people who have disowned himself and who is a leader of the people and who should start reading his own ideas before he reads it before I should appoint him over my table.
He wrote this to me, and I placed him in the future.
This is the problem with our work.
You dear youth, you dear men and women. If you want to know that you are doing well, you want to know that you will be like the eye of those who are not willing to kill them.
This is the greatest and ever-increased statement: "Malach is the one who fears God." [The Holy Quran, 35: 828] The fear of God is one of the qualities that
The teachers have certain icons, but the fear of God is being praised.
The knowledge of this great blessing is that one can achieve divine fear in a man " s heart.
It is necessary to achieve this identity. You dear youth who have been in a position to do this work. When you reach the years of age, you should do something else in order to benefit from it.
This is the way of life. Some will reach old age, and others will not achieve it.
You should know that they are more than 20 years.
During the 20th years of age, one feels that it is time to reach 70 years.
I am aware that they will pass away; then the words of a long time will be organized, and they will have opportunities to make a success, and it is necessary to achieve it.
Therefore, I would like to call on the honorable people, you should call on God, for fear of him and for draw closer to the God who is in heaven and who is referred to as the primary source of knowledge and understanding.
If knowledge is not based on knowledge, it can be a valueless opportunity.
We have a teacher - who is religious and non-Israelite - who does not benefit from knowledge, but he is also a tragedy.
This basiji spirit is essential for knowledge and teacher.
To Kermanshah is a very important town.
As the teacher of Ulama said in a short time, Kermanshah was responsible for the honorable clergy, such as the families of the Naghali, and the rest of the educators among them - not one of them or those of the people - were ordinary people.
The same is true of Kermanshah " s narration. The same is that the people of Kermanshah were
Heard Ali, Muhammad, Ali (s.w.a.) - and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) continued to live.
Of course he did not mean it, but he continued to live, and they were
This is the case with many of his children.
This is one example.
Another example is the example of Egha's Aussan, who was at the end of his life.
I am able to remember some things about him.
He, the brothers of Aghag and his household, met with Aghammammad, Isfahan, and the household of Aghaviat and the household of Isfahan, and the students of Armanshaz, who has come from Iraq and has been in Kermanshah for years.
He was the one who was going to execute His judgment in Isfahan.
This is the manifestation of divine knowledge and calculation.
He was also among those who received training from the Akhund Fatul Sulvil Presidentians who were then in the home of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
A teacher is the scholar of Kabulian.
This book was written in a beautiful and beautiful book for many years.
For the past 60 years in Kermanshah.
I read in this book that the 13th of hajj Aghag Mahdain was convinced of God " s backing and going to the holy places and in his return to Kermanshah
The writer of the book says that I am two witnesses of witnesses - I think that he has said of me and that he has been reading the book for the past - that is , the hajjman of Kummis, who has become a teacher and who is in the presence of Kadar in Kabuli (s.a.).
This is a lesson. He was learning during the time of a 70-hour-year-old man (a.s.).
This is not a matter of taking a stand or brazenly at a great teacher.
We should learn these things. You dear youth should follow this path and continue.
This was the man of Kabul, who grew up in India, and moved to Najaf to Kermanshah, and he was welcomed back.
In Kermanshah, Kabul 60 years of age held in Kermanshah
He himself is one of the teachers who have been exiled to
This is a manifestation of the identity of the people, the hearts of the people who are enlightened by religious teachers
When they receive a new personality and understand its characteristics, they will welcome him to the extent that they do not believe that they are not going to
As the man of Isfahan, he felt that he was the man of Isfahan, but he felt that he was the man of Kermanshah. He was the man of Kermanshah.
These things I have said that I have been able to clean up the scene.
I would like to discuss other matters.
The dear youth, the dear commanders, the dear youth and the future of the youth.
For two reasons: First of all, I would like to congregated Islam in the world - whether in the Islamic Ummah or those of the non-Muslim.
Therefore, the weight of this embodiment is
Today you are in a similar situation.
You should not be afraid; " they are afraid of Allah's favor, and they are not afraid of each one of them.
Do not be afraid to return, and do not fear that they are on the path.
You do not want to say that there are injustices, but you do not want to be afraid of those who are suffering.
Do not do things that are expected to happen.
Does this not happen in Iran?
The Iranian nation has to say that they are not doing anything else in the world. They will spend a lot of time and night, but they will not
Each professor would say that this action was not easy.
I tell you that some of our fighters say that he will not fail.
Ayatollah Khamenei told me that the Imam (r.a.) told me that he was fighting against the war and that he was not going to leave.
He did not believe that the Shah could be removed.
He told me this.
The Imam (r.a.) said that the war would be removed, but he
It was not just after he had been removed from the United States, and the west of western countries have gone to the end of the country and they have slipped
Nobody believes in this regard.
No one feels that the great Revolution will take place in Egypt, Egypt and the Plain of Dabid, Egypt and the land of Honbababababaptism.
It is a very strange thing to do so in different parts of the country, but there is no one thinking about Egypt.
These are among the things we should place in our hearts.
We should not take advantage of what is expected to do, but what
You should be determined to make a lot of responsibility, and you are unable to do this.
The answer is: " The praise of God is worthy of him. They should not forget God, and God has
And God is deserving of Himself.
This is our path.
In this regard, we are careful to say that we are aware of the importance of teachers - and we are spoken of as "Whammad, "Islamations of Allah's favor are the Holy Prophet of the Holy Prophet (s.w
Allah the Exalted said: " We have placed these things to each prophet to each one of the Prophets, and they are speaking to the people, and they are speaking about the manifestations of the Holy Prophet's (s
And your Lord, if they did not do so, let them know what they were doing."
Therefore, if I have been invited to join you, we will stay with the people who have been prepared for the witness of the demons and the people.
They will attack us, and we will be prepared.
In the arena of spirituality, we need to create a strengthening aid for ourselves - a large shield of faith and faith - so that we will not achieve victory.
Pornography and ethnic dynasty are rooted from fleeting and dynasty of one " s debt (whons).
I would like to congratulate him.
If you do not experience somewhere in your heart, nobody can succeed in you.
This is to say, "The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household should be prepared to rely on God."" [The Holy Quran, 3:22), the " Perference of reliance on God." [The Holy Quran
[The Holy Quran, 39:36) These are a lesson for us.
We should read the Holy Quran with all thought.
This witness is being present on the road to the front lines, a daystar, and other present-day communications.
I have known that I am killed in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In some Islamic countries, many of the people are killed for the sake of the presence of an unfamiliar meeting. In some of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps
This is the case in the other side of the issue of Shia (s.w.a.) and he calls the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.).
These are the methods that they follow.
Therefore, there is a great blessing for them.
I would like to tell you that this is the province of Shia and Sunni.
It is good for the teachers of Shia and Sunni to prepare a meeting among them and understand each other.
We have the responsibility to associate with them.
You can democracy, but you should strive to work in harmony with your company.
If they want to do research, they will not do so.
I am convinced that I am convinced that I am not going to play the role of knowledge and philosophy among the scholars,
But despite these things, there are other things that have been associated with them; there is
The teacher of Shia was about to speak in his people. He was speaking to his people, using this power and speaking to their problems.
Today they are not ashamed to call upon themselves, but they are not ashamed of them.
It is necessary to ignore this event from the Islamic Ummah.
Therefore, this economy that we have spoken about is the result of all these things.
Another responsibility is the responsibility of reading.
I heard that the Kermanshah and I had graduated from Kumm and that their brothers had arranged for them - and they had been exiled, and they would
Therefore, knowledge is essential.
Of course, there are important issues for education.
There was someone who was present at the point of giving.
After a second time, I asked him that I was behind him, and he said that I was outside the towns that were far away from the province of Khorasian - I was preaching in the past until he returned from the end of my life and said that I did not know which I was going to use these people.
This is understandable.
Today, look at the kinds of young people who have been studying with us today.
In this city of Kermanshah, those who graduated are very busy.
Sometimes this was not the case.
Before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, all of this province of Kermanshah, the graduates of the university had not ended.
But now, those who are planted have been weaker.
These young people are exposed to different propaganda, and there are questions that arise.
You should pay attention to their questions and prepare their answers to them, and then go on to the point.
You should praise those who will speak with them and understand their reasonings and what they need from the Holy Quran and from the Holy Quran, the Holy Quran and the
His Eminence said that this is the case: "The Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) is a source of wisdom and insight."
You should be vigilant.
It is necessary to do these things.
Reflect on the moral values that you have considered to be an auspicious academic factor.
Sanctify the hearts of those who are speaking with them and who are enlightened.
This training was just as I said, "Doman, the leader of the people, and the people who started to read it before he reads a passage of difficult times.
It is necessary to carry out this difficult task.
The teachers should enter the arena of vigilance, but the important point is that they should enter into the arenas that the teachers should enter into the arena of role models.
The maintenance of the teachers is that by means of her teacher, kindness, kindness, and kindness, and by means of the minds of the people who speak to them, make they come into the arena.
It is the goal of all re-appearances.
A person who is stricken by all his enemies will be saved if he is able to preserve his relationship with Him.
It is a very important thing.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on those who are speaking with them, and you will be able to attend meetings.
I do not know whether he is present in Kermanshah or not, he or I do not know that he is present in Kermanshah or not.
Shia and Sunni Muslims should not exploit their brothers.
Go with one another, sympathize with one another.
There are other things that have been associated with.
If that happens, then divine students will continue.
I would like to tell you that when the Revolution prevailed, I would like to tell you that Islam had a new role model in the world.
What a powerful and powerful role model to produce such a great event that has shaken the horizon?
The victory of the Islamic Revolution and the magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was shattered
They returned to the Holy Quran, and they received certain information about Islam, and they were interested in Islam.
At that time, they began to fight against Islam, and the second stage was during the era of the Revolution.
The academic in the Islamic countries have been created in the minds of young people who have hoped that they will see that if the government is established, there will be dissolved of poverty and injustice from their countries.
Some of them are true people. I have seen some of them, and I have seen some of them, and Muslims are not Muslims; neither do they believe in Islam.
They have become so confused that they think that there is hope for people.
But when the lame snakes broke out, they felt that they did not expect it, nor did they expect it.
Therefore, they get to the path of Islam.
They are all those who have seen in Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen and other places. They are all of them in 1960 and 1970 " s - approximately 30 years ago - all of them smell; even if anyone speaks of Islam in the past 30 years.
This is the case in our country. I do not want to mention them.
There are people who are speaking about Islam, but they are not ignorant of these things.
They returned to Islam and watched the Holy Quran as they watched the Islamic Republic and watched the Islamic Republic.
In the Islamic system, he manages all the present systems of things, and all those who hate the blood of the nations are fighting against him, but he sees that he stands up against him.
And they have not managed to achieve anything, but they have not managed to see what they are looking for in Islam.
You see what is happening?
They want to avoid it.
In the United States, in the United States helmet and Labor, New York, and he is also the source of logic Street (s.w.a.) that thousands of people
Well, this is what we say, and we know that from the beginning that we have spoken that we are not arbitrarily, nor do we have any excuses, nor do
You should pay attention to it.
Islamic teachers should be prepared.
I would like to congratulate the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.), and they believed that they would be in harmony with the Holy Quran and the Holy Quran and the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.)
If you do this, you will see how the Islamic love will grow.
I would like to know many of the things that I am saying in my case. I would like to say, but I should pay attention to it.
Dear God, make teachers of the Islamic Ummah benefit from it.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on these dear youth and youth - in Kermanshah and a Kermanshah - are worthy of being teachers.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on all of us.
Dear God, make the heart of the Imam of the Age (may our souls be sacrificed for his sake).
Leader Meets - Khamenei.ir
His Eminence said that Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei said that Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution said that Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution was a new member of the Mediterranean and TVans.
The following is the full text of his inspired words:
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
Dakta Abdul " salute Ali Asghari (Allah).
Determined to regress, Zerus (s.w.a.) and thanked him for the great achievements of the Revolution and the jealousy of the people, and this was not the result of the long history of the Revolution and the experience of the Islamic Revolution.
That is to say, it is part of a paper that I have given to the teacher of Zeraz-in-law at the time of my mother (with).
Therefore, I am adding to the importance of protecting, safeguarding the honorable and intellectual powers, safeguarding the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps, protecting the people of the Islamic Revolution and working towards obscurities, and relying on Allah the Exalted.
I am kind to Allah the Exalted in this regard.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei

(French only), May
Leader’s Speech to Ayatollah Khamenei, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution (s.w.a.)
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on Maya, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet of Eid al-Mustafafa Muhammad and His immaculate household, especially the God of Mahdam (Ims.
We thank God for the opportunity to re-appearance our magnanimous Imam and our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and our love for him.
Although the name of the Imam (r.a.) remained alive in the hearts of our people, the day of Khordad was a manifestation of expressing love for the people of Iran.
This is not just the day of the martyrdom of his great martyr - Imam Moses (a.s.)
This year was the same as the year 1342, and the year 1342, which was the beginning of the Islamic Revolution.
The 15th of Khordad was a crucial and important day.
I would like to talk about this before going to the original issues and I would like to talk about it.
The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement of teachers.
Prior to Khordad, there were some important issues that happened in the year 1341 and early 1342.
For example, the events of the Mediterraneans took place on the occasion of 2,42 years of the year 1342, the issue that led to drunkenness and the weaker ethics of the Islamic Republic.
Before the year 1341 years, the issue of Improaming people in the marketplace of Tehran, and the people were defeated in the hegemony of hajj.
All of this is a manifestation of the fact that the movement of teachers in the year 1341 and early 1342 took up a position that the policeman and officials were using a lot of power in order to make good use of the clerics of the clerics and
But this was the last 15th of Khordad.
For this reason, what happened on the 15th of Khordad 1342 was an indication of the relationship between people and teachers at that time.
On the day of the year 13th of Khordad, he introduced a very important and most important event in the Persian school.
Later, on Khordad, he was arrested on Khordad, in Tehran, and in different other cities, the Gomorrah and the people were able to stand up against the people.
It is noteworthy that such a relationship is the result of the progress of this movement and
Wherever a movement is supported by people and traveling with them, the movement will continue.
But if people do not enter a movement, it will not succeed.
As was the case in Iran during the civilizations. Unfortunately, the movements of the people did not get along with them.
When the people entered the arena and they supported the movement, and they all thoughtfully, and the movement of the people will continue.
This was what happened on Khordad.
As a result of the people who were in Tehran and other towns, he was arrested by the issue of the government and the strength of the people and the people was put to death on a wide range of people.
The blood of God " s servants has been filled with the blood of both men and women.
On the 15th of Khordad, the reign of a sword and the faithless heart of the neighbor has appeared publicly.
Another issue is that Khordad - one of our dear youth and our dear people - is that when the blood of the people were held in Tehran and other towns, the people did not have an opportunity to call themselves on their rights, those who were in charge of human rights.
Men and teachers should be careful not only in the arena.
They claimed to belligence. They even claimed to support the governmental war veterans. They said that this movement was a facial movement. They
When those who are looking at odds and feel that they fail to stay outside the battlefield, they will criticize the patients of the patients.
They said that they were a religious academic and a revolutionary movement. The result of Imam Khomeini's re-appearance and re-appearanceance
His faith, faith, faith, and faith and faith are revealed among those who have faith in him.
He was speaking from the midst of his heart and the people responded to this call with all their possessions.
They entered the arena and stood firm.
They have achieved this movement, which is not short of the world.
Now I would like to explain the three faiths of the Imam of the Age (may our
These are some of the important things that we understand.
Demond believe in God, the Imam of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) became a sign of faith in God.
Then they said to them: " God is our Grand Instructor and usurped the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
He said, "I will help you." [The Holy Quran, 477] Allah's favor, and this is the promise of Jehovah." [The Holy Quran,
He knew that this was the meaning of the words of the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) household.
His Eminence said that this nation is a people, a nation of faith, a good and firm determination.
The people of Iran used to bring up the Iranian nation, but at least some time, the Nadeli Kadiopian people - although they did not have all of them - have revealed their faith in the people of Iran.
He understood the Iranian nation and made them lie.
He explained that the religious jealousy of the Iranian nation was exemplary and insight.
The people were far more comfortable in the Imam (r.a.), and the enemies of the enemies of the people, and the enemies of the people were in danger.
This is the reason why you think that Imam Mahdaviat is not present in the battlefields and colonial powers because they feel that they are opposed to the war veterans and that he sees the people as enemies.
Depending on you, Imam Khomeini taught the Iranian nation that we are able to do so.
He explained to the world of power. On the day of 1342, Imam Khomeini appeared before the Mediterranean people in the school of the Shah Riddha, who trusted the US, and the people were able to fight against him and war against him.
He was a teacher in the city of Kum, who did not have any weapons or support.
Your faith in God and your willingness to bestow success on him in this regard.
This was the case at that time when he returned from exile in Beheshtihra, Imam Khomeini (r.a.), and I was threatened by the people of Bakhra (s.a.).
The Imam (r.a.) managed to achieve his vigilance.
The Imam (r.a.) was the one whom he believed.
And some believe that this is one of the most powerful weapons that the enemies have placed in order to prove their power on the people of the nations, that they
Thus, they managed to feed the Iranian nation for many years in political, economic, and other areas of life.
He told the Iranian people that you can achieve success.
He has returned to us, and he has returned to us with dignity and self-confidence.
I would like to congratulate the Iranian nation for the past 30 years, and I would like to discuss them in all areas in the future.
They accepted the faith of the Imams (r.a.) - faith, faith, faith, and self-confidence.
At the beginning of this struggle, the three faith-strengthening beliefs gave to Imam Khomeini (r.a.)
When he was forced to live as a fugitive, he was arrested in Paris when he returned to Iran.
These three things were the ones who gave to the magnanimous re-appearance of Imam Ali (r.a.)
This was the case in Bahman of 1357 (a.s.), but when he announced the Islamic Republic, he was firmly established in the arena of 135 feet (857 m), and He was not present at the age of 10, and he was baptized during the last days of these events.
These three factors are the sources of the magnanimous Imam's (r.a.).
Until the end of his life, no one has seen a sign of weakness, fatigue, fatigue, and heavy deeds of Imam Khomeini (r.a.).
Many of the arrogant powers have turned into the world, whenever they
At times, they returned from the backwardness of the statements that they had
But the Imam of the Age (a.s.) delivered his lectures in the last year 1342 and heat.
He grew old, but his heart was a youth.
This is the firm determination of the Holy Quran, which says: " The wools that have trampled on the road, and we have thoroughly defeated them." [The Holy Quran, 72
In a different verse, he said: "The people who have said: "They are the people who have faith in God, and they have exercised faith in their souls."
The Iranian nation has replaced the feelings of disability, and Allah the Exalted has replaced them with their situation: " Zeal is what God has not changed to mankind until he has changed their hearts."
The Iranian nation managed to correct their paths, and Allah the Exalted helped them and delivered them.
What was the result?
There are many things that our young ones should know about relying on the kind of self-confidence of the government of Pahlagui - which is more serious than those of the regimes - to do with England and the Americas.
This self-confidence leads to shame.
After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the presidential officials of the US President said: " We are going to tell him (Shah) that the things he needs and those who are not in need."
They tell him that you should strengthen your relationships.
You will sell them, and you will not sell them.
Such a country that is trusting in others is to be returned to a humble and humble country.
They are corrupted by the evil leaders, they are betrayed, and they are the target of the economy, but they are
They were replaced by the honorable officials and the people.
For the past 30 years, the nobles of the country and the economic and political issues of the country are the people of the country.
They did not get the mastery over their traditions (w.w.a.) when they were at the end of the reigns of some.
President politicians who are present in front of the enemies and show their bitterness towards the people, have transformed themselves into the arena of knowledge, and they have
Before the Revolution, we had no success in the arena of knowledge.
Are these things?
Dear God, the world of Islam tells us that they will reach the peaks of the educational system for the sake of the world.
Are these things?
If we want to build a way, if we want to build a way, if we would like to build a street or a trailer, we should extend our hands to others and help them to build
Today the young people of this nation are not content to rely on sanctions, but they see
Why should we say that we are concerned about all these things?
In health, medical and medical advances, it is necessary for our patients to go to different countries, but if they do not have it, they should die.
Today, we have the most important and most important role models in Tehran, not just in Tehran, but
The Iranian nation did not need some of them in this regard.
We have achieved self-confidence in this important aspect.
At that time , many of the country had been left behind.
Prior to the victory of the Islamic Revolution, I visited many of the country and had not returned to the farms.
Today, there are many different kinds of services in the country throughout the cities and cities.
Today, nobody can say that outsiders negotiates or sports arenas.
During the years before the victory of the Revolution, there were some 30 million people of the country, when the officials and the honorable officials were fifty.
Today the number of people has doubled the number of times, but the number of government officials have increased 20 times.
The fact that our esteemed officials are referring to the responsibility of the esteemed teachers and officials.
Each morning held at a university, and about five, about ten others.
At that time, a number of higher schools did not get involved in the number of
Today in this regard, there are many people who are present in the arena of higher education.
This is the great movement of the Iranian people and the efforts of our youth and their youth. This is
These are important things.
The blessings of this revolution are being made, and thousands of new opportunities have been made in the country.
Our friendship in foreign countries is seen today as many as possible in the country.
It is necessary to look at these things.
These are the advantages that have been bestowed by the three faith and faith in the people of the country, faith, faith, faith, faith, and trust.
We did not say that these words were the result of my misconceptions.
No, it is still great in our presence.
I would like to tell you that if we compared ourselves to taghut, it is possible to think that such achievements are possible. But if we compared ourselves to what Islam is interested in the Iranian nation - that the world is aware of its glory and that there is a good reason for us.
I say that this is because our great nation and our esteemed people know that the success of progress is due to re-appearance of these three faith.
They know that there is a long way in the near future.
You can continue to follow this long path until now, and this is the manifestation of reaching its destination.
I would say these words because you knew that the efforts of the enemies to make a firm stand in our hearts.
The path is ahead of us.
We have a map.
What is our map?
The teaching of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was the result of the training of the Imam (r.a.) and his
I do not see any benefit in the name of the Imam (r.a.), but we forget his teachings.
The chair was with our magnanimous Imam, and he introduced it to us.
Democratically, the teachings of the Imam (r.a.) is a firm stand against the political and political systems. You dear Muslim brothers and all nations, but I am not content with all the countries that oppressed the Iranian nation.
The Leader of the Imam (r.a.)
And this is the message of the speech delivered in the Scriptures, and those who have been gathered together in traditions. In the arena of denominations, Imam Khomeini (r.a.s.).
In the arena of economic economy, Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was the result of his self-confidence, self-confidence and self-confidence and self-assuffici
Similarly, the teachings of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) demanded that we accept the world " s economic capacities, and we
The Iranian nation can reduce such an academic academic academic academic faith and remember its lofty Imam (r.a.).
The Iranian nation can continue.
In view of the capacities and capacities, we can continue to follow the path that has been created in the past 30 years and in this regard.
Of course, the issue of elections is the future.
Our dear brothers and sisters, the dear Iranian nation,
He is a manifestation of all these three faiths associated with our magnanimous Imam, which is a manifestation of faith in God
Our goal is to play our role in our country.
The Iranian people are responsible for this responsibility.
Similarly, it is a sign of trust for people, for example, for people to identify themselves as a manifestation of human culture, and the people are elected by government officials.
And it is a manifestation of trust, and anybody who casts his necks into the bottom of elections, and he will feel that he is able to make a contribution in the country for the sake of
This is a very important point.
Therefore, it is a manifestation of trust in God.
Anyone who will not support you from the guests - the eight-year-olds who are in the arena - should not be toward the Islamic Republic.
Therefore, it is not unreasonable to each of the other members of the Islamic Republic.
He himself enters the arena of elections, and those who have stood in the arena of elections - he is willing to accept the Islamic Republic and the way they are treated.
Then it is the second step that the issue is not to let the brothers and sisters - or the other of the brothers or sisters - make me benefit from the country and the rest of the country.
Our enemies outside the country, and they think that they will be a threat to this Islamic system.
Their goal is to re-crepare the elections, but they do not have the opportunity to say that the people have been slipped in the Islamic system. They
This is what the enemies of this nation hope.
But they should not get to know our people. The enemies of this nation have forgotten the day of Dey (30, when the people of Iran manage to show their support for the Islamic Republic in the year 13888 and the people think that they are opposed to the fitna of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In order to reduce the cover of this election, some scholars have organized themselves through the media.
On one occasion , they said that the elections were already organized, and they said that they did not speak in elections, at times they said that they didn " t believe in the eyes of the people.
No, they do not know our people, and they do not know our elections, and they do not understand the Islamic Republic's Guards Corps.
Is this possible in countries that are
In countries such countries, there are few excuses, and they are not able to democratically, but they are not able to support the logics and their illegitimates and their ethics.
There are other people who are not supported by the Zionists, who do not have the support of ethicating the blood of the world, nor can they enter the arena of elections.
They did not have the media with them, nor did they have
Therefore, it is the kind of person who will put an end to their fitnas.
In our country, there are few of our brothers who have been dead and who have not been martyred, and they will be
Where are these conditions achieved in all the world?
Of course the power is the only legal entity.
It is the basis for some to enter the arena of elections, and some cannot enter it.
The Law made it clear that the people who were willing to fulfill it - who was worthy of
This is the framework of the laws.
The enemies sitting on the side of the path of these things and say, "Well, they say, just as I have spoken, they are saying: "I will be found among the people who fear God will continue to stress these things."
But the Iranian nation will pay a competitive re-appearance for these people.
I would like to tell some of the followers of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
They may try to do whatever they see, but they do well to focus on what they see, and they want to do what is right.
They should pay attention to this point. I do not have any of the people who have been based on foreign media and are determined to say: " I am the best one of the children."
I would like to congratulate the minds of the brothers who were trying to awaken them, and they were righteous in speaking.
They did, but they did not mean that they did not mean it, but they did not mean it, neither were the government or the government.
They should not vote the meaning of the economy.
And now, it does not need to start out from the beginning, and thousands of laborers have been conducted.
Over the years, different governments have been managed to achieve great achievements.
These things should not be neglected.
All such things are not just the result of economic problems and the cost of productions, but we do not manage to achieve all these activities.
Of course, we should not hold back from such problems.
Similarly, there should not be an unrealities.
I would like to tell all the children what they did when they were in the late technical days, and they would not be ashamed of them.
If they are presented in the future, you will not be patient and try hard to fulfill the responsibility of the Islamic Revolution.
Do your best.
In our country and on the basis of the guidance of our government, the president of our country has the right to do with great power.
The fact that the leader of the Islamic Republic is a great source of power and truth.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps is one of the things he is doing in his hands. He is the one who has the power to organize laws, and he is able to use all those who speak to him in the country.
There are different events.
It is the limit.
It is the Law that will rule as a limit.
The Law was a bathlete.
The people who are speaking to the people should tell them what sort of things they need.
If they are prepared and prepared to tell others, they should make efforts in order to manage them in order to manage those who are taking advantage of the rules and managements.
Some have mistaken thinking that we are going to avoid the enemies so that they can reduce their offenses.
This is a mistake.
The enemies of the enemies were apparently due to the presence of the Islamic Republic because he was alive in the hearts and minds of the people of the country and on the occasion of Khordad, the death of the Imam (r.a.) because
This is the reason for this indignation.
If our nation stands firm and is firm, it will be likely that the need is to resolve the issues of economy, and today the enemies will be able to make progress in the presence of the Iranian nation.
Of course, what is important is our firm determination, faith, faith, and trust in God, and trust in his people, whether it is in the sense of justice or in the presence of a nation.
My dear children, the ten days of the people who are in a great test, I hope God, and I hope that the great test of the people will rise up.
Necessity or power is based on God and dignity.
Leader's Guards Corps - Khamenei.ir
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
To Effective Effecurities of Europe and North America
These events that happened in France and their capacities in other countries, and they made me feel that I should speak directly to you.
I speak to you, but you are young. I do not know your parents, but you are dear youthful of the future of the people and your nation. I will see that your hearts are full of knowledge.
I am not speaking of politicians, government officials, and I am not going to say that they have deliberately removed their politicians from the right path.
Speaking about Islam is particularly one of the things that you are present
Twenty years ago - from the time of the Trammammaton - has been determined to explain this great religion as a fear-inspiring religion.
Unfortunately, this situation has been a source of fear and stability (a.s.
I would not like to talk about different kinds of fragments and fears that have been presented in the hearts of nations in western countries.
If you go back from history, you will see that in a new history, they are curious about the injustices and injustices of the people of the nations and Muslim nations.
The history of Europe and America has denunciated himself in disgrace because of the worship of the people and the oppressive wolves of non-Israelites and those who were not Christians.
Medical scholars and teachers are among the shameful remorse of the blood that has been named in the form of Catholics and Protestants and the name of foreigners and tribals in the world.
The purpose of the bullying and other parts of this old system of things is not by nature, but it is not by nature what I am trying to ask your scientists when I am reluctant to find a few years or by the consciences of the people in the west.
Why are the consciences of people shown to the events in the history of the past few years not at present?
Why are people in need of understanding from such important ways in dealing with cultural and mental-regulating?
You yourselves know that the academic academic academic anti-faface and the kind of fear of the rest of the people is the result of a congregation and agressors.
I would like to ask you, Why are the old political systems returned to the fear of Islam and Muslims?
Why has the world " s system of things presently been able to reason against Islam?
What are some things that are thinking and teachings of Islam that can be a source of security for the great world, and what will they find in dishonoring the face of Islam?
Therefore, the first need is to ask the question and follow the goal of this great effort.
The second goal is to reform the re-appearance of such propaganda, and try to understand this religion, which is based on accurate teachings.
I do not know that he is aware of what I am using to know in the real sense of what is being a source of cowardice and that he is responsible for you. I do not know that he or she understands Islam, but what I am saying you should not let you
You should not let them introduce you to the traditions of those who are taking their positions as Islamic representatives.
You should understand Islam from its origin.
You understand Islam by means of the Holy Quran and by the life of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.) and by God " s faithfulness to him and his
I would like to ask you, You have read the Holy Quran in the light of the Holy Quran?
Have you carefully read the teachings of the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.w.a.) and his greetings be upon him and his Agene.
Currently, you have come to know that the Islamic Republic is not a source of information, nor is it
You ask yourself to ask the Islamic Republic, on the basis of teaching, and on the other side of the world's education, and he has taught the greatest and intellectual, intellectual, intellectual, and intellectual.
I say to you that you should not allow politicians and foolishness to deceit you from the truth, and he has removed the injustices of justice from you.
Now that the brilliant power of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps hastened, do not let yourself be sidetracked.
Even if there is nobody else, he will be full of this system of things, but any one of you can achieve justice in this regard.
Despite the challenges that have been presented between Islam and you young people is a real challenge, but this can help new questions in your hearts who are searching for accurate knowledge of the truth.
The answers to these questions will help you to identify some new truths.
Therefore, do not let this opportunity come to understand the truth of Islam to you, so that you should pay attention to this responsibility in your own hearing, and the nations of the nations should write the history of this kind of vigilance and the events of the west have made without sufferings.

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
The Great One Dak Dad Ahmadine (Allah)
Over the past eight years as the Leader of the Islamic Republic and the talents that you have acquired in this regard.
Sayyid Ali Khamenei
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on April 20, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with a
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and greetings be upon our Leader and our Prophet, and upon his immaculate household, especially the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.).
I thank God from the midst of my heart that He has given me a different opportunity to interview you dear people, the honorable people of Mashhad or those who visited him, the dear brothers and sisters of this holy city of Eid al-Kubra (s.a.).
I would like to congratulate the excitement of Nurouz, I hope that this year we entered will be a year full of divine blessings and a source of joy for all the people of Iran.
There are other points that I like to talk about in this meeting with your dear brothers and sisters.
The first point is to look at what happened to us, on our people, our people , our country , and the things that have affected us in the world arenas and in the arenas of this region
Our goal is to discuss the issues that happened in the year 1390, especially the achievements of the Iranian nation in this year.
The leaders of arrogance and self-confidence and academic power and self-confidence. They used their power, and they were powerful and powerful.
Anyone who follows the propaganda efforts of the Iranian nation can see such efforts and make progress in the arena of economic capacities, economic, political, and other factors that threaten the Iranian people to stand firm in the arena of progress and progress in the arena of progress.
In fact, they want to democratically that they can fight against the magnanimous Imam (r.a.) teaches us, and the Revolution has given us the power to say that we should expect the people of the nations and that you should not know that you are able to do something else.
They made a lot of efforts to achieve this goal. They
I want everyone to realize that they hope to see the Iranian nation go on the path and that they have made their progress in the eyes of the world and that the enemies will be able to do so.
Our goal is to say that the Iranian nation has managed to use such power and that the Iranian nation has not been able to do so.
Of course we are not injured, but we are weak in the arena of weakness.
We gave the year 1390 (r.a.) named the year 1390), and this year the year was about economy.
The actions of the officials of the country and the people in the arena of economic arenas that have been bestowed by the people for years.
Among the things that can be said in this regard is the goal of managing the government.
The enemies of the economy, are part of the pre-Christian governments or they have insisted that this political system should be carried out in the country.
Of course, this event has been associated with the situation of the past, but the situation has continued to be different from the problems that have been held in. But the government and
But what has been done to the officials of the government - that is, in the government or in the government - and the people have supported and have played an important role model.
All of our people have heard them, but this is a great responsibility.
One of the purposes of this arrangement is to separate from government officials in righteousness.
Later in a discourse I explained that this is the result of different kinds of policies between different sects of the country.
I have been able to learn from different parts of the country that shows that this has influenced the life of the ungodly among society.
This is one of the goals of this system of things.
Another goal is to improve the financial system of things.
Basically, the economy of economic hardship - which all of them have been able to make progress in this system of things.
Another goal is to use discipline.
As a result of divine blessings, we are familiar with the idea that our magnanimous laborers are not being noticed.
As we use these blessings, it is possible to say that the heavens and all the nations of the world are still alive.
You should know that if it is not until now, it is not the best way to manage it.
When it is not necessary to achieve material wealth in a household, what must we do?
The Iranian nation should be on the side of the enemies and our enemies.
But the results of this work have been achieved, but they have achieved victory in the arena of resistance.
This was the work that was done in the past 1390. When our enemies
But the young people in our society have been zealous, and they have gained the victory of the enemies.
One of the most important work that has been done in the past, the result of the zeal of the people is what has been done in the arena of knowledge and technology.
Of course, knowledge and technology is one of the source of economic economy.
When a nation acquires knowledge and advances in modern technology, it will achieve wealth and achieve political powers, it will become a source of wealth and power.
Because of the importance of progress and artistic progress, I make it a point to this important point.
I would like to congratulate all the other aspects of the country, and I can tell you that the future progress of the country is not near.
According to the report of worldly educational organizations that have been accepted - which is not our educational organization - is the best time to progress in the world.
In the year 1390, Ayatollah Khamenei, which was about 2011, reported the educational systems in 2011 - the three months that the Iranian nation had made progress in the year 1388 and was in progress.
This was the case when the enemies of the Iranian nation managed to discontinue the Iranian people and
In the past, the Iranian nation is the first one in the arena of knowledge, and it is the seventh world of knowledge.
It is a report of some people who have been present at the beginning of the year 1390 " s and that we have made progress in Nanonoviations and in the technology of the country.
This vigilance was the case in the year 1389 of America and some other explosion before they gave us
It is necessary to establish a baseless role model for us,
They placed a number of speculations in order to deliver us, saying that we should send a foreign assignment to foreign countries; but we trust in it.
The Brazilian and Turkey came to be with our government officials, and they signed a written agreement.
But after the letter of the United States had dropped away from him, they did not want to take sides of the champion, and they wanted to use some of it and use it as much as they could.
As a result of the lack of vows made by the United States, the government of Brazil and Turkey was humiliated. This was the case of the economy of $ 20 percent.
In the past 30 years , they were able to bring about 20 percent of the nuclear negotiations and informed the world, and our enemies entered into the disapproval.
Even though they knew that the center of Tehran was based on medical advances - that is to pay attention to the needs of the patients and thousands of patients - and even if they denied it. They
It is our youth.
It is the work of suffering and suffering, but this is the process of progressing in different sports.
This was the event that occurred in the year 1390.
In a short time, the Russians and I used to call him in France, and I was determined to give him a young and a third and a half, Russian, and I was among them, and I used to call him on him, and I used to call him, and I would give him to our youth.
This was the case in 1390.
The presence of a number of mercenaries and six times, as well as the formalities of foreign products and the kind of services made by the Iranian nation, all of them managed to
These are part of the achievements that have been experienced in the year of the economy of economy.
These are the progress of knowledge, progress, progress, and production and materials that point to knowledge, but all of them have a clear influence on the economy of the country.
By the end of the year 1390 - that is the last week of the year 1390.
I have seen many of the things that have been progressed in different areas of knowledge, which can be observed even in other areas. Therefore, one cannot say that this progress is not limited.
The first step is to have a basiji spirit and a mental attitude that is based on the hearts of those who are
They are exposed to their behavior and spirituality. They are like those who fight against it, just like those in the arena of divine action.
There are differences between people who are working towards sincerity and because of social status, social status, or social backgrounds and those who are working
This is a very valuable and
The second is to say that our government officials have been forced to revolt the sanctions that our people have
During the last days of my life, some people showed that we are thankful for the God they have placed.
I feel that the sanctions that the enemies have placed us as opportunities and value.
The third factor that I witnessed was that of a great concubine.
Some parts of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps are not limited to the popular culture.
For many years, we need to teach her in the arena of labor and intelligence.
But if I realize that they are determined to say that we are in a position to do so, they
This kind of trust between a nation and other youth is very valuable.
Another characteristic is that of trusting young people.
This is because the work is in the hands of young people.
Youths are a source of insight and understanding.
Another characteristic is the relationship of students and officials.
I would like to congratulate the government officials who were familiar with the previous governments to try to get a closer relationship with the officials and the officials.
Fortunately, I was convinced that this was the beginning of the Revolution.
Of course this is the case when it is necessary to achieve knowledge in the arena of scientific progress and in the arena of our scholarships.
This economy was in the year 1390, and the year when its enemies suddenly turned down the negotiations. Sometimes they threaten the pressure of politics, and sometimes they try to break the sanctions.
Now the US Presidents are trying to deprave the people of Iran. They are trying to
There are other important victories in the year 1390.
The identity of the Islamic meetings, the Palestinians, the meetings of weapons, and the international economy, the youth and youth who are among the things that have been held in Tehran.
The Islamic Republic is one of the things that Muslims have returned to, and they have awakened.
In the economic fields, thousands of homes and homes have been built in economic arenas.
This is a manifestation of great importance. Increased homes have been built in a regional arena.
These are the things that have been created in these years have continued to prove justice.
In spite of these enemies, the enemies and the wicked are determined, but this nation has stood firm and prepared its progress.
Of course, it is necessary to realize that it is not until now that the elections are finished. I hope that the people will bring their nation together in the future when they will be elected.
This elections is very important.
I would like to tell you, and I said that the six months of the year 1388 were trying to kill a nation so that they could not get out of the country.
They sometimes say that they will be exasperated. Sometimes they say that if they have turned their enemies away from the Iranian nation, they have managed to dissuade different propaganda in order to prevent people from escalating.
During a period of time, one of our scholars - one of the past six months and six months - has been the goal of the people to kill them.
Over the past ten years, the number of people during the time of the elections of the rules of the elders and the representatives of the Americans (a.s.) did not reach the peaks of 40 percent.
Therefore, compare this with the Iranian nation - look at the capacities that have been imposed on the people - at that time for the issue of openness.
By such pressures, by such pressures, such as sports and threats and threats, the 12th day of Espand and the esteemed members of the Assembly of Iran should be divided among the people and the Islamic Republic.
This elections should be a source of information and power.
They have been exposed to the news of the past experiences in Iran, and they tell the news about the realities, but they do not have access to this election.
It is the case with the eyes of people.
This election was just like a powerful tool foregleams to clarify the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic for the rest of the world.
These are the events that happened in the year 1390.
These are some of the achievements of the Iranian nation in the year 1390.
Since the nuclear issue has been introduced, the enemies have become familiar with it.
Of course they knew that they knew that Iran is not interested in nuclear weapons.
This is true of us, and we will not seek out nuclear weapons. We do not know that they are doing so, but they do know that they are not doing so.
What is the difference?
The following is the firm determination of the Islamic system to safeguard the wealth of the Iranian nation.
The future - such as the firm determination of economic and political powers, political and scientific advances - have been the kind of self-appearance.
For many years, this is a manifestation of trust.
The arrogant powers knew that their life was based on fame and oil.
When they have lost sight of this well-being, they have to feel that they are in need and that they are faced with a great deal of hardships.
For six years, some nine years, they have to make use of the capacities and other countries in advance.
The US, now in charge of $ 30 billion, and the calculation of our scholars - who have placed their trust in the number of Americans - has been added to 20 years of age.
At that time they were to rely on the feat of the Persian Gulf that was out of the Persian Gulf and 50 percent of the world " s population.
At that time, they would rely on the three quarters of our region and the seas that were enlightened.
In the world of all countries - not just the Persian Gulf, but the Gulf and the Gulf of Iran - is the greatest and more important Islamic Republic.
In some countries, some countries are far more effective than ours.
In the latter part of the Gulf, we belong to the second part of the world - from which we are blessed, and we are far more successful in the arena of the economy.
This is the focus of the countries that are using.
He has been present for ten years, but the Islamic Republic of Iran has been noted for the blessings that have been revealed in the past few years.
And what of the arrogant powers want?
They want this country to be ruled by a government and a system that will be like a few other countries in the hands of other countries. They have a gift. They
If in Iran, which is a prominent figure in Iran, is the kind of policies that have been held by a so-called arrogance government who has stood firm in the economy and is determined to
The people who think that if we take a firm stand against the issue of nuclear war, the United States will bring the end of the war, and they will certainly see that they are indifferent from this
The problem is not a matter of nuclear problems.
There are countries that have nuclear weapons, but they do not care about them.
Therefore, the issue is not a matter of nuclear weapons, nor is it a matter of human responsibilities.
The problem was the Islamic Republic who stood firm in the face of a lion.
If the Islamic Republic is present, it is like other countries of the regional countries that will prove to be policies for its people.
The problem is the kind of arrogance that they
Of course the Americans make mistakes.
It is a serious mistake to think that by exercising firm determination and threats, the Islamic Republic of Iran will be forced to resolve from the arena of the Islamic Republic.
Of course, we do not let their people know of the calamities that they can heal in the arena of blessings.
They do not want their nations to understand what they are awaiting according to their situation. They do not want to tell the nations about these things.
They expected that they would not be able to do so.
I would like to inform you, Your dear brothers and sisters, and you dear people of Iran, and I would like to tell you and all the people of Iran, and they are in a weak state.
I do not want to set excuses and clarifications as well as other experiences as I would like that of the
Look at the US President is the result of his pregnancy.
What is meant by nature?
It is that we are present in a situation that we are living in a real situation, and I want to change this situation.
If this is the case, it is not possible for the people to enter the arena in the arena of elections, but the people of America and they have not managed to discriminate themselves.
The effect of this embodied in the people of the country was a manifestation of the behavior of the Americans. When this man stood up and stood up, the Americans were very bad and promised him to bring them back.
Therefore, it is clear that the situation is a bad situation.
I didn " t want to say this, and the Americans showed themselves that they were involved.
This is what the man sees, and this man is at the end of the kingdom.
Has it been possible to change this dangerous situation?
This debt is equivalent to what they do in the home.
This was a serious problem for a foreign country.
This is the case of the political situation: They were forced to leave Iraq without defeat. In Afghanistan, even every day of their situation was extremely bad.
Muslim countries in Egypt, in northern Africa, Tunisia, U.S. President
Basically, we see the Commander of Wall Street that was present in the United States.
Is this a good situation?
Therefore, America is in a very difficult situation.
The Americans were threats to other countries, and they bowed down.
I would like to announce that I did not have nuclear weapons, but we would not protect ourselves from any enemies against us, neither would we respond to the attack of the enemies.
The Holy Quran assures us: "Tovers and those who are taking the lead among you and who have turned their back on them, but they will not get
The path of God, which is awakened from the presence of this system of things, and you will not receive divine assistance (a.s.) and help the oppressors of their oppressors).
No one else in the Holy Quran (s.w.a.) said that if you start to attack, you will be successful. You will be conquered and you are defeated.
But (Allah) promised that whenever the enemies attacked you, they would likely be defeated.
This should not be expected to happen at the beginning of Islam. No, " the divine blessing of God that has awakened from the presence of the enemy, and you will not be able to draw closer to God."
The Iranian nation has made a firm resolve for all these things and has no intention of attacking a foreign country, but it is connected with the love of its people, her wealth, and Islam, and the Islamic Republic of Islam and its power.
That is to say, when you make use of domestic products, you help the Iranian people to do the work of progress and help the Iranian nation achieve progress.
This unforgettable culture - which can be expected to result from other areas of our nation - to use foreign products - is a serious problem for our future and future.
Each of us has a duty to support and strengthen our domestic products.
Therefore, today the officials have a good example in their hands. They can use this to strengthen domestic products.
They are a nation - those who are weak or who are able to do work - one of them should move on to action.
You should be interested in the productions of domestic products.
It is not presumptuous and a mistake to be extremely proud of foreign products, in our home, in the things we need, and in our daily needs and in the things that have been created in the country.
I felt that some of the productions were carried out in the country, and I noticed that some of the facilities were returned.
If they were sold, they would not want them, but they had a sign of the French economy.
The presence of domestic production is a very important point.
In the arena of management, the management of the management is one of the main aspects of the people.
Dear brothers and sisters in all the country, we need determination and work together.
There are many discords and discharges.
Sometimes one point is related to the idea that two people view the issue as different. But this should not be the cause of discord.
On one occasion, this person has a different viewpoint, and someone else has a different opinion should not be a source of discord.
The Holy Quran reads us: " You should not fight until your knees does not get weaker." [The Holy Quran, 8:46) If we
In the past years, the result of the discord between us and our enemies has been disgraceful.
The Commander of the Faithful (a.s.) teaches us, saying: "We know know what is true, but he does not make a mistake injurious and unless he finds it."
He wants the Islamic Republic to love and love the Islamic Revolution and to love the religion and Allah the Exalted, but he does not make a mistake.
He is different from the kind of person who is familiar with the Islamic system and is heading with the Islamic system.
His heart is to say that these present-day experiences of the media and the media offer people to speak about each other.
The root of the issue is that we should personally recognize that we should respect the laws of the Islamic personality.
Of course, it is not necessary to dismiss such statements as something that some people should be accused of misguided and discorded and
I would like to congratulate all the dear youth of the country and I would like to congratulate all the youth of the country, I would like to congratulate all the youthful people, and I would like to call all the people of Islam and all the good qualities of Islam.
It is necessary to honor the law.
The Islamic Republic's Guards Corps is one of the goals of the Islamic Republic.
The same is true of the officials of Iran.
The government honors the members of the government, and the government officials should honor government officials.
This does not mean that all of them should think and think that if they have
I hope that this year 1391 will be one of the years that has begun, and the people of Iran will be happy for the Iranian nation.
Dear God, the blessedness of Muhammad, the blessedness of Muhammad and his household, make sure of our dear youth, our honorable people on the right path.
Dear God, disappoint the enemies of this nation.
You should pay attention to this lofty and firm determination to the goal of the future. Make the heart of the Imam of the Age agreed, and let us pray in his prayers.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2013 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
God " s faithfulness was based on Siddith Sheol, Fatima , the Holy Prophet of the Holy Prophet of God, and the loyalty of God to resurrect her father and children.
I would like to congratulate all the dear brothers and sisters who have attended this great meeting.
I hope Allah the Exalted will prepare our hearts and our tongue to benefit from his blessings.
This is a good example for me that each year on the occasion of Norouz, and I would like to congratulate the people, and I would like to congratulate the destiny of the country and observe the events that have taken place in the future.
You should know that our dear brothers and sisters, our people, our people, are not blind to the things we have seen and showed by them. Some of the people who are
There are other nations that are benefiting from our experience. They look at the conditions of the Iranian nation, and they will rejoice over any success we have experienced.
If we have achieved victory, they feel that they have succeeded, and if they have achieved victory, they will feel that they have defeated us.
And there are some people in the world who are looking at our activities, but these disagreements are the first time.
They wished to be the people of Iran.
They have always been able to manage all the current events of the country, and they have all the advantages of the country.
Then the Islamic Revolution came to the knees of their hands.
Therefore, they were opposed to the Revolution, and they were opposed to
Therefore, we are responsible for a number of human perfection.
Therefore, when we look at our future and future achievements, our future and our future will be brighter.
Some of our people were looking at the conditions of the country and did not
What they see in less expensive materials, the remnant of domestic products and the pressures of the enemies.
I have different opinions.
When I look at the conditions of our country and look at the challenges of the people, I watch the Iranian people succeed in this regard.
Of course, there are problems and problems that exist in the country. There are many things that are not common in the world.
The experienced woman who was behind the crimes of the United States, recivenge said that we wanted to congrete the sanctions of the Islamic Republic.
I would tell them what they did in the future, and I would tell them what they did.
Therefore, one aspect of the plots of the enemies in the arena of the economy that the Iranian nation played in the face of the enemies, and there is a great opportunity to show that the Iranian nation has acquired insight and capacities.
When a person looks at the scene, it is like sports that arenas, an experienced experienced experienced, but it is the only one that will disapprove the success of the people and should listen to them.
This is a great achievement in the presence of our
Anyone who looks at this stage is well-searched, and he will listen to the Iranian people, just as we have seen in the world's feelings, including those countries that oppose the Iranian nation.
There are politicians, government officials and all those who know where the world is and who observe the situation, all of them feel that the Iranian people are interested in the Iranian nation.
It is necessary to look at all the efforts that have been made throughout the country and the results of their efforts.
Who are these people?
Later, I would get brighter.
The enemies who do not wish to see the Iranian nation achieve such progress in all areas. The first is to say that they should do all the things they can to see the Iranian nation achieve such progress.
They should do this by relying on the sanctions, by taking advantage of the opportunities of government officials and other activities, by taking sides of the world and by taking a firm stand in the media.
The president of the United States, the president of the US President, spoke of the economy of the economy. He was speaking of
He said that the dignity of the Iranian nation is not present, but there are economic problems.
But he did not speak of the good things that had been done in the country, nor did the great achievements of the Iranian nation have achieved in the past 30 years. We faced
This was the year 1391, and it was one of the years that our enemies had overcome with their policies.
They said that we would like to confuse the Iranian nation by democrating them.
Therefore, if the Islamic Republic stands firm, it will stand up and progress.
Therefore, if they are unable to do so, they should not allow them to do so. If they
Today these two activities are not like a child. They are trying to stop
We said that there are enemies.
Who are these enemies?
I would like to congratulate the Iranian nation.
The answer to this question is not a problem.
Today the Iranian nation has returned to the US government throughout the past 30 years.
It is good for the American officials to realize that the length of the past 30 years and that the Iranian people have seen some of the things that they have named as well as their hearts to return to the United States.
This is a very important point that each member of the world should pay attention to this event and its point.
They are the center of these foes and their enmity.
Of course, there are other enemies, but we do not see them as enemies.
The Zionists were enemies, but the Zionists did not stand out as enemies of the Iranian nation.
At times, the officials of Israel were threatening us and threatening us, and they were threatening us, but they knew that if they did not know, they knew that if they knew that if they did not know, they would be reproached.
The government of England was also independent of the Iranian nation.
England was one of the enemies of the Iranian nation.
It is the government of England that does not have its own support, but it is not the result of its independence.
There are other governments that show enmity.
I would like to tell that in the recent years of the government officials, I would like to explain their enmity to the Iranian nation.
A person is particularly aware of what is right, and he should not return to the person who has not been slapped as an enemy.
We did not have a problem with the government and our country in France, for years, and we did not have a problem in this time. However, this mistaken actors and the people were awakened from the days of Nazazy and the government has continued to progress.
This is a mistake, and a lack of reasoning and reasoning is essential.
When speaking, the Americans say that the world is full of production. They have named some of the politicians in the world, which are Americans, the Zionists and other countries.
In the past 1391, we should know that since the beginning of the year 1391, the USSS had begun to make a new plot.
From the beginning of this year 1391 they began to place a great foundation on the Iranian nation.
They are opposed to their enmity, but they wish that the Iranian nation will not know that they are enemies and that they are not
During the past few years in this regard, Alien-Modeen-fashioned Ali (a.s.) in the first century, I said that you should not ignore the fact that you would like to have the privilege of taking part in a foreign country - you would like to
The US government has placed some people with special people to speak to the world, and they go to the countries and talk with the heads of the nurses in order to see that they are not content with the economic, economic, economic, economic, economic, economic, economic, and economic goals of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
They should pay attention to their vigilance and establish a relationship with the Islamic Republic.
They began this work since the beginning of 1391, especially from Mordad, where they had been persecuted.
I would like to say - in the past few months - the Americans say that the Americans say that I am convinced that I am convinced that the restrictive sanctions were not involved.
Our wealthier experienced the problem of relying on the economy.
We must divide our economic and security. We should try to cooperate with them.
For the past seven years , I told the government that they should do something whenever we would like to cover our logics.
At that time, some who were in charge of the policies said that this was a good thing.
Of course, it is necessary to do something and to protect it.
Whenever the economic economy gets involved in a unique position, the enemies are determined to focus on this goal.
The sanctions have influenced, but they are not influenced by the forces of the enemies.
I would like to discuss the issue of economy in the arena of economic activities, and then the enemies did all they could to see that they were separated from the Islamic Republic as they said.
They should not allow the Islamic Republic to influence and its politics in this region.
They disagree with what they want to do.
Our brothers and sisters were not in two parts of the world of all nations.
All of them are very familiar with the Iranian people.
They tell us this, and they tell us that they have discussed the events that they have discussed, and the nations believe that after they have returned home.
That is to say, the differences of the enemies of the Iranian nation hopes.
They bravely achieved any influence.
In the arena of politics, their goal is to place this sanction in the hearts of the Iranian nation on the path of the people, and they will discord the people and the Islamic system.
On the 22th of Bahman, the Iranian nation gave them across the Revolution and showed their love for the Islamic system and the Islamic Revolution.
In the arena of security, they have done all they can to corrupt the health of the country, which government officials have been able to bridle the light of these events in the media.
In the arena of the region, they have tried to bring the end of the Islamic Republic.
In the arena of the regional countries, they have proved that there is no problem in which the region can be solved without the presence of Iran and approval of Iran.
Depending on the attack of the Zionist regime, the Zionist regime was after the opening policies of Iran, and the Zionist regimened in the hands of the Palestinian resistance.
They said that they did not tell us - that if the presence of the Islamic Republic and its power, the Palestinians cannot stand in front of the righteous nation, they did not say anything about it.
This is because during the eight-day period of the Palestinian times they have gained a victory against the righteous nation of Israel.
I said that the efforts they made were not to be influenced; I accepted it, but he was on the side of the economy and brought us a great victory.
That is to say, the sanctions of the Iranian nation and the experience of the people and they have managed to make great achievements. If they did not
Our young ones have experienced many of the achievements that they have not experienced. In the arena of labor, which I will use to explain, 1391 we have progressed in the past years.
There are many progresses, in the arena of production, innovative, innovative areas, in the arena of production, innovations, innovative areas, in the arenas, in the arenas, in the arenas, and in the arenas that have improved their economy.
We found great progress in the arena of knowledge in 1391.
In the arena of knowledge and art, in the past year 1388, there are many good things that will bring joy to people who have faith in the future.
That is to say, in the year that they like to congratulate the Iranian nation, but we can see him, our dear youth and our dear youth and our dear youth who have worked in the days of Nahid, and I have been sent to the expansion of the universe by Peshgam.
When the creation of this living creature was transferred to heaven and returned to his soul and peace, the world of scientists in the world demanded that this be a great surprise for them.
But after the truth was revealed to everyone, they saw that they did not have a chance.
In health and medical matters, the academic academic infirmities and medical advances have been created.
In the arena of nature, we have acquired a lot in this region.
There are great achievements, production, and management.
All these things have been done in this year after the Iranian nation was held in order to condemn them.
In this year, we were in the early stages in different areas of knowledge.
In the arena of knowledge and technology, the country has progressed in 30 percent.
In the year 1391, the prostitute was diagnosed with the Islamic Revolution.
That is to say, the number of our students - who were present in the late 20th and the students who were present in the arena of higher education during the last year.
This is a great blessing for the Iranian nation.
In the arena of water, as well as circumstances, innovations, innovations, innovative and innovations, the country has achieved great achievements.
All these things have been found in the year when the enemies of the Iranian people have done all they can to see the Iranian nation.
There are valuable lessons in the events that happened in the year 1391, and this lesson is that any nation living in life will be threatened by the pressures and pressures of the enemies.
It tells us and all those who are looking at the interests of Iran, that what is important to a nation is to rely on God, rely on Him, rely on him, and not on the enemies.
This is the future.
In the year 1391, it was another face-to-face with laborers.
Of course we understand our weakness. This is the characteristic of our
At that time, the soldiers were aware of their power, and they were injured in order to overcome him.
We understand our weakness.
This weakness originated with the dependability of our self-confidence - which I said that this was a weakness of weakness - the lack of self-confidence and the economic capacations that I have always experienced in life.
The government officials and officials who are present in the arena of government officials should pay attention to the future of the governmental officials in charge of the country.
Another important point is that the foundation of the country is a powerful source of power.
When a solid foundation is solid, he will not influence the plots of the enemies.
If the honorable government officials and such a solid foundation are aware of their responsibility, they will be able to return any opportunity to a foreign country, just as we have seen in the year 1391.
By Allah's favor, the world of our government officials and the people of the country have acted in the year 1391.
Of course economic goals are important and the main goal of the past. But the economic progress is not just a matter of importance, but the security of the people is essential and important. The progress of knowledge is the foundation of knowledge.
Therefore, if knowledge persists in an effort, then all other things will come in.
Political dignity and dignity are important, indifferent and indifferent.
In all these areas, we have progressed.
It is a protective part of the protective organs, and this is one of the
By means of such progress, our nation proves that the lack of the power of America does not mean turning back, but this is a very important event.
Dear God, the world powers and the world of colonial governments - are at the time of the sovereignty of the world - and the United States wants to show people of the nations that if you want a good and successful life, you should remain alert to the power of our power.
The Iranian nation proved that this was a lie.
Our people showed that the lack of self-confidence in America and other countries is not enough to make progress.
There are many other countries that have prepared themselves with America.
We have such experience as the past 30 years. See how the Islamic Republic has been
Anybody who fails to do so will realize that the lack of self-confidence and uncertainties of the world is a chance to a nation, not a threat.
Thankfully, the Iranian nation has been blessed with its power and knowledge.
In time, we managed to do so.
This is the case of the issue of twenty-embracing economy in Tehran.
This tacket demands twenty percent of the country, which we did not manage to enter.
They should make a lot of refuse, and they should try to force the Islamic Republic on
But even before the matter seems that it is possible for us to have problems until our youth, our youth and our youth have managed to bring about 20 percent of the fitna for what they need.
Our opposers do not expect us to do so.
But at the time our government officials understood this need, and they managed to strengthen this Iranian nation.
When they think that the Islamic Republic will come in their presence, and they will not let them know that they are in their late techn
If our youth and our youth are not doing this work, they will manage to democratically and expanse the cost of explosors that we have traveled to
The people of the country discovered this, and they realized that they did what they should do.
Therefore, it is necessary to achieve victory. It is necessary to be a governmental system in all the events that are related to the country. I should
This is the goal of research.
If they are to make scientific and educational work, they are all of them in this regard.
The responsibility of all of us is to try to build the country in a way that is not controlled and influenced by the enemies.
We are safeguarded. This is one of the economy of resistance.
In economy of resistance, one of the most important social compensations is the source of economic threats.
It is necessary for economic hardship to be a threat. It is necessary for him to avoid all kinds of threats from the enemies.
This is the first point that I should tell you.
The second point is that the Americans repeatedly send us to discuss the issue of nuclear problems. They send us to discuss the issue of the nucle
In a number of times, they tell us that you are present in the arena of the economy of the economy, the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran should join me in a contelligence of the nuclear
Why?
This is not the case of our experience.
What they mean is to say, let us discuss what we say.
Therefore, when we announce that this is not a matter, it is necessary for Iran to make it a point.
I don " t have any hope for the things they say, but I do not stop it.
Well , there are other topics that must be avoided:
The first point is that the Americans are repeatedly sent to us, and sometimes they send us, and they tell us that we are not doing the will of the Islamic government.
Our answer is that we do not care about the goal of Islamic Republic or the will of Islam, nor do you know that you are not determined to replace this Islamic system.
At that time, you are determined to follow the Islamic Republic and openly say that you are not able to do anything in the future.
The second point is that the Americans are telling us that we are honest in the matter.
That is to say, we are interested in discussing and discussing the appropriate issues.
I say to them: " We have often told you that we do not have the idea of getting closer to the front of the people, but you say that you do not agree.
What is the reason for us to believe what you are saying?
When you are present, you are not prepared to accept a clear and clear statement, and there are other reasons why we should accept what you have said during the times that you have proved their discord in this regard.
Our understanding of this advice is based on the fact that the Americans are introducing the introduction, a way that is misleading and enlightened by the world and the people of our country.
You should make sure that this is not the case.
Are you able to make sure?
I would like to tell that I would know that the Americans were not at a time when they said that some people were able to visit the Americans and speak to the Americans.
This is a fantasy of propaganda, and it is a
Now there is no one of the points that he has discussed with them.
The third point is that our understanding, our experience, our experience and our sense of identity is that the Americans do not want to end the nuclear issue.
The Americans do not want to end the nuclear negotiations and solve this problem. If they want to end its end and solve the problem, the path is a path that is open.
The main goal of the nuclear negotiations is to accept the responsibility of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps.
Of course, the Iranian nation has the responsibility to achieve peace in the country and its own interests.
This is a great hope. We do not want it.
They tell us that we are anxious that you will be like the nuclear path.
They are the people who have mentioned their names. They call themselves on the name of the world.
They say that the world is in need.
No, the countries of the world are not independent.
Most of the countries of the world support the Islamic Republic and the need for it.
They accept the responsibility of re-appearing the Islamic Republic, and they may try to eliminate this problem with the rules of the nuclear war veterans.
Whenever we are close to the solution, the Americans make a firm stand against this path.
Their goal is to make sure that they continue to make progress in the face of pressures.
Such pressures, such as they themselves say, the Iranian people are not able to confuse the Iranian nation
I would like to introduce them by the end of this issue.
This is the way: The Americans will vanish the end of the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation.
If they want to end their problems - just as they say, they want to fight against Iran and the United States - to jump the end of their oppressors.
For the past 30 years, the Iranian people were exposed to the illegitimate sculations of the Iranian nation.
Since the first year of the Revolution and the establishment of the Islamic government, they have been kind to us.
In the arena of security, they have managed to protect our defenses. They have managed to fight against us, and they have supported our dear enemies for years, and they have managed to protect our economy.
Therefore, I would like to call the officials of the United States. If they are careful, they will correct their politics, and they will bring their attention to the end of the Iranian nation.
I have to say that the matter of the importance of elections is the most important thing.
A country is a manifestation of political action.
He is a manifestation of political weakness. He is a manifestation of the identity of the Islamic Republic. He is a manifestation of the identity of the Islamic Republic.
He is a manifestation of democracy, a symbol of Islamic democracy.
Therefore, paying attention to the importance of the elections is to let the enemies of the Iranian nation go throughout the elections.
They have planned to prevent the people from going through the elections, killing them and making them stand.
Over the years, we have spent the elections - the elections of the Majlis (s.w.a.), and our enemies have tried not to explicit the advantages of the country.
Let me tell some things about the elections, but there are two months
But now I would like to talk to other things.
First of all, the issue of elections is that the presence of the people and their generates are very important.
The presence of the people at that time can reduce the influence of the enemies.
Our nation should know that the honorable presence of the Iranian nation will have a positive effect on the country
This is the first point. By Allah's favor, divine assistance and the efforts of the Iranian nation, it is a great achievement for the people
The second point is that all denominations and religious groups should enter into the elections of the Islamic Republic.
This is the responsibility of everybody, and this is a responsibility.
I am not a singlebody or a political athlete.
All those who exercise faith in the Islamic Republic and from the people of this country have to make progress in this regard.
In addition to the elections, it is appropriate for those who are opposed to this system.
The third point is that the concept of the people is the result of the elections.
You should know that it is the best way to get to know the identity of those who have
I do not have a single hour.
I would like to congratulate the other people, and I would like to congratulate it.
It is the kind of person who is caring for the secretary of the academic people who pay attention to the council of elections, and they realize that they should not be unsteady.
If someone says this, it is not true.
Of course, in these days, we will not hold back from telling the news that has been held in different events.
It is one of the thousands of people who have worked.
I was told that they were a few days of elections, and millions of such things were held in the days of elections.
Be careful not to congratulate such things.
Of course, nobody or politicians may try to attract the minds of other people into the world - but they do not know anything about me.
They can help and help one another to identify the best person.
Of course the principle is the concept of the people.
The following is that the events related to elections and those who are not prominent, all should submit to the law.
What happened in the year 13888, and after the elections of the president of the country - which has been corrupted by a lack of respect for the law of others.
It is the idea that people are familiar with what I want, but I should respect them.
It is necessary to show honor to the superiority of the nation.
It is necessary to use these legal methods.
We should call people on the streets because what happened to us - just as it happened in the year 1388 - that is to say, it is one of the unforgivable people who have not been lost.
This is a lesson for the Iranian nation, and the people of Iran will stand firm
The final event is that everyone should know that what we need from the president of the country is the good things that they do not have with what is bad.
Each of us should know that the present-day leader should have a good effect on the actions of the president of the country, but not with its weakness.
Everybody is in a weak and infirm position.
The leaders - now that I am or who will come in the future - have a lot of power and weakness.
The Leader of the Islamic Revolution's Guards Corps should be among the things that are present in the arena of governmental power and leader.
That is to say, it is necessary to be among our governments, and those who are present to go to them, and they must be on guard against each other.
The people who are prepared to enter this arena must enter into all their power and rely on God and for relying on the capacities of this nation.
Dear God, bestow Your blessings on this nation.
Dear God, make the immaculate soul of the Imam of the Age (a.s.).
Dear God, make the heart of the Imam of the
Dear God, make your gift of free will
Leader’s Speech to Members of the Islamic Revolution - Khamenei.ir The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with members of the economic economy.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
First of all, I am thankful to the honorable brothers and sisters who are carrying out their economy in different economic areas.
On the other side of the meeting is a manifestation of the significance of the significance of this system of things.
We wanted to have a new day in the country of Continual activities, and I was determined to pay attention to the issues of the government officials and to pay attention to these things.
This is the first point.
This is a good example for all. The government is a government in economic economy, and the economies are
The second point, which has been prepared for this meeting, is that the situation is not limited to those who are not authorized to introduce a report on the realities of the country
I did not say that I would always say that I would like to congratulate the people, but I knew that I had to believe that I should always be able to do so and that the government officials should pay attention to me, but the people
I want to tell you that I am close to the people. I want to tell you that I am close to the people.
These things that I have discussed in different areas - which I have written and will be prepared for a report in the past - the past of the past of human history.
This is a source of pride for the Iranian nation.
It is the progress of the Iranian nation.
We have made good progress in the arena of production, in the field of service, in different fields, in scientific and other areas of knowledge.
It is a good thing for people to hear such things from government officials.
It is good for all of us to realize that this is one of the ways in which the enemies of the Iranian people are killed. I well know that this is a lot of time.
What is not to say should not be the kind of death of an ambitious and impoverishable laborer.
It is necessary to feel that we have a lot of progress, as an example, and there are 40 percent of
The first point is that we have placed the year 1390 in charge. The name of
The arrogant powers are the harm of the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic in economic arenas.
Although they had a great deal of nuclear issue in order to achieve economic sanctions, it was not the cause of the nuclear sanctions.
You can recall that when they placed the sanctions in the first century, it was the beginning of the sanctions that they had placed in the country, even when there were no nuclear talks in the country.
Although it was not an important restriction, it was not until now that his name was the most important restrictions and the name of "theism" - which was a source of sanctions which had been promoted in the US President.
The objective of the sanction is the secretary of the economy.
Of course, it was proud that the Iranian nation had been coping with the sanctions.
Although they were not in the past, they were opposed to the sanctions, but the result of the efforts of different kinds of progress in the country had not been returned to the past 30 years.
Therefore, it is necessary to be prepared.
Of course this requires action.
He is not a movement.
A popular movement is one of some characteristics.
The stress of this sincere efforts is one of the main reasons for being vigilant, and it is one of the
Such a movement is his name.
Therefore, the economy refers to the movement that has been imposed on the Iranian nation and the goal of killing the enemies.
Another point is that in the process of progressing in a country, we management is one of the most important plans to manage the future in the most important areas of life. We should take a firm stand in this regard.
Other nations will not sit down to look at us for the first time, and they continue their movements.
Of course we are not using some of the methods that they use, and we will not use them. We are following the most holy path. But we have decided that this is the first step towards those who are taking the lead among us.
Therefore , this is a requirement for action.
It is necessary to make such progress and reflect on it so that we can reach the first position.
This issue is not just enough to see the first position and not that we are going to achieve the first position. No, the future of the people of the nations today depends on this issue.
If a economy is in the arena of economic progress, it is not possible to achieve what it means and progress, but it will continue to feel pity.
We do not want our oppressors.
For two years, our country has been infected with violence.
The evily of the ambitious rulers and the plots of the enemies are the result of this oppression.
From the late 1800 " s, England had been in charge to congratulate the political systems of the country and their mouths, and they have
The late 1800 " s was the first time of England to enter the country - which had come from India - at that time when the Indian army was in charge and the center of the reign was located - from the Badhrk of Brohrach and started to give a bribe to the people.
All these negotiations as well as the rulers and others, were quick to reach this person. Lair The enemies whose enemies have awakened from this country, and they have allowed the enemies of the unresponsive rulers to attack this country.
We do not want this to continue.
The Islamic Revolution created a large shield in front of them.
We want this large shield to be stronger.
We should not let them dictate that they should be extremely economy in our economic economy, our political, and our future.
One of the sources of this power is economically economically.
This is why we say that we should be vigilant.
I did not say that the Iranian nation had to be the first one in this region. No, for the future of this
Therefore, it is necessary to use all the powers that are being done in the country and try to foment in the heart of a child and influential, which is to be used in the arena of power and in the country.
We heard this and felt that this was the result of the progress of the country during the Revolution.
What happened in the arena of resistance in the country before the victory of the Islamic Revolution will not agree that this will happen.
The same is true of the events that have been set in different areas. The events that are taking place in the country are at a time, but they do not believe that they will happen in different areas, but they do know that they are coming before us.
I say that this is the result of the training I have received from different parts of the country.
This is a very important point.
Our economic capacities are important.
Sometimes I said that if the situation of our country is compared to the extent of our society and the people of the world, they will see that they are responsible.
And the people of the country are a source of material and material things, just as the people of the world can democratic and international arenas. Therefore, we should
These are important and valuable things.
For example, this event is more important than just present in the country and the situation is a short time, but it is possible to solve this problem by introducing appropriate research, which some of the brothers and sisters have spoken in the country.
Therefore, in fact, the country has a great blessing.
The same is true of our presence and our region.
We are one of the most important areas of life.
The two of us, including the weather and the weather and the weather and the regional region of Asia and Europe, are among the most important aspects of this region.
All these things are good for us.
Now, this is the point that we have been discussed in a few decades - that we have defeated the fitna for 20 years of progress.
That is to say, a number of years has been prepared to protect. The year is the beginning of five plans.
Of course many things have been prepared for years.
As the report of the introduction and they listen to it is that they are important, but they are not prepared to do so.
Earnestly, the governmental policies have been reassigned as well as the governmental policies of resistance, and political systems have been informed in 44 - all of which have been prepared to do with one another.
If we are able to do so, we can benefit from the blessings and blessings of those who are referred to.
Political forces can achieve achieve achievement and achieve economic progress.
Of course not, some of the goals that have been set out in order for years, there are other reasons why they have hindered their progress.
Such progress as 8 percent, as well as a lack of employment or a lack of income-taining products - which I discussed in the day - is a manifestation of all these things that I did not do.
This has been the case for the past five years in order to
In this law, we need to study in the arena of government and economic activities.
With the goal of establishing a economy, the goal of creating a economy that is accompanied by the economy
They calculated that the capacities for five years, each year had 160 billion calendar.
It is necessary to achieve this.
In the arena of the illegitimate system of things, it is not necessary to get well-payed, but it is not the only kind of achievement for our economic systems. We say that we are
Every time, there are good things and bad things.
For many years, I had to talk about the issue of fighting against the economy.
When I introduced this issue, some of them came to me to say that they were too busy to see the issue of economic hardship and they would be intimidated by the economy.
I would like to say that they are discorded.
If he realizes that the government is not going to ignore the law-appearances, he wants to pay attention to the law-appearances.
We are opposed to the honorable government officials, and we have management to make good use of the economy. We should
Fortunately, this is the fact that all or most of the economy of the economy and government officials of the economy are present in this regard.
They heard what they had said and heard - that is to say the positive aspects of the events that have been made or what they have referred to. I would like to tell you that you should pay attention to the things you have heard and think about them.
We should not allow the things that have been said to be safeguarded.
Of course, Hazrat said that he did not speak of the bad things that were being spoken, and why did they tell us when the decisions were made, this means that they were not conducted. This means that some of them were of their problems.
If these advice is not noticed, it is clear that they are good advice that they can study with their future. There are many things that I would like to discuss with these things, I would like to discuss two of these things from the organizations that they are referred to
First of all, the issue is the issue of management to achieve production. The issue is the issue of economy.
The issue of addressing the issue of government and the government is dependent on the daily needs and practices that have awakened in this regard, it should be noted for the support of the domestic products.
Although some of the government officials who spoke to them, they said that they did not need this 30 percent
The issue is the same in other areas, but it is necessary to give support to governmental organizations.
We should benefit from it.
Of course, they have a responsibility in this regard. But the
Some of the government officials brought me to tell that some of the patients did not come to see what they were able to do, but they used to use their old age.
It is necessary to pay attention to this issue.
Of course the government is an important point, and it is necessary to pay attention.
I would like to give such an opportunity, but I would like to discuss the points that they did not have.
It is necessary to face this issue with all self-confidences for honesthearted people and willing to do their work.
The following is the issue of production.
There is nobody who is opposed to material things; but there is a need to be prepared.
It is not a great reason to avoid letting go of time - just as the days near the festival is to be lost in the marketplaces, and it is not a great reason for us to explicit the paths we have entered.
It is necessary to pay attention to what is being done in the home.
Of course it is said that the bags and capabilities can help the domestic products. If the
I feel that this is not a source of power.
Democratically, the issue of production is particularly academic achievement. I feel that the issue of entering affluezation is a fundamental reason for a person to accept it.
In our farms, we have goods.
One of the teachers introduced a report on the fruits of the gardens and the fruits of the trees.
Our firm determination in this regard is one of the most distant part of the world.
We should increase our productions.
We should not take advantage of these materials as an example of Latin America and other countries as well as other countries.
The following is the issue of production.
Of course the government has a duty to help those who have managements.
Fortunately, this is the fact that our dear brothers and sisters mentioned in this meeting - that the products of the embodiments of the embodiments of the embodiments of our oil and the future will be satisfied. We hope that we will
It is our duty to reach our destination.
One of the most most difficult times in the economic economic and future wealth of our country is to rely on the sanctimony of resistance.
In the past years I said - although the government officials did not respond - we should reach our position even if we were to move to political issues and economically decide to leave our oil as an example for five days or a few months.
Look at the scene.
Today we are not able to do so, and we need these dear ones in the country.
During the economy of the economy, the Iranian nation and the Islamic Republic will have certain power in the world.
We should pay attention to this point. This is to say, it is necessary to help and support. It is necessary to
They have a responsibility in this regard. They have noted that they have a responsibility in this regard. These countries that have been referred to as the best of the materials that we have received - these are the experiences of other countries that have been imposed on them.
In the world, 50 years of age and fifty have been producing goods and selling them to those who have been trained and continue to achieve their goal.
As an example of a German company or Swisss estimated a few years of age, 50 percent of the goods are stored and selling it until now they have acquired goods in our country and in our country.
Why?
It is necessary to pay attention to these things.
This shows the need for a new culture, culture, and management
The issue of economic resistance is a very important point.
If this corrupt man had not found a corrupt man in a government that would help him, he would not have manage to make a lot of money for the economy.
Therefore, the government officials have a responsibility in order to prevent the economy of economic economy in governmental organizations.
As an example, when you realize that a certain illness has taken place in the fields, it is not possible for you to show mercy and sympathetic treatment. You know that if you know that this
This is the case with the economy.
If a member of the governmental organizations listens to or see a sense of economy - I speak to government officials - you should not give a message.
The economy of economic hardship is one of the most dangerous diseases and aggresors. Therefore, it is necessary to
One of the things is necessary to prepare well for the future.
We need a firm determination in the arena of resistance.
Just as one of the brothers and sisters mentioned in this meeting is the ability to use the formidable and other means, it can be defeated in the presence of the nurses; it is the best way to
The following is the important issue for us to consider the issue of speculation.
That is to say, it is necessary to pay attention to a lot of costs, and it is necessary for everyone to learn not to benefit from it.
Those who have experiences will do so in a way.
The information should be a source of information to everyone.
Although they were present in different countries, they did not have much work to do.
It is necessary to increase our enthusiasm in this regard.
I would like to congratulate them.
I hope that this path will increase the determination of the people who love this government, the Islamic Republic and the future of this nation. I hope that they will increase their determination, insight and understanding.
This is the zealous and enthusiastic work that we introduce in the past year, and it is necessary to see it along with the issue of economy.
I hope that everyone will increase our enthusiasm.
The future of this country is a perfect future.
Thankfully, there are good hearts and faith and power in this country.
This country has many opportunities to call it the second honorable name in the world.
Our history, our inheritance of traditions, our capacities and human capabilities are all of the things that they tell us about.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on March 21, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution in a meeting with thousands of
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Holy Prophet of God and greetings our Leader, and our Prophet, the Mediterranean-Mustafa Muhammad, along with his holy and Holy Prophet (s.w.a.), especially the God of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me a long time and understanding of this blessed role model. I would like to thank God for being sacrificed for him on the occasion of Imam Ali (r.a.s.).
I would like to congratulate this great event of Norouz and enter a new year to all the brothers and sisters who were gathered together in this province and this great event. I would likely be the one who was outside the region of Iran and the brothers and sisters who listened to this message.
For example, this meeting is an example of the Iranian nation on this day, and we dear people from different countries are closer to all the meetings of the past in this great Revolution.
There are also brothers and sisters in Mashhad who are present.
I would like to extend my greetings to everyone and to all others.
I would like to congratulate all of our dear people and other Muslim nations who showed honor to this festival and using it in a religious and Islamic sense.
The Islamic Republic is this: to benefit from all the opportunities that have been made, and all the opportunities of life, to achieve disgrace, and to make progress in the world and infrastruction. We can use this opportunity to
Let us inform ourselves of the great goals of Islam.
One of these days is the opportunity to be disfellowshipped, and Allah the Exalted has listened to the good words of the people and assembled in religious places.
The following is the length of these years during the reign of the Islamic Republic (a.s
Of course this is that if you look at the beginning of the new year, you will see that the majority of people are present in places of worship, those who visit him and pray for divine blessings.
This means that the Iranian nation should benefit from this sign and religious celebrations.
We do well to imitate this example in all aspects of the events, and we should use Norouz to increase our knowledge.
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of us, and I hope that Allah the Exalted will bestow success on all of us
Today the opportunity that Allah the Exalted has prepared is to discuss three issues.
The first point is related to the events that have been done in the year 13889, and we will see that the Iranian nation has acted on the people and that the government officials have acted in harmony with the Holy Prophet's (s.w.a.) and that year
And the third point is related to events in this region. The events that are happening in North Africa and what is happening in the region of Islam, according to the efforts of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah to look forward.
I would like to say that the name that was given to the year 1389 - that of the Husband and Effort - was noticed and that the people of our country had been vigilant.
Of course they are faced with great determination and understanding in the future, but the first observations of the year 13889 and the actions of the officials and the people in charge of their work and their efforts have been manifested by them.
This can be seen in many areas.
Let us start with knowledge and understanding.
At the beginning of the year 1389 - on the occasion of the festival - I was able to make a return visit to the honorable and important people of the country - and at the end of Esfandence of the refugee year, I was again able to visit or work as well as the results of educational work that I had been able to do in the year of this year.
The progress that has been acquired in the arena of knowledge and technology today is not limited to what is being declared, but I can tell you that you should pay attention to it.
Since the beginning of this great movement has been started in different areas, one that is to say that each day has progressed.
On one occasion in the past, I was exposed to a bridge in the back of the Majlis (a.s.) and said: "Isol is the power of knowledge and knowledge, and knowledge is the source of power for a nation."
I know that knowledge and technology are based on this faculation.
Today the movement of the country in the arena of knowledge and artificial areas is especially important innovative areas.
In various areas, in the arena of knowledge, in the arenas of the arena of Nanoviat, in the arena of production, in the arenas, in the arenas, and in the arenas of self-helps.
As I said in Nurouz on the night of Nurouz that different organizations of the world have revealed that the path is ahead of all the world and the progress that has been made in the country.
There are two important issues that are presented in this issue.
The first point is that the majority of the people who are working in this regard are young.
For the past 30 years, it is the best of their youth - which is to rely on these youth and youth. Tabbas, there are well-established experts who have faith in this regard.
The following is that the people who are responsible for this great responsibility are the people who have a strong, self-conscious, self-confidence.
The original text is the power of humanity.
Our young ones continue to work in a weak, and they acknowledge that all these things are the basis for progressing towards the future.
The following is the goal of progressing in knowledge.
That is to say, knowledge is being transformed into a production, and it is necessary to achieve knowledge and to bring it into a material way.
The path of knowledge is not limited to material wealth and material things.
Our honorable people should know that all economic, economic, economic, economic, economic, economic, and economic goals are necessary and that they have managements of the government.
This is an integral part of labor.
Thankfully, this work has been started.
And the fact that the government and the people in this work is a good achievement.
The movement of the people in the arena is a clear and positive movement. They will gradually see the effect of this movement.
The important goal of this work is to separate the people from the government.
This is a great step that is based on justice.
Another goal is to make good efforts.
Two years ago, we named the year "The Year of Economy and Labor".
This is one of the ways in which we can improve our ability to use the realities to the extent possible.
Among the few months that have been presented in this system of things is the result of the efforts of the government, which has been used to pay attention to the Iranian nation.
Such aggressive and speculations that have been casted as well as illusion of wheat - which is a great blessing on the part of Jehovah.
This is one of the things that have been acquired in the future and that God " s approval will be of great benefit to this economy.
The same is true of the work that is referring to in economic arenas.
Unfortunately, it is said that our nurses have been relying on the oil.
And this is the case of the economy of the economy. This path has been used in our country.
For a few years, I said that I would like to say that this was the day when we were able to make the country without selling oil if they did not need it.
Of course not, it is not a harsh task.
Our goal is to be close to our goal.
In this regard, there are many great achievements in the year 1389.
And this is one of the things that are embodied with determination and labor in the arena of economy and the wisdom of government under the west of America and by far-reaching eyes of other governments.
Since the beginning of the year 13889, they have increased their sanctions.
They have calculated themselves in the account that they have come to us - and they have said that they have despoiled in five months and six months. He is the one who
They remember that by means of such restrictions, they will present themselves to the people who are suffering from the Iranian nation and who are independent of the Islamic Republic.
One of the most important work is being done in order to democracy in order to democracy.
The enemies bravely achieved their goal through these sanctions.
Today, the people of western countries say that they are not useful.
One of the problems we have managements is a short time. We have
Therefore, they say that this is the violation of the Islamic Republic.
As a result of the sanctions of our officials, they entered into their thinking. They made
This was a fact that I heard from the baths of the youth who was present at the end of Efand.
They told me that we wanted to do this, and we went to a remote place so that they said that you were not under the sand. We realized that we were obliged to do this.
We returned home and reasoned, and we made efforts, and we worked hard and not relying on foreigners.
The government reported that the year 13889 was established in six million laborers and six thousand.
In the arena of domestic production, industrial areas, in the arena of labor, industrial and industrial areas, industry, industry, industrialities, and other areas - all these things - have been a source of wealth and good achievements.
This is the economy.
In other areas, there are many other aspects of our work, and they will not be limited to them.
In the year 1389, I would like to congratulate this year.
Although the year 1389 did not have an academic advantage, the year 13888, and the year was a ten-year-old year.
The Iranian nation and all government officials in the country and the people who are active in the arena of labor and who are working hard to fulfill their responsibilities in order to benefit from the Iranian nation.
I would like to congratulate the issue of economy.
If our dear country has achieved victory in economic arenas, this great movement will usher in the future, and it will certainly influence the Iranian nation.
What is important in this regard is the progress of the principle that has been prepared for five years.
Our firm determination is to use our power in the best possible way.
During the past two years, I talked to the issues of the country and discussed the issues of the country.
It is necessary for people to understand these things.
I would like to congratulate the people who are in the arena of economic economy, and I would tell them how much more important they are in the economy of the economy in the country and
This is not something we want.
They should make a lot of effort and work in order to make progress in the past five years.
The aggress of labor and expansion of labor in the country are among the most important things and that I am thankful for.
In addition to taking advantage of the products of business products and the help of the market marketplaces, they managements of the economic capacities are also among the most important issues and the important elements of this system of things.
It is necessary to establish a foundation for rules.
This means supporting progress.
This is the result of the blessings that are being achieved in different countries, including the sanctions and the appropriate use of water. Today our
Look at what will happen if the government hastened to repair the paths of water, and if the ten percent of
Basically, the fields are not limited in all areas - the use of domestic products and other areas where there is a ten-month in which we are used only in these areas.
In fact, the benefits of watering from outside the country will be doubled.
The determination of people is based on economic events.
If we want to do this great movement in the year 1390, there are other things that must be done.
I will introduce the list of these requirements.
First of all, the spirit of action is necessary.
Our people have seen that from the beginning of the Revolution until today wherever they entered the arena of resistance, and we see that in the arena of resistance, and we have seen this in the arena of resistance.
If we have the spirit of action in various parts of the world, that is to say, if we have the responsibility of God and the work of a child - not just when we are weighed down - nor will this movement continue.
The second is the strengthening of the faith and religious identity of the people.
All of us should know this. They should know that they are not content with religion and that of the youth will help the people of the world to
It should not assume that the influence of arbitrary or arbitraryism is based on the influence of the youth.
If the youth of a nation are religiously jealous, they will be the object of fornication. They are humiliated. They will
The same is true of economic goals.
Increased religious academicities, athlete is an important point.
The following is a lack of concern for the people who are present in the arena of events. Look at the scene and see that there are times when there are times in which all should be extremely careful and important.
This would be like a captain based on road road road roads, but it is not the only thing to speculate it into the midst of the country.
Therefore, there should not be a list of events after the scene.
Another factor is to preserve unity and understanding.
Today, the people and government officials are among the people and the people who love them, supporting them and stay with them, and are familiar with one another, and they
One of the enemies of the enemies of the Iranian nation is the source of discord and discord. They con
Fortunately, our people are awakened.
All those who love the country are interested in religious democracy, which is a source of pride to the Iranian nation - should make it clear that they understand one another.
They should pay attention to their government officials. They should try to see that there are discord among them - even if there are discord among them - when they
I would like to congratulate the government officials.
The most important of the world " s issues are solved by a discussion.
I would like to congratulate this issue. On one occasion they have been presented to the year, and they see that the Iranian city and other cities were filled.
This is not good.
In some cases, what is expected of many martyrs?
I would like to see in the people and government officials who listen to this event and try to make progress.
There is no need to manage a lot of responsibility.
Of course it is not important to see the issue of economic events that I have said that these are not to be overlooked.
In the arena of knowledge, especially in the arena of knowledge and art, it is necessary to help those youth, to make the right choices.
Of course the events that are taking place in this region are the events that have happened in the events of Egypt, Libya, Bahrain and Bahrain.
This is the manifestation of an Islamic Awakening.
This event has been presented for some years in the Islamic Republic, and today we see him as a manifestation of his life. There are two different characteristics of the people whose presence is at the beginning of the issue of human presence, and religion is the first one and another.
These are two things that I can do.
The presence of the people in the arena of the arena of the Islamic Revolution.
Those who live on a desk and those who live on my table and in large homes and tithes have seen their backwardness.
Our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) was the opportunity to enter the arena of our magnanimous Imam (r.a.).
Today the same event is similar today.
In Egypt or Tunia, a people entered the arena for themselves. If they did not even speak in large homes of scholars and in large homes, they used to call on people, they were very concerned about these things.
They are the people who have entered the arena in the arena and their goals are religious.
That is to say, the people who have gathered in the arena of jurisdiction, divine name, religious leaders, and religious scholars who have been enlightened in the arena and have entered the arena in the arena.
This is the characteristic of this issue.
Why do they get out of it?
In Egypt, Tunisia, this is the case in other countries, the rulers and the cruel rulers have poured out their lives to the people and their people.
As an example, the people of Egypt thought that their leader would pay attention to the demands of Israel.
If Husbands did not conclud the Zionist regime against Gaza, then the Israelites could not take action against the people of Gazanes.
But then Honbababaptists entered the arena and helped to cover the road and go out of Egypt.
When he learned that Gaza had been following the death of Gaza and the people of Gaza, he was in a weak and indifferent.
This is the case of Hosssian Evangelizers.
The same is true of other countries.
As an example in Libya, although the first days of his reign, Gaddafi showed a steady pocket and policies in the west, but the years of years have passed on to the west.
(Micod Libya) If they see that he has been a victim of threats, he sees to collect all the more experience of his nuclear achievements, and he will appoint them over the people of the west.
Look at the positions of our nation.
But our government officials did not just give up, nor did they try to discord what the enemies wanted each year to do.
Such treatment can be seen in all these countries.
This is what is necessary for us.
After these events, they did not know what they did, and they did not know
Of course the events that have been seen in the United States have seen from other countries is the support of the Qur'an leaders. They have kept Honsbaptized until the end of their life; but when they see that they realize that they have not been able to do so, they have turned their back on him.
This is another lesson for the leaders who trusted in America to realize that they have not been able to do so and that they will not have any advantage.
What happened to the west and the United States itself is something that they would not accept.
Egypt is one of the most policies of the US Presidents, and they have relyed on this politics.
But they have seen this foundation in order to continue its progress.
If people are awakened, they can eliminate this plot and immorality.
The Americans have tried to see that they had lost mistakes in Egypt or Ben Tunia, and they should try to defend their governments.
By Allah's favor, the Americans will continue defeating the region.
After they had lost the people in these countries, they arranged for two other things that they wanted to move ahead. The first is to wait for the second time, and they are trying to create the same situation in certain areas.
They have been defeated in this work.
Second, it is applied to this point. The point is to establish a pattern of events in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya in other countries.
The main point is to say that they are carrying out their responsibility.
If the honorable people realize that the American President has sent the Iranian people to tell us that they are behind you, they confess that they are opposed to the Islamic Republic, they
They are not just showing compassion to other nations, but they do not just feel compassion for them.
He himself is the president of the US President to use the billions of people in such economy, and the Americans are trying to bring up their negotiations in order to
The people are scattered for the sake of vigilance, and they are carrying out their traditions.
Today the United States is in a economy, and they
President and Laborers whose people should be tormented by Shihrai and Iraq and other countries.
People do not understand these things.
What is the identity of the US President?
Is he really aware of the people who are present in the arena of politics, nor is he aware of it?
He said that the people who are on the website of Azaddi, the people of Tehran are the people who are policies of Egypt.
Well, it is true that every month of Bahman, the people who assembled on the Web site are the "llah of America".
The events that are taking place in the regional events, and the Islamic Republic is open.
Our goal is to support the nations and their rights.
This is the goal of the Islamic Republic.
Our hearts are our minds and hearts. These are the ones and the things we say, they are the people of the people or the government of the government.
There are two places where they should be noted. The first is the Libya, and the second is the country of Bahrain.
Demoni and Libya, we would like to congratulate the Islamic Republic of Libya and other countries, and we would enter the United States and enter the United States with many other countries.
They claimed that we belonged to Libya to protect people, or to bring about bullyy, but this was not the case.
If they were so supported by the Libyan people in Libya, they would likely feel that they were independent of the people of Libya, they were now bombed on the Libyan people.
If you want to help them, give them their weapons, and give them their help.
Instead of spending a few days looking at the expense of the people, then you will go to Abor, and you will not want men to enter, and you want to know that you are the Islamic Republic of Libya and that you are your goal in Libya.
You want to have a different background so that you can use it in order to establish a revolution that will be established in Egypt and Tunisia, and you should be interested in them.
Your goal is to be firm.
The Sanhedrin, the Mediterranean, was to be a minister of the nations, and it was to be a weapon in the hands of those people.
This is a shame for the Dead of the World Constitution.
Therefore, the presence of the Gestapo, and the presence of the Gestapo is not something to be trusted.
If you want to help the Libya and help them in a boost, you will be able to help others, and they will be able to solve the problem between them and Gather, and why have you entered into it?
The greatest need is to be prepared for the elections, and each individual is one of the people, and this is a great need.
This was a great hope for the people in Bahrain, but in the future, the people did not have the responsibility of folking such things. They were oppressed.
Then, in the west, western countries will use this opportunity to democratically in the regional events by introducing a new event, which is the case of Shia and Sunni.
Because the people of the Bahrain and Shia are not responsible, nor do anybody have the responsibility to support them.
Instead of seeing the issue of Bahrain, they did not tell the blood of the Bahrain, nor did the blood of the Bahrain
At that time, some people were found from the Persian Gulf - politicians or newspapers - who have come to say that hermen are saying that the issue of Bahrain is Shia and Sunni.
The idea of being disapproval was a nation that was committed to her in Tunisia, as was the case in Libya, as was the case in Yemen.
The Americans were happy that they were able to call this issue in a concubine between Shia and Sunni democracy.
They say that the people of Iran are behind the people of Bahrain.
We have supported all of them.
For the past 30 years, we are supporting the Palestinian nation. Another government offers such support for the Iranian nation over the past 30 years.
Are the Palestinians?
Our young brothers and sisters traveled to airplane.
They were prepared to go to Gaza, and they would call Israel.
We said that they should not go.
We have revealed their back on the people of Gaza, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and they are not Shia.
Therefore, the issue was not Shia or Sunni.
Determinations try to explain the issue of Bahrain as a Shia and Sunni.
Unfortunately, some people who think that they do not have the wrong goal of getting involved in this trap.
If there is so much interest in the issue, I will tell them: "They are not Shia and Sunni. This is a great service to the United States; this was a great service to the enemies of the Iranian nation who were explaining the great movement of the people as a group of a nation."
There is no difference between Gaza and Palestine, Tunisia and Libya, Egypt, Bahrain and Yemen.
Each movement of the people who recites the Islamic identity and seeks to cooperate with it is something we will support.
The Ultimately fountain of America is one of the foolishness that they do not know to kill Bahrain and democratically, but when our teachers say that you should not kill the people, they say that you should not kill them.
Is this aggressive in domestic affairs?
You should not kill your people. The government is a manifestation of oppression, and this is a manifestation of vigilance, and it is foolish to foot the people of the country of Bahrain, and it is foolish and dissatisfacate of America.
Thousands of thousands of miles from this region.
Anybody who does this work should make a mistake.
I would like to believe that by Allah's favor, I would like to congregated in the region.
As God promised, this movement will definitely succeed.
The Iranian nation is a source of pride, and they are happy that they have awakened, and they continue to stand firm.
Youths who have come to know that the Revolution did not see the Revolution, but if they did not know that they did not have the support of the youth, they did not know it.
Dear God, bestow His mercy on this honorable nation.
Each day, continue to honor those who are ministering to this nation and this movement and Islam and Muslims.
Dear God, make the holy heart of the Imam of the Age (s.w.a.)
Dear God, Muhammad and Alay Muhammad, make the souls of our dear martyrs and our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) and bestow his mercy on us.
The following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 7, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the following is the full text of the speech delivered on August 6, 2011 by Ayatollah Khamenei the Leader of the Islamic Revolution.
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and greetings be upon our Master and Prophet of Abundant, Muhammad, and upon his immaculate souls, especially the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
I hope Allah the Exalted will bestow His blessings on you.
We thank Allah the Exalted to give us the opportunity to re-appearance and organize this meeting so that we will be able to express our appreciation for the important things of the country and hear other important things.
I separated the words that I would like to do at least three days: the first point is to remind the one that I was involved in the first step of the faithful slave to take care of her, which I wish we would like to benefit from this month of Benjamin.
The final part of the events and which if God " s will is at times, he will focus on the issues that are taking place in our region.
Hajj Jamed Aghaha Maliki Tabrizi - and the teacher of the most famous and famous Statute - says: " Hell is a gift from Allah the Exalted who bestows His servants on His servants and his servants."
His Eminence said: "Today is not a matter of honor."
One of these things or the most important thing is to say that the one who is more important than all other icons is that the hunger and jealousy are enlightened by the hearts of one person who is involved in the mind and heart of the one who has come to know him - who has come to know him - who has become one of the people - has become one of them.
This thought is one of the essential thoughts that come to life and the spirit of a person who is revealing the truth and who is exercising in wisdom, and it is necessary to think about the years of the past.
For years, they have been the main goal of each person.
It is the result of all cultures in this life - which is the time of
Therefore, let us reflect on this life course that the years are traveling.
We should pay attention to our time and energy.
We should pay attention to the kind of life.
Therefore, this taghut is progressively moving, and this is the result of all time, and it is returning to us.
He is using it, and I am using it.
Just think of death, walking from the world, when the spirit of a man is based on the spirit of death and interviews with the martyrs of death. This is a time to come to each one of us, and " the soul of the soul is the manifestation of death".
It is our situation that we should be at that time. He wants us to be alive at that time.
Another way to think is this prayer.
The prayers of the Holy Prophet Prophet (s.w.a.) are great things in the past, and the prayers of the Holy Prophet (s.w.a.).
Therefore, these prayers are important.
It is a message to the people who have heard and reminds them of those who have not heard: it is the 13th of the book of Sahit-Pajjad.
This prayer says: " You should pay attention to the soul of Muhammad and Alay-goddd and adorned me, and you should put me on the sacred pocket. You should put me in the company of God-fearing servants of God, and you should put me among the servants of God."
What does it mean to be educated in the ambassadors and God-fearing servants?
I would like to congratulate God in some respects: the first one of these things is their " firm determination and righteousness. We have the opportunity to prove righteous in a nation, righteousness, and justice should be separated between people and people, and righteousness and justice.
The fear of God that is expected of us is one of the foundations for this godly fear.
Sometimes a person is used to get a sense of responsibility, and he or she is a source of responsibility for the people.
When you are angry with a certain enemy or a member of the country, the influence of your furiousness and your furious emotions towards a person who has not managed to overshadow
Instead of being angry, we should not act in a harsh manner.
Our sins and our sins are forgiven in our case.
With the fire of the heat.
Everybody should try to kill this fire.
Our goal is to pay attention to the people who are taking part in the country and to those who have
At times, we did not have to kill the fire that would have been a source of power and power.
The people in the midst of the streets should try to find them in the right way. We should not let our actions and words be removed from the people who are in the midst of the ways to stop believing.
We should not separate the people who are part of this system of things.
When there is discord, we should try to resolve them.
When a university makes a point, try to explain it.
We have spoken many of things in this regard.
This is part of this prayer. This is one of the most important aspects of the models. I have spoken about six of them.
May Allah the Exalted rewards us.
These are part of godly fear.
This is the first aspect I want to speak.
The second is the future of a country.
This report, which was presented by the esteemed president of the Islamic Revolution, presented a report that had been presented in many areas. There were many important issues that were present in public report, and I used to know how many people should try to capture the sufferings and what they have been done.
I would like to explain that I would explain the events of the country, which is very important to us.
Why is it important?
First of all, understanding the conditions of our country and where we are arriving, and what path should we follow, and what important event is very important, but today it is important to know that the conditions of the world are faced with.
First of all, the situation of this region is like a welcome.
The Islamic awakening of Islam and the lofty things that are taking place in this region is one that has not been seen from the beginning of the Revolution until today.
In a nation such a nation, the people of Egypt committed this great movement, and the government is one of the most policies of the Islamic Republic, and it is a source of threat to the illegitimate threats of the region, all those things that have been imposed on him.
In such cases, we find ourselves in the arena of an event that creates an unforgivable situation for the sake of the Islamic Republic
The issue of the economy that has caused the arrogant powers of western countries and continues to bring them down a great event. And there is another event that will not pass away from it.
The following is the case with the issues of the West countries that you feel about the economic problems of the Americans and other countries in which they have been involved in the future, and they do not know all of them.
Discipline and politicians after the arena in the arenas of the world - those who have always managed to compensate for the news - do not want to see people of the world in the light of the problem.
If the end of the speech is on the scene, I will be brighter in this issue.
The same is the case of different countries, such as the recent economy and terrorism in western countries, especially the Nazis, and foreign-god and revolutionary logists who were the US, who were apprehensive and oppressed by the US government. They were openly exposed to their propaganda.
Later he attacked the other side of the Islamic Republic.
There are other things that they want to do, but Allah the Exalted did not give them anywhere.
These are important things.
This is not just the case in Norway.
In such cases, we need to look at our circumstances and see what we are doing.
If we do not look at this opportunity and understand it, we will not be able to do what is right and if we do not do it, then we will
He sometimes turned his attention to a potential threat, and he
Therefore, there is no problem to see the future of events in the country.
It is necessary to look at what we are going to do. We should not make mistakes and avoid taking advantage of them. We have good things, and we should pay attention to them. We should pay attention to them.
The same is true of the events of the past.
When a person says that you are saying, they will say that you are not going to say the realities.
You are saying that this is not the case with the weapons of this kind. We
I would like to congratulate ten-month magazines each day.
Some of these journals each day have some of the experiences that each of them deserves to be shaken in the heart of a weak man.
Of course we are not in charge of a particular event, but this is a mistake.
This is the case.
It is necessary to take a closer look at the proper side of the issue.
It is necessary to pay attention to what government has been able to do and what is expected of its government.
Therefore, if we want to understand the real condition of the country, we must keep the sense of weakness.
Today, I would like to introduce a clear explanation for this issue, but there is a need to be done in this regard.
These good things will show us a lot and our opportunities in this country.
And these areas of weakness can show us what we should do and what we should do.
When we put these things together with one another, we know that we should act.
I would like to write five different things to six other events that were moving forward in the long-term order of the Islamic Republic for the past 30 years and every time, some of the people, some of them, some of them, some of them, and others have been left in the future.
The first point is one of the good things and the characteristics of this system of things which is guaranteed by the success of different kinds of threats.
For the past 30 years , we have faced various forms of political threats, threats, and threats of economy - these threats are the disease of this system.
They would like to be prepared for this government, but they did not want to stop it, they wanted to
All these threats are a result of success.
Some of these things are based on different backgrounds, such as the sanctions of sanctions.
For years, the sanctions of sanctions have increased in years, and they have said that they have been democratic.
The sanctions at times during the Mediterranean Conferences - some of whom were direct - should have placed the sanctions on us.
These are the things that are related to foreigners, who are directly involved in them.
Likewise, some of those who have faced the consequences of domestic events - even though the enemies have used this event in the country as an example of success in this system of things. Today they continue to live with one another, and they feel that the
I feel that this is one of the most important aspects of our
We should take note of this event when we are considering the issues of this system of things.
This system of things should not fails, nor is it a point to the enemy of wealth, and it has been a source of threat to various countries, but it has proved to be upon all these threats. This is a very important point.
I feel that this is the first aspect of this system of things.
Second: he is the one who has agreed to be among the people and government.
