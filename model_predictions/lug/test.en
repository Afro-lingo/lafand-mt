You are not helping Ugandans to calm down.
Hutu majority have all the time to work.
The Hutu majority have all the time to work hard indeed as they stand in opposition to the dictatorship.
Do the best for the people so that at the end of the day they can see the rationale of choosing a better African government.
The Hutu majority should have done better when during the Mobutu era they propped up a dictatorship of Juvenal Habiryamani instead.
One would like to compare Mobutu and Kabila, or Habiryamani and Paul Kagame, or Amin and Obote versus Museveni.
All these are now well known African dictators.
Christine Kabayekka curses won't kill the terrorists Baganda say "curses of a hen do not kill the kite".

As for the Excellencies gathered in Kampala for the African Union summit, their number is close to that of the innocent lives who perished on July 11.
A few weeks ago I argued for the superpowers to take over Africa.
One patriotic General, my classmate at Makerere University, labelled me "saboteur" Ndugu Afande.
What sort of sovereignty is this Amon B?
Mbekiza inquired if Uganda could export peace it does not have at home.
The entire African Union can only "condemn in the strongest terms possible" while Ugandans are murdered in cold blood.
Amon Mbekiza's comment in New Vision, July 19, 2010, on the July 11 terror attacks in Kampala missed one key point.
As we mourn the dead, we must ask; whose political, economic interests does Uganda serve by being in Somalia?
The insurgency in northern Uganda has lasted over 20 years.
Millions of Ugandans were born during the rebellion and entered adulthood before it ended.
While some peace has returned, people in northern Uganda think the war has subsided, not ended.
The war cannot be pronounced over' unless Joseph Kony and his top commanders are captured or killed.
I find Mbekiza's criticism of President Obama and Clinton misplaced.
President Obama is not an African head of state.
Ssuubi like Kabaka Yekka will simply isolate Buganda, the new political pressure group formed by some disgruntled Democratic Party members.
This reflects a repeat of the Kabaka Yekka Uganda People's Congress unholy alliance of 1961 to deny Benedict Kiwanuka of Democratic Party
The Kabaka Yekka allied with the Uganda Peoples Congress but the marriage crumbled in 1966 when the Kabaka was forced to flee to exile.
In spite of Buganda abandoning the Democratic Party for Uganda People's Congress in the 1960s, Democratic Party remained its honest and only ally.
Democratic Party now remains in the hearts of the majority of the Baganda, a big reason why Ssuubi members faced resistance in Masaka.
Ssuubi 2011 was formed by some people who didn't want a non Muganda to take the Democratic Party leadership.
Ssuubi 2011 was formed by those who were opposed to the election of Norbert Mao from the north.
Democratic Party refused to join the Inter-Party Cooperation because it has no serious future plan other than removing Museveni.
The arrogance exhibited by Forum for Democratic Change leaders especially when Democratic Party suggested reforms was self-explanatory.
Democratic Party said not all parties can bring the same numbers in the Inter-Party Cooperation to elect one flag bearer.
How sure are we that delegates will not be donated to such parties?
For Democratic Party to just enter Inter Peoples Congress is to deny Ugandans a choice.
For members in Ssuubi to say they will support Mao in the congress while roaming with Forum for Democratic Change shows their intentions.
Parties like Conservative Party, Social Democratic Party, the Justice Forum don't have roots even in Kampala.
Buganda has been a serious victim of deceit.
In 1961 allied with Uganda Peoples Congress but betrayed in 1967.
In the 1980s Buganda was promised a federal system of governance by National Resistance Movement but has been denied to date.
Mwaka Lutukumoi was the Democratic Party National Spokesperson.
Kayonza Furniture Palace Plot 11, Old Port bell Road Opposite Sadolin Paints is your ultimate source for office and household furniture.
Thus, Ugandans should not ask what Obama and Clinton have done to castrate the African terrorists.
Rather we should ask what the African nationals are doing to liberate Africa from bad governance and poverty.
Julius Kiiza said that Makerere University Military can't win the war.
I don't agree with those who support the government's position to launch a full-scale war on Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia.
The attack on Al-Shabaab is a very small part of the War on Terror, certainly not the heart of it.
I disagree with President Museveni's war drums.
At this time, I don't understand our need to go to war with Al-Shabaab despite the recent bombs in Kampala.
Perhaps some Ugandans are contented with Museveni's reasons.
Ask former United States president George Bush.
It's also so unfair when some people generalise that all Muslims are terrorists.
While there are some scriptures in the Koran that encourage violence, they are insignificant.
Islam has no central religious authority like the Vatican in Catholicism.
Abbey Kibirige Semuwemba United Kingdom on the story "Ganging up on Museveni" I can sense dome truth in this article.
Though the National Resistance Movement spokesperson is trying to downplay Ssemwogerere Mulwanyamuli's role on Uganda's political scene, National Resistance Movement and President Museveni feel politically threatened.
That is why the government is now pursuing him using National Social Security Fund, labelling his Ssuubi 2011 political group a Kabaka Yekka party.
Konny Jovia Ssuubi inquired if Kabaka Yekka was opportunism to the Muganda peasant
The only person capable of delivering that security is Yoweri Museveni.
Kizza Besigye is already in league with the perceived enemies of Buganda.
Norbert Mao has been wise to avoid that lot.
Democratic Party and National Resistance Movement are the real friends of Buganda.

New research shows that African elections are far from promoting democracy on the continent.
Finance Minister Syda Bbumba's recently announced national budget was made with the two thousand eleven elections in mind.
Government critics claimed that the national budget read out in the Uganda Parliament is full of politics.
New research conducted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast demonstrates that elections held in Africa have an impact.
It is one of the few things which presents challenges in elections in different elections in countries in Africa.
In Uganda, it is shown that the economic reforms that the country was pursuing leading up to the election were not going to work.
African finance ministers and reformers who are known for their fiscal discipline are usually fired around election time.
War, guns and votes also show unsuprisingly that voting decisions in African countries are based on ethnic voting blocks.
A case study of two Ugandan state ministers is shown.
An alumni from Makerere University focuses on winning re-election to the Uganda Parliament.
The member of parliament who bet his re-election on perfromance lost the election while ethnic posturing won the day.
Further evidence that Barrack Obama could never win an African election can be found here.
Besides, quality information on governmental performance in Africa is scanty and hard to come by.
Think of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and today's dysfunctional Iraqi democracy.
Ethnic violence in Kenya is usually rife during elections such as those in two thousand two and two thousand seven.
Interestingly, the rough and tumble of African elections discourages decent African candidates from competing for political office and instead encourages some not so well suited candidates.
Mu mawanga agakyakula abeesimbyewo batera okwogera ebisasamaza abalonzi ne bamenya amateeka.
Uganda is not short of examples in this regard.
After all winning an election in Africa can mean immunity from prosecution and he who reins of state power controls the judicial machinery as well.
Collier presents research by Pedro Vicente in Sao Tome which found that candidates who bribed voters won as compared to those who did not.
It is an empirical fact that bribery wins elections in poor countries.
After all African voters do not expect that the competing politicians will deliver on their promises and elections are their only chance to cash in.
Some politicians will actually be seen again four years later at the next election.
Collier and Pedro, during the two thousand seven Nigerian election determined that electoral bribery and vote miscounting were used to win elections.
War, guns and votes is an insightful reading into how electoral democracy has had the opposite effect in African countries.
Since Uganda was bombed in July two thousand eleven, Al-Shabaab terrorist group in Somalia claimed responsibility.
There has been a lot of tough talk in Kampala.
President Yoweri Museveni has promised to hit back at Al-Shabaab by increasing our troops in that country.
Many Ugandans support the government in its posturing for a surge.
Yet the surge will increase rather than reduce the problem of the fragmentation of the state in Somalia.
It will also increase the financial and human cost on the state of Uganda.
No amount of Uganda Peoples Defence Forces' presence in Somalia will bring peace to that country.
Only Somalis' can.
Uganda's troops can only assist in peace building if there are strong internal forces with a strong vested interested in peace.
Somalia needs a war lord able to mobilise reources and build a military capability to take effective control of the entire country.
The crisis of the state in Somalia, though initially created by internal factors, has been worsened by international interference in its domestic politics.
Indeed it is part of the wider African dilemma.
Quality information on governmental performance in Africa is scarcely a basis of voter choice as compared to ethnic identity and loyalty.
Voting decision in African countries are not based on government performance as is the case in the west.
Elections held in Africa increase political violence, ethnic tensions, electoral bribery and imprisonment of formidable opposition candidates.
The July eleven twin bomb blasts in the city that killed seventy six people and left dozens of others injured.
Mr. Okumu said the reason why they have ordered National Social Security Fund to pay people who were affected by the Sunday night disaster.
Mr Grace Isabirye told that on July fourteen all the bomb victims will be paid the money they saved with National Social Security Fund. Uganda Peoples Defence Forces last week approved one hundred ninety six strong Joint Anti-terrorism Taskforce to secure the search and fight against terrorists .
The fight against terrorism in Uganda was inspired by the terror attacks that happened on July eleven in the country.
Kunsa also underscores the need for a thorough legal framework behind the Bill.
Grace Isabirye, Onegi Obel, Amama Mbabazi former Managing Director, David Jamwa and Ezra Suruma are going to be hear today.
The Independent randomly interviewed some workers who save with the National Social Security Fund.
There have been numerous complaints about the inefficiencies of National Social Security Fund, and the never ending scandals.
John Matovu said that if government chose to allow competitors to National Social Security Fund perhaps we would see improved service.
Joan Nantume wished that people could save with any organization they wanted instead of National Social Security Fund.
I have been saving with National Social Security Fund for 10 years now.
Gilbert Okello from Mukwano Group of companies said he will get them some time, even if government changed.
Government needs to craft this law well maybe setting a minimum interest rate on the workers' savings, says Immaculate Akanyo.
According to the Independent issue of July 23 - 29, 2010, by John Njoroge, the air is pungent with urine, fecal matter and cow dung.
This is Kifumbira, a slum in Kamwokya, a suburb of Kampala city.
This issue is not exclusive to Kifumbira; the suburbs of Kawempe, Kalerwe, Wandegeya, Bwaise, Kisaasi, Kiwatule, Kitintale and Banda are also affected.
At the Kitintale market, used needles, bandages and syringes are openly dumped with domestic food waste.
In late November 2009, Ronald Mukasa, fell ill after he stepped on a needle while looking for plastic bottles and scrap metal in a rubbish dump.
He developed an extremely high temperature, and began losing consciousness and he was then rushed to Mulago National Referral Hospital.
He was rushed to Kamwokya Christian Caring Community Centre, a health centre in the Kamwokya area.
Doctors there revived him but Mukasa died a few days later of tetanus while at Mulago Hospital.
We show the Minister for Primary Health, James Kakooza, some photos from Kifumbira.
The problem is the "I don't care" attitude of people in Kampala especially.
There are hospitals in the rural areas, both government and private where people can go instead of coming to Kampala.
However, according to the Commissioner of Clinical Services at the Ministry of Health Jacinto Amandwa, the problem goes well beyond attitude.
Amandwa, is suddenly shocked and saddened when he views the pictures.
Amandwa apportions part of the blame to the Uganda Medical Council, the licensing body for private hospitals in Uganda.
According to the independent issue of July 23 - 29, 2010, many are operating without clear medical waste disposal channels.
The Uganda's Healthcare Waste management system Plan of 2007/08-2009/10 suggested that, it should collect and destroy waste.
Major hospitals like Mulago National Referral Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Nsambya and Kibuli have their own incinerators.
The government has a burner in Nakasongola but hospitals and clinics do not have burners.
Health facilities retain the duty of transporting their waste to collection centres from where contracted companies pick it and take it to Nakasongola.
Minister Kakooza said that they provide armed escorts for expired drugs to ensure that they are transported to Nakasongola.
Dr Appolo Ahimbisibwe from Kamwokya Christian Caring Community Centre said that they have an understanding with the health centre in Kisenyi.
Ahimbisibwe adds that the centre pays Shs. 2000 for every kilo of medical waste it transports to Kisenyi.
A spot survey of private medical units in Kifumbira Kamwokya reveals that many private clinics are not willing to pay these additional disposal costs.
At Kasee Clinic, one of 12 private medical units within a 200 metre radius, an attendant was initially helpful but suddenly became hostile.
Life clinic and Nyange clinic also offered very rude responses.
"We don't want journalists here"one attendant shouted in Luganda before slamming her door.
Unrecognized by government and the Ministry of Health, these illegal clinics operate without letters from the medical council.
Many clinics in Kampala, Wakiso, Mukono and central region do not have professional people working in them.
According to Ahimbisibwe, slum dwellings like Kifumbira-Kamwokya are ideal for unregistered private medical centres to operate.
"You do not expect such people to be responsible," Ahimbisibwe notes in frustration.
Mulago Hospital is a shining example of how medical waste disposal is supposed to work.
With three incinerators, Mulago boasts an organised and elaborately systematic method of medical waste management.
Plastic bottles are recycled, domestic waste is collected by Kampala City Council and human body parts are taken to the mortuary grounds in Bukasa.
But for the residents of Kifumbira Kamwokya, just two kilometres away, Mulago's organisation offers little comfort.
Used needles, syringes and blood transfusion tubes were dumped in Kifumbira, Kamwokya.
Mulago Hospital has an incinerator.

The actions by the former Allied Democratic Forces reporters if not checked can be a recipe for disaster.
The demand for the reinstatement of the former Allied Democratic Force liaison office at the Container Village cannot be entertained.
Lieutenant Col Buturo dismissed the proposal of setting up an office even after numerous complaints from the wananchi.
All these affairs at the former Container Village were used in the name of the Joint-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda which negatively affected its image.
There are active serving Uganda People's Defense Force soldiers who need to observe and abide by rules and regulations of the army.
These individuals include Benz Tushabe, Kigonya Siraje, Abdu Rashid Mukiibi, Kakooza Ahmad and others.

The Arab world whose agenda and accountability cannot be clear and convincing.
It is wrong for the group to claim that the government negotiated a deal with Ali Bamuze and Muhammed Kigundu and ignored them.
The Allied Democratic Forces and Lord Resistance Army leadership are still holed up in the bush fighting the government.
Therefore, it's irrelevant for the group to claim to work for and on behalf of the Allied Democratic Force.
It's not true that by the time Rwigyema Shafik was arrested, he was on official Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda duties as alleged.
Much as he was initially deployed by the Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda in the Busoga region, he was given an official vehicle and a pistol.

The job in Uganda Clays was tailor-made for me.
It has been a challenging but exciting eighteen years I have spent here, first as company secretary for nine years and then CEO for nine years.
So I am carrying good memories for the company, the employees, and the board, especially the chairman, Professor Ssenfuma.
He has been my chairman since I became the chief executive officer in 2001.
Uganda Clays is a worker focused organisation in almost every way and I think that has been the basis of our success.
We have put employees first and you have seen this through the awards we have got from the Federation of Uganda Employers.
In February next year I will make 64, how old are you?
In Africa that is old age.
I became the chief executive officer in 2001.

Ocici said that it takes more than just friendship but rather an investment in time and determination to build a strong brand.
The Head of Women in Business Damalie Mukiibi said that the future of the country's economy is in the development of investment clubs.
Standard Bank the mother bank of Stanbic Bank Uganda has been named the best investment bank in Africa in 2010.
Jacko Maree, the Standard Bank Group chief executive said that it is particularly pleasing to be recognised in Africa's highly competitive banking sector.
Being named as the best investment bank in Africa is further confirmation of our capacity to provide top quality services.
Standard Bank has a presence in 17 African countries, 16 countries outside the continent.
Opportunity Uganda, a microfinance institution, has dragged the Uganda Revenue Authority to commercial court for wrongful taxation.
Post Bank Uganda was last week relieved from paying 288 million shillings in Value Added Tax arising from the sale of its land on William Street.
Opportunity Uganda is also contesting a stamp duty to the tune of 488 million shillings imposed on it by the tax body.
It says it is not a credit institution if it is not obligated to work as a collecting agent for the Uganda Revenue Authority.
Uganda Revenue Authority, without verifying the details of its transactions, wrongfully classified them by applying inappropriate stamp duty rates.

The Summit left doubt as to whether African States are capable of working together to solve Africa's most pressing challenges.
The July 11 bombings on Uganda now blamed on the Al-Quaeda, and Al-Shabab jihadist terrorists in Somalia.
Despite the jihadist threats, Uganda became the first African nation to respond to the African Union call in 2007 to send troops to war-torn Somalia.
Uganda was followed by Burundi in sending troops to Somalia.
Uganda remained the lone nation in the African Union peace mission in Somalia until 2008 when it was followed by Burundi.
Other African countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone broke their commitment to send troops to flush out the Al-Shabab in Somalia.
Until July 11, Uganda and Burundi remained the only countries in Somalia being drained both in personnel and equipment due to militant attacks.
There seems no concerted effort on the continent to end this growing terror in Somalia.
This has left only Uganda and Burundi to fight with the Lord Resistance Army uprising in northern Uganda and the troubles in Bujumbura.
The African Union states must show their commitment to solving Africa's problems not just by words by concrete action on the ground.
Nkrumah and Sekou Toure stood to liberate Africa from colonialism and yet today, no leader appears to borrow a leaf from them.
That explains why the approval for the peacekeeping role in Somalia was left to only two countries for over three years now.
Allan Ssempebwa Kyobe of Makerere University thinks Al-Shabab claimed false responsibility.
if any Ugandan had been behind the terror attacks, with or without links to Al- Shabaab, they would never come out to take responsibility.
The Ugandan security agencies need to continue with investigations despite the Al-Shabaab claim.
After the bomb blasts during the FIFA world cup final in two places in Kampala, Somali militants claimed responsibility.

The restoration of the East African common market is the non-material dream of all good globalists.
The East African Community goal is clear, a common economic space for all people, a space in which trade, capital, and people move freely.
Therefore, the East African Community's joined strategy calls for a more open border for the movement of goods and people.
It is absurd to believe that suddenly we can create a regional free trade area with Kenya without massive social-economic changes in our countries.
In common market countries, college education is free, but this can not happen in our East African Community setting.
The East African Common Market was started in 1917 as a preindustrial stage.
It was started to serve the British business interests and those settlers in Kenya.
Therefore, it came as no surprise that when joint services were established in 1945, Kenya benefited more than Uganda and Tanganyika.
Kenya benefitted in terms of value-added to their Gross Domestic Product; more employment benefits and revenue.
For instance, in 1971 the East Africa Railways employed 55% Kenyans, 33% Tanzanians and 12 per cent Ugandans.
Kenya also had a higher manufacturing base than either Uganda or Tanzania, a situation that persists to date.
To correct this uneven situation the British colonial government established the Raisman Commission in 1960.
According to Professor Brown, who was a member of the Commission, Kenya gained the most from the common market.
Uganda gained marginally and Tanzania broke even.
Therefore, fiscal compensation to Tanganyika and Uganda through the distribution tool was recommended, as one of the solutions to this inequity.
The sums involved were far short of what would be needed to lead to the development of industries in Uganda and Tanganyika.
The sums that would be considered adequate were too high for Kenya to accept.
I am now wondering what exactly was negotiated recently by the architects of the East African Community to address this situation.
Abbey Kibirige Semuwemba confirms that the East African Community common market is an ideal dream.
According to the independent issue of July 30th to August 05, 2010, his act was unlawful.
Byarugaba is excited at the news that finally a new Managing Director has been appointed at National Social Security Fund.
Richard Byarugaba takes over from Grace Isabirye who took over from David Jamwa and made him and Mondo Kagonyera pay their debts to NSSF.
I have never met Byarugaba but I have followed press reports about him over time.
I was excited by the announcement that he was taking over at National Social Security Fund.
He is no doubt better placed to drive National Social Security Fund forward.
His previous employment suggests he will make sound decisions in regard to prudent and viable investment of workers' savings
He can turn around the pension scheme, increase interest on workers' savings as well as returns on National Social Security Fund investments.
As it is the tradition at National Social Security Fund let us not be quick to shoot him down.
The time for being cynical about National Social Security Fund has long ticked away into the past.
Everybody deserves a fair chance and so let's give Byarugaba a chance.
Duncan of Kyaliwajjala wouldn't call the current democracy competitive.
The National Resistance Movement has corruptly co-opted a large section of the electorate to serve the party's interests.
There is little competition for votes outside and inside the National Resistance Movement.
Ocheto said that Mwenda was wrong.
Andrew Mwenda missed a great point by just concentrating on symptoms and in so doing, he came up with a wrong solution to tackle the problem.
Edgar says a section of the intellectual and political class in Uganda is too lazy to think over this paradox.
There is an interesting discussion paper prepared by Ferraz and Finan at Berkeley in 2005.
As Ocheto rightly observes, the absence of term limits in Uganda's constitution removes all such re-election incentives.
Ocheto and Omeros think your points are questionable.
Why should President Museveni put in place a competitive system that can cause him to lose power?

According to the independent of July 30-August 5, 2010, how much money has been transferred in Uganda through the MTN mobile money services?
Bank of Africa has signed up billions of Uganda Shillings with the French Development Agency to guarantee loans for Small and Medium Enterprises.
Billions of Uganda Shillings was overdrawn from the Bank of Uganda.
The money was meant for the Ministry of Education.
The amount in billions of American dollars recently signed by Iran in a pipeline agreement is to send gas to Turkey.
The American bank Manager Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay 550,000,000 American dollars to settle civil fraud charges made against it.
The Kabale district administration was ordered by a court to pay 250,000,000 in millions of Ugandan Shillings to Gladys Aserua.

AMISOM as an AU and UN mandated peace keeping force has a limited capacity to protect the Presidential Palace, Mogadishu airport.
The Uganda People's Defence Force presence within the AMISOM framework does not answer the needs of the Ugandans.
When the population talks of wiping out Al-Shabaab from Somalia, they mean militarily defeating them thus removing ability of launching attacks.
Since the Uganda People`s Defence Force cannot achieve that goal, the only feasible option is to withdraw from Somalia.
We can then, as a member state of the UN, ask the UN Security Council for a mandate forcefully invade Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab.
This strategy would allow Uganda to launch attacks against the Al-Shabaab.

During its National Executive Conference in January, the NRM declared it had registered 8 million members including the under age.
This was before the EC started the national voter registration exercise which also yielded about 15 million voters, up from 10 million in 2006.
The NRM has been registering people it calls its members across the country.
The Electoral Commission also doubts the authenticity of the NRM figures.
Early this year, the NRM also doubted the genuineness of the EC's national voter register, alleging that it contained two million ghost names.
Uganda's demographic statistics put the 2009 population projections to 30.6 million.
This implies that 14.2 million Ugandans are above 18 and thus qualified to register as voters.
Population estimates published by the Population Secretariat rise even more questions on the Electro Commission's 15 million voters.
The estimates for 2010 show Ugandans of 18 years and above are 13.9 million, up from 12.9 million in 2008.
Given the high apathy among Ugandans to register for voting and death of some registered voters, the number of new voters would be fewer.
However, the EC has said this is not the final figure.
Some MPs in the NRM have already accused the secretariat of creating ghost members on the register which could facilitate rigging the primaries.
Kinkizi East MP Chris Baryomunsi, has cited that a person's name would be manipulated to appear several times on the same register differently.
At the recent NRM National Conference, some delegates complained that even well-known opposition members had been on the party register.
This had been done by some NRM officials for selfish interests.
The NRM deputy spokesman Ofwono Opondo has said that not all 9 million party registered members are eligible to vote as 1 million are minors.
However,a big question is; who will stop a 16 year old registered NRM member from voting if they registered with the EC ?
Statistics show that Uganda's population has been growing at the rate of 3.2 per annum since 2003.
Godber Tumushabe, ED of ACODE, a local think-tank on public policy analysis, is skeptical about the NRM claim of 9 million members.
It was not proper for the National Resistance Movement to register before the national Electoral Commission exercise.
He says political parties should focus on the EC national voter register for it is easy to verify and it's more credible than any party's register.
In 2011 Electoral Commission registers 15m voters, NRM enrolls 9m; do the figures lie?
The Police regrets the incidents and thanks all the people who participated in the evacuation and management of the victims.
We therefore, call upon all members of the public to be aware of this threat join the Police and other agencies to fight and prevent its occurrence.
We strongly urge organizers of public events such as parties, concerts, open air public prayers, sports and others should involve the police.
We hereby give notice to the proprietors of the following, that teams of Police will visit their premises to ensure availability of adequate security.
We call upon every member of the public with any information of security nature to call the following toll free lines;
These are MTN 0800299922396, 0800299922397, 080029992239 and 0414598067 for UTL.
At their weekly press conference, the EC chairperson Eng Kiggundu told the public that they hadn't lent their registration kits to the NRM as alleged.
The NRM has been registering its voters using registration kits that resemble the ones of the EC in the recent national voter registration exercise.
There have been allegations in some media outlets that EC lent out its equipment to certain political parties to enable them register supporters.
"The commission categorically denies this allegation",Eng. Kiggundu said.
Kiggundu said that they concluded the update of the national voters' register on June 18, 2010 and retrieved all the equipment from the field.
He said the equipment would be packed and sent to the Ministry of Internal Affairs after completion of data transfer.
According to Kiggundu, by July 13, the EC had uploaded 4,670,585 voters, which constitute 97% of the voters they registered in the last registration.
According to Kiggundu, of the 4,670,585 voters, 4290,634 were registered as new, 326,609 as transferring, and 53,342 whose photos were missing.
The Electoral Commission expects to start displaying the national voter register on August 11 and end it on August 30.
This means the EC has most of its equipment lying idle when they could earn money needed to boost their election budget if they rented them out.
However, the Electoral Commission spokesman Paul Bukenya said the constitution does not allow them to do income generating business.
Considering that government has consistently failed to meet the commission's budget, the EC could explore ways of generating its own income.
Last week, the Electoral Commission had to defend itself why it cannot give every opposition party a copy of the national voters' register.
The Electoral Commission said it would be too expensive.
If the EC had other sources of revenue other than relying on remittances from the national treasury, it would reduce on such financial constraints.
However, upon growing pressure from the opposition who accused the EC of incompetence, it revised its stand.
It promised to give the voter registers to the political parties.
The Electoral Commission management have added that they are in talks with government for additional money for this purpose.
Electoral Commission denies lending its equipment to National Resistance Movement during the independent July 23 - 29, 2010 election.
The "fresh-election-call" was made in a statement issued by Uganda Patriotic Movement Secretary General Bidandi Ssali in Kampala yesterday.
The UPM wishes to reiterate to the world and particularly Ugandans that the forthcoming elections will be held under certain conditions.
These conditions have already rendered the elections unfair and unfree.
Right from the beginning, it was clear that the Chairman of the Military Commission had motives other than organizing a free and fair election.
For instance the constituency where our President Yoweri Museveni`s contesting has been unlawfully altered at least three times.
This includes last week and all in a vain attempt to minimize his support.
In all cases those who were denied registration were known opponents of UPC .
The imported foreigners registered were in all cases brought by UPC.
During the nomination exercise, sixteen Uganda Patriotic Movement candidates were disqualified.
Other UPM candidates were denied nomination on grounds that their ability to speak English was not ascertainable.
These included a Lecturer Mr. Chango Macho and a Catholic Father Rev.Okoth.
All our petitions about nominations have been ignored by the Electoral Commission, for example, by the men of "integrity".
Up to now, fifteen District Commissioners have been retired arbitrarily by the Chairman of the Military Commission.
These District Commissioners were also the Returning Officers.
The 15th was fired only two days ago apparently because when Obote went to Rukungiri there was no one to address people.
But why did the South African police arrest you?
I fell out with Kabila and returned to Rwanda.
Kayumba is my friend and he knows that I cannot do something like that to him.
Do you still work for Rwandan intelligence?
I used to be a soldier in the Ugandan army, later, Rwandan army and finally in the Congolese army.
In Congo, I was the Commanding Officer of the Presidential Guard of Laurent Kabila.
He spoke to the Independent's Andrew Mwenda on Kayumba`s shooting; "Karegyeya engineered my detention".
He is influential in the government of South Africa and sits on the National Executive Committee of the ruling Africa National Congress.
Kayumba was also visited by the South African chief of police and the head of South Africa's military intelligence.
It is said that all these powerful Africa National Congress and government officials were there due to Masetera's influence.
The involvement of powerful personalities from the South African government has caused some rifts in the relationship between the two countries.
Some Rwandan insiders claim it has also biased the investigation into the Kayumba attempted assassination.
A Rwandan source, told the Independent that Karegyeya was the one giving South African police tips on whom to arrest.
Gakwerera also claims he was arrested on the advice of Karegyeya.
Further, Rwandan officials have openly accused the South African police of incompetence.
They claim that immediately Kayumba was shot, the first people taken to make police statements are those he had in the car.
However, a South African diplomat worsened things when he mentioned in an interview that the Rwandan government was behind the shooting.
The Kayumba case seems to be setting the relationship between the two nations into a dangerous balance.
But there is more; the Rwandan government had applied for the deportation of Kayumba on charges of terrorism.
On April 6, Spain submitted its own application to deport Kayumba on charges of crimes against humanity.
Two days later, France also applied for the same.
Kayumba could afford to rubbish Rwanda's claims against him because it is a poor country whose accusations can easily be disregarded.
However, France and Spain are powerful nations considered to be mature democracies and reasonable in their actions.
So,their applications could carry more weight with South Africa.
What is clear, however, is that by the time he was shot, Kayumba had begun to reassess his options.
Deportation applications from Spain and France showed that Kayumba and Kagame shared a stronger common threat.
This common threat was stronger than the issues that separate them.
So, he began making contact with Kigali.
Kayumba is a close personal friend to Maj.Gen.Steven Kashaka, currently Uganda's military ambassador to South Africa.
According to Francis Gakwerera, this thing was engineered by Patrick Karegyeya, the former director of Rwanda's External Security.
Whenever I travel through South Africa, I meet and talk with Karegyeya because he is also my friend.
He sometimes picks me from the airport whenever I get into South Africa.
On this occasion, I got into South Africa on Wednesday and called him on Friday, the day before Kayumba was shot.
On Saturday, I had a lunch appointment with Karegyeya which he cancelled saying he was going to watch soccer.
He later called me saying Kayumba had been shot.
I called him thirty minutes later to ask about Kayumba`s state but he said he was busy and promised to call back.
I was at the home of Albert Gatare, a brother of the late Miko.
He told me that Kayumba was in Riverside Hospital.
It is at that moment that the police called me and said they wanted me.
Nine police men then came in heavily armed.
There were many policemen with police dogs.
Then on Sunday night, almost 30 hours later, they brought other suspects including Richard who turned out to be Kayumba's driver.
The other suspects included two Rwandans, a Kenyan and a Tanzanian.
They asked me if I knew any of the suspects and I knew the two Rwandans.
He told me that he was actually involved in the shooting of Kayumba.
He said someone called him on telephone saying his name was Dr. Ndahiro.
He promised to give him two thousand United States dollars if he helped them kill Kayumba that is an enemy of Rwanda.
He said that Dr. Ndahiro promised that the driver would be rewarded by President Paul Kagame if he cooperated.
The driver also said that the shooting was the second attempt on Kayumba's life.
Kayumba was sleeping in his bed with his wife.
Three days later, he tipped them off when Kayumba and wife were going to the shopping mall.
First, I understood him to be referring to Dr.Emmanuel Ndahiro, the head of the National Security Services.
So, I asked him if he knew this Ndahiro and he said no.
So I asked him why he believed that it was Dr. Ndahiro.
I was commanding officer of the presidential guard of rebel leader and later President Laurent Kabila.
So I know, the story of Kayumba's shooting is all deceptive.
Then the killer went over to the side of Kayumba and they had a physical fight.
We were then transferred to John Foster Prison on Monday.
Kayumba's driver recorded his statement in my presence and he repeated to the police what he had told me in jail.
These people were not victimized in any way after the overthrow of Amin.
But there was evidence against them that they aided Amin in Killing Uganda People's Congress members.
Let Kahigiriza come here and contradict my words, if what I say is not correct.
While addressing another rally in Buzabo's constituency, Muwanga warned saying;
"Take the message to Buzabo and all the Democratic Party supporters that they must stop the dirty politics immediately".
The liberty which was brought by the Uganda People's Congress cost people's lives some died in Lake Victoria, others between Mutukula and Arua.
They sacrificed their lives for the freedom of everyone in Uganda.
Muwanga warned that, members of different parties should not claim to have an upper hand on others by molesting them.
Muwanga talked to the Uganda people's Congress in Mbirizi, Masaka South-West constituency.
The 65 year old chairman who effectively participated in last years' liberation war which toppled Amin said:
"You the youth of Uganda People's Congress will spearhead the reconstruction and development task".
"The first thing the Uganda People's Congress will do as soon as it comes to power will be to engage the youth in productive work.
Uganda People's Congress youths will spearhead this so as to set an example to the rest.
Muwanga also appealed to Ugandans to strive hard and establish mutual respect for each other.
At Bwezibwera, the chairman pledged, never again shall the Uganda People's Congress allow Uganda to be humiliated as it was in the Amin's days.
Never shall Uganda be characterized with the life of scarcities of essential commodities.
Uganda People's Congress needs determined characters who would stand with this nation even in difficult times.
Commenting on the Democratic Party led by Paulo Kawanga Semogerere, he said it was characterized by contradictions.
He commended Semogerere for his ability to lead a party which was almost torn apart by contradictions.
The Democratic Party, serious contender with the Uganda People's Congress in the polls, had given away more that 10 parliamentary seats.
I tend to think that Semogerere is only unfortunate to lead such men.
Otherwise, how can we have the 1980 parliamentary candidates who cannot fill in the forms and present them in time?
Nakasi's story is heartbreaking.
This series is compiled and reproduced by John Njoroge.
According to the independent issued on Jul 30- August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumire reported that;
A young woman who was returning home outside the countryside town of Soroti was raped.
The 28 year old Grace Nakasi was a victim of an insurgency in eastern Uganda.
She was pulled off the road to the bush and gang-raped by the men in uniform.
I was living in Soroti town.
I met nine soldiers on patrol at about 7:00 pm.
Nakasi begins her story by narrating how they all raped her and abandoned by the roadside.
This was 1987, a year after President Yoweri Museveni had captured the reigns of state power.
He announced "a fundamental change", not a mere change of guard.
The heinous incident marked the dawn of repeated sexual violence against Nakasi and many other women in conflict areas.
"I decided to go to the bus park to take a bus to visit my home," Nakasi narrates with suppressed sadness.
It was on the way to the bus park that Nakasi became a victim of the second rape.
Nakasi narrated, "I met four National Resistance Army soldiers, two of them dragged me off the road and forced themselves on me".
Nakasi a mother of 12 children, a resident of Soroti, was raped 16 times, infected with HIV.
She was later thrown out of her marital home by the enraged husband.
It's a touching narrative and a wider reflection of the tribulations women face in Africa's conflict-torn regions.
She is one of the faces of Ugandan women that carry the burden of sexual violence.
For the past decade Uganda has been applauded on the world stage as a successful story in the fight against Human immunodeficiency Virus.
Women trapped between government soldiers and the LRA rebels have borne the brunt of the HIV.
This is more than any other women in the rest of the country.
The prevalent sexual violence by both the LRA and government soldiers has left behind a traumatized and stressed generation of women.
In 1990, Nakasi was again gang-raped by men whom she believes were government soldiers.
She was admitted to Butabika Mental Rehabilitation Hospital in Kampala for several months after the rape incident.
In 2002, Nakasi took an HIV test.
But the day I told him I had tested HIV positive, he threw me out of the house, Nakasi narrates in a tone of courage that has defied many odds.
Nakasi was excommunicated from the community.
A ray of hope emerged in 2007.
Nakasi was rescued by World Vision International which paid for her operation to remove her uterus which helps eliminate the fistula condition.
After the treatment, she and other women, who are victims of sexual violence, started a support group called Teso Peace Women's Activists.
According to the Independent issue of July 30-August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumi wrote about women and girls who are abandoned after rape.
Nakasi said the young girl's parents died in the war and now at nine no one wants to take care of her yet has six orphans under her care.
Nakasi's story is not unique in Uganda's war-ravaged communities.
She told the Independent that about 40 women within just one sub-county of Tubur in Soroti where she works suffer from vaginal fistula.
This is due to rape.
Nakasi and other HIV- positive women regularly walk many miles from Tubur to get life pronging drugs.
Nakasi has managed to get funds from Women's International Cross-Cultural Exchange and Urgent Action Fund Africa.
These funds help orphans and provide medicines to people living with HIV in her village.
It became clear that the new government was there to stay after the late 1990's.
Until then, the Rwandan Patriotic Front had managed to run the country through sheer ingenuity.
A small and poor country grappling with problems of the magnitude Rwanda has faced in recently;
And still faces today cannot be considered normal.
Most people who visit Rwanda marvel at how clean and orderly Kigali is compared to cities elsewhere in the region and beyond.
Remembering his childhood in clean and orderly Entebbe;
Kalyegira arguably has grounds for asserting that there is nothing impressive about the state Kigali is in.
Nonetheless, that Kigali is the only Rwandan town talked about in these terms merely reflects that many visitors do not venture beyond it.
Kigali is not the only clean and orderly town in Rwanda.
He has traversed Rwanda over the last decade sometimes as a visitor, other times as a researcher.
My adventures have allowed me to observe different aspects of life in Rwanda at close range.
A perceptive visitor to any place in Rwanda cannot fail to notice evidence of the high quality of public administration the country.
Also the service delivery in the country.
The regular cleaning and garbage collection seen in Kigali is, for example, evident in towns, big and small across the country.
The reason why all this is impressive is not because it happens only in Rwanda, or that it has never happened anywhere else.
Rather, it is because it happens in a country which only 16 years ago was expected to dig itself deeper into chaos and violence.
Thus add a new statistic to Africa's many failed and failing states.
Only RPF cadres and RPA soldiers who had organised a war and successfully defeated a better equiped and resourced army;
Expected to see a functioning and effective state in less than a generation.
Most rural folks possess medical insurance which entitles them to quality services which their counterparts in neighbouring countries.
These include countries like Uganda, could not possibly expect.
In health sphere, Rwandans do not expect to offer bribes to public servants employed to deliver services to which they are entitled.
Given the country's demographics, most of the beneficiaries of these advances are members of the majority Hutu population.
This is thanks to propaganda by past regimes.
Commentators of a particular bent may sneer at the Rwanda government's democratic credentials.
In Rwanda, police and army officers do not make political statements praising the Rwanda Political Front or criticising its opponents.
Hutu and Tutsi who qualify under the law are free to participate, without restriction or special privileges linked to ethnicity.
They can participate as candidates or supporters of any of the country's legally registered political parties.
Journalists working for state media are not fired for hosting leaders of parties other than the Rwanda Political Front.
Under the supremacist Habyarimana and Kayibanda regimes this kind of ‚Äòfreedom for all' was unthinkable.
Another sphere in which the robustness of the Rwanda state can be discerned is law enforcement.
In some, including several of Rwanda's neighbours, having laws on the statute books is one thing, enforcement is another.
In Rwanda, the state's willingness and capacity for law enforcement explains why the impunity which some of us have come to accept.
It explains it as a fact of life in our countries is virtually unknown.
There are no untouchables, which explains why, regardless of what they may think of President Kagame as individuals.
Then there are those who think he could be less strict and more compromising.
There are also no cases of the high and mighty erecting buildings in total disregard of planning regulations and suffering no consequences.
And yet others have theirs demolished.
Important personalities and ordinary folk, Hutu and Tutsi, soldier and civilian, all live in equal fear of, and respect for, the law.
On law enforcement, Kalyegira is, of course, right to argue that "a state is not just about buildings, street lights or a functional civil service".
It is too early to call Rwanda an African success story, as it is inappropriate to call it a normal country.

Mubatsi Asinja HabatiIf says if you plan to seek the services of the Uganda police, prisons service, Mulago Hospital, any court, or UMEME;
You must be ready to bribe.
The East African Bribery Index, a governance tool used to measure bribery levels says that no service is offered in the private and public sectors.
The Uganda Revenue Authority is slightly different than other national services that were surveyed.
The survey interviewed people in the East African Community member states of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.
The survey was carried out by Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog.
URA was found to be the institution with the highest aggregate index of all indicators, which means it performed worst on the bribery index.
It replaced the Uganda police, which was worst in the survey last year, but moved up to the second worst position this year.
Regionally, Uganda is the second worst performer on the bribery index after Burundi.
Rwanda is by far the best performer with a corruption prevalence of only 6.6 percent.
Uganda, Kenya, and Burundi have bribery prevalence of 33 percent and dont expect service at URA, police and UMEME without a bribe.
The report does not provide much information about why there is minimal corruption in Rwanda.
However, it shows that the Rwandan Ombudsman enforces the government's zero tolerance against corruption.
In 2009, the Finance Director at the Presidency of Rwanda was suspended from office.
He was sentenced to four years in prison following corruption allegations.
He was also fined more than one billion Rwandan Francs.
A former top civil servant in the Rwandan infrastructure ministry was given a similar fine.
Over 20 of the 30 district mayors in Rwanda were removed from office for alleged mismanagement.
In Rwanda, the Ombuds-man's office is responsible for reviewing the revenue declarations submitted by top government officials.
These include the president.
In comparison to Uganda where relatively low ranking offenders are arraigned before the anti-corruption court and convictions are rare.
In Rwanda, only six percent of respondents said that they had actually paid a bribe.
Due to the limited numbers of reported bribery incidents, the index for Rwanda couldn't be formulated by compilers in their report.
No other East African country registered high optimism in corruption perceptions compared to Rwanda.
A common new form of corruption used by top government officials in Uganda involves delaying the execution of services to create a crisis.
It happened during the CHOGM in 2007 where colossal amounts of public funds were stolen in hurried procurements.
The report says that it's clear that the anti-corruption legislations in Uganda have had little impact thus strengthening the cause to review them.
The government's point man in the anti-corruption fight, Minister for Ethics and Integrity, James Nsaba Buturo;
Gets defensive when presented with the figures.
He says he doesn't know what safeway Transparency International's surveys use to arrive to its information.
But Jasper Tumuhimbise, an anticorruption activist, has no doubt about the unease.
He says that Uganda might top the region in next year's survey.
Tumuhimbise adds that Uganda ranks high on corruption.
Apart from Rwanda, all governments in the region appear to lack the will to fight corruption.
As a result of this, most citizens do not even bother to report the vice.
At 41 percent, Uganda has the highest number of respondents saying they do not report bribery cases because no action will be taken.
In worst-performing Burundi, however, only 17 percent believe it will rise.
"What we need is the release of our money," said Odoi.
"But we see no headway and we can't open the university to the students", Odoi continued.
"The scene at Makerere was calm on Monday but with each passing day the risk of restlessness and frustration grows", Odoi added.
A clash of faith is emerging at the all African Bishops Conference in Entebbe.
The six day conference is aimed at fostering unity and breathing new life into the church.
Under the theme, "Securing the future, unlocking our Potential," four hundred Anglicans faith will meet including Rowan Williams.
He is the Archbishop of Canterbury.
This is a difficult time for the Anglican faith as the divide between Bishops in Africa and outside continues to grow.
Archbishop Williams has a substantially more favorable stand on homosexuality and gay Bishops serving in the church than African counterparts.
The Independent of Aug 27 - Sept 02, 2010 said there is no easy way out of the brutality that confronts the Karimojong civilians today.
As darkness deepens over Karamoja, the National Resistance Movement government continues with its brutal "disarmament programme".
Sadly enough, while this scenario continues, it is business as usual for Ugandans and the rest of the world.
According to available information from Karamoja, the Uganda People's Defence Forces soldiers are conducting a military campaign.
A Pokot chief elder Mzee Aramutori Lokodo, first brought the plight of the Karimojong to the public in February this year.
Then on April 29, 2010, Nicholas Abul, the Kacheri LCIII chairman, was quoted in the media.
"The army should identify the warriors who are armed and those who are not", Nicholas Abdul said.
During his tour of Karamoja, the Forum for Democratic Change President, Dr Kizza Besigye, saw what was happening there.
Besigye told journalists at the FDC party headquarters in Najjanankumbi that the abuses take the form of extreme torture.
In the New Vision of May 24, 2010, the Uganda Human Rights Commission said Kotido district residents were panic stricken.
Later, in a meeting with Uganda Human Rights Commission on June 28, the visiting Irish Foreign Affairs minister Michael Martin had some remarks.
"We are concerned about reports on human rights violation against women and children in Karamoja," Martin said.
Pokot Member of Parliament, accuses the Elite Special Forces unit of the Uganda People's Defence Forces for the killing "innocent Pokot people".
Kiyonga also accused the Uganda People's Defence Forces of scalding suspected Karimojong rustlers with hot metals.
The army spokesman, Leutenant. Colonel. Felix Kulayigye, dismissed the allegations as "unfounded".
On removing people's teeth as a method of torture, Kulayigye said: "Karimojong people have removed their teeth culturally".
Even before the current allegations, another MP wrote to President Museveni and the Commander in Chief about the army's conduct.
Jie County Member of Parliament told President Museveni that soldiers killed between twenty eight to forty three civilians in April.
The president dismissed the allegations as "baseless" and that the army was "doing a good job in ridding Karamoja of guns.
So such is the tragic situation that has been playing itself in the Karamoja sub-region of North eastern Uganda.
The practice of drawing civilians into the fray of military "operations" is the Uganda People's Defence Force's long standing tradition.
They know that not all Karimojong carry guns.
Neither are all Karimojong cattle rustlers, yet they are targeted as if they were.
This is not to suggest that the Karimojong warriors who terrorise their communities and neighbouring districts should not be held accountable.
To the Uganda People's Defence Forces, they are all the same, all "Karimojong are warriors".
Common sense has to prevail, the Karimojong warriors must be separated from the ordinary civilians.
Museveni hasn't learnt from the twenty five years of the insurgency in Acholi if he expects to rid Karamoja of guns by force.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces continues to target women and children.
"Collective punishment cannot deliver a peaceful Karamoja." said Olara, a human rights advocate.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces continues to target women and children.
It is rare to read an opinion about politics in Uganda in our media whose premise is our reality.
Two months ago, two former prime ministers of Buganda Kingdom announced their support for the opposition in the forthcoming elections.
Given President Museveni's battles with Mengo over land and federo lately, this was a big public relations coup for our embattled opposition.
In trying to win over ethnic Baganda, the opposition has done little to root itself in their existential problems.
However, the calculation is obvious that by winning over powerful Baganda leaders to its side, the opposition hopes to leverage their reputation.
In this lies the fundamental failure of politics in Africa.
During 2006 presidential election, Museveni got one point six million votes and seventy five point four percent in the West.
Let us assume the same number of registered voters and the same voter turnout as in 2006.
The opposition needs to only force Museveni to a draw in the south east and to forty percent in Buganda.
For then the combined vote of the opposition would be three point four five million against Museveni's three point three million votes.
Buganda is therefore the major battle ground region around which Museveni's presidency will be fought.
If Muliika and Ssemogerere tilt the balance against Museveni in Buganda, it is very likely that we will get another change.
The worrying feature about democratic politics in Africa is how much elites are able to make bargains at the top.
If the opposition can win Buganda simply by entering a deal with a few Baganda elites, it will have little incentive.
Politicians in Africa find it more electorally profitable to prioritize the allocation of private goods over pubic goods.
To dismantle this elite driven politics is the biggest challenge to democratization in Africa.
This is where the opposition has failed to offer an alternative to National Resistance Movement.
Even in western democracies, the endorsement of influential elites is important, but only for its symbolic value.
It is rare to hear an issue based organizational voice backing a candidate in Uganda.
The worrying feature about democratic politics in Africa is how much elites are able to make bargains at the top.
The crisis of democracy in Africa.
Dan Mugarura, the Chairman for Electoral Affairs of the main opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change, is a very worried man.
"If you can shoot your own child and wife, it means you will tear up your neighbour," Mugarura told The Independent.
He was referring to the violence during the ruling National Resistance Movement party district elections and constituency primaries.
Mugarura's fears are not unfounded.
In Kapchorwa's Tingey county, violence erupted between supporters of former minister Stephen Chebrot and the incumbent MP Herbert Sabila.
In West Budama Minister Emmanuel Otala drew a gun at supporters of his opponent.
Dr. Gabriel Aridru Ajedra clashed at Awindiri Old Market.
In Kaliro, elections were cancelled twice over alleged malpractices.
In Butaleja the elections were cancelled after a mob attacked the organisers.
For many observers, they were indicators of what government could have been dealing with in 2011.
According to a 2009 Human Rights Watch International report, security agencies present the single biggest threat.
Ikuya Magode, summed up the current crisis for his party and the country going into the 2011 elections.
The Igbo says, "whenever you see a toad jumping in broad daylight, then know that something is after its life".
Such was the situation on July 13 when Matia Kasaija, Amama Mbabazi and Crispus Kiyonga, issued statements about the July 11 bomb attacks.
Security minister Mbabazi told parliament that when they introduce additional security measures they expect the public to support them.
On July 14, the Regulation of Interception Bill was hastily passed inspite of the concerns that it would infringe on citizens' right to privacy.
Finally, in early August, President Museveni issued a policy directive to the Ministry of Finance to remove taxes on security equipment.
Nathan Igeme Nabeta, Chairperson Parliamentary CommitteeICT, says it will be some time before the Regulation of Interception Law is operational.
The government requires funds to equip and run a communication monitoring center and these were not provided for in 2009/2010 budget.
Nabeta says that right now the law is not useful in the fight against terror.
In May 2002, the Anti terrorism Act was passed, but it has never been made operational.
Amama Mbabazi insisted in parliament that the Regulation of Interception Law was more specific.
Resident District Commissioners have embarked on an exercise to push Local Councils back into community policing.
Nakawa Resident District Commissioner Fred Bamwine has ordered Local Councils to resume some of their former policing roles.
However, until fresh LC elections are held in line with the April 2, 2007 Constitutional Court ruling they cannot dispense justice in minor cases.
The 2007 ruling nullified the election of village and parish councils and ordered that new ones be elected under the multi party political order.
Designed to provide a platform through which political parties and organisations collaborate with the Electoral Commission.
Article 20 provides for a National Consultative Forum to have a chairman nominated from a party with the most representation in parliament.
Sam Rwakojo, the Electoral Commission secretary, explained to the twenty eight parties and organisations that attended the launch.
But the absence of even a single National Resistance Movement representative raised eyebrows.
Ssemujja Ibrahim Nganda, spokes person of IPC, which brings together five political parties wondered why the law was amended.
Nganda suspects wicked play.
With the chairman's chair empty, the opposition Forum for Democratic Change party's Amanya Mushega was nominated as the vice chairperson.
Nganda said that at times people put much importance to the establishment of an organisation.
Asuman Basalirwa, said he does not think the political parties and organisations will benefit from the forum.
Article 67 of the 1995 Uganda constitution states;
"No election candidate shall be denied reasonable access and use of State owned communication media".
Basalirwa said, for example, if it had been established earlier, the Forum would have dealt with the reconstitution of the Electoral Commission.
The independence of the Electoral Commission is doubted by the opposition parties.
The forum was a prerequisite under the Public Procurement Oversight Authority that was passed by parliament on March 20, 2002.
Basalirwa predicts that the Forum will be of no help between now and February 2011, when the general elections will be held.
It is six months to the next elections and it is obvious the forum has many issues to address.
President Museveni, who is the chairman of the NRM and appoints the Electoral Commission, has said he will not change its composition.
The launch was at Hotel Africana Kampala on August.
Rwakoojo conducted over seventeen meetings together with all Electoral Commission commissioners.
The EC chairman, Engineer. Badru Kiggundu and Rwakoojo, said they would ensure that political parties comply with the code of conduct.
Nganda told the Independent that the leadership does not matter but what matters is how decisions are arrived at.
Basalirwa agrees that if the leader of the forum has good will, then the forum will succeed in addressing the issues.
National Resistance Movement absence threatens party forum launch.
Last week the police blocked a meeting by the Democratic Party faction led by Samuel Lubega at Nsambya Youth Sharing Hall in Kampala.
The meeting was to discuss terms under which they would join the Interparty Cooperation, a loose alliance of five political parties.
The faction relocated the meeting to Kabusu village and resolved to join the Inter Party Corporation.
The officially recognised DP said that they had summoned the five leaders of the Lubega faction to the party's disciplinary committee.
Simon Peter Ochieng, said they had not received any letter calling them to appear before the disciplinary committee.
He said Mao's group only summoned them through a press conference for publicity purposes.
Ochieng said that Mao's group loves media attention.
He said they pulled the same action on August 18 when they went to meet the Inter Party Corporation leaders and called journalists to escort them.
Salaam Musumba, approves that Mao's group went to meet the Inter Party Corporation for publicity purposes.
Musumba described Mao's decision to meet Inter Party Corporation leaders as a childish check to attract publicity.
The Mao group's sudden change of attitude was very surprising given that they have been publicly minimizing the Inter Party Corporation.
Musumba said they were not interested in spoiling in childish politics.
She said the Inter Party Corporation had written to the Mao group to join Inter Party Corporation but they refused.
They later decided to examine the legal and political implications of accepting one faction of Democratic Party when the other is out.
The Inter Party Corporation then subjected the issue to a legal and political survey.
Musumba said, it was then Mao and his group came accompanied by journalists to meet the Inter Party Corporation.
She said it appears Mao's Democratic Party is neither interested in joining the Inter Party Corporation nor cooperating with them on anything.
Mao had said after the Inter Party Corporation meeting that Democratic Party was up to exploring the form.
The Mao group wants to field their own presidential candidate but can cooperate with the Inter Party Corporation on other areas.
Mao also said he supports the Inter Party Corporation position to have the current Electoral Commission changed.
Musumba said this was Mao's trick to hinder the IPC from considering the option of accepting the other Democratic Party faction.
However Mathias Nsubuga, the secretary general of the Mao Democratic Party, said it's the Inter Party Corporation who invited them for a meeting.
Musumba removed Nsubuga's claim.
She said Mao's group came for other reasons other than the invitation because they had long ignored it.
Some members of the Inter Party Corporation say they have put on hold the decision to accept one Democratic Party group.
Dr Frank Nabwiso believes the two groups can reconcile.
But the Lubega faction is looking at admission into the Inter Party Corporation rather than reconcile with the Mao group.
In an interview with Lubega before Mbale conference early this year, his position on joining Inter Party Corporation was the same as Mao's.
The Democratic Party would not join the Inter party Cooperation because the party always lost their members in such unions.
Observers say he was one sided to take his Democratic Party camp into the 2011 elections without the backing of other opposition parties.
They were also facing a lot of pressure from the Mao group.
The Mao group ignored reconciliation with the Lubega group.
Nsubuga said that court declared Mao the lawful leader of the Democratic Party.
He says the Lubega group must succumb to Mao, who was elected in the Mbale Delegates Conference.
Both Democratic Party groups have been holding similar activities since the Mbale conference.
Mukasa Mbidde told the Independent that they asked the police to block the meeting of the Lubega's group in Nsambya Sharing Hall.
According to the Independent issue on August 27- September 02, 2010, Mubatsi reported, Mao seeks to work with the Inter Party Cooperation.
The Inter Party Cooperation brings together five opposition parties.
Four of the five parties nominated their candidates except Uganda People's Congress.
The Ugandan People's Congress, the third largest opposition party in parliament, did not attend the nominations at Kololo Airstrip.
The nomination was extended to August 23 to give Uganda People's Congress time to nominate its candidate, but the deadline elapsed.
This time Otunnu pointed out unresolved issues under the Inter Party Cooperation arrangement which must be sorted out first.
It's not the pending arrest of Otunnu that had prevented the Uganda People's Congress from nominating its candidate to Inter Party Cooperation.
It provided practical coverage for growing conflicts within the Inter Party Congress.
The Inter Party Congress will nominate the joint candidate on August 31.
There is a strong feeling that the Inter Party Cooperation is being run mainly by the Federation of Democratic Change.
The UPC says the Federation of Democratic Change is running Inter Party Cooperation activities without involving the other participating parties.
Sources within the Ugandan People's Congress say that the party wants Otunnu to be the Inter Party Congress joint candidate.
The Uganda People's Congress supported the Democratic Party's Paul Ssemogerere in the first interparty union in 1996 and Kizza Besigye in 2001.
The Uganda People's Congress will not settle for anything short of Otunnu being the automatic Inter Party Cooperation flag bearer.
They would rather quit the Inter Party Cooperation arrangement and contest in 2011 as a party rather than an alliance.
They say Otunnu's cabinet is completely against their leader.
It was set up by the Uganda People's Congress.
The rejection of the Electoral Commission was advanced by Olara Otunu.
The Forum for Democratic Change has since diverted it into pretending it was their idea.
Why did they take part in the elections even though they knew that the Electoral Commission was for the National Resistance Movement?
The Uganda People's Congress participated in the 2006 elections as well, which were presided over by the same Electoral Commission.
The Uganda People's Congress is questioning why the Forum for Democratic Change did not reject the Electoral Commission in 2006.
It's clear that the Inter Party Congress partnership was hurriedly entered without much thought into the details of how it would work.
The Uganda People's Congress claims that it never supported the idea of a joint candidate at this stage of the elections.
Our initial agreement in the Inter Party Congress was that we jointly fight the political harassment and the election malpractices.
Without a fifty percent win Museveni would be forced to go for a re-run.
The Uganda People's Congress says the Forum for Democratic Change has changed from that position.
This hot fallout was mainly between the Forum for Democratic Change and the Uganda People's Congress.
When the parties came out of the meeting Otunnu made an unreal statement that the Uganda People's Congress has never said.
He did not clarify whether he would submit himself for Inter Party Cooperation nominations.
The confusion made it worse when Otunnu said he could not readily say he would be nominated by August 31.
Otunnu told the press that the Uganda People's Congress will decide accordingly after they have reviewed the Inter Party Congress decisions.
Lukyamuzi, Besigye and Kyanjo asked Otunnu if the Uganda People's Congress was withdrawing from the Inter Party Congress.
They were welcomed with songs of Uganda Patriotic Movement as they took up their seats.
It was the birth of the Uganda Patriotic Movement.
Yoweri Museveni was the temporary chairman and vice chairman of the Military Commission.
These people, together with many others, found themselves unable to join either the Uganda People's Congress or the Democratic Party.
Museveni warned that the Ugandan people are fed up with dictatorship and are now concerned about a disciplined democracy.
The Uganda Patriotic Movement includes groups like the Front for National Salvation which fought Amin for eight years.
Museveni warned that anyone who has the ambition of becoming a dictator in Uganda would be pushed out.
The categories laid down by Mozambican freedom fighters for their grades as criminals used by the freedom fighters against their colleagues.
Museveni declared amidst a laughter, that the question does not arise because Obote is welcome to join the movement.
Museveni stressed that membership is open to all.
He said that cleanliness in leadership is one of the rarest commodities in Uganda.
The Uganda Patriotic Movement supports a mixed economy.
Museveni added that by capitalism, he did not mean those people who sell toilet paper and therefore call themselves capitalists.
Ugandans need to start manufacturing.
A man called Museveni was just an importer of shoes while another, Kasaija wanted to start producing shoes in Uganda.
The movement would encourage Kasaija because of the multiplier effect his enterprise would have on the economy.
It developed Europe from a backward old continent to a scientific economy.
Museveni said that the Uganda Patriotic Movement's differences with the Democratic Party are historical.
The Democratic Party is identified with some social groups and continues to have this image even now.
We supported the Uganda National Liberation Front because it covered us up.
Some of us belonged to the Uganda People's Congress.
The acting chairman of the Uganda Patriotic Movement concluded the meeting.
Museveni warns of war in case the elections are rigged.
Otuunu said the Uganda people's Congress has no problem whatsoever with the Inter Party Cooperation processes taking their course.
Besigye, the Inter Party Cooperation chairperson, said the standoff had been caused by poor communication between the cooperating parties.
Besigye said, there was a problem of communication that led to people coming up with different perceptions.
This means the issues were not resolved in the meeting, which had been meant to bring the Uganda People's Congress back on board.
Besigye insisted they had discussions and drawn up a road map to follow in choosing a presidential flag bearer on August 31.

Mangu is just one of over eight thousand people that were left homeless by the mudslides.
Eighty nine people were killed and more than three thousand are missing in the Mount Elgon Village of Nametsi.
At least eight thousand one hundred seventy seven Internally displaced people live in Bulucheke camp.

Kubi sounded this call while addressing journalists at a two day workshop.
According to the Independent issue of September 17-23, 2010, by Patrick Matsiko stated that the Movement was formed thirty years ago.
In 1980, when it first contested elections, it was the Uganda Patriotic Movement political party.
Unlike Museveni, Eriya Kategaya, Amanya Mushega, Amama Mbabazi, Bidandi Ssali nolonger hold the same position they did 30 years ago.
So does Ruhakana Rugunda.
This means that the survival of National Resistance Movement depends on the existence of Museveni.
There are no permanent interests that hold the Movement together apart from the worship of Museveni's personality.
The things that held the Movement together from 1980 to 1986 have since faded away.
President Museveni justified his 1981 rebellion because Milton Obote cheated in the 1980 elections
Milton Obote did this by using violence and intimidation against the opposition.
During his 25 year rule as president, the National Resistance Movement has failed to organise free and fair elections.
The first presidential elections were held in 1996 ten years after he captured power in 1986.
During the election campaign, Museveni released his opponent, Paul Ssemogerere, who had no counterpart in the Great Lakes region.
In 2001, this political defeat led to the birth of a second Movement called the Reform Agenda.
The second Movement comprised of deserters from the first Movement who were disgusted by the narrowing democratic space.
It was led by Dr Kizza Besigye, a retired colonel who had formerly served as National Resistance Movement's national political supervisor.
The Forum for Democratic Change also comprised other former National Resistance Movement members.
The Reform Agenda was contesting power in the 2001 elections.
Besigye fled the country for four years and many of his supporters were also harrased out of the country.
Besigye returned in 2005 for a second battle with Museveni and by 2006, the second Movement had grown in number and strength.
The dissatisfied National Resistance Movement candidates had become discontented under the manner in which the 2006 election had been held.
They claimed that the NRM 2006 party primaries had been rigged and decided to contest the general elections as independent candidates.
They remained loyal to the National Resistance Movement once they succeeded on individual merit.
About ninety five percent of the thirty seven independent Members of Parliament are connected to the National Resistance Movement.
A common political front challenged the National Resistance Movement existing condition.
They cannot stand up as a force to challenge Museveni for the state power today.
There was recent chaos in the National Resistance Movement primaries.
They are cursing the National Resistance Movement for messing up the election.
As long as they are benefiting personally under the National Resistance Movement, they are willing to tolerate the rot and remain loyal.
And for that reason Museveni and the National Resistance Movement will not treat them harshly.
Democratic free and fair elections have never been a value dearly and deeply held by the National Resistance Movement.
It has only been used to give the National Resistance Movement a democratic face in the public.
That's why it has been easy for the National Resistance Movement to abandon the 1980 promise of free and fair elections.
One of the values to which the National Resistance Movement has not withdrawn on is, joining of power.
They pursued it as a matter of life and death through the bush war in 1981.
The events in the recent National Resistance Movement primaries, Museveni did not go to the bush to fight Milton Obote for rigging elections.
The National Resistance Movement party has a chaos and selfish history.
According to Andrew Mwenda, Besigye is right compared to Otunnu.
Besigye shares a similar feeling but believes that the demand for electoral reform should be incidential.
I agree with Otunnu in principle but side with Besigye on the matter of practical politics.
Otunnu does not appreciate the hard choices the opposition is faced with.
The opposition will now have a platform to register its grievances and demands before the wider Ugandan public.
It will give President Museveni an opportunity to run a one man show.
I often find most freedom and accountability activists in Uganda missing in this important communication.
I made this point during the Temangalo debate.
The procurement process in the National Social Security Fund was full of changes.
It was better to hold the fund to account for delivering five thousand cheap houses in Temangalo and hang Amama Mbabazi later.
The naive and emotional gossiping classes of Kampala were swayed by their personal desires.
We lost both ways, the project failed and Mbabazi was not punished.
Uganda's opposition has huge technological and economic opportunities that it can build on to defeat Museveni.
The opposition has grown its base from twenty four percent of the vote in 1996 to forty one percent in the last election.
Uganda should have a perfect election process.
Karl Popper in his book, Conjectures and Refutations, offered the best insight.
It is unlikely that Uganda can get a free and fair election today.
Otunnu had a passionate desire with digging out the past of Luwero and the Northern War.
America was involved in an endless debate on slavery.
Majority of Ugandan voters are between the ages of eighteen and thirty.
They were too young to care about what happened in Luwero.
Making Luwero an electoral issue in 2010 meant discussing issues that interest 1% of voters.
People in northern Uganda have suffered a million and one injustices under Museveni's rule.
Andrew Mwenda is the founder and owner of the independent news magazine.
Joseph Ocheng is a Ugandan journalist born in Kotido district, nothern Uganda.
Otunnu does not seem to understand the difficult choices to be made by the opposition.
According to the Independent issue of September 17-23, 2010, Mubatsi stated that election chaos threatened to obstruct the NRM primaries.
Gideon Badagamawa, an expert on environment and natural resources, explains that plastic is non biodegradable hence affets soils.
Badagamawa says over fifty percent imports of food come to Africa, not because we cannot produce food but because our soils have degenerated because they are chocked with plastics.
Badagamawa says that well managed recycling programs can reduce pollution.
In poor countries like Uganda, reducing plastic usage is not an easy task.
Uganda manufactures warned that banning plastics, which are largely used for packaging, would increase costs of production.
It would also increase prices of consumer goods.
Uganda Plastic Manufacturers and Recycling Association intend to continue to lobby the government for support.
Lukwiya revealed that Acaye Ecomog sent his six children to government and is being urged to come out and look after his children.
Lotiba was instructed to deploy soldiers to attack Sudan People's Liberation Army camps and loot food.
Otti claimed that he checked the area where he got in contact with Uganda Peoples Defence Forces.
Otti bragged that Uganda Peoples Defence Forces has paid him salary indirectly.
Otti suspected Okulu's squad to be the one which attacked a location in Madi.
Lukwiya reported that Okulu Ben met Labongo and they separated some days back.
Kapere met Lagulu across undisclosed river today.
Labongo reported that he is trying to meet Okuti after getting information that his and Okuti's squads met in undisclosed location.
Dominic instructed Okuti to move with the entire group to join him after meeting.
Ocan Bunia revealed that his medical condition is deteriorating and commented that he has put it in God's hands.
Angola reported to Kony that Uganda Peoples Defence Forces attacked him and among the dead is a captain.
In reaction to Kony's orders, Angola reported clearly that he failed to control Acaye Ecomog.
The news of Acaye Ecomog and Angola's reaction to Kony's orders to command other commanders, has put Kony in another state of confusion.
It is a big sign of loss of command and control on Kony's side.
We expect Kony to harass and use Lukwiya as his army commander to arrest that situation.
Kony's prescriptions to Ocan Bunia's disease looks a gamble.
If his commanders who are already with questionable loyalty take note of Ocan Bunia's disease, it could increase their negative attitude.
Uganda Peoples Defence Forces should be informed of Angola's stand, so his position could be constantly attacked to destroy his morale.
UPDF propaganda desk should exploit Kony's guesswork on prescribing the various medicine for Ocan Bunia which have not worked.
Opio Makas was directed to fragment his and Lotiba's force into smaller groups to avoid Uganda Peoples Defence Forces pursuit.
If Makas does what he has been told, he will reach safely especially now that it is too bushy for the gunship to observe well.
Makas was reminded that Equatoria Defence Force are also potential enemies of Lords Resistance Army.
Kony stated clearly that these days he does not trust his soldiers because their minds are mixed up and believes that's why they are escaping.
Lukwiya could not get Kony clearly when he asked him his plans now that Lukwiya is near the border.
Kony ordered Lukwiya to cross the border.
Labongo reported that he met Okuti Okello.
Okuti was intercepted by Uganda Peoples Defence Forces while he was coming from ambush.
One of the officers who is a son of Labongo's aunt died with three others.
Labongo narrated that Ayoli is talking on the Frequency Modulation radios.
Lotiba reported that he heard some gunshots about a kilometer from his location.
Uganda Peoples Defence Forces have gone back to their base.
The UPC party president Dr. Olara Otunnu announced the party's withdrawal from Interparty Cooperation on August thirtieth.
He said the Uganda People's Congress position was not to take part in an election.
Otunnu restated this position during a media briefing last week.
He said that there was widespread election violence in the recent National Resistance Movement primaries.
Information from inside Uganda People's Congress shows that Otunnu could be facing a near riot within its own party.
Yona Kanyomoozi is a former Minister of Cooperatives and Marketing in the Obote two regime from one thousand eighty to eighty five.
He says he will stand as an independent candidate in Ntungamo in next year's elections.
Kanyomozi was also a candidate in the March Uganda People's Congress party presidential elections.
The Uganda People's Congress withdrawal from the Inter Party Cooperation was a huge mistake which is likely to kill the party.
He says it would be yet another big error not to participate in the two thousand eleven general elections.
Otunnu is behaving like Obote did in one thousand nine hundred ninety four.
Only five people from the Uganda People's Congress were in that assembly.
Otunnu is doing what Obote did by pulling out of the Inter Party Cooperation, which is also a very big mistake.
My supporters have urged me to stand for the Ntungamo Municipality parliamentary seat and I can not let them down.
I am going to stand as an independent and as a Uganda People's Congress because that is where I belong.
Inside sources said former UPC presidential contenders Jimmy Akena, Joseph Ochieno and Henry Mayega will contest in two thousand eleven.
By the time of filing this story, Ochieno was reportedly upcountry campaigning.
Sospater Akwenyu is the chairman Uganda People's Congress Kaberamaido district.
"We have another Congressman Alfred Ewatu who wants to stand so I stepped down for him," said Akwenyu.
Uganda People Congress will participate in the general elections or maintain its boycott stand, Akwenyu said.
We shall tell the people of Uganda our position when we have reached the bridge.
Akwenyu serves on Otunnu's cabinet.
In the Independent last week, Otunnu said that Uganda People's Congress had encountered a fork in the road.
Some members from Uganda People's Congress disobeyed the directive of the party President Milton Obote in one thousand nine hundred eighty nine.
Two weeks after the March Uganda People's Congress party presidential elections, appointments made by Otunnu were rejected.
They both questioned why Otunnu had made the appointments without consulting them.
Sources say that the growing rebellion against Otunnu in the Uganda People's Congress stems from his association with the anti Obote faction.
This faction is the gang of four that controls the Milton Obote Foundation and the investment wing of the Uganda People's Congress.
It is said that this gang supported Otunnu to take the Uganda People's Congress presidency.
Kanyomoozi shares the view that Otunnu's problems stem from his links with the Gang of Four.
Otunnu is under intensive pressure from a group known in Uganda People's Congress circles as the gang of four.
Mindra was the corporation secretary of the Milton Obote Foundation.
They are uncontrollably against the Obote family.
The gang succeeded in defeating the Obote family as represented by Jimmy Akena at Nambole during the UPC presidential elections.
Walubiri, one of the said gang of four, did not cut up words in expressing his opposition to the Obotes.
Our problem started when some of Obote's family members thought leadership in the party was by succession which we opposed on principle.
Similar groups emerged in the one thousand nine hundred sixties after independence.
It also involved pro and anti Obote forces within Uganda People's Congress.
Opposing Democratic Party lost key constituencies to rival parties by Dicta Asiimwe.
The Democratic Party Secretary General Mathias Nsubuga is defiant.
He courageously says Democratic Party will take over state power in the two thousand eleven general elections.
Nsubuga says the Democratic Party President Norbert Mao commands the highest appeal to the youth.
Nsubuga's claims appear to be at variance with the events on September thirty first.
Ssuubi has absorbed many members of Democratic Party.
Prior to the two thousand six general elections, Democratic Party was the king maker in Kampala.
In that year's election, Charles Musoke Sserunjogi was replaced by Godfrey Nyakaana as Kampala Central division chairperson.
The mayorship went to Hajji Nasser Sebaggala.
Deo Kijjambu was the Democratic Party Kampala district treasurer.
Erias Lukwago captured the Kampala Central Member of Parliament seat from Francis Babu.
Today Democratic Party leads in only two divisions out of the five.
Protazio Kintu is Local council three Chairman for Nakawa Division.
The Democratic Party also leads three out of Kampala's eight parliamentary constituencies.
The party has three Members of Parliament only in Kampala Central, Kawempe North and Kawempe South.
Kampala district Democratic Party chairman, Vincent Mayanja, laments that the party is ceding ground to other parties in the city.
Mayanja, like the Democratic Party Secretary General Nsubuga, claims they will take back Kampala.
They were carrying out primary elections while another Democratic Party group of Sam Lubega was electing their own flag bearers elsewhere.
Democratic Party will have candidates from the same party competing against each other for votes from the same supporters.
Democratic Party's trouble is not only Lubega's group.
Erias Lukwago is the Kampala Central Member of Parliament.
Mao group held their elections for the Democratic Party Kampala Central flag bearer on August twenty eighth.
Mayanja said the party pleaded with Lukwago to send his nomination application for Democratic Party's flag but he never did.
Lukwago said that he could not subscribe to one group of the party.
He said he would only participate after the two groups have reconciled, which looks unlikely to happen.
Most likely Lukwago will join Forum for Democratic Change which has cultivated a strong opposition presence in and around Kampala.
Initially Lukwago wanted to become the mayor of Kampala.
He had been told that Parliament was set to pass the Kampala takeover bill when Members of Parliament returned from the recess.
If that happens, he says, he will stand for Kampala Central Member of Parliament.
Democratic Party will have two candidates Lukwago and Yawe.
This will give advantage to Forum for Democratic Change and National Resistance Movement candidates.
The Interparty Cooperation is now inviting National Resistance Movement losers.
Those troubled by National Resistance Movement's rigging machinery should join the cooperation in the "struggle for free and fair elections".
The opposition seems to be attempting to seize the opportunity of the fights within National Resistance Movement.
The Inter Party Cooperation told the press about the violence witnessed in the National Resistance Movement primary elections.
The Inter Party Cooperation condemned the election violence and rigging.
IPC chairman and presidential flag bearer Doctor Kizza Besigye says what happens in political parties is a matter of public concern.
It would be wrong for Inter Party Cooperation to keep quiet as National Resistance Movement spreads violence on its members in elections.
The Inter Party Cooperation punished the National Resistance Movement for involving the police and the army in its elections.
Besigye pointed out that police were assigned to deliver National Resistance Movement electoral materials.
Robert Isoke was detailed to monitor and investigate the alleged ballot stuffing in Kabarole district.
Besigye said these are clear cases of partisan behaviour that security forces are exhibiting which must stop.
The Inter Party Cooperation described these actions as criminal and called for prosecution of the culprits.
The violence in NRM primaries has given the Inter Party Cooperation reason to press for a new national Electoral Commission.
The Inter Party Cooperation says the National Resistance Movement election mismanagement will show up into the national Electoral Commission.

Denis Mbidde, a local football enthusiast believes that the new arrangement presents an opportunity for a fresh start.
Mbidde says that the new administration will give rise to a well shaped structure compared to the current set up.
He explains that Fufa is currently overwhelmed by many responsibilities.
Fufa runs district football, first division, second division, women football, Uganda Cranes and Uganda Kobs.
The fresh start that Mbidde dreams of is around the corner.
The Fufa Chief Executive Officer, Edgar Watson, is right.
The ongoing painting exhibition by emerging artist James Sensalire came as no particular surprise to regular art observers.
Sensalire claims that there are certain environmental features that are fast becoming extinct because of human activities.

Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa that was Uganda's fifth president since independence, was a strong hearted freedom fighter and adventurous.
We were together in Uganda National Congress from 1956 up to early 1960 when we split due to internal disagreements.
Uganda National Congress, the party which spread the gospel of nationalism and fought for Uganda's independence was founded by six men.
Musazi was the founding President General and Abubaker Mayanja founding Secretary General.
Binaisa's early life was adventurous.
After Makerere University, he went to London without much financial support.
He raised tuition fees by digging graves in London.
This is what he used to tell us in Katwe in 1957 during our conversations about life.

Muwanga requested then to take the message to Buzabo and all the Democratic Party supporters to stop the dirty politics immediately.
The liberty which was brought by the Uganda People's Congress cost people's lives some died in Lake Victoria, others between Mutukula and Arua.
They sacrificed their lives for the freedom of everyone in Uganda.
Muwanga warned that members of different parties should not claim to have an upper hand on others by molesting them.
Muwanga talked to the Uganda people's Congress in Mbirizi, Masaka South-West constituency.
The 65 year old chairman who effectively participated in last years' liberation war which removed Amin was among the speakers.
The youth of Uganda People's Congress will spearhead the reconstruction and development task.
The first thing the Uganda People's Congress will do as soon as it comes to power will be to engage the youth in productive work.
Uganda People's Congress youths will spearhead this so as to set an example to the rest.
Muwanga also appealed to Ugandans to strive hard and establish mutual respect for each other.
At Bwezibwera, the chairman pledged, never again shall the Uganda People's Congress allow Uganda to be humiliated as it was in the Amin's days.
Never shall Uganda be characterized with the life of scarcities of essential commodities.
Uganda People's Congress needs determined characters who would stand with this nation even in difficult times.
Commenting on the Democratic Party led by Paulo Kawanga Semogerere, he said it was characterized by contradictions.
He commended Semogerere for his ability to lead a party that was almost torn apart by contradictions.
The Democratic Party, the serious contender with the Uganda People's Congress in the polls, had given away more than 10 parliamentary seats.

According to the independent on Jul 30- August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumire reported that a young woman in Soroti was raped while returning home.
The 28 year old Grace Nakasi, a victim of an insurgency in eastern Uganda, was pulled off the road to the bush and gang-raped by the men in uniform.
I was living in Soroti town.
I met nine soldiers on patrol at about seven o'clock in the evening.
Nakasi begins her story by narrating how they all raped her and abandoned her by the roadside.
This was 1987, a year after President Yoweri Museveni had captured power and announced a fundamental change.
One year later, Nakasi received information that her parents had been killed by rebels.
Nakasi narrated to us how she decided to go to the bus park to take a bus to visit her home.
It was on the way to the bus park that Nakasi became a victim of the second rape.
Nakasi met four National Resistance Army soldiers, two of them dragged her off the road and forced themselves on her.
There was a meeting with Ugandan women's groups under the support of the Women's International Cross-Cultural Exchange during the AU summit.
The Africa Union Summit took place in Kampala the capital city of Uganda.
Nakasi a mother of 12 children, a resident of Soroti, was raped 16 times, infected with HIV and later thrown out of her marital home by the husband.
It's a touching narrative and a wider reflection of the tribulations women face in Africa's conflict-torn regions.
She is one of the faces of Ugandan women that carry the burden of sexual violence.
For the past decade, Uganda has been applauded on the world stage as a successful story in the fight against the Human immunodeficiency Virus.
Women who were harrased by the Lord's Resistance Army rebels have been affected by HIV more than any other women in the rest of the country.
The sexual violence by both the Lord Resistance Army and government soldiers has left behind a traumatized and stressed generation of women.
In 1990, Nakasi was again gang-raped by men whom she believes were government soldiers.
She was admitted to Butabika Mental Rehabilitation Hospital in Kampala for several months after the rape incident.
In 2002, Nakasi took an HIV test.
But the day I told him I had tested HIV positive, he threw me out of the house, Nakasi narrates in a tone of courage that has defied many odds.
Nakasi was excommunicated from the community.
A ray of hope emerged in 2007.
Nakasi was rescued by World Vision International which paid for her operation to remove her uterus which helps eliminate the fistula condition.
After the treatment, she and other women, who are victims of sexual violence, started a support group called Teso Peace Women's Activists.
Nakasi's story is heartbreaking.
According to the Independent issue of July 30-August 05, 2010, Rosebell Kagumi wrote an article about women and girls who are abandoned after rape.
Nakasi said the young girl's parents died in the war and now at nine no one wants to take care of her yet has six orphans under her care.
Nakasi's story is not unique in Uganda's war-ravaged communities.
She told the Independent that about 40 women within just one sub-county of Tubur in Soroti where she works suffer from vaginal fistula due to rape.
Nakasi and other HIV- positive women regularly walk many miles from Tubur to get life pronging drugs.
Nakasi has managed to get funds from Women's International Cross-Cultural Exchange and Urgent Action Fund Africa.
Nakasi will use the funds to help orphans and provide medicines to people living with HIV in her village.
I tend to think that Semogerere is only unfortunate to lead such men.
The heinous incident marked the dawn of repeated sexual violence against Nakasi and many other women in conflict areas.
Reports indicated that the majority of voters had cast their ballots within three hours of polls opening.
For Kagame's supporters, the cheerful mood from the campaign will reenergize the Rwanda Patriotic Font base.
Display of the National Voter's Register is from eleventh to thirty first August two thousand ten.
The Electoral Commission has appointed eleventh August to thirty first August two thousand ten for Display of the National Voters' Register.

The interparty organisations dialogue hosted Democratic reforms at Munyonyo Resort.
InterParty Organisation for Dialogue brings together political parties with representation in parliament.
The InterParty Organisation for Dialogue comprises of the ruling party and the opposition parties.
The president said It is the ultimate responsibility of all Africans to promote dialogue and fight dictatorship.
He argued that the dialogue must be based on issues that are important to the African people.
The opposition parties suggested reforms in the method of constituting the Electoral Commission to ensure a level ground.
In his book, Sowing the Mustard Seed, Museveni writes that Paulo Muwanga's government refused to amend the electoral law.
All the Uganda People's Congress members wanted the fa√ßade of an election in order to legitimise the coup.
The electoral law reforms the president is writing about are the same reforms the opposition parties are demanding today.
Museveni too rejected the opposition's call for electoral law reforms just like Muwanga in one thousand nine hundred eighty.
The Election Commission is very competent with people of high integrity.
The struggle for electoral law reforms in Uganda has been on since one thousand nine hundred eighty.
The results of one thousand nine hundred eighty general elections were contested and a rebellion ensued.
About five hundred thousand Ugandans died during the five-year insurgency that brought Museveni to power.
Museveni gave one of the reasons for the National Resistance Army rebellion.
The Supreme Court ruled that the Electoral Commission failed to conduct free and fair elections in two thousand one and six.
This is the same commission the president insists is too competent to be changed.
Uganda has held four elections since one thousand nine hundred eighty.
The participating political parties in the electoral process are suspicious of the independence of the Electoral Commission.
The Electoral Commission organises credible elections without due influence from the ruling party.
Many analysts say that the selection of Electoral Commission members must be by a neutral committee comprising Ugandans of national integrity.
The Electoral Commission members especially the chairperson and secretary should never again be persons handpicked by the ruling party alone.
It should be the national consensus committee of great persons that should supervise and judge the work of the Electoral Commission.
The national consensus committee resorts to courts of laws in its supervision of the Electoral Commission.
Uganda's political opposition groups agree with this proposal.

AMISOM as the AU and UN mandated peace keeping force has a limited capacity to protect the Presidential Palace, Mogadishu airport.
The Uganda People's Defence Force presence within the AMISOM framework does not answer the needs of the Ugandans.
When the population talks of wiping out Al-Shabaab from Somalia, they mean militarily defeating them thus removing ability of launching attacks.
Since the Uganda People`s Defence Force cannot achieve that goal, the only feasible option is to withdraw from Somalia.
We can then, as a member state of the UN, ask the UN Security Council for a mandate forcefully invade Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab.
This strategy would allow Uganda to launch attacks against the Al-Shabaab.

During its National Executive Conference in January, the NRMovement declared it had registered 8 million members including the under age.
This was before the EC started the national voter registration exercise which also yielded about 15 million voters, up from 10 million in 2006.
The NRM has been registering people it calls its members across the country.
The Electoral Commission also doubts the authenticity of the NRM figures.
Early this year, the NRM also doubted the genuineness of the EC's national voter register, alleging that it contained two million ghost names.
Uganda's demographic statistics put the 2009 population projections to 30.6 million.
This implies that 14.2 million Ugandans are above 18 and thus qualified to register as voters.
Population estimates published by the Population Secretariat rise even more questions on the Electro Commission's 15 million voters.
The estimates for 2010 show Ugandans of 18 years and above are 13.9 million, up from 12.9 million in 2008.
Given the high apathy among Ugandans to register for voting and death of some registered voters, the number of new voters would be fewer.
However, the EC has said this is not the final figure.
Even if some superman had inherited the presidency, it was practically impossible for anyone to govern Uganda.
Various conflicting parties had begun fighting for power back in Moshi sorted out each other.
After the fall of Idi Amin, all successor regimes were nothing but caretakers, stop-gap measures, until the final showdown.
This only happened in one thousand nine hundred eighty-six with President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement emerging as a victor.
It is therefore surprising that Binaisa, in spite of all this, was able to hold on to power for nearly a year.
Ugandans might as well be grateful that here was a man who never craved to be president.
He held Uganda together, made her laugh and was gradually steering her to normality before the forces of instability struck.
He asserted civilian supremacy by demoting the Army Chief of Staff, General Oyite Ojok.
An umbrella government was embraced by National Resistance Movement once it came to power.
Binaisa was also not a corrupt president as his personal life reveals.
Immediately after the loss of his presidency, he fled back to New York where he resumed his law practice.
In the year one thousand nine hundred eighty-six, soon after the National Resistance Movement government had come to power he returned.
He put up an unfinished shell at the top of Mutundwe hill.
He opened a law firm, walked freely on the streets of Kampala as he had nothing to hide.

How many ex-presidents in Africa have had to work for a living once overthrown, given the exploitative regimes prevalent on the continent?
In the 1962 constitution, he always said he had to write the "pigeon hole constitution".
The"pigeon hole constitution" was written to fill a void after the one thousand nine hundred sixty-six crisis.
The 1967 constitution that followed allowed him detention without trial for which he suffered under the British.
The British imprisoned him for a year in Moroto, Karamoja.
Subsequently, he resigned as Attorney General in one thousand nine hundred sixty-seven.
In being opportunistic in his political views, no one can deny that he was a pan African nationalist throughout his life.
Mr Binaisa's nationalism was born out of his personal experiences at the discriminative hands of the British as a student.
Mr Binaisa was an enterprising African miner and resident in Britain in the early fifties.
Shortly after returning from Britain in one thousand nine hundred fifty-six, he joined the Uganda National Congress under Mr Ignatius Musaazi.
He got disillusioned with Musaazi's leadership walked out on him to be led by Apollo Obote under the Uganda Peoples Congress.
Though descending from a royal lineage Binaisa was willing to risk the anger of his Baganda tribesmen for his republican beliefs.
He always opposed the separatist politics of the Mengo government.
Here he was ahead of his time as the Mengo government has since abandoned the idea of a secessionist government.
Mahmood Mamdani has also pointed the failure of the Baganda to play a leading role in the national affairs of this country.
Men like Binaisa and Luyimbazi Zake were willing to pay the price.
Binaisa was a very committed and excellent lawyer well respected by his peers.
He was the first Queen's Counsel in East and Central Africa, served the Judicial Service Commission, headed the Law Society of Uganda!
As shown whenever out of political office Binaisa never hesitated to return to the bar and practice his trade.
However, his legal career, much like that of fellow lawyer Nelson Mandela suffered many arrests.
As Mandela points out in the Long Walk to Freedom the times could not allow a normal person to live normally.

The number of malaria cases in Apac in a year is higher compared to Kabale.
Research from the year one thousand nine hundred ninety-four to two thousand five in some districts in Uganda shows higher malaria cases in Apac.
In Uganda, malaria accounts for twenty-five to forty per cent of outpatient visits to health facilities.
In Uganda malaria is responsible for nearly half of inpatient child deaths.
I had never seen Museveni as happy as this.
The pictures showing President Museveni laughing at his own jokes by a comedian bring some healing to the nation that has been under attack.
My gratitude goes to that brilliant comedian Herbert Ssegujja for a job well done and deserving acknowledgement.
In the hectic schedule and duties of the President, sometimes it is good to ease his stress levels given his demanding office.
When the President is happy good things are likely to happen.
That is why a gesture of comedy like that of Ssegujja is necessary.
Great job Ssegujja.
Give National Resistance Movement a knockout to overcome rigging.
The attitude of some of our western brothers is that: "if the natives are not killing each other too much, support the side with the bigger club".
Our presidents have learnt those lessons well.
Your greatest resource ultimately is the people of Uganda.

In a recent interview, former acting Managing Director of National Social Security Fund Grace Isabirye highlighted that the Fund is being reformed.
Grace Isabirye was engaging in a discussion to collect views from various parties like the National Organisation of Trade Union.
This came as exciting news to the National Social Security Fund contributors.
Now that Isabirye has left, I hope his vision will be taken up by his successor Richard Byarugaba.
Byarugaba and his board of directors should ensure these wonderful ideas by his predecessor are pursued and executed.

Mwenda wrote about it on Saturday evening June nineteenth.
South African police arrested the first suspect in connection with the attempted murder of Lieutenant General Kayumba Nyamwasa.
Lieutenant General Kayumba Nyamwasa who was a former Rwandan High Commissioner to India now turned revolutionary.
The suspect was a retired Captain Francis Gakwerera, a businessman based in Mozambique but also a former soldier.
Francis is a former soldier in the Ugandan, Rwandan army but he finally joined the Congolese army.
Kayumba had a few months earlier escaped from Rwanda and launched a scathing criticism of President Paul Kagame and his government.
It seemed the Rwandan government was behind this attempted assassination.
Gakwerera's profile suggests that he was the right man for such a job.
He is a close family friend of Kayumba; so he knew the victim well.
As a former combatant in three wars in three different countries, Gakwerera admits to having been a sniper.
The relationship between Gakwerera and the Kayumba family was confirmed by Kayumba's wife, Rosette on her Facebook page.
She said Gakwerera is a close friend of the family and could not have been involved in the attempted assassination of her husband.
Gakwerera who was released after five days without any charges also denies involvement.
On Sunday, June twentieth, Kayumba's driver Richard Bachisha was also arrested in connection with the attempted assassination.
An interview with suspect Kayumba shooting showed the unresolved puzzle between Kayumba Nyamwasa and Paul Kagame before they fell out.
He was alongside two other Rwandese, one known as Saad and the other as Rukara.
There were also two other suspects; one from Kenya, and the other from Tanzania.
The arrest of Bachisha was surprising given that he seemed loyal to his boss having helped him escape from Rwanda in the middle of the night.
He escaped from Rwanda on February twenty-eighth.
Bachisha was put in the same jail as Gakwerera.
However, immediately they met, Bachisha poured out his heart to Gakwerera.
He claimed that after Bichisha arrived in South Africa, he was called on the telephone by someone claiming to be Doctor Ndahiro.
Ndahiro asked him to kill Kayumba on behalf of the Rwandan government.
Ndahiro promised to pay him two thousand dollars for the job.
Bichisha claimed that he later met agents sent by this Doctor Ndahiro who gave him only six hundred dollars.
It is here that Bichisha's story becomes even more intriguing.
He claimed that on Wednesday, June sixteenth, three days before Kayumba was shot, the killers came into Kayumba's house at night.
Bichisha told Gakwerera that Kayumba and his wife were sleeping in their bedroom.
According to Bichisha, the assassins left him their contact.
He later telephoned them on Saturday, June nineteenth and told them that he was going to the shopping mall with Kayumba.
As agreed, the killers showed up at the mall where one of them shot Kayumba in the stomach.
Bichisha claims that later that day, Ndahiro called again and asked him to finish off Kayumba adding that this time Kagame had promised a reward.
This is the same story Bichisha later told the South African police and also recorded in his statement.
Bichisha also provided the telephone number from which Ndahiro called.
The Chief of the National Security Services which is Rwanda's national intelligence arm is called Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.
Therefore, Bichisha seems to be referring to him.
First, if these professional assassins knew Kayumba's house and had special keys to enter it, then why did they need Bichisha?
He seems to be a hindrance to their mission.
Second, Bichisha's description of the shooting incident is suspicious.
He claims Mrs Kayumba later corroborated this story that a man approached their car as they left the mall and waved at them angrily to stop.
Bichisha stopped the car and opened the driver's window
The man pulled out a pistol and shot once at Kayumba in the stomach.
The man walked around the car to Kayumba's side where they wrestled for a while before the man fled.
The second reason is that the heroic story of Kayumba wrestling the assassin sounds like a Hollywood movie.
Is this really what happened or this is the version of events Kayumba, his wife and their driver wanted the world to hear?
if Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, would he telephone the General's driver whom he did not know and ask him to collaborate in the effort?
If what Kayumba's driver is saying is true, was someone impersonating Ndahiro?
The fourth reason is that there is no evidence linking Bichisha to those who tried to kill Kayumba.
Even if he was involved, why was he so willing to implicate himself in a case of attempted murder that in South Africa carries up to twenty years in jail?
Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.
To whom was Bichisha working?
Security experts say Bichisha could have been a mole planted inside the prison by South African police to gather information from other suspects.
But there is another twist in the Kayumba shooting incident that places South African authorities in credibility problems.
Bichisha entered South Africa on a Ugandan passport issued on April twenty-first two thousand ten.
It is this passport that Bichisha used when identifying himself before the South African police.
Yet in all their press releases, the South African police have never revealed that one of the suspects is Ugandan.
Gakwerera claims Bichisha's story sounded rehearsed.
Those arrested in connection with the shooting claimed that they had been approached by people who claimed that Kayumba had killed their relatives.
Kayumba was head of Rwanda's National Security Services, the state's intelligence agency.
These people paid them money to kill Kayumba.
However, these Rwandans claimed, since they had been paid in advance, they took the money but did nothing.
The two Rwandan suspects are actually known petty criminals.
The Rwanda government had applied for their extradition accusing them of breaking into its High Commission in Pretoria and stealing property.
South African authorities had been dragging their feet on the case.
There has been a lot of politics in Kayumba's case.
First, on the day he was shot, the deputy president of South Africa showed up at the hospital where Kayumba had been admitted.
He was joined by South Africa's former chief spy, Bill Masetera, a close friend of Patrick Karegyeya also a dissident with Kayumba.
Masetera was the head of South Africa's National Intelligence Agency when Karegyeya was Rwanda's director of External Security.
Masetera later became a security advisor to former South African president, Thabo Mbeki.
The two fell out over allegations that Masetera was secretly enhancing the power of Mbeki's main rival and current president, Jacob Zuma.
Masetera's relationship with Karegyeya became stronger as, he now claims, presidents tend to use and dump their intelligence chiefs.
What was Museveni's game plan in this Kayumba saga?
As top Rehabilitation Project Force officials pondered this issue, "a friend" from the American Central Intelligence Agency called Kigali.
He claimed that Kayumba had sent a message to Museveni seeking contact.
Francis Gakwerera says he lives in Mozambique where he has been running a business since two thousand five.
However, whenever I am travelling between Maputo and Kigali, I travel through South Africa.
I also buy things from South Africa which I sell in Mozambique.
How did you get arrested in relation to shooting Kayumba?
I was in South Africa in transit to Maputo.
I had some business to do in South Africa and also to find a place in a boarding school for my child.
I use South Africa for many things.
I arrived Wednesday and was arrested on Saturday.
The police accused me of being the person who shot Kayumba.
Do you know Kayumba and do the two of you have historical wrangles?
I first met Kayumba in Kitgum in one thousand eighty-seven when he was the Assistant District Administrator.
I was a sergeant in the nineteenth Battalion of the National Riffle Association which is currently call Uganda Peoples Defence Force.
In 1990 we shifted together to Gulu.
On 1st October 1990, we drove in the same motor vehicle to Kagitumba when the Rehabilitation Project Force was launching the struggle.
