As to the rest, then, brothers, we request, and call on you in the Lord Jesus, as you received from us how it is necessary for you to walk and to please God, that you may abound the more, 
for you have known what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus; 
for this is the will of God—your sanctification: that you abstain from the whoredom, 
that each of you know to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that were not knowing God, 
that no one goes beyond and defrauds his brother in the matter, because the LORD is an avenger of all these, as we also spoke to you before and testified, 
for God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification. 
He, therefore, who is despising, does not despise man, but God, who also gave His Holy Spirit to us. 
And concerning the brotherly love, you have no need of my writing to you, for you yourselves are God-taught to love one another, 
for you do it also to all the brothers who are in all Macedonia; and we call on you, brothers, to abound still more, 
and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you, 
that you may walk properly to those outside, and may have lack of nothing. 
And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, that you may not sorrow, as also the rest who have no hope, 
for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God will bring with Him those asleep through Jesus, 
for we say this to you in the word of the LORD, that we who are living—who remain over to the coming of the LORD—may not precede those asleep, 
because the LORD Himself, with a shout, with the voice of a chief-messenger, and with the trumpet of God, will come down from Heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first; 
then we who are living, who are remaining over, will be snatched up together with them in the clouds to meet the LORD in the air, and so we will always be with the LORD; 
so, then, comfort one another with these words. 
And concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need of my writing to you, 
for you have thoroughly known that the Day of the LORD so comes as a thief in the night, 
for when they may say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction comes on them, as the travail on her who is with child, and they will not escape; 
but you, brothers, are not in darkness, that the Day may catch you as a thief; 
you are all sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness, 
so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober, 
for those sleeping, sleep by night, and those making themselves drunk, are drunken by night, 
and we, being of the day—let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and a helmet—a hope of salvation, 
because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who died for us, that whether we wake—whether we sleep—we may live together with Him; 
for this reason, comfort one another, and build up one another, as also you do. 
And we ask you, brothers, to know those laboring among you and leading you in the LORD and admonishing you, 
and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves; 
and we exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient to all; 
see that no one may render evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue that which is good, both to one another and to all; 
always rejoice; 
continually pray; 
give thanks in everything, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you. 
Do not quench the Spirit; 
do not despise prophesyings; 
prove all things; hold fast to that which is good; 
abstain from all appearance of evil; 
and may the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved, unblameably at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
He who is calling you is steadfast, who also will do it. 
Brothers, pray for us. 
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 
I charge you by the LORD, that the letter be read to all the holy brothers. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you! Amen.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! 
We always ought to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith increases greatly, and the love of each one of you all abounds to one another, 
so that we ourselves glory in you in the assemblies of God, for your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you bear— 
a token of the righteous judgment of God, for your being counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you also suffer, 
since it is a righteous thing with God to give back to those troubling you—tribulation, 
and to you who are troubled—rest with us in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from Heaven, with messengers of His power, 
in flaming fire, giving vengeance to those not knowing God, and to those not obeying the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who will suffer justice—continuous destruction—from the face of the LORD, and from the glory of His strength, 
when He may come to be glorified in His holy ones, and to be wondered at by all those believing—because our testimony was believed among you—in that day; 
for which we also always pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of the calling, and may fulfill all the good pleasure of goodness, and the work of faith in power, 
that the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ. 
And we ask you, brothers, in regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together to Him, 
that you are not quickly shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither through spirit, neither through word, neither through letters as through us, as that the Day of the LORD has arrived; 
do not let anyone deceive you in any way, because if the departure may not come first, the man of lawlessness may not be revealed—the son of destruction, 
who is opposing and is raising himself up above all called god or worshiped, so as for him to have sat down in the temple of God, proclaiming that he is God. 
Do you not remember that, yet being with you, I said these things to you? 
And now, you have known what is restraining, for his being revealed in his own time, 
for the secret of lawlessness already works, only the One now restraining will do so until He may come out of the midst, 
and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the LORD will consume with the Spirit of His mouth, and will nullify at the appearance of His coming, 
whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders, 
and in all deceitfulness of the unrighteousness in those perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth for their being saved, 
and because of this God will send to them a working of delusion, for their believing the lie, 
that they may be judged—all who did not believe the truth, but were well pleased in the unrighteousness. 
And we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brothers, beloved by the LORD, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation, in sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, 
to which He called you through our good news, to the acquiring of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
so, then, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions that you were taught, whether through word, whether through our letter; 
and may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who loved us, and gave continuous comfort, and good hope in grace, 
comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work. 
As to the rest, pray, brothers, concerning us, that the word of the LORD may run and may be glorified, as also with you, 
and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for not all are of the faith; 
but faithful is the LORD who will establish you, and will guard you from the evil one; 
and we now have confidence in the LORD, that which we command you both do and will do; 
and the LORD direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ. 
And we command you, brothers, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly, and not after the tradition that you received from us, 
for you have known how it is necessary to imitate us, because we did not act disorderly among you; 
nor did we eat bread of anyone for nothing, but in labor and in travail, working night and day, not to be chargeable to any of you; 
not because we have no authority, but that we might give ourselves to you as a pattern, to imitate us; 
for even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if anyone is not willing to work, neither let him eat, 
for we hear of some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but being busybodies, 
and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that working with quietness, they may eat their own bread; 
and you, brothers, may you not be weary doing well, 
and if anyone does not obey our word through the letter, note this one, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed, 
and do not count as an enemy, but admonish as a brother; 
and may the LORD of peace Himself always give to you peace in every way; the LORD is with you all! 
The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all! Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope, 
to Timotheus—genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord! 
According as I exhorted you to remain in Ephesus—I going on to Macedonia—that you might charge certain ones not to teach any other thing, 
nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the stewardship of God which is in faith. 
And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of unhypocritical faith, 
from which certain men, having swerved, turned aside to vain discourse, 
willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they confidently assert, 
and we have known that the Law is good, if anyone may use it lawfully; 
having known this, that law is not set for a righteous man, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers, 
whoremongers, homosexuals, enslavers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is adverse to sound doctrine, 
according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted. 
And I give thanks to Him who enabled me—Christ Jesus our Lord—that He reckoned me steadfast, having put me to the ministry, 
who before was speaking slander, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did it in unbelief, 
and the grace of our Lord exceedingly abounded, with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus. 
The word is steadfast, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am first; 
but because of this I found kindness, that Jesus Christ might first show forth all long-suffering in me, for a pattern of those about to believe on Him to continuous life. 
And to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God, is honor and glory through the ages of the ages! Amen. 
I commit to you this charge, child Timotheus, according to the prophecies that went before on you, that you may war in them the good warfare, 
having faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away, made shipwreck concerning the faith, 
of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be instructed not to speak evil. 
I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men— 
for kings, and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all piety and gravity, 
for this is right and acceptable before God our Savior, 
who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth; 
for there is one God, also one mediator of God and of men—the man Christ Jesus, 
who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony in its own times— 
in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle—truth I say in Christ, I do not lie—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth. 
I intend, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, apart from anger and deliberation; 
also the women in like manner, in orderly apparel, to adorn themselves with modesty and sobriety, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or clothing of great price, 
but—which becomes women professing godly piety—through good works. 
Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection, 
and I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness, 
for Adam was formed first, then Eve, 
and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, came into transgression, 
and she will be saved through the childbearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety. 
The word is steadfast: If anyone longs for overseership, he desires a right work; 
it is required, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, a husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, respectable, a friend of strangers, apt to teach, 
not given to wine, not a striker, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money, 
leading his own house well, having children in subjection with all dignity, 
(and if anyone has not known how to lead his own house, how will he take care of an assembly of God?) 
not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the Devil; 
and it is required of him also to have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the Devil. 
Servants, in like manner, dignified, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to shameful gain, 
having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience, 
and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable. 
Women, in like manner, dignified, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things. 
Servants—let them be husbands of one wife, leading the children well, and their own houses, 
for those who ministered well acquire a good step to themselves, and much boldness in faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
I write to you these things, hoping to come to you soon, 
and if I delay, that you may know how it is required to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God—a pillar and foundation of the truth, 
and confessedly, great is the secret of piety: who was revealed in flesh, declared righteous in the Spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory! 
And the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons, 
speaking lies in hypocrisy, being seared in their own conscience, 
forbidding to marry—to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth, 
because every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received, 
for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession. 
Placing these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which you followed after, 
but reject the profane and old women’s fables, and exercise yourself to piety, 
for bodily exercise is to little profit, but piety is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is coming; 
the word is steadfast, and worthy of all acceptance; 
for this we both labor and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Savior of all men—especially of those believing. 
Charge these things, and teach; 
let no one despise your youth, but become a pattern of those believing in word, in behavior, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity; 
until I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching; 
do not be careless of the gift in you, that was given you through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership; 
be careful of these things; be in these things, that your advancement may be evident in all things; 
take heed to yourself and to the teaching; remain in them, for doing this thing, you will save both yourself and those hearing you. 
You may not rebuke an elder, but exhort him as a father, younger persons as brothers, 
aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters—in all purity; 
honor widows who are really widows; 
and if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety to their own house, and to give back a repayment to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God. 
And she who is really a widow and desolate, has hoped on God, and remains in the supplications and in the prayers night and day, 
but she given to luxury while living has died; 
and charge these things, that they may be blameless; 
and if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of the household, he has denied the faith, and he is worse than an unbeliever. 
A widow—do not let her be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband, 
being testified to in good works: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if she washed holy ones’ feet, if she relieved those in tribulation, if she followed after every good work; 
and be refusing younger widows, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry, 
having judgment, because they cast away the first faith, 
and also at the same time, they learn to be idle, going around the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking things they should not; 
I intend, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer of reviling; 
for some already turned aside after Satan. 
If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the assembly be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows. 
Let them, the well-leading elders, be counted worthy of double honor, especially those laboring in word and teaching, 
for the Writing says, “You will not muzzle an ox treading out,” and, “Worthy is the workman of his reward.” 
Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on two or three witnesses. 
Reprove those sinning before all, that the others may also have fear; 
I fully testify, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen messengers, that you may keep these things, without prejudging, doing nothing by partiality. 
Be quickly laying hands on no one, nor be having fellowship with the sins of others; be keeping yourself pure; 
no longer be drinking water, but be using a little wine, because of your stomach and of your frequent sicknesses; 
the sins of certain men are evident beforehand, leading before to judgment, but some also they follow after; 
in like manner the right works are also evident beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid. 
As many as are servants under a yoke, let them reckon their own masters worthy of all honor, that evil may not be spoken of the Name of God and the teaching; 
and those having believing masters, do not let them slight them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve, because they are steadfast and beloved, who are partaking of the benefit. Be teaching and exhorting these things; 
if anyone be teaching otherwise, and does not consent to sound words—those of our Lord Jesus Christ—and to the teaching according to piety, 
he is proud, knowing nothing, but unhealthy about questions and word-striving, out of which come envy, strife, slanders, evil-surmisings, 
wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such; 
but it is great gain—the piety with contentment; 
for we brought nothing into the world—because neither are we able to carry out anything; 
but having food and raiment—with these we will suffice ourselves; 
and those intending to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction, 
for the love of money is a root of all the evils, which certain ones longing for went astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows; 
and you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness. 
Be striving the good strife of the faith; be laying hold on the continuous life to which you also were called, and did profess the right profession before many witnesses. 
I charge you, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the right profession before Pontius Pilate, 
that you keep the command unspotted, unblameable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
which He will show in His own times—the blessed and only sovereign, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords, 
having immortality alone, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no one of men saw, nor is able to see, to whom is honor and perpetual might! Amen. 
Charge those rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment— 
to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate, 
treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on that which is truly life. 
O Timotheus, guard the thing entrusted, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge, 
which certain ones professing—swerved concerning the faith. The grace is with you! Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, according to a promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 
to Timotheus, beloved child: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord! 
I am thankful to God, whom I serve from progenitors in a pure conscience, that I unceasingly have remembrance concerning you in my supplications night and day, 
desiring to see you greatly, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy, 
taking remembrance of the unhypocritical faith that is in you, that first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that also in you. 
For which cause I remind you to stir up the gift of God that is in you through the putting on of my hands, 
for God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind; 
therefore you may not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but you suffer evil along with the good news according to the power of God, 
who saved us, and called with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, that was given to us in Christ Jesus, before the times of the ages, 
and was made visible now through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who indeed abolished death, and enlightened life and immortality through the good news, 
to which I was placed a preacher and an apostle, and a teacher of nations, 
for which cause these things I also suffer, but I am not ashamed, for I have known in whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that He is able to guard that which I have committed to Him—to that day. 
Hold the pattern of sound words, which you heard from me, in faith and love that is in Christ Jesus; 
guard the good thing committed through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling in us; 
you have known this, that they turned from me—all those in Asia, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes; 
may the LORD give kindness to the house of Onesiphorus, because he refreshed me many times, and was not ashamed of my chain, 
but being in Rome, he sought me very diligently and found me; 
may the LORD give to him to find kindness from the LORD in that day; and you very well know how much he ministered in Ephesus. 
You, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 
and the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, be committing these things to steadfast men, who will also be sufficient to teach others; 
you, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ; 
no one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who enlisted him; 
and if anyone also may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully; 
it is first necessary for the laboring farmer to partake of the fruits; 
be considering what things I say, for the LORD gives to you understanding in all things. 
Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news, 
in which I suffer evil—to bonds, as an evildoer, but the word of God has not been bound; 
because of this I endure all things, because of the chosen ones, that they also may obtain salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with perpetual glory. 
The word is steadfast: For if we died together—we will also live together; 
if we endure together—we will also reign together; if we deny Him, He will also deny us; 
if we are not steadfast, He remains steadfast; He is not able to deny Himself. 
Remind them of these things, testifying fully before the LORD—not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing; 
be diligent to present yourself approved to God—a workman not ashamed, straightly cutting the word of truth; 
and stand aloof from the profane vain talkings, for they will advance to more impiety, 
and their word will have pasture as a gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
who swerved concerning the truth, saying the resurrection to have already been, and overthrows the faith of some; 
sure, nevertheless, the foundation of God has stood, having this seal: “The LORD has known those who are His,” and, “Let him depart from unrighteousness—everyone who is naming the Name of Christ.” 
And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor, and some to dishonor: 
if, then, anyone may cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified and profitable to the master—having been prepared to every good work; 
and flee the youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling on the LORD out of a pure heart; 
and be avoiding the foolish and uninstructed questions, having known that they beget strife, 
and a servant of the LORD must not quarrel, but to be gentle to all, apt to teach, patient under evil, 
instructing those opposing in meekness—if perhaps God may give to them conversion to an acknowledging of the truth, 
and they may awake out of the Devil’s snare, having been caught by him at his will. 
And know this, that in the last days there will come perilous times, 
for men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, slanderous, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unkind, 
without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, without control, barbaric, not lovers of those who are good, 
traitors, reckless, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, 
having a form of piety, but having denied its power; and be turning away from these, 
for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the weak women, loaded with sins, led away with manifold desires, 
always learning, and never able to come to a knowledge of truth, 
and even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so these also stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith; 
but they will not advance any further, for their folly will be evident to all, as theirs also became. 
And you have followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance, 
the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured! And the LORD delivered me out of all. 
And all who will to live piously in Christ Jesus will also be persecuted, 
and evil men and impostors will advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray. 
And you—remain in the things which you learned and were entrusted with, having known from whom you learned, 
and because you have known the Holy Writings from infancy, which are able to make you wise—to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus. 
Every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction that is in righteousness, 
that the man of God may be fitted—having been completed for every good work. 
I fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge the living and dead at His appearing and His Kingdom— 
preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching, 
for there will be a season when they will not endure the sound teaching, but they will heap up teachers according to their own desires—having an itching ear, 
and, indeed, they will turn away from hearing the truth, and they will be turned aside to the fables. 
But you—watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; make full assurance of your ministry, 
for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release has arrived; 
I have striven the good strife, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 
from now on there is laid up for me the garland of righteousness that the LORD—the Righteous Judge—will give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving His appearing. 
Be diligent to come to me quickly, 
for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia; 
only Lucas is with me; having taken Mark, bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for ministry; 
and I sent Tychicus to Ephesus; 
coming, bring the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus and the scrolls—especially the parchments. 
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the LORD repay to him according to his works, 
of whom you also beware, for he has greatly stood against our words; 
no one stood with me in my first defense, but all forsook me (may it not be reckoned to them), 
but the LORD stood by me, and strengthened me, that the preaching might be fully assured through me, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion, 
and the LORD will free me from every evil work, and will save me—to His heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory through the ages of the ages! Amen. 
Greet Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus’ household; 
Erastus remained in Corinth, and I left Trophimus ailing in Miletus; 
be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers. 
The Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit. The grace is with you! Amen.
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety, 
on hope of continuous life, which God, who does not lie, promised before times of ages 
(and He revealed His word in His own times), in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Savior, 
to Titus—true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior! 
For this cause I left you in Crete, that you may arrange the things lacking, and may set elders down in every city, as I appointed to you, 
if anyone is blameless, a husband of one wife, having believing children, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate— 
for it is required of the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor prone to anger, not given to wine, not an abuser, not given to shameful gain, 
but a lover of strangers, a lover of the good, sober-minded, righteous, holy, self-controlled, 
holding—according to the teaching—to the steadfast word, that he may also be able to exhort in the sound teaching, and to convict the deniers; 
for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers—especially those of the circumcision— 
whose mouths must be covered, who overturn whole households, teaching what things it should not, for the sake of shameful gain. 
A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans! Always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!” 
This testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 
not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth. 
All things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and nothing is pure to the defiled and unsteadfast, but even the mind and the conscience of them is defiled. 
They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their works, being abominable, and disobedient, and disapproved to every good work. 
But you—speak what is suitable according to the sound teaching. 
Elders are to be temperate, dignified, sober, sound in faith, in the love, in the endurance. 
Aged women, in like manner, in behavior as becomes sacred persons, not false accusers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of good things, 
that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children, 
sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that evil may not be spoken of the word of God. 
The younger men, in like manner, exhort them to be sober-minded. 
Concerning all things, present yourself as a pattern of good works—in the teaching with uncorruptedness, dignity, 
sound discourse that is blameless, so that he who is of the contrary may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you. 
Servants are to be subject to their own masters, to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, 
not stealing, but showing all good steadfastness, that the teaching of God our Savior they may adorn in all things. 
For the saving grace of God has appeared to all men, 
teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, we may live soberly, and righteously, and piously in the present age, 
waiting for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
who gave Himself for us, that He might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to Himself a special people, zealous of good works. 
Speak these things, and exhort and convict with all authority; let no one despise you! 
Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, to be ready to every good work, 
to speak evil of no one, not to be quarrelsome—gentle, showing all meekness to all men, 
for we, also, were once thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving manifold desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, odious—hating one another; 
and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Savior appeared 
(not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness), He saved us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
which He poured on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
that having been declared righteous by His grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of continuous life. 
The word is steadfast; and concerning these things I intend you to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works—who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men, 
but stand away from foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law—for they are unprofitable and vain. 
Reject a heretical man, after a first and second admonition, 
having known that he has been subverted who is such, and sins, being self-condemned. 
When I will send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. 
Diligently send forth Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking, 
and let them learn—ours also—to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful. 
All those with me greet you. Greet those cherishing us in faith. The grace is with you all!
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker, 
and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in your house: 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! 
I give thanks to my God, always making mention of you in my prayers, 
hearing of your love and faith that you have to the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy ones, 
that the fellowship of your faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus; 
for we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the yearnings of the holy ones have been refreshed through you, brother. 
For this reason, having in Christ much boldness to command you that which is fit— 
because of the love I rather plead, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ; 
I beg you concerning my child—whom I begot in my bonds—Onesimus, 
who once was to you unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to you, 
whom I sent again to you—he who is my own heart, 
whom I intended to retain to myself, that in your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news, 
but apart from your mind I willed to do nothing, so that your good deed may not be as of necessity, but of willingness, 
for perhaps because of this he departed for an hour, that you may have him continuously, 
no longer as a servant, but above a servant—a beloved brother, especially to me, and how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the LORD! 
If, then, you have fellowship with me, receive him as me, 
and if he did hurt to you, or owes anything, charge this to me; 
I, Paul, wrote with my hand, I will repay; besides, that I may not say that you also owe to me yourself. 
Yes, brother, may I have profit of you in the LORD; refresh my yearnings in the LORD; 
I wrote to you having been confident in your obedience, having known that you will also do above what I may say; 
and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be granted to you. 
Epaphras greets you (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus), 
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow-workmen! 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.
In many parts and many ways, God, having spoken long ago to the fathers by the prophets, 
in these last days speaks to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom He also made the ages; 
who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also all things by the saying of His might—having made a cleansing of our sins through Himself, sat down at the right hand of the Greatness in the highest, 
having become so much better than the messengers, as He inherited a more excellent name than them. 
For to which of the messengers did He ever say, “You are My Son—today I have begotten You?” And again, “I will be to Him for a Father, and He will be to Me for a Son?” 
And when again He may bring the firstborn into the world, He says, “And let them worship Him—all messengers of God”; 
and to the messengers, indeed, He says, “The One who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire”; 
but to the Son: “Your throne, O God, is agelong and continuous; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom; 
You loved righteousness, and hated lawlessness; Because of this He anointed You—God, Your God—With oil of gladness above Your partners”; 
and, “You, LORD, founded the earth at the beginning, || And the heavens are a work of Your hands. 
These will perish, but You remain, || And all will become old as a garment, 
And You will roll them together as a mantle, and they will be changed, || But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.” 
And to which of the messengers did He ever say, “Sit at My right hand, || Until I may make Your enemies Your footstool?” 
Are they not all spirits of service—being sent forth for ministry because of those about to inherit salvation? 
Because of this it is more abundantly necessary to take heed to the things heard, lest we may drift away, 
for if the word being spoken through messengers became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just repayment, 
how will we escape, having neglected such great salvation? Which having received that spoken through the LORD from the beginning, was confirmed to us by those having heard, 
God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will. 
For He did not subject the coming world to messengers, concerning which we speak, 
and one in a certain place testified fully, saying, “What is man, that You are mindful of him, || Or a son of man, that You look after him? 
You made him a little less than messengers, || You crowned him with glory and honor, || And set him over the works of Your hands, 
You put all things in subjection under his feet,” for in the subjecting to Him all things, He left nothing to Him unsubjected, but now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him, 
and we see Him who was made a little less than messengers—Jesus—because of the suffering of death, having been crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God He might taste of death for everyone. 
For it was fitting to Him, because of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings, 
for both He who is sanctifying and those sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, 
saying, “I will declare Your Name to My brothers, || In the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to You”; and again, “I will be trusting on Him”; 
and again, “Behold, I and the children that God gave to Me.” 
Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself also took part of the same in like manner, that through death He might destroy him having the power of death—that is, the Devil— 
and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage, 
for doubtless, He does not lay hold of messengers, but He lays hold of the seed of Abraham, 
for this reason it seemed necessary to Him to be made like the brothers in all things, that He might become a kind and faithful Chief Priest in the things related to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people, 
for in that He suffered, Himself being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted. 
For this reason, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and Chief Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus, 
being faithful to Him who appointed Him, as also Moses was in all His house. 
For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who builds it has more honor than the house. 
For every house is built by someone, and He who built all things is God, 
and Moses was indeed steadfast in all His house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken— 
but Christ, as a Son over His house, whose house we are, if we hold fast the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope to the end. 
For this reason, as the Holy Spirit says, “Today, if you may hear His voice— 
you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 
in which your fathers tempted Me; they proved Me, and saw My works for forty years; 
for this reason I was grieved with that generation and said, They always go astray in their heart, and these have not known My ways; 
so I swore in My anger, They will not enter into My rest.” 
Watch out, brothers, lest there will be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God, 
but exhort one another every day, while it is called “Today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, 
for we have become partakers of the Christ, if we may hold fast the confidence we had at the beginning to the end, 
as it is said, “Today, if you may hear His voice, you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation.” 
For who were those, having heard, that provoked, but not all those having come out of Egypt through Moses? 
But with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 
And to whom did He swear that they will not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? 
And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief. 
We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, anyone of you may seem to have come short, 
for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard, 
for we enter into the rest—we who believed, as He said, “So I swore in My anger, They will not enter into My rest”; and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world, 
for He spoke in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: “And God rested in the seventh day from all His works”; 
and in this place again, “They will not enter into My rest”; 
since then, it remains for some to enter into it, and those who first heard good news did not enter in because of unbelief— 
again He limits a certain day, “Today,” in David saying, after so long a time, as it has been said, “Today, if you may hear His voice, you may not harden your hearts,” 
for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken after these things concerning another day; 
there remains, then, a Sabbath rest to the people of God, 
for he who entered into His rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own. 
May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one may fall in the same example of the unbelief, 
for the Word of God is living, and working, and sharper—beyond every two-edged sword—and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of joints and also marrows, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart; 
and there is not a created thing hidden before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes—with whom is our reckoning. 
Having, then, a great Chief Priest having passed through the heavens—Jesus the Son of God—may we hold fast the profession, 
for we do not have a Chief Priest unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One tempted in all things in like manner, yet without sin; 
we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace—for seasonable help. 
For every chief priest taken out of men is set in things pertaining to God in behalf of men, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins, 
being able to be gentle to those being ignorant and going astray, since he is also surrounded with weakness; 
and because of this weakness he ought, just as for the people, so also for himself, to bring forward sacrifices for sins; 
and no one takes the honor to himself, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron. 
So also the Christ did not glorify Himself to become Chief Priest, but He who spoke to Him: “You are My Son, today I have begotten You”; 
just as He also says in another place, “You are a priest throughout the age, according to the order of Melchizedek”; 
who in the days of His flesh having offered up both prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and having been heard in respect to that which He feared, 
though being a Son, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered, 
and having been made perfect, He became the cause of continuous salvation to all those obeying Him, 
having been called by God a Chief Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, 
concerning the Word, of whom we have much to speak, and of hard explanation to say, since you have become dull of hearing, 
for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again you have need that one teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become having need of milk, and not of strong food, 
for everyone who is partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness—for he is an infant, 
and the strong food is of perfect men, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, to both the discernment of good and of evil. 
For this reason, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, we may advance to perfection, not laying again a foundation of conversion from dead works, and of faith on God, 
of the teaching of immersions, also of laying on of hands, also of the resurrection of the dead, and of continuous judgment, 
and this we will do, if God may permit, 
for it is impossible for those once enlightened, having also tasted of the heavenly gift, and having become partakers of the Holy Spirit, 
and tasted the good saying of God, also the powers of the coming age, 
and having fallen away, to renew them again to conversion, having crucified to themselves the Son of God again, and exposed to public shame. 
For the earth, having drunk in the rain coming on it many times, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom it is also dressed, partakes of blessing from God, 
but that which is bearing thorns and briers is disapproved of, and near to cursing, whose end is for burning; 
but we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak, 
for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labor of love that you showed to His Name, having ministered to the holy ones and ministering; 
and we desire each one of you to show the same diligence, to the full assurance of the hope to the end, 
that you may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises. 
For God, having made promise to Abraham, seeing He was not able to swear by any greater, swore by Himself, 
saying, “Blessing I will indeed bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you”; 
and so, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise; 
for men swear by the greater, and the oath is for confirmation of the end of all their controversy, 
in which God, more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of His counsel, interposed by an oath, 
that through two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong comfort, having fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope being set before us, 
which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into that within the veil, 
to where a forerunner entered for us—Jesus, having become Chief Priest throughout the age after the order of Melchizedek. 
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham turning back from the striking of the kings, and blessed him, 
to whom also Abraham divided a tenth of all (first, indeed, being interpreted, “King of righteousness,” and then also, “King of Salem,” which is, King of Peace), 
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and having been like the Son of God, remains a priest continually. 
And see how great this one is, to whom Abraham the patriarch also gave a tenth out of the best of the spoils, 
and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, have a command to take tithes from the people according to the Law, that is, their brothers, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham; 
and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and he has blessed him having the promises, 
and apart from all controversy, the less is blessed by the better— 
and here, indeed, men who die receive tithes, and there he who is testified to that he was living, 
and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, has paid tithes, 
for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchizedek met him. 
If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood—for the people under it had received law—what further need, according to the order of Melchizedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron? 
For the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, a change comes of the Law, 
for He of whom these things are said in another tribe has had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar, 
for it is evident that out of Judah has arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. 
And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest, 
who did not come according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life, 
for He testifies, “You are a priest—throughout the age, according to the order of Melchizedek”; 
for an annulling indeed comes of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness 
(for nothing did the Law perfect), and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 
And inasmuch as it is not apart from oath 
(for those indeed apart from oath have become priests, and He became priest with an oath through Him who is saying to Him, “The LORD swore, and will not regret, You are a priest throughout the age, according to the order of Melchizedek”), 
by so much also has Jesus become guarantee of a better covenant, 
and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining; 
and He, because of His remaining throughout the age, has the inviolable priesthood, 
from where also He is able to save to the very end, those coming through Him to God—ever living to make intercession for them. 
For also such a Chief Priest was fitting for us—holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and having become higher than the heavens, 
who has no daily necessity, as the chief priests, to first offer up sacrifice for His own sins, then for those of the people; for this He did once, having offered up Himself; 
for the Law appoints men as chief priests, having weakness, but the word of the oath that is after the Law appoints the Son having been perfected throughout the age. 
And the sum concerning the things spoken of is: we have such a Chief Priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Greatness in the heavens, 
a servant of the holy places, and of the true dwelling place, which the LORD set up, and not man, 
for every chief priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, from where it is necessary for this One to also have something that He may offer; 
for if, indeed, He were on earth, He would not be a priest (there being the priests who are offering the gifts according to the Law, 
who to an example and shadow serve of the heavenly things, as Moses has been divinely warned, being about to construct the Dwelling Place, for, “See,” He says, “that you will make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain”), 
but now He has obtained a more excellent service, how much He is also mediator of a better covenant, which has been sanctioned on better promises, 
for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second. 
For finding fault, He says to them, “Behold, days come, says the LORD, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant, 
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking them by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt—because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the LORD— 
because this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the LORD, giving My laws into their mind, and I will write them on their hearts, and I will be to them for a God, and they will be to Me for a people; 
and they will not each teach his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, Know the LORD, because they will all know Me—from the small one of them to the great one of them, 
because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and I will remember their sins and their lawlessnesses no more.” 
In the saying “new,” He has made the first obsolete, and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is near disappearing. 
It had, indeed, then (even the first dwelling place) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary, 
for a dwelling place was prepared, the first, in which was both the lampstand, and the table, and the Bread of the Presentation—which is called “Holy”; 
and after the second veil a dwelling place that is called “Holy of Holies,” 
having a golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid all over with gold, in which is the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tablets of the covenant, 
and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the propitiatory covering, concerning which we are not to particularly speak now. 
And these things having been thus prepared, into the first dwelling place, indeed, the priests go in at all times, performing the services, 
and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he offers for himself and the errors of the people. 
By this the Holy Spirit was making evident that the way of the holy places has not yet been revealed, the first dwelling place yet having a standing, 
which is an allegory in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving, 
only on the basis of food, and drinks, and different immersions, and fleshly ordinances—until the time of reformation imposed on them. 
But Christ having come, Chief Priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect dwelling place not made with hands—that is, not of this creation— 
neither through blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, entered in once into the holy places, having obtained continuous redemption; 
for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those defiled, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh, 
how much more will the blood of the Christ (who through the perpetual Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 
And because of this, He is mediator of a new covenant, that His death having come for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the continuous inheritance, 
for where a covenant is, it is necessary to establish the death of the one having made it, 
for a covenant is affirmed at death, since it is not in force at all when the one having made it lives, 
for which reason, not even the first has been initiated apart from blood, 
for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people, 
saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God enjoined to you,” 
and he sprinkled both the Dwelling Place and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner, 
and with blood almost all things are purified according to the Law, and forgiveness does not come apart from blood-shedding. 
It is necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these; 
for the Christ did not enter into holy places made with hands—figures of the true—but into Heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us; 
nor that He may offer Himself many times, even as the chief priest enters into the holy places every year with blood of others, 
otherwise it was necessary for Him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now He has been revealed once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through His sacrifice; 
and as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this—judgment, 
so also the Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, apart from a sin-offering, for salvation to those waiting for Him! 
For the Law having a shadow of the good things coming—not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near, 
since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having been purified once? 
But in those sacrifices is a remembrance of sins every year, 
for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
For this reason, coming into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering You did not will, and a body You prepared for Me; 
in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, You did not delight. 
Then I said, Behold, I come (in a volume of the scroll it has been written concerning Me), to do, O God, Your will”; 
saying above, “Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering You did not will, nor delight in” (which are offered according to the Law), 
then He said, “Behold, I come to do, O God, Your will”; He takes away the first that He may establish the second; 
in which will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all, 
and every priest, indeed, has daily stood serving, and offering the same sacrifices many times, that are never able to take away sins. 
But He, having offered one sacrifice for sin—to the end, sat down at the right hand of God— 
as to the rest, expecting until He may place His enemies as His footstool, 
for by one offering He has perfected to the end those being sanctified; 
and the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after that He has said before, 
“This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD, giving My laws on their hearts, and I will write them on their minds,” 
and, “I will remember their sins and their lawlessness no more”; 
and where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer offering for sin. 
Having, therefore, brothers, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, by the blood of Jesus, 
which is the way He initiated for us—new and living, through the veil, that is, His flesh— 
and a Great Priest over the house of God, 
may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water; 
may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope (for He who promised is faithful), 
and may we consider to provoke one another to love and to good works, 
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is a custom of some, but exhorting, and so much the more as you see the Day coming near. 
For if we are sinning willingly after receiving the full knowledge of the truth—there remains no more sacrifice for sins, 
but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers; 
anyone having set aside a law of Moses dies without mercies on the basis of two or three witnesses. 
Of how much worse punishment will he be counted worthy who trampled on the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant a common thing, by which he was sanctified, and having insulted the Spirit of grace? 
For we have known Him who is saying, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the LORD”; and again, “The LORD will judge His people.” 
It is fearful to fall into the hands of the living God. 
But call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, you endured much conflict of sufferings; 
this indeed, being made spectacles with both insults and afflictions, now this, having become partners of those so living, 
for you also sympathized with my bonds, and the robbery of your goods you received with joy, knowing that you have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one. 
You may not cast away, then, your boldness, which has great repayment of reward, 
for you have need of patience, that having done the will of God, you may receive the promise. 
“For yet in a very, very little while, He who is coming will come, and will not linger,” 
but, “The righteous will live by faith; and if he may draw back, My soul has no pleasure in him.” 
But we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul. 
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the proof of matters not being seen, 
for by this, the elders were well-attested. 
By faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a saying of God, in regard to the things seen having not come out of things appearing. 
By faith Abel offered a better sacrifice to God than Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, yet speaks. 
By faith Enoch was translated—not to see death, and was not found, because God translated him; for before his translation he had been testified to—that he had pleased God well, 
and apart from faith it is impossible to please Him, for it is required of him who is coming to God to believe that He exists and that He becomes a rewarder to those seeking Him. 
By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the things not yet seen, having feared, prepared an ark to the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and he became heir of the righteousness according to faith. 
By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed, to go forth into the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and he went forth, not knowing to where he goes. 
By faith he sojourned in the land of the promise as a strange country, having dwelt in dwelling places with Isaac and Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise, 
for he was looking for the city having the foundations, whose craftsman and constructor is God. 
And by faith Sarah, herself barren, received power to conceive seed even after the time of life, seeing she judged Him who promised faithful; 
for this reason, also, from one—and that of one who had become dead—were begotten as the stars of the sky in multitude, and innumerable as the sand that is by the seashore. 
All these died in faith, having not received the promises, but having seen them from afar, and having been persuaded, and having greeted them, and having confessed that they are strangers and sojourners on the earth, 
for those saying such things make apparent that they seek a country; 
and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return, 
but now they long for better, that is, heavenly, for this reason God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He prepared a city for them. 
By faith Abraham has offered up Isaac, being tried, even the one having received the promises offered up his only begotten, 
of whom it was said, “In Isaac will your Seed be called,” 
reckoning that God is even able to raise up out of the dead, from where also in a figurative sense he received him. 
By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau. 
By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped on the top of his staff. 
By faith Joseph, dying, made mention concerning the outgoing of the sons of Israel, and gave command concerning his bones. 
By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful, and were not afraid of the decree of the king. 
By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh, 
having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have sin’s pleasure for a season, 
having reckoned the reproach of the Christ greater wealth than the treasures in Egypt, for he looked to the repayment of reward. 
By faith he left Egypt behind, having not been afraid of the wrath of the king, for as seeing the Invisible One—he endured. 
By faith he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, so that He who is destroying the firstborn might not touch them. 
By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, which having made an attempt to cross, the Egyptians were swallowed up. 
By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been surrounded for seven days. 
By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who disbelieved, having received the spies with peace. 
And what yet will I say? For the time will fail me recounting about Gideon, also Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, also David, and Samuel, and the prophets, 
who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions, 
quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were made powerful out of weakness, became strong in battle, caused armies of the foreigners to give way; 
women received their dead by a resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that they might receive a better resurrection, 
and others received trial of mockings and scourgings, and yet of bonds and imprisonment; 
they were stoned, they were sawn apart, they were tried; they died in the killing of the sword; they went around in sheepskins, in goatskins—being destitute, afflicted, injuriously treated, 
of whom the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, and mountains, and caves, and the holes of the earth; 
and all these, having been testified to through faith, did not receive the promise, 
God, having provided something better for us, that apart from us they might not be made perfect. 
Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set around us, having put off every weight, and the closely besetting sin, may we run the contest that is set before us through endurance, 
looking to the Author and Perfecter of the faith—Jesus, who, for the joy set before Him, endured a cross, having despised shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God; 
for again consider Him who endured such contradiction from the sinners to Himself, that you may not be wearied in your souls—being faint. 
You did not yet resist to blood—striving with sin; 
and you have forgotten the exhortation that speaks fully to you as to sons, “My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, nor be faint, being reproved by Him, 
for whom the LORD loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives”; 
if you endure discipline, God bears Himself to you as to sons, for who is a son whom a father does not discipline? 
And if you are apart from discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are bastards, and not sons. 
Then, indeed, we have had fathers of our flesh, correctors, and we respected them; will we not much rather be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live? 
For they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed good to them, were disciplining, but He for profit, to be partakers of His separation; 
and all discipline for the present, indeed, does not seem to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those exercised through it. 
For this reason, lift up the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees; 
and make straight paths for your feet, so that which is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed; 
pursue peace with all, and the separation, apart from which no one will see the LORD, 
observing lest anyone be failing of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may give trouble, and through this many may be defiled; 
lest anyone be a fornicator, or a profane person, as Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food sold his birthright, 
for you know that also afterward, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was disapproved of, for he did not find a place of conversion, though having sought it with tears. 
For you did not come near to the mountain touched and scorched with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and storm, 
and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which those having heard begged that a word might not be added to them, 
for they were not bearing that which is commanded, “And if a beast may touch the mountain, it will be stoned, or shot through with an arrow,” 
and (so terrible was the sight), Moses said, “I am exceedingly fearful, and trembling.” 
But you came to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers, 
to the assembly-place and Assembly of the Firstborn registered in Heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of righteous men made perfect, 
and to a mediator of a new covenant—Jesus, and to blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel! 
Watch out lest you refuse Him who is speaking, for if those did not escape who refused him who was divinely speaking on earth—much less we who turn away from Him who speaks from Heaven, 
whose voice shook the earth then, and now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more—I shake not only the earth, but also Heaven”; 
and this, “Yet once more,” makes evident the removal of the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the things not shaken may remain; 
for this reason, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, may we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly, with reverence and fear, 
for our God is also a consuming fire. 
Let brotherly love remain. 
Do not be forgetful of hospitality, for through this some entertained messengers unaware. 
Be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with them, of those maltreated, as yourselves also being in the body. 
The marriage is to be honored by all, and the bed undefiled, for God will judge whoremongers and adulterers. 
Be without covetous behavior, being content with the things present, for He has said, “No, I will not leave, no, nor forsake you,” 
so that we boldly say, “The LORD is to me a helper, and I will not fear what man will do to me.” 
Be mindful of those leading you, who spoke to you the word of God, who, considering the outcome of their behavior, imitate their faith: 
Jesus Christ—the same yesterday and today and for all ages. 
Do not be carried away with strange and manifold teachings, for it is good that by grace the heart is confirmed, not with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited; 
we have an altar from which they who are serving the Dwelling Place have no authority to eat, 
for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into the holy places through the chief priest—of these the bodies are burned outside the camp. 
For this reason, also Jesus—that He might sanctify the people through His own blood—suffered outside the gate; 
now then, may we go forth to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach; 
for we have no abiding city here, but we seek the coming one. 
Through Him, then, we may always offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to His Name. 
And do not be forgetful of doing good and of fellowship, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices. 
Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for these watch for your souls, as about to give account, that they may do this with joy, and not sighing, for this is unprofitable to you. 
Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience, willing to behave well in all things, 
and I call on you to do this more abundantly, that I may be restored to you more quickly. 
And the God of peace, who brought up the Great Shepherd of the sheep out of the dead—by the blood of a perpetual covenant—our Lord Jesus, 
make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory through the ages of the ages! Amen. 
And I beg you, brothers, endure the word of the exhortation, for I have also written to you through few words. 
Know that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom I will see you, if he may come more shortly. 
Greet all those leading you, and all the holy ones. Those from Italy greet you. 
The grace is with you all! Amen.
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes who are in the dispersion: Greetings! 
Count it all joy, my brothers, when you may fall into manifold temptations, 
knowing that the proof of your faith works endurance, 
and let the endurance have a perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. 
And if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask from God, who is giving to all generously, and not reproaching, and it will be given to him; 
but let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who is doubting has been like a wave of the sea, driven by wind and tossed; 
for do not let that man suppose that he will receive anything from the LORD— 
a soul-split man is unstable in all his ways. 
And let the brother who is low rejoice in his exaltation, 
but the rich in his becoming low, because he will pass away as a flower of grass; 
for the sun rose with the burning heat, and withered the grass, and the flower of it fell, and the beauty of its appearance perished, so also the rich in his way will fade away! 
Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because, becoming approved, he will receive the garland of life, which the LORD promised to those loving Him. 
Let no one who is being tempted say, “I am tempted from God,” for God is not tempted by evils, and Himself tempts no one, 
but each one is tempted, being led away and enticed by his own desires; 
afterward the desire having conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin having been perfected, brings forth death. 
Do not be led astray, my beloved brothers. 
Every good giving, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation, or shadow of turning; 
having willed it, He begot us with a word of truth, for our being a certain first-fruit of His creatures. 
So then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, 
for the wrath of a man does not work the righteousness of God; 
for this reason, having put aside all filthiness and superabundance of evil, receive the implanted word in meekness, that is able to save your souls; 
and become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves, 
because, if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one has been like to a man viewing his natural face in a mirror, 
for he viewed himself, and has gone away, and immediately he forgot what kind of man he was; 
but he who looked into the perfect law—that of liberty, and continued there, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work—this one will be blessed in his doing. 
If anyone thinks to be religious among you, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, the religion of this one is vain; 
religion pure and undefiled with the God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation—to keep himself unspotted from the world. 
My brothers, do not hold the faith of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ in favor by appearance, 
for if there may come into your synagogue a man with gold ring, in radiant clothing, and there may also come in a poor man in vile clothing, 
and you may look on him bearing the radiant clothing, and may say to him, “You—sit here well,” and may say to the poor man, “You—stand there,” or, “Sit here under my footstool,” 
you did not judge fully in yourselves, and became ill-reasoning judges. 
Listen, my beloved brothers, did God not choose the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that He promised to those loving Him? 
But you dishonored the poor one. Do the rich not oppress you and themselves draw you to judgment-seats? 
Do they not themselves speak evil of the good Name having been called on you? 
If, indeed, you fulfill royal law, according to the Writing: “You will love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well; 
but if you favor by appearance, you work sin, being convicted by the Law as transgressors; 
for whoever will keep the whole Law, but will stumble in one point, he has become guilty of all; 
for He who is saying, “You may not commit adultery,” also said, “You may not murder”; but if you will not commit adultery, but will commit murder, you have become a transgressor of law; 
thus, speak and so act as one about to be judged by a law of liberty, 
for the judgment without mercy is to him having not done mercy, and mercy exults over judgment. 
What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone may speak of having faith, but he may not have works? Is that faith able to save him? 
And if a brother or sister may be naked, and may be destitute of daily food, 
and anyone of you may say to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed, and be filled,” but may not give to them the things necessary for the body, what is the profit? 
So also faith, if it may not have works, is dead by itself. 
But someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith out of works. 
You believe that God is one; you do well! The demons also believe—and shudder! 
And do you wish to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? 
Was not our father Abraham considered righteous out of works, having brought up his son Isaac on the altar? 
Do you see that faith was working with his works, and faith was perfected out of the works? 
And the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness”; and, “Friend of God” he was called. 
You see, then, that man is considered righteous out of works, and not out of faith only; 
and in like manner also Rahab the prostitute—was she not considered righteous out of works, having received the messengers, and having sent them forth by another way? 
For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also the faith apart from works is dead. 
Do not let many be teachers, my brothers, having known that we will receive greater judgment, 
for we all make many stumbles; if anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to also bridle the whole body; 
behold, the bits we put into the mouths of the horses for their obeying us, and we direct their whole body; 
behold, also the ships, being so great, and being driven by fierce winds, are directed by a very small rudder, wherever the impulse of the one steering wills, 
so also the tongue is a little member, and boasts greatly; behold, how much forest a little fire kindles! 
And the tongue is a fire, the world of the unrighteousness, so the tongue is set in our members, which is spotting our whole body, and is setting on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna. 
For every nature, both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and things of the sea, is subdued, and has been subdued, by the human nature, 
but no one of men is able to subdue the tongue—it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison; 
with it we bless the God and Father, and with it we curse the men made according to the likeness of God; 
out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing; it does not need, my brothers, these things to so happen; 
does the fountain out of the same opening pour forth the sweet and the bitter? 
Is a fig tree able, my brothers, to make olives? Or a vine figs? Neither is salty water able to have made sweet water. 
Who is wise and intelligent among you? Let him show his works out of good behavior in meekness of wisdom, 
yet, if you have bitter zeal, and rivalry in your heart, do not glory, nor lie against the truth; 
this wisdom is not descending from above, but earthly, physical, demon-like, 
for where zeal and rivalry are, there is insurrection and every evil matter; 
but the wisdom from above, first, indeed, is pure, then peaceable, gentle, well-convinced, full of kindness and good fruits, uncontentious, and unhypocritical— 
and the fruit of righteousness in peace is sown to those making peace. 
From where are wars and fightings among you? Is it not from here, out of your passions warring in your members? 
You desire, and do not have, so you murder; and you are zealous, and are not able to attain, so you fight and war; and you do not have, because of your not asking; 
you ask, and you do not receive, because you ask badly, that you may spend it in your pleasures. 
Adulterers and adulteresses! Have you not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever, then, may intend to be a friend of the world, he is designated as an enemy of God. 
Or, do you think that the Writing says emptily, “The Spirit that has dwelt in us yearns with envy,” 
but God gives greater grace, for this reason it says, “God sets Himself up against proud ones, and He gives grace to lowly ones.” 
Be subject, then, to God; stand up against the Devil, and he will flee from you; 
draw near to God, and He will draw near to you; cleanse hands, you sinners! And purify hearts, you split-souled! 
Be exceedingly afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter be turned to mourning, and the joy to heaviness; 
be made low before the LORD, and He will exalt you. 
Do not speak against one another, brothers; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, speaks against law, and judges law, and if you judge law, you are not a doer of law but a judge. 
One is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; you—who are you that judges the other? 
Go, now, you who are saying, “Today and tomorrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain,” 
who does not know the thing of tomorrow; for what is your life? For it is a vapor that is appearing for a little while, and then is vanishing; 
instead, you ought to say, “If the LORD may will, we will live, and do this or that”; 
but now you glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil; 
to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing it, it is sin to him. 
Go, now, you rich! Weep, howling over your miseries that are coming on you; 
your riches have rotted, and your garments have become moth-eaten; 
your gold and silver have rotted, and the rust of them will be to you for a testimony, and will eat your flesh as fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days! 
Behold, the reward of the workmen cries out, of those who in-gathered your fields, which has been fraudulently kept back by you, and the exclamations of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the LORD of Hosts; 
you lived in luxury on the earth, and were wanton; you nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter; 
you condemned—you murdered the righteous; he does not resist you. 
Be patient, then, brothers, until the coming of the LORD; behold, the farmer expects the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, until he may receive rain—early and latter; 
you also be patient; establish your hearts, because the coming of the LORD has drawn near; 
do not murmur against one another, brothers, that you may not be condemned; behold, the Judge has stood before the door. 
Brothers, as an example of the suffering of evil and of patience, take the prophets who spoke in the Name of the LORD; 
behold, we call those who are enduring blessed; you heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end from the LORD, that the LORD is very compassionate, and pitying. 
And before all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by Heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, but let your “Yes” be yes, and the “No,” no, that you may not fall under judgment. 
Does anyone suffer evil among you? Let him pray; is anyone of good cheer? Let him sing psalms; 
is anyone sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the Name of the LORD, 
and the prayer of faith will save the distressed one, and the LORD will raise him up, and if he may have committed sins, they will be forgiven to him. 
Be confessing to one another the trespasses, and be praying for one another, that you may be healed; very strong is a working supplication of a righteous man; 
Elijah was a similar-feeling man as us, and with prayer he prayed—not to rain, and it did not rain on the land three years and six months; 
and again he prayed, and the sky gave rain, and the land brought forth her fruit. 
Brothers, if anyone among you may go astray from the truth, and anyone may turn him back, 
let him know that he who turned back a sinner from the straying of his way will save a soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctification of the Spirit, to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied to you! 
Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness begot us again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ out of the dead, 
to an incorruptible inheritance, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved for you in the heavens, 
who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, to salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, 
in which you are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in various trials, 
so that the proof of your faith—much more precious than gold that is perishing, and being approved through fire—may be found to result in praise, and honor, and glory, at the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
whom, having not seen, you love, in whom, now believing although not seeing, you are glad with unspeakable joy and have been filled with glory, 
receiving the outcome of the faith—salvation of your souls; 
concerning which salvation the prophets sought out and searched out, who prophesied concerning the grace toward you, 
searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was signifying, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these, 
to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who proclaimed good news to you), by the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven, to which things messengers desire to look into intently. 
For this reason, having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 
as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance, 
but according as He who called you is holy, you also, become holy in all behavior, 
because it has been written: “Become holy, because I am holy”; 
and if you call on the Father, who is judging without favoritism according to the work of each, pass the time of your sojourn in fear, 
having known that, not with corruptible things—silver or gold—were you redeemed from your foolish behavior inherited from our forefathers, 
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted—Christ’s— 
foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and revealed in the last times because of you, 
who through Him believe in God who raised Him out of the dead, and gave glory to Him, so that your faith and hope may be in God. 
Having purified your souls in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to unhypocritical brotherly love, love one another earnestly out of a pure heart, 
being begotten again, not out of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, through a word of God—living and remaining—throughout the age; 
because all flesh is as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; the grass withered, and the flower of it fell away, 
but the saying of the LORD remains—throughout the age; and this is the saying of good news that was proclaimed to you. 
Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings, 
as newborn babies, desire the reasonable, unspoiled milk, so that you may grow up to salvation, 
if it so be that you tasted that the LORD is good, 
to whom coming—a living stone—having indeed been disapproved of by men, but with God—choice and precious, 
and you yourselves are built up as living stones into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
For this reason, also, it is contained in the Writing: “Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on Him may not be put to shame”; 
to you, then, who are believing—the preciousness; but to the unbelieving, the stone that the builders disapproved of—this One has become the head of the corner, 
and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense—who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving—to which they were also set. 
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that you may show forth the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light, 
who were once not a people, but are now the people of God; who had not found mercy, but now have found mercy. 
Beloved, I call on you, as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires that war against the soul, 
having your behavior right among the nations, so that whenever they speak against you as evildoers, seeing your good works, they may glorify God in the day of inspection. 
Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the LORD, whether to a king, as the highest, 
whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evildoers, and a praise of those doing good; 
because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men— 
as free, and not having freedom as the cloak of evil, but as servants of God; 
give honor to all; love the brotherhood; fear God; honor the king. 
Servants, be subject in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked; 
for this is grace: if anyone endures sorrows because of conscience toward God, suffering unrighteously; 
for what renown is it, if sinning and being battered, you endure it? But if, doing good and suffering for it, you endure, this is grace with God, 
for to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving to you an example, that you may follow His steps, 
who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in His mouth, 
who being reviled—was not reviling again, suffering—was not threatening, and was committing Himself to Him who is judging righteously, 
who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree that having died to sins, we may live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed; 
for you were as sheep going astray, but now you turned back to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. 
Wives, be subject to your own husbands in like manner, that even if some are disobedient to the word, they may be won through the behavior of the wives without the word, 
having beheld your pure behavior in fear, 
whose adorning—let it not be that which is outward, of braiding of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments, 
but—the hidden man of the heart, by the incorruptible thing of the meek and quiet spirit, which is of great value before God, 
for thus once also the holy women who hoped on God were adorning themselves, being subject to their own husbands, 
as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him “lord,” of whom you became daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror. 
Husbands, in like manner, dwelling with them, according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel—to the wife—imparting honor, as also being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers are not hindered. 
And finally, be all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brothers, compassionate, courteous, 
not giving back evil for evil, or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, blessing, having known that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing; 
for “he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips—not to speak guile; 
let him turn aside from evil, and do good, let him seek peace and pursue it; 
because the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears—to their supplication, but the face of the LORD is against those doing evil”; 
and who is he who will be doing you evil, if you may become imitators of Him who is good? 
But if you also should suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed! And do not be afraid of their fear, nor be troubled, 
but sanctify the LORD God in your hearts. And always be ready for defense to everyone who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear, 
having a good conscience, so that whenever they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed—those who are maligning your good behavior in Christ; 
for if the will of God wills it, it is better to suffer doing good, than doing evil; 
also because Christ suffered once for sin—righteous for unrighteous—that He might lead us to God, indeed having been put to death in the flesh, but having been made alive in the Spirit, 
by which, having gone, He also preached to the spirits in prison, 
who sometime ago disobeyed when once the long-suffering of God waited, in the days of Noah—an ark being prepared—in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water, 
also an antitype to immersion which now saves you—not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to Heaven—messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to Him. 
Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind, because he who suffered in the flesh has finished with sin, 
no longer in the desires of men, but in the will of God, to live the rest of the time in the flesh; 
for the time has sufficiently passed to have carried out the will of the nations, having walked in licentiousness, lusts, excesses of wines, revelings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries, 
in which they think it strange—your not running with them to the same excess of wastefulness, slandering you— 
who will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead, 
for this also was good news proclaimed to dead men, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, but may live according to God in the Spirit. 
Now the end of all things has come near; be sober-minded, then, and be sober in your prayers. 
Before all things, having earnest love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins; 
be hospitable to one another, without murmuring; 
each one, according as he received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; 
if anyone speaks, speak as oracles of God; if anyone ministers, minister as of the strength which God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power through the ages of the ages. Amen. 
Beloved, do not think it strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you, 
but according as you have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice, that you may also rejoice in the revelation of His glory—exulting; 
if you are reproached in the Name of Christ—you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you; in regard, indeed, to them, is evil spoken of Him, and in regard to you, He is glorified; 
for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as a meddler into other men’s matters; 
and if as a Christian, do not let him be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this respect; 
because it is the time of the judgment to have begun from the house of God, and if first from us, what is the end of those disobedient to the good news of God? 
And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and sinner appear? 
So that those also suffering according to the will of God, as to a steadfast Creator, let them commit their own souls in doing good. 
Elders who are among you, I exhort you, as a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and a partaker of the glory about to be revealed, 
feed the flock of God that is among you, overseeing not by compulsion, but willingly, neither for shameful gain, but eagerly, 
neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but becoming patterns for the flock, 
and the Chief Shepherd having appeared, you will receive the unfading garland of glory. 
In like manner, you young ones, be subject to elders, and all subjecting yourselves to one another; clothe yourselves with humble-mindedness, because God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble; 
be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that He may exalt you in good time, 
having cast all your care on Him, because He cares for you. 
Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the Devil walks around as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may swallow up, 
whom you must resist, steadfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings of your brotherhood to be accomplished in the world. 
And the God of all grace, who called you to His perpetual glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you; 
to Him is the glory and the power through the ages and the ages! Amen. 
Through Silvanus, the faithful brother as I reckon, I wrote through few words to you, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which you have stood. 
She in Babylon chosen with you greets you, and my son Marcus. 
Greet one another in a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus! Amen.
Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who obtained an equally precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: 
Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the acknowledgment of God and of Jesus our Lord! 
As His divine power has given to us all things pertaining to life and piety, through the acknowledgment of Him who called us through glory and virtue, 
through which the most great and precious promises have been given to us, that through these you may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption and lust in the world. 
And for this same reason also, having brought in all diligence, supplement your faith with virtue, and with virtue—knowledge, 
and with knowledge—self-control, and with self-control—endurance, and with endurance—piety, 
and with piety—brotherly kindness, and with brotherly kindness—love; 
for these things being in you and abounding, make you neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins; 
therefore, rather, brothers, be diligent to make steadfast your calling and divine selection, for doing these things you may never stumble; 
in this way the entrance into the continuous kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplemented to you. 
Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you about these things, although you have known them and have been established in the present truth, 
and I think right, so long as I am in this tent, to stir you up in reminding you, 
having known that the laying aside of my tent is soon, even as our Lord Jesus Christ also showed to me. 
And I will also be diligent to ensure that you always have a remembrance to make of these things after my departure. 
For having not followed out skillfully devised fables, we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having become eyewitnesses of His majesty— 
for having received honor and glory from God the Father, such a voice being borne to Him by the Excellent Glory: “This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I delighted”; 
and we heard this voice borne out of Heaven, being with Him at the holy mountain. 
And we have a more firm prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day may dawn, and the morning star may arise in your hearts; 
knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Writing comes of private exposition, 
for prophecy never came by the will of man, but men spoke from God, being brought by the Holy Spirit. 
But there also came false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you, who will stealthily bring in destructive sects, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing quick destruction to themselves, 
and many will follow out their destructive ways, because of whom the way of the truth will be spoken of as evil, 
and in covetousness, with forged words, they will make merchandise of you, whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber. 
For if God did not spare messengers having sinned, but having cast them down to Tartarus with chains of deepest gloom, delivered them, having been reserved to judgment, 
and did not spare the old world, but kept the eighth person, Noah, a preacher of righteousness, having brought a flood on the world of the impious, 
and having turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, condemned with an overthrow, having set them as an example to those about to be impious, 
and He rescued righteous Lot, worn down by the conduct of the lawless in licentiousness, 
for the righteous man dwelling among them was tormented in his righteous soul, day by day, in seeing and hearing unlawful works— 
the LORD has known to rescue the pious out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous being punished to the day of judgment, 
and chiefly those following after the flesh in lust and defilement, and despising lordship. Bold, self-pleased, they are not afraid to speak evil of glorious ones, 
whereas messengers, being greater in strength and power, do not bear a slanderous judgment against them before the LORD; 
and these, as irrational natural beasts, made to be caught and destroyed—in what things they are ignorant of, slandering—in their destruction will be destroyed; 
doing unjustly, they will receive a reward of unrighteousness, esteeming pleasure in the day, and luxury—they are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits, feasting with you, 
having eyes full of adultery, and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised in covetousnesses, children of a curse, 
having forsaken a right way, they went astray, having followed in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved a reward of unrighteousness, 
and had a rebuke of his own iniquity—a mute donkey, having spoken in man’s voice, forbid the madness of the prophet. 
These are wells without water, and clouds driven by a storm, to whom the deepest gloom of darkness has been kept throughout the age; 
for speaking swollen words of vanity, they entice in desires of the flesh—licentiousness, those who had truly escaped from those conducting themselves in error, 
promising liberty to them, themselves being servants of corruption, for by whom anyone has been overcome, he has been brought to servitude to this one also; 
for if having escaped from the defilements of the world, in the acknowledging of the LORD and Savior Jesus Christ, and again being entangled by these things, they have been overcome, the last things have become worse to them than the first, 
for it were better to them not to have acknowledged the way of righteousness, than having acknowledged it, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them, 
and that of the true proverb has happened to them: “A dog turned back on his own vomit,” and, “A sow having bathed herself—to rolling in mire.” 
This is now, beloved, a second letter I write to you, in both which I stir up your pure mind in reminding you 
to be mindful of the sayings said before by the holy prophets, and of the command of us the apostles of the LORD and Savior, 
knowing this first, that there will come scoffers in the last days, going on according to their own desires, 
and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things so remain from the beginning of the creation”; 
for this they willingly conceal, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth having been established by the word of God out of water and through water, 
through which the world then, having been flooded by water, was destroyed; 
and by the same word, the present heavens and earth, having been stored up for fire, are being preserved until the day of judgment and destruction of impious men. 
And do not let this one thing be concealed from you, beloved, that one day with the LORD is as one thousand years and one thousand years as one day; 
the LORD is not slow in regard to the promise, as some count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not intending any to be lost, but all to come to conversion, 
and it will come—the Day of the LORD—as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements will be dissolved with burning heat, and the earth and the works in it will not be found. 
All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy behaviors and pious acts, 
waiting for and hurrying the coming of the Day of God, by which the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with burning heat? 
And we wait for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise, in which righteousness dwells; 
for this reason, beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent, spotless and unblameable, to be found by Him in peace, 
and count the long-suffering of our Lord as salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul—according to the wisdom given to him—wrote to you, 
as also in all the letters, speaking in them concerning these things, among which are some things that are hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable twist, as also the other Writings, to their own destruction. 
You, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, you may fall from your own steadfastness, 
and increase in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; to Him is the glory both now, and to the day of the age! Amen.
That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the Word of Life— 
and the Life appeared, and we have seen, and testify, and declare to you the continuous Life, which was with the Father, and was revealed to us— 
we declare to you that which we have seen and heard, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ; 
and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full. 
And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness is not in Him at all; 
if we may say, “We have fellowship with Him,” and may walk in the darkness—we lie, and do not speak the truth; 
and if we may walk in the light, as He is in the light—we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin; 
if we may say, “We have no sin,” we lead ourselves astray, and the truth is not in us; 
if we may confess our sins, He is steadfast and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness; 
if we may say, “We have not sinned,” we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us. 
My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin: and if anyone may sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous One, 
and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for the whole world, 
and in this we know that we have known Him, if we may keep His commands; 
he who is saying, “I have known Him,” and is not keeping His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 
and whoever may keep His word, truly the love of God has been perfected in him; in this we know that we are in Him. 
He who is saying he remains in Him, himself ought to also walk according as He walked. 
Beloved, I do not write a new command to you, but an old command, that you had from the beginning—the old command is the word that you heard from the beginning; 
again, a new command I write to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light now shines; 
he who is saying he is in the light, and is hating his brother, he is in the darkness until now; 
he who is loving his brother, he remains in the light, and there is not a stumbling-block in him; 
but he who is hating his brother, he is in the darkness, and he walks in the darkness, and he has not known where he goes, because the darkness blinded his eyes. 
I write to you, little children, because sins have been forgiven you through His Name; 
I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one; I write to you, little youths, because you have known the Father; 
I wrote to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning; I wrote to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 
Do not love the world, nor the things in the world; if anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 
because all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of one’s life—is not of the Father, but of the world, 
and the world is passing away, and the desire of it, but he who is doing the will of God, he remains—throughout the age. 
Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as you heard that the antichrist comes, even now antichrists have become many—whereby we know that it is the last hour; 
they went forth out of us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out so that they might be revealed that they are not all of us. 
And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things; 
I did not write to you because you have not known the truth, but because you have known it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son; 
everyone who is denying the Son, neither has the Father; he who is confessing the Son has the Father also. 
You, then, that which you heard from the beginning, let it remain in you; if that which you heard from the beginning may remain in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father, 
and this is the promise that He promised us—the continuous life. 
These things I wrote to you concerning those leading you astray; 
and you, the anointing that you received from Him, it remains in you, and you have no need that anyone may teach you, but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, you will remain in Him. 
And now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He may have appeared, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before Him, at His coming; 
if you know that He is righteous, know that everyone doing righteousness, has been begotten of Him. 
See what love the Father has given to us, that we may be called children of God; because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 
Beloved, now, we are children of God, and it was not yet revealed what we will be. We have known that if He may have appeared, we will be like Him, because we will see Him as He is; 
and everyone who is having this hope on Him, purifies himself, even as He is pure. 
Everyone who is doing sin, he also does lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness, 
and you have known that He appeared that He may take away our sins, and sin is not in Him; 
everyone who is remaining in Him does not sin; everyone who is sinning, has not seen Him, nor known Him. 
Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous, 
he who is doing sin, he is of the Devil, because the Devil sins from the beginning; for this reason the Son of God appeared, that He may undo the works of the Devil; 
everyone who has been begotten of God, he does not sin, because His seed remains in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been begotten of God. 
In this are revealed the children of God, and the children of the Devil; everyone who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother, 
because this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we may love one another, 
not as Cain—he was of the evil one, and he slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother were righteous. 
Do not wonder, my brothers, if the world hates you; 
we have known that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers; he who is not loving his brother remains in death. 
Everyone who is hating his brother is a manslayer, and you have known that no manslayer has continuous life remaining in him; 
in this we have known love, because He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers; 
and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his yearnings from him—how does the love of God remain in him? 
My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in work and in truth! 
And in this we know that we are of the truth, and before Him we will assure our hearts, 
because if our heart may condemn—because greater is God than our heart, and He knows all things. 
Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God, 
and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commands, and we do the things pleasing before Him, 
and this is His command, that we may believe in the Name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He gave command to us, 
and he who is keeping His commands, remains in Him, and He in him; and in this we know that He remains in us, from the Spirit that He gave us. 
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world. 
In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh, it is of God, 
and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ having come in the flesh, it is not of God; and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world. 
You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you, than he who is in the world. 
They are of the world, because they speak of this from the world, and the world hears them; 
we are of God; he who is knowing God hears us; he who is not of God, does not hear us; from this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 
Beloved, may we love one another, because love is of God, and everyone loving has been begotten of God, and knows God; 
he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love. 
In this was revealed the love of God in us, because God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we may live through Him; 
in this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son as the propitiation for our sins. 
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another; 
no one has ever seen God; if we may love one another, God remains in us, and His love is having been perfected in us; 
in this we know that we remain in Him, and He in us, because of His Spirit He has given us. 
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world; 
whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God; 
and we have known and believed the love that God has in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in love, remains in God, and God in him. 
In this, love has been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because even as He is, we also are in this world. 
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and he who is fearing has not been made perfect in love; 
we love Him, because He first loved us; 
if anyone may say, “I love God,” and may hate his brother, he is a liar; for he who is not loving his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love God whom he has not seen? 
And this is the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother. 
Everyone who is believing that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who is loving Him who begot, also loves him who is begotten of Him. 
In this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God and may keep His commands; 
for this is the love of God, that we may keep His commands, and His commands are not burdensome; 
because everyone who is begotten of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory that overcame the world—our faith. 
Who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God? 
This One is He who came through water and blood—Jesus the Christ, not in water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit is the One testifying, because the Spirit is the truth, 
because there are three who are testifying in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one; 
and there are three who are testifying in the earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one. 
If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son. 
He who is believing in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning His Son; 
and this is the testimony, that God gave continuous life to us, and this life is in His Son; 
he who is having the Son has life; he who is not having the Son of God does not have life. 
I wrote these things to you who are believing in the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have continuous life, and that you may believe in the Name of the Son of God. 
And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if we may ask anything according to His will, He hears us, 
and if we have known that He hears us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him. 
If anyone may see his brother sinning a sin that is not to death, he will ask, and He will give life to him—to those not sinning to death; there is sin to death—I do not say that he may ask concerning it; 
all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that is not to death. 
We have known that everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, but He who was begotten of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him; 
we have known that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the power of the evil one; 
but we have known that the Son of God has come, and has given us a mind that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this One is the true God and the continuous Life! 
Little children, guard yourselves from idols! Amen.
The elder to the chosen lady, and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those having known the truth, 
because of the truth that is remaining in us, and will be with us throughout the age, 
there will be with you grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
I rejoiced exceedingly that I have found of your children walking in truth, even as we received a command from the Father; 
and now I implore you, lady, not as writing to you a new command, but which we had from the beginning, that we may love one another, 
and this is love, that we may walk according to His commands; this is the command, even as you heard from the beginning, that you may walk in it, 
because many deceivers entered into the world, who are not confessing Jesus Christ coming in flesh; this one is he who is leading astray, and the antichrist. 
See to yourselves that you may not lose the things that we worked for, but may receive a full reward; 
everyone who is transgressing, and is not remaining in the teaching of the Christ, does not have God; he who is remaining in the teaching of the Christ, this one has both the Father and the Son; 
if anyone comes to you, and does not bear this teaching, do not receive him into the house, and do not say to him, “Greetings!” 
For he who is saying to him, “Greetings,” has fellowship with his evil works. 
Having many things to write to you, I did not intend it with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full. 
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth! 
Beloved, I desire you to prosper concerning all things, and to be in health, even as your soul prospers, 
for I rejoiced exceedingly, brothers coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you walk in truth; 
I have no joy greater than these things, that I may hear of my children walking in truth. 
Beloved, you act faithfully in whatever you may do toward the brothers and the one among strangers, 
who testified of your love before an assembly, whom you will do well, having sent forward worthily of God, 
because they went forth for His Name, receiving nothing from the nations; 
we, then, ought to receive such, that we may become fellow-workers to the truth. 
I wrote to the assembly, but he who is loving to be first among them—Diotrephes—does not receive us; 
because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he does, talking nonsense against us with evil words; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and he forbids those intending to receive them, and he casts them out of the assembly. 
Beloved, do not be following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, he is of God, but he who is doing evil has not seen God; 
testimony has been given to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself, and we also—we testify, and you have known that our testimony is true. 
Many things I had to write, but I do not wish to write to you through ink and pen, 
and I hope to see you soon, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to you! The friends greet you. Be greeting the friends by name. 
-
Judas, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those called, having been loved in God the Father, and having been kept in Jesus Christ, 
mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you! 
Beloved, using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting you to fight for the faith once delivered to the holy ones, 
for there came in certain men stealthily, having been written beforehand to this judgment long ago, impious, perverting the grace of our God to licentiousness, and denying our only Master and Lord—Jesus Christ. 
Now I intend to remind you, you once having known all this, that Jesus, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, He secondly destroyed those not having believed; 
messengers also, those who did not keep their own principality, but left their proper dwelling, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness until the judgment of the great day, 
as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these messengers, having given themselves to whoredom, and having gone after other flesh, have been set before as an example, undergoing the justice of continuous fire. 
In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming indeed defile the flesh, and they disregard lordship, and they speak evil of glorious ones, 
yet Michael, the chief messenger, when disputing with the Devil, reasoning about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring against him a judgment of slander, but said, “The LORD rebuke you!” 
But these, indeed, whatever things they have not known, they speak evil of; and whatever they know, like the irrational beasts, they understand naturally—in these they are corrupted; 
woe to them! Because they went on in the way of Cain, and they rushed to the deceit of Balaam for reward, and in the controversy of Korah they perished. 
These are stains at your love-feasts, feasting together with you without fear, shepherding themselves; waterless clouds, being carried away by winds; autumnal trees without fruit, having died twice, having been uprooted; 
wild waves of a sea, foaming up their own shameful deeds; stars going astray, for whom the gloom of the darkness throughout the age has been kept. 
And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied to these, saying, “Behold, the LORD has come with myriads of His holy ones, 
to do judgment against all, and to convict all their impious ones, concerning all their works of impiety that they did impiously, and concerning all the harsh words that impious sinners spoke against Him.” 
These are discontented grumblers, walking according to their own lusts; and their mouth speaks swollen words, giving admiration to persons for the sake of profit; 
but you, beloved, remember the sayings spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
that they said to you, that in the last time there will be scoffers, following after their own lusts of impieties, 
these are those causing divisions, natural men, not having the Spirit. 
But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 
keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ resulting in continuous life; 
and, indeed, show mercy to those who are doubting, 
and rescue others by snatching them out of fire; but show mercy to others in fear, hating even the coat having been stained from the flesh. 
And to Him who is able to guard you without stumbling, and to set you in the presence of His glory unblemished, in gladness, 
to the only wise God our Savior, is glory and greatness, power and authority, both now and forever! Amen.
A revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave to Him to show to His servants what things must quickly come to pass; and He signified it, having sent through His messenger to His servant John, 
who testified to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as he also saw. 
Blessed is he who is reading, and those hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it, for the time is near! 
John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the Seven Spirits that are before His throne, 
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn out of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth; to Him loving us and having released us from our sins in His blood, 
He has also made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him—the glory and the power through the ages of the ages! Amen. 
Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land will wail because of Him. Yes! Amen! 
“I am the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, says the LORD, who is, and who was, and who is coming—the Almighty.” 
I, John, who am also your brother, and fellow-partner in the tribulation, and in the kingdom and endurance of Jesus Christ, was in the island that is called Patmos, because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ; 
I was in the Spirit on the LORD’s Day, and I heard a great voice behind me, as of a trumpet, saying, 
“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,” and, “Write what you see in a scroll, and send it to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.” 
And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me, and having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, 
and in the midst of the seven lampstands, One like a Son of Man, clothed to the foot, and having been girded around at the breasts with a golden girdle, 
and His head and hairs were white, as if white wool—as snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire; 
and His feet like to frankincense-colored brass, as having been fired in a furnace, and His voice as a sound of many waters; 
and having seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword is proceeding, and His countenance—as the sun shining in its might. 
And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead, and He placed His right hand on me, saying to me, “Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last, 
and He who is living, and I became dead, and behold, I am living through the ages of the ages. Amen! And I have the keys of Hades and of death. 
Write the things that you have seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to come after these things; 
the secret of the seven stars that you have seen on My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are messengers of the seven assemblies, and the seven lampstands that you have seen are seven assemblies.” 
“To the messenger of the Ephesian assembly write: These things says He who is holding the seven stars in His right hand, who is walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands: 
I have known your works, and your labor, and your endurance, and that you are not able to bear evil ones, and that you have tried those saying themselves to be apostles and are not, and have found them liars, 
and you bore, and have endurance, and have toiled because of My Name, and have not been weary. 
But I have against you that you left your first love! 
Remember, then, from where you have fallen, and convert, and do the first works; and if not, I come to you quickly, and will remove your lampstand from its place—if you may not convert; 
but this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, that I also hate. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies: To him who is overcoming—I will give to him to eat of the Tree of Life that is in the midst of the paradise of God. 
And to the messenger of the assembly of the Smyrneans write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived: 
I have known your works, and tribulation, and poverty—yet you are rich—and the slander of those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. 
Do not be afraid of the things that you are about to suffer; behold, the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation ten days; become faithful to death, and I will give to you the garland of life. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies: He who is overcoming may not be injured of the second death. 
And to the messenger of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things says He who is having the sharp two-edged sword: 
I have known your works, and where you dwell—where the throne of Satan is—and you hold fast My Name, and you did not deny My faith, even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness, who was put to death beside you, where Satan dwells. 
But I have a few things against you: that you have there those holding the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom; 
so have you, even you, those holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans—which thing I hate. 
Convert! And if not, I come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies: To him who is overcoming, I will give to him to eat from the hidden manna, and will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, that no one knew except him who is receiving it. 
And to the messenger of the assembly of Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, who is having His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like to frankincense-colored brass: 
I have known your works, and love, and ministry, and faith, and your endurance, and your works—and the last are more than the first. 
But I have a few things against you: that you allow the woman Jezebel, who is calling herself a prophetess, to teach, and to lead astray, My servants to commit whoredom, and to eat idol-sacrifices; 
and I gave to her a time that she might convert from her whoredom, and she did not convert; 
behold, I will cast her into a bed, and those committing adultery with her into great tribulation—if they may not convert from her works, 
and I will kill her children in death, and all the assemblies will know that I am He who is searching affections and hearts; and I will give to you—to each—according to your works. 
And to you I say, and to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, and who did not know the depths of Satan, as they say—I will not put on you another burden, 
but hold that which you have, until I may come; 
and he who is overcoming, and who is keeping My works to the end, I will give to him authority over the nations, 
and he will rule them with a rod of iron—they will be broken as the vessels of the potter—as I have also received from My Father; 
and I will give to him the morning star. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” 
“And to the messenger of the assembly in Sardis write: These things says He who is having the Seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I have known your works, and that you have the name that you live, and you are dead; 
be watching, and strengthen the rest of the things that are about to die, for I have not found your works fulfilled before God. 
Remember, then, what you have received and heard, and keep it and convert: if, then, you may not watch, I will come on you as a thief, and you may not know what hour I will come on you. 
You have a few names even in Sardis who did not defile their garments, and they will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy. 
The one thus overcoming will be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Scroll of Life, and I will confess his name before My Father, and before His messengers. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. 
And to the messenger of the assembly in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the True One, having the key of David, the One opening and no one will shut, and shutting and no one opens: 
I have known your works; behold, I have set before you a door having been opened, which no one is able to shut it, because you have little power, and yet have kept My word, and have not denied My Name; 
behold, I give from the synagogue of Satan—those saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but lie—behold, I will make them that they may come and prostrate before your feet, and may know that I loved you. 
Because you kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of the trial that is about to come on all the world, to try those dwelling on the earth. 
Behold, I come quickly, be holding fast that which you have, that no one may receive your garland. 
He who is overcoming—I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he may not go outside anymore, and I will write on him the Name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, that comes down out of Heaven from My God—also My new Name. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. 
And to the messenger of the assembly of the Laodiceans write: These things says the Amen, the Witness—the Faithful and True—the Chief of the creation of God: 
I have known your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot. 
So—because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth; 
because you say—I am rich, and have grown rich, and have need of nothing, and have not known that you are the wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked; 
I counsel you to buy from Me gold fired by fire, that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, and with eye-salve anoint your eyes, that you may see. 
As many as I cherish, I convict and discipline; be zealous, then, and convert; 
behold, I have stood at the door, and I knock; if anyone may hear My voice, and may open the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with Me. 
He who is overcoming—I will give to him to sit with Me in My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father in His throne. 
He who is having an ear—let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.” 
After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in the sky, and the first voice that I heard—as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying, “Come up here, and I will show you what must come to pass after these things”; 
and immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and on the throne is One sitting, 
and He who is sitting was in appearance like a stone, jasper and sardine: and a rainbow was around the throne in appearance like an emerald. 
And around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and sitting on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders, having been clothed in white garments, and on their heads golden garlands; 
and out of the throne proceed lightnings, and thunders, and voices; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the Seven Spirits of God, 
and before the throne—a sea of glass like to crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and around the throne—four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind; 
and the first living creature—like a lion; and the second living creature—like a calf; and the third living creature has the face as a man; and the fourth living creature—like an eagle flying. 
And the four living creatures, one by one of them had six wings respectively, around and within are full of eyes, and they have no rest day and night, saying, “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, the LORD God, the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming”; 
and when the living creatures give glory, and honor, and thanksgiving, to the One sitting on the throne, the One living through the ages of the ages, 
the twenty-four elders will fall down before the One sitting on the throne, and worship the One living through the ages of the ages, and they will cast their garlands before the throne, saying, 
“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory, and the honor, and the power, because You created all things, and because of Your will they existed and were created.” 
And I saw a scroll on the right hand of Him who is sitting on the throne, written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals; 
and I saw a strong messenger crying with a great voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?” 
And no one was able in Heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to behold it. 
And I was weeping much, because no one was found worthy to open and to read the scroll, nor to behold it, 
and one of the elders says to me, “Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has overcome to open the scroll, and to loose its seven seals”; 
and I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the Seven Spirits of God, which are sent to all the earth, 
and He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who is sitting on the throne. 
And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each one having harps and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy ones, 
and they sing a new song, saying, “Worthy are You to take the scroll, and to open its seals, because You were slain, and You purchased us to God in Your blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, 
and made them to be to our God kings and priests, and they will reign on the earth.” 
And I saw, and I heard the voice of many messengers around the throne, and the living creatures, and the elders—and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands— 
saying with a great voice, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!” 
And every creature that is in Heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and the things that are on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, “To Him who is sitting on the throne and to the Lamb—the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the might—through the ages of the ages!” 
And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and they worship Him who is living through the ages of the ages. 
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as it were a voice of thunder, “Come and behold!” 
And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who is sitting on it is having a bow, and there was given to him a garland, and he went forth overcoming, and that he may overcome. 
And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come and behold!” 
And there went forth another horse—fire-colored, and to him who is sitting on it, there was given to him to take peace from the earth, and that they may slay one another, and there was given to him a great sword. 
And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come and behold!” And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and he who is sitting on it is having a balance in his hand, 
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius, and you may not injure the oil and the wine.” 
And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come and behold!” 
And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and he who is sitting on him—his name is Death, and Hades follows with him, and there was given to them authority to kill over the fourth part of the earth with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth. 
And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony that they held, 
and they were crying with a great voice, saying, “Until when, O Master, the Holy and the True, do You not judge and take vengeance of our blood from those dwelling on the earth?” 
And there was given to each one a white robe, and it was said to them that they may rest themselves yet a short time, until may also be fulfilled their fellow-servants and their brothers, who are about to be killed—even as they. 
And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, a great earthquake came, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, 
and the stars of Heaven fell to the earth—as a fig tree casts her unripe figs, being shaken by a great wind— 
and the sky departed as a scroll rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places; 
and the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chiefs of thousands, and the mighty, and every servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains, 
and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him who is sitting on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb,” 
because the great day of His anger has come, and who is able to stand? 
And after these things I saw four messengers, standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind may not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree; 
and I saw another messenger going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he cried with a great voice to the four messengers, to whom it was given to injure the land and the sea, saying, 
“Do not injure the land, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we may seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.” 
And I heard the number of those sealed—one hundred forty-four thousand, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: 
of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed; 
of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed; 
of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed; 
of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed. 
After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no one was able to number, out of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, having been clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands, 
and crying with a great voice, saying, “Salvation to our God, the One sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb!” 
And all the messengers stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
saying, “Amen! The blessing, and the glory, and the wisdom, and the thanksgiving, and the honor, and the power, and the strength, are to our God through the ages of the ages! Amen!” 
And one of the elders answered, saying to me, “These having been clothed with the white robes, who are they, and from where have they come?” 
And I have said to him, “Lord, you have known”; and he said to me, “These are those who are coming out of the Great Tribulation, and they washed their robes, and they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb; 
because of this they are before the throne of God, and they do service to Him day and night in His temple, and He who is sitting on the throne will dwell over them; 
they will not hunger anymore, nor may the sun fall on them, nor any heat, 
because the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” 
And when He opens the seventh seal, there came silence in Heaven about half an hour, 
and I saw the seven messengers who have stood before God, and there were given to them seven trumpets, 
and another messenger came, and he stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there was given to him much incense, that he may give it to the prayers of all the holy ones on the golden altar that is before the throne, 
and the smoke of the incenses, with the prayers of the holy ones, went up before God out of the hand of the messenger; 
and the messenger took the censer, and filled it out of the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth, and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
And the seven messengers who are having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they may sound the trumpets; 
and the first messenger sounded the trumpet, and there came hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth, and the third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
And the second messenger sounded the trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood, 
and the third of the creatures that are in the sea died, those having life, and the third of the ships were destroyed. 
And the third messenger sounded the trumpet, and there fell out of the sky a great star, burning as a lamp, and it fell on the third of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters, 
and the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third of the waters become wormwood, and many of the men died because of the waters, because they were made bitter. 
And the fourth messenger sounded the trumpet, and the third of the sun was struck, and the third of the moon, and the third of the stars, that the third of them may be darkened, and that the day may not shine—the third of it, and the night in like manner. 
And I saw, and I heard one messenger, flying in midair, saying with a great voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three messengers being about to sound trumpets.” 
And the fifth messenger sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star having fallen to the earth out of Heaven, and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss, 
and he opened the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit. 
And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority, 
and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads, 
and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment—as the torment of a scorpion—when it may strike a man; 
and in those days men will seek death and they will not find it, and they will desire to die, and death will flee from them. 
And the likenesses of the locusts—like to horses made ready to battle, and on their heads something as garlands like gold, and their faces as faces of men, 
and they had hair as hair of women, and their teeth were as those of lions, 
and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings—as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle; 
and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority is to injure men five months; 
and they have over them a king—the messenger of the abyss—a name is to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he has a name, Apollyon. 
The first woe went forth, behold, there yet come two woes after these things. 
And the sixth messenger sounded the trumpet, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the altar of gold that is before God, 
saying to the sixth messenger who had the trumpet, “Loose the four messengers who are bound at the great river Euphrates”; 
and the four messengers were loosed, who have been made ready for the hour, and day, and month, and year, that they may kill the third of mankind; 
and the number of the forces of the horsemen—twice ten thousand ten thousands, and I heard the number of them. 
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses are as heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone; 
by these three plagues the third of mankind was killed, from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the brimstone, that is proceeding out of their mouths, 
for the power of the horses are in their mouth, and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and they injure with them. 
And the rest of mankind, who were not killed in these plagues, neither converted from the works of their hands, that they may not worship the demons, and idols, those of gold, and those of silver, and those of brass, and those of stone, and those of wood, that are neither able to see, nor to hear, nor to walk, 
and they did not convert from their murders, nor from their sorceries, nor from their whoredoms, nor from their thefts. 
And I saw another strong messenger coming down out of Heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, 
and he had in his hand a little scroll opened, and he placed his right foot on the sea, and the left on the land, 
and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars, and when he cried, the seven thunders spoke out their voices; 
and when the seven thunders spoke their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of Heaven saying to me, “Seal the things that the seven thunders spoke,” and, “You may not write these things.” 
And the messenger whom I saw standing on the sea, and on the land, lifted up his hand to the sky, 
and swore by Him who lives through the ages of the ages, who created the sky and the things in it, and the land and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it—that time will not be yet, 
but in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, when he may be about to sound the trumpet, and the secret of God may be accomplished, as He declared to His own servants, to the prophets. 
And the voice that I heard out of Heaven is again speaking with me, and saying, “Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the messenger who has been standing on the sea, and on the land”: 
and I went away to the messenger, saying to him, “Give me the little scroll”; and he says to me, “Take, and eat it up, and it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” 
And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the messenger, and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey, and when I ate it my belly was made bitter; 
and he says to me, “You must again prophesy about many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” 
And there was given to me a reed like to a rod, and the messenger stood, saying, “Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those worshiping in it; 
and leave out the court that is outside the temple, and you may not measure it, because it was given to the nations, and they will tread down the holy city forty-two months; 
and I will give to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand, two hundred, sixty days, clothed with sackcloth”; 
these are the two olive trees, and the two lampstands that stand before the God of the earth; 
and if anyone may will to injure them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies, and if anyone may will to injure them, thus it is required of him to be killed. 
These have authority to shut the sky, that rain may not rain in the days of their prophecy, and they have authority over the waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the land with every plague, as often as they may will. 
And when they may finish their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them, 
and their body is on the street of the great city that is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified, 
and they gaze—those of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations—on their dead bodies three and a half days, and they will not allow their dead bodies to be put into tombs, 
and those dwelling on the earth will rejoice over them, and will make merry, and they will send gifts to one another, because these—the two prophets—tormented those dwelling on the earth. 
And after the three and a half days, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those beholding them, 
and they heard a great voice out of Heaven saying to them, “Come up here”; and they went up to Heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them; 
and in that hour a great earthquake came, and the tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became frightened, and they gave glory to the God of Heaven. 
The second woe went forth, behold, the third woe comes quickly. 
And the seventh messenger sounded the trumpet, and there came great voices in Heaven, saying, “The kingdoms of the world became those of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign through the ages of the ages!” 
And the twenty-four elders, who are sitting on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
saying, “We give thanks to You, O LORD God, the Almighty, who is, and who was, and who is coming, because You have taken Your great power and reigned; 
and the nations were angry, and Your anger came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to Your servants, to the prophets, and to the holy ones, and to those fearing Your Name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.” 
And the temple of God was opened in Heaven, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen in His temple, and there came lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail. 
And a great sign was seen in the sky: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars, 
and having a child in her womb she cries out, travailing and being in pain to bring forth. 
And there was seen another sign in the sky, and behold, a great fire-colored dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads, 
and his tail draws the third of the stars of the sky, and he cast them to the earth; and the dragon stood before the woman who is about to bring forth, that when she may bring forth, he may devour her child; 
and she brought forth a male son, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and her child was snatched up to God and to His throne, 
and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place made ready from God, that there they may nourish her—one thousand, two hundred, sixty days. 
And there came war in Heaven: Michael and his messengers warred against the dragon, and the dragon and his messengers warred, 
and they did not prevail, nor was their place found anymore in Heaven; 
and the great dragon was cast forth—the old serpent, who is called “Devil,” and “Satan,” who is leading the whole world astray—he was cast forth to the earth, and his messengers were cast forth with him. 
And I heard a great voice saying in Heaven, “Now came the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom, of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brothers was cast down, who is accusing them before our God day and night; 
and they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life—to death; 
because of this be glad, you heavens, and those who dwell in them; woe to those inhabiting the earth and the sea, because the Devil went down to you, having great wrath, having known that he has a short time.” 
And when the dragon saw that he was cast forth to the earth, he pursued the woman who brought forth the male, 
and there were given to the woman two wings of the great eagle, that she may fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent; 
and the serpent cast forth out of his mouth water as a river after the woman, that he may cause her to be carried away by the river, 
and the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon cast forth out of his mouth; 
and the dragon was angry against the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus. 
- 
And I stood on the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and ten crowns on its horns, and on its heads names of slander, 
and the beast that I saw was like to a leopard, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave to it his power, and his throne, and great authority. 
And I saw one of its heads as slain to death, and its deadly wound was healed, and all the earth wondered after the beast, 
and they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like to the beast? Who is able to war with it?” 
And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and slanders, and there was given to it authority to make war forty-two months, 
and it opened its mouth for slander toward God, to slander His Name, and of His dwelling place, and of those who dwell in Heaven, 
and there was given to it to make war with the holy ones, and to overcome them, and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and tongue, and nation. 
And all who are dwelling on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Scroll of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; 
if anyone has an ear—let him hear: 
if anyone goes into captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone is to be killed with sword, it is necessary of him by sword to be killed; here is the endurance and the faith of the holy ones. 
And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, and it was speaking as a dragon, 
and all the authority of the first beast does it do before it, and it makes the earth and those dwelling in it that they will worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed, 
and it does great signs, that fire also it may make to come down from the sky to the earth before men, 
and it leads astray those dwelling on the earth, because of the signs that were given it to do before the beast, saying to those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast that has the wound of the sword and lived, 
and there was given to it to give a spirit to the image of the beast, that also the image of the beast may speak, and it may cause as many as will not worship the image of the beast, that they may be killed. 
And it makes all, the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, and the freemen, and the servants, that it may give to them a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 
and that no one may be able to buy, or to sell, except he who is having the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
Here is the wisdom! He who is having the understanding, let him count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and its number: six hundred sixty-six. 
And I saw, and behold, a Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred forty-four thousand, having the Name of His Father written on their foreheads; 
and I heard a voice out of Heaven, as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder, and I heard a voice of harpists harping with their harps, 
and they sing, as it were, a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who have been bought from the earth; 
these are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgin; these are they who are following the Lamb wherever He may go; these were bought from among men—a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb— 
and in their mouth there was not found guile, for they are unblemished before the throne of God. 
And I saw another messenger flying in midair, having continuous good news to proclaim to those dwelling on the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people, 
saying in a great voice, “Fear God, and give to Him glory, because the hour of His judgment came, and worship Him who made the sky, and the land, and sea, and fountains of waters.” 
And another messenger followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, because of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom she has given to all nations to drink.” 
And a third messenger followed them, saying in a great voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God that has been mingled unmixed in the cup of His anger, and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy messengers, and before the Lamb, 
and the smoke of their torment goes up through ages of ages; and they have no rest day and night, who are worshiping the beast and his image, also if any receive the mark of his name. 
Here is endurance of the holy ones; here are those keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.” 
And I heard a voice out of Heaven saying to me, “Write: Blessed are the dead who are dying in the LORD from this time!” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “That they may rest from their labors—and their works follow them!” 
And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud One sitting like a Son of Man, having on His head a golden garland, and in His hand a sharp sickle; 
and another messenger came forth out of the temple crying in a great voice to Him who is sitting on the cloud, “Send forth Your sickle and reap, because the hour of reaping has come to You, because the harvest of the earth has been ripe”; 
and He who is sitting on the cloud put forth His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. 
And another messenger came forth out of the temple that is in Heaven, having—he also—a sharp sickle, 
and another messenger came forth out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, “Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, because her grapes have come to perfection”; 
and the messenger put forth his sickle to the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God; 
and the winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came forth out of the winepress—to the bridles of the horses, one thousand six hundred stadia. 
And I saw another sign in the sky, great and wonderful: seven messengers having the seven last plagues, because in these the wrath of God was completed, 
and I saw as a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who gain the victory over the beast, and his image, and his mark, and the number of his name, standing by the sea of the glass, having harps of God, 
and they sing the song of Moses, servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and wonderful are Your works, O LORD God, the Almighty, righteous and true are Your ways, O King of holy ones! 
Who may not fear You, O LORD, and glorify Your Name? Because You alone are holy, because all the nations will come and worship before You, because Your righteous acts were revealed.” 
And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the Dwelling Place of the Testimony was opened in Heaven; 
and the seven messengers having the seven plagues came forth out of the temple, clothed in linen, pure and radiant, and girded around the breasts with golden girdles: 
and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden bowls, full of the wrath of God, who is living through the ages of the ages; 
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven messengers may be completed. 
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven messengers, “Go away, and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God into the earth”; 
and the first went away, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and there came a sore—bad and grievous—to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those worshiping his image. 
And the second messenger poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of one dead, and every living soul in the sea died. 
And the third messenger poured out his bowl into the rivers, and into the fountains of the waters, and there came blood, 
and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, “Righteous, O LORD, are You, who is, and who was, and who will be, the Holy One, because You judged these things, 
because they poured out the blood of holy ones and prophets, and You gave to them blood to drink, for they are worthy”; 
and I heard another out of the altar, saying, “Yes, LORD God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.” 
And the fourth messenger poured out his bowl on the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire, 
and men were scorched with great heat, and they slandered the Name of God, who has authority over these plagues, and they did not convert—to give to Him glory. 
And the fifth messenger poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain, 
and they slandered the God of Heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not convert from their works. 
And the sixth messenger poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates, and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready; 
and I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs— 
for they are spirits of demons, doing signs—which go forth to the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty. 
(“Behold, I come as a thief; blessed is he who is watching, and keeping his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they may see his unseemliness.”) 
And they brought them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon. 
And the seventh messenger poured out his bowl on the air, and there came forth a great voice from the temple of Heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 
And there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as has not come since men came on the earth, so mighty an earthquake—so great! 
And it came—the great city—into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger, 
and every island fled away, and mountains were not found, 
and great hail (as of talent weight) comes down out of the sky on men, and men slandered God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great. 
And there came one of the seven messengers, who were having the seven bowls, and he spoke with me, saying to me, “Come, I will show to you the judgment of the great whore, who is sitting on the many waters, 
with whom the kings of the earth committed whoredom; and those inhabiting the earth were made drunk from the wine of her whoredom”; 
and he carried me away to a wilderness in the Spirit, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of slander, having seven heads and ten horns, 
and the woman was clothed with purple and scarlet-color, and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and uncleanness of her whoredom, 
and on her forehead was a name written: “SECRET, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE WHORES, AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” 
And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the holy ones, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, and I wondered—having seen her—with great wonder; 
and the messenger said to me, “For this reason did you wonder? I will tell you the secret of the woman and of the beast that is carrying her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. 
The beast that you saw: it was, and it is not, and it is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go away to destruction, and those dwelling on the earth will wonder, whose names have not been written on the Scroll of Life from the foundation of the world, beholding the beast that was, and is not, although it is. 
Here is the mind that is having wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits, 
and there are seven kings, the five fell, and the one is, the other did not yet come, and when he may come, it is necessary for him to remain a short time; 
and the beast that was, and is not, he also is eighth, and he is out of the seven, and he goes away to destruction. 
And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who did not yet receive a kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast; 
these have one mind, and they will give over their own power and authority to the beast; 
these will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and those with Him are called, and chosen, and steadfast.” 
And he says to me, “The waters that you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; 
and the ten horns that you saw, and the beast, these will hate the whore, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her in fire, 
for God gave into their hearts to do His purpose, and to make one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the sayings of God may be fulfilled, 
and the woman that you saw is the great city that is having reign over the kings of the earth.” 
And after these things I saw another messenger coming down out of Heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lightened from his glory, 
and he cried in might with a great voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! And she became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird, 
because all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth committed whoredom with her, and merchants of the earth were made rich from the power of her indulgence.” 
And I heard another voice out of Heaven, saying, “Come forth out of her, My people, that you may not partake with her sins, and that you may not receive of her plagues, 
because her sins have reached up to Heaven, and God remembered her unrighteousness. 
Render to her as she also rendered to you, and double to her twofold according to her works; in the cup that she mingled mingle to her double. 
As much as she glorified herself and indulged, so much torment and sorrow give to her, because in her heart she says, I sit as queen, and I am not a widow, and I will not see sorrow; 
because of this, in one day, will come her plagues: death, and sorrow, and famine; and she will be utterly burned in fire, because strong is the LORD God who is judging her; 
and the kings of the earth will weep over her and strike themselves for her, who committed whoredom and indulged with her, when they may see the smoke of her burning, 
having stood from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! Babylon, the strong city! Because in one hour your judgment came. 
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore; 
cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all fragrant wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and brass, and iron, and marble, 
and cinnamon, and amomum, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies and souls of men. 
And the fruits of the desire of your soul went away from you, and all things—the sumptuous and the radiant—went away from you, and no more at all may you find them. 
The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far off because of the fear of her torment, weeping, and mourning, 
and saying, Woe, woe, the great city, that was clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and gilded in gold, and precious stone, and pearls— 
because in one hour so much riches were made desolate! And every shipmaster, and all the company on the ships, and sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood far off, 
and were crying, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to the great city? 
And they cast dust on their heads, and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city! In which were made rich all having ships in the sea, out of her costliness—for in one hour was she made desolate. 
Be glad over her, O Heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, because God judged your judgment of her!” 
And one strong messenger took up a stone as a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will Babylon be cast, the great city, and may not be found anymore at all; 
and voice of harpists, and musicians, and pipers, and trumpeters, may not be heard at all in you anymore; and any craftsman of any craft may not be found at all in you anymore; and noise of a millstone may not be heard at all in you anymore; 
and light of a lamp may not shine at all in you anymore; and voice of bridegroom and of bride may not be heard at all in you anymore; because your merchants were the great ones of the earth, because all the nations were led astray in your sorcery, 
and in her blood of prophets and of holy ones was found, and of all those who have been slain on the earth.” 
And after these things I heard a great voice of a great multitude in Heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! The salvation, and the glory, and the power belong to the LORD our God; 
because true and righteous are His judgments, because He judged the great whore who corrupted the earth in her whoredom, and He avenged the blood of His servants at her hand”; 
and a second time they said, “Hallelujah”; and her smoke comes up through the ages of the ages! 
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and they worshiped God who is sitting on the throne, saying, “Amen! Hallelujah!” 
And a voice out of the throne came forth, saying, “Praise our God, all you His servants, and those fearing Him, both the small and the great”; 
and I heard as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, “Hallelujah! Because our Lord, the God, the Almighty, has reigned! 
May we rejoice and exult, and give the glory to Him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready; 
and there was given to her that she may be clothed with fine linen, pure and radiant, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the holy ones.” 
And he says to me, “Write: Blessed are they who have been called to the banquet of the marriage of the Lamb”; and he says to me, “These are the true words of God”; 
and I fell before his feet to worship him, and he says to me, “Behold—No! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers, those having the testimony of Jesus; worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.” 
And I saw Heaven having been opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who is sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war, 
and His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on His head are many crowns—having a Name written that no one has known, except Himself, 
and He is clothed with a garment covered with blood, and His Name is called, The Word of God. 
And the armies in Heaven were following Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen—white and pure; 
and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp sword, that with it He may strike the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron, and He treads the press of the wine of the wrath and the anger of God the Almighty, 
and He has on the garment and on His thigh the name written: “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.” 
And I saw one messenger standing in the sun, and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds that are flying in midair, “Come and be gathered together to the banquet of the great God or the great banquet of God, 
that you may eat flesh of kings, and flesh of chiefs of thousands, and flesh of strong men, and flesh of horses, and of those sitting on them, and the flesh of all—freemen and servants—both small and great.” 
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, having been gathered together to make war with Him who is sitting on the horse, and with His army; 
and the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who did the signs before him, in which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image; the two were cast living into the lake of the fire that is burning with brimstone; 
and the rest were killed with the sword of Him who is sitting on the horse, which is proceeding out of His mouth, and all the birds were filled with their flesh. 
And I saw a messenger coming down out of Heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain over his hand, 
and he laid hold on the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him one thousand years, 
and he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and put a seal on him, that he may no longer lead the nations astray, until the one thousand years may be completed; and after these it is necessary for him to be loosed a short time. 
And I saw thrones, and they that sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast, nor his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand, and they lived and reigned with the Christ one thousand years; 
and the rest of the dead did not live again until the one thousand years may be completed; this is the first resurrection. 
Blessed and holy—he who is having part in the first resurrection; the second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will reign with Him one thousand years. 
And when the one thousand years may be completed, Satan will be loosed out of his prison, 
and he will go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them together to war, of whom the number—as the sand of the sea; 
and they went up over the breadth of the land, and surrounded the camp of the holy ones, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of Heaven, and devoured them; 
and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are, and they will be tormented day and night through the ages of the ages. 
And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting on it, from whose face the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them; 
and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls—according to their works; 
and the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works; 
and death and Hades were cast into the lake of the fire—this is the second death; 
and if anyone was not found written in the Scroll of Life, he was cast into the lake of the fire. 
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more; 
and I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of Heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband; 
and I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them as their God, 
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor will there be anymore pain, because the first things passed away.” 
And He who is sitting on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new”; and He says to me, “Write, because these words are true and steadfast”; 
and He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsting, I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely. 
The one who is overcoming will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be My son. 
But to fearful, and unsteadfast, and abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all the liars, their part is in the lake that is burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.” 
And one of the seven messengers, having the seven bowls that are full of the seven last plagues, came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb,” 
and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, 
having the glory of God, and her light—like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone clear as crystal, 
also having a great and high wall, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel— 
at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates; 
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall; 
and the city lies square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed—twelve thousand stadia; the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal. 
And he measured its wall—one hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger; 
and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city is pure gold—like to pure glass. 
And the foundations of the wall of the city have been adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, 
the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 
And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each one of the gates respectively was of one pearl; and the street of the city is pure gold—as transparent glass. 
And I did not see a temple in it, for the LORD God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple. 
And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God lightens it, and the lamp of it—the Lamb; 
and the nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it, 
and its gates will never be shut by day, for night will not be there; 
and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it; 
and there may never enter into it anything defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, if not those written in the Lamb’s Scroll of Life. 
And he showed me the river of the water of life, radiant as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb 
in the midst of its street, and of the river on this side and on that—the Tree of Life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit according to each month, and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations; 
and there will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His servants will serve Him, 
and they will see His face, and His Name is on their foreheads, 
and there will be no night there, and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, because the LORD God gives them light, and they will reign through the ages of the ages. 
And he said to me, “These words are steadfast and true, and the LORD God of the holy prophets sent His messenger to show to His servants the things that must come quickly. 
Behold, I come quickly; blessed is he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll.” 
And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to worship before the feet of the messenger who is showing me these things; 
and he says to me, “Behold—No! For I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; worship God.” 
And He says to me, “You may not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near. 
The one being unrighteous—let him be unrighteous still; and the filthy—let him be filthy still; and the righteous—let him do righteousness still; and the holy—let him be holy still. 
Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to each as his work will be; 
I am the Alpha and the Omega—the Beginning and End—the First and the Last. 
Blessed are those washing their robes that the authority will be theirs to the Tree of Life, and they may enter into the city by the gates; 
and outside are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and everyone cherishing and doing falsehood. 
I, Jesus, sent My messenger to testify to you these things concerning the assemblies; I am the root and the offspring of David, the radiant morning star! 
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And he who is hearing—let him say, Come! And he who is thirsting—let him come; and he who is willing—let him take the water of life freely. 
For I testify to everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this scroll, if anyone may add to these, God will add to him the plagues that have been written in this scroll, 
and if anyone may take away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the Scroll of Life, and out of the holy city, and the things that have been written in this scroll.” 
The One testifying to these things says, “Yes, I come quickly!” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus! 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with all the holy ones. Amen.
