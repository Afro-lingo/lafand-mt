Francis had lived in Uganda, in Rwanda and later in Congo.
Kayumba after a long time in Rwanda, he continued to fight for President Paul Kagame and his government.
This was because of the Rwandan government.
Gakwerera’s findings indicate that he was a very skilled person to do the job.
Kayumba’s alliance with the Uganda People's Congress was very well known.
This is why Gakwerera believes that he was a soldier.
The meeting between Gakwerera and Kayumba was signed by Kayumba Rosette on Facebook.
He said Gakwerera was a family member and he was not willing to leave the party.
Gakwerera who was arrested for almost two days after he was arrested, failed to respond.
In Sande, two Ogwomukaaga, Kayumba’s wife Richard Bachisha was arrested.
The investigation by Kayumba’s supporters revealed that there were issues that were not resolved by Kayumba Nyamwasa and Paul Kagame before.
He was with two Rwandans, one named Saad and one named Rukara.
He had also been arrested two Kenyans, one Kenyan and one Tanzanian.
The arrest of Bachisha was a shock absorber because he had failed to return to Rwanda after he failed to return to Rwanda.
He returned from Rwanda on October fourth.
Bachisha was arrested in his home as Gakwerera.
On the other hand, Bachisha and Gakwerera clashed with Bachisha and accused Gakwerera of killing all the suspects.
He explained that after Bichisha returned to South Africa, he was arrested by a man called Ndahiro.
Ndahiro asked Kayumba to leave the Rwandan government.
Ndahiro asked Ndahiro to pay two hundred shillings because of the lack of money.
Bichisha said the following day he met with a group of former Ndahiro supporters who were given a few hundred shillings.
This was Bichisha’s first strike.
He explained that after Kayumba’s death, a few days after Kayumba’s death, the suspects will return to Kayumba’s house.
Bichisha told Gakwerera that Kayumba and his wife were in the same room.
According to Bichisha, the telephone phones are displaying their numbers.
Then he went to Lwomukaaga and told them that he was going to meet Kayumba.
He went to the polling station and one of them gave Kayumba a shock absorber.
Bichisha says that after the night, Ndahiro took a shock absorber and asked Kayumba to kill Kayumba and says that in the morning Kagame had asked him to kill Kayumba.
This was after Bichisha’s letter to South Africa’s police and took over his office.
Bichisha also received Ndahiro’s number.
Doctor Emmanuel Ndahiro.
Nolwekyo, Bichisha is expected to be a candidate.
The question is, if the suspects were aware of Kayumba’s house and they had a lot of information about it, why did they call Bichisha?
He could not be a critic of his position.
The second, Bichisha’s shock absorber was a shock absorber.
He says after Kayumba received the warning message that a woman took a shock absorber from her car when she took a shock absorber from her car when she took a shock absorber from her car.
Bichisha showed a car and a shock absorber on the side of the car.
The man took a shock absorber and took Kayumba to a shock absorber.
The woman pulled out of the car at Kayumba’s residence where they were waiting for him.
The second reason is the Kayumba’s ability to compete with a Hollywood film.
This was the Kayumba, his mother and his wife who wanted the newspaper to publish?
Then when Ndahiro wanted to kill Kayumba, he asked the Genero who was not aware of the matter and asked him to explain it?
This is when Kayumba’s lawyer says that there was a candidate who had taken Ndahiro’s name?
The problem is that there is no agreement between Bichisha and those who wanted Kayumba.
This was because he was anxious to join the petition for a suicide bomber for two years in South Africa.
Gakwerera says Bichisha’s speech was a shock absorber.
Bichisha was angry?
The security sources say that Bichisha could be a lawyer at South Africa’s police for information on the arrested suspects.
On the Kayumba’s petition, there is also a debate in the Kayumba’s petition against South Africa’s refugees.
