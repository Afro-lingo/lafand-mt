( Read Psalm 123 : 1 - 4 . )
He compared our looking to Jehovah with the way a servant looks to his master .
What did the psalmist mean by that ?
Well , not only does a servant look to his master for food and protection but the servant needs constantly to watch his master to discern his wishes and then to carry them out .
In a similar way , we daily need to search God’s Word to ascertain what Jehovah’s will is for us personally and then to follow that direction .
Only then can we be sure that Jehovah will show us favor in our time of need . ​ — Eph .
5 : 17 .
What can distract us from keeping our eyes fixed on Jehovah ?
Although we know the importance of continually looking to Jehovah , we may at times become distracted .
That is exactly what happened to Jesus ’ close friend Martha .
She became “ distracted with attending to many duties . ”
If that could happen to such a faithful person when Jesus was physically with her , we should not be surprised if the same thing could happen to us .
What , then , can distract us from keeping our eyes fixed on Jehovah ?
In this article , we will examine how the actions of others could distract us .
We will also learn how to remain focused on Jehovah .
Why might we be surprised that Moses lost the privilege of entering the Promised Land ?
Moses certainly looked to Jehovah for direction and guidance .
Indeed , “ he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible . ”
( Read Hebrews 11 : 24 - 27 . )
The Bible record tells us that “ there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses , whom Jehovah knew face - to - face . ”
But even though Moses had such a close relationship with Jehovah , he still lost the privilege of entering the Promised Land .
What caused Moses to stumble ?
5 - 7 .
What problem arose shortly after the Israelites left Egypt , and how did Moses handle the situation ?
Less than two months after the Israelites left Egypt , a serious problem arose ​ — even before they arrived at Mount Sinai .
The people started to complain about a lack of water .
They began to murmur against Moses , and the situation became so serious that Moses cried out to Jehovah : “ What should I do with this people ?
A little longer and they will stone me ! ”
Jehovah responded by giving Moses clear instructions .
He was to take his rod and strike the rock in Horeb , and then water would come gushing out .
We read : “ Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel . ”
The Israelites drank their fill , and the problem was solved . ​ — Ex .
17 : 5 , 6 .
The inspired record goes on to tell us that Moses “ named the place Massah and Meribah because of the quarreling of the Israelites and because they put Jehovah to the test by saying : ‘ Is Jehovah in our midst or not ? ’ ”
Those names were appropriate because they mean “ Testing ” and “ Quarreling . ”
How did Jehovah feel about what happened there at Meribah ?
He viewed the actions of the Israelites as a challenge to his Godship , not just a rebellion against Moses .
( Read Psalm 95 : 8 , 9 . )
The Israelites were clearly in the wrong .
On that occasion , Moses reacted correctly by looking to Jehovah and then carefully following his direction .
What problem arose toward the end of the 40 - year journey through the wilderness ?
What happened , though , when a similar event occurred some 40 years later , toward the end of the journey through the wilderness ?
The Israelites again found themselves in a location that came to be called Meribah .
But this was a different site , one near Kadesh , close to the border of the Promised Land .
* The Israelites once again complained about the lack of water .
But on this occasion , things turned out differently for Moses .
What instructions did Moses receive , but what did he do ?
( See opening picture . )
How did Moses react to this rebellion ?
Once again he turned his eyes to Jehovah for direction .
But this time Jehovah did not tell him to strike the rock .
Moses was told to take his rod , gather the people before the crag , and then speak to the crag .
Moses did not , however , speak to that rock , or crag .
Rather , he vented his frustration by shouting out to those gathered there : “ Hear , now , you rebels !
Must we bring out water for you from this crag ? ”
He then struck the crag not just once but twice . ​ — Num .
20 : 10 , 11 .
How did Jehovah react to Moses ’ actions ?
Jehovah became angry , even furious , with Moses .
Why did Jehovah react in that way ?
A number of factors may have been involved .
As mentioned above , Jehovah may have been indignant because Moses failed to follow the new directions he had received .
How might Moses ’ action of striking the rock have detracted from the miracle Jehovah performed ?
There is another possibility .
Rock formations around the location of the first Meribah are solid granite .
Regardless of how hard someone strikes granite , no one expects water to flow from it .
However , cliff formations around the second Meribah are very different , usually consisting of softer limestone .
Because of the porous nature of limestone , such areas often have underground reservoirs of water that can be tapped as a water supply .
Could it be that when Moses struck such porous rock twice , he opened himself up to the accusation that the resulting flow of water was due to natural causes rather than to Jehovah ?
By striking the rock instead of speaking to it , was Moses , as it were , taking some of the miracle out of the miracle ?
* We cannot be certain .
For what other reason might Jehovah have been angry with Moses and Aaron ?
There is another plausible explanation for Jehovah’s anger with Moses as well as Aaron .
Notice what Moses said to the people : “ Must we bring out water for you from this crag ? ”
By using the word “ we , ” Moses was likely referring to himself and Aaron .
Those words indicated a gross lack of respect for Jehovah as the true Source of that miracle .
This possibility seems to be confirmed by what we read at Psalm 106 : 32 , 33 : “ They provoked Him at the waters of Meribah , and it went badly for Moses because of them .
They embittered his spirit , and he spoke rashly with his lips . ”
* Whatever the case , Moses ’ actions detracted from the honor due Jehovah .
Speaking to Moses and Aaron , Jehovah said : “ You both rebelled against my order . ”
A serious sin indeed !
Why was the judgment Jehovah made concerning Moses both appropriate and consistent ?
As leaders among Jehovah’s people , Moses and Aaron had a greater measure of accountability .
Previously , Jehovah had denied a whole generation of Israelites entrance into the land of Canaan because of their rebelliousness .
So it was both appropriate and consistent for Jehovah to make the same judgment with regard to Moses because of his rebellious act .
Just like the other rebels , he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land .
14 , 15 .
What caused Moses to rebel ?
What led Moses to adopt such a rebellious attitude ?
Notice Psalm 106 : 32 , 33 once again : “ They provoked Him at the waters of Meribah , and it went badly for Moses because of them .
They embittered his spirit , and he spoke rashly with his lips . ”
Although the Israelites provoked Jehovah , it was Moses who became embittered .
His lack of self - control led him to speak without considering the consequences .
Moses allowed the actions of others to distract him from keeping his eyes fixed on Jehovah .
Moses handled the first incident correctly .
Yet , it is possible that after dealing for decades with the rebellious Israelites , he had become tired and frustrated .
Was Moses thinking mainly of his own feelings instead of how he could glorify Jehovah ?
Why should we be concerned about Moses ’ actions ?
If such a faithful prophet as Moses could be distracted and stumbled , the same thing could easily happen to us .
Like Moses , we are about to enter a symbolic land , the new world that Jehovah has promised us .
None of us want to miss out on that special privilege .
To fulfill our goal , though , we need to keep our eyes fixed on Jehovah , always seeking to do his will .
What lessons should we learn from Moses ’ mistake ?
What will help us not to give in to frustration ?
Do not give in to frustration .
Even when we find ourselves dealing with the same problems over and over again , “ let us not give up in doing what is fine , for in due time we will reap if we do not tire out . ”
When faced with frustrating situations or recurring personality conflicts , do we control our lips and our temper ?
When provoked by others , we need to learn to “ yield place to the wrath . ”
Whose wrath ?
Jehovah’s wrath .
( Read Romans 12 : 17 - 21 . )
If we keep looking to Jehovah , we will show him due respect by yielding to his wrath , patiently waiting for him to take action when he deems it necessary .
To do otherwise and avenge ourselves in some way would be tantamount to disrespecting Jehovah .
What do we need to remember when it comes to following directions ?
Carefully follow the latest directions .
Do we faithfully follow the latest directions that Jehovah has given us ?
If so , we will not rely on always doing things the way we have done them in the past .
Rather , we will be quick to follow any new direction that Jehovah provides through his organization .
At the same time , we will be careful that we “ do not go beyond the things that are written . ”
In so doing , we keep our eyes fixed on Jehovah .
What lesson should we learn from Moses ’ reaction to the mistakes of others ?
( See paragraph 19 )
How can we avoid damaging our relationship with Jehovah even though we may be dealing with the mistakes of others ?
Do not allow the mistakes of others to damage your relationship with Jehovah .
If we keep our figurative eyes focused on Jehovah , we will not allow the actions of others to embitter us or damage our relationship with him .
This is especially important if , like Moses , we have a measure of responsibility in God’s organization .
While it is true that each of us needs to ‘ keep working out his own salvation with fear and trembling , ’ we must remember that Jehovah does not have one rigid , inflexible standard by which he judges us .
Rather , the more responsibility we have , the greater our accountability .
But if we truly love Jehovah , nothing will stumble us or separate us from his love . ​ — Ps .
119 : 165 ; Rom . 8 : 37 - 39 .
What should be our determination ?
In these challenging times , may our eyes be raised continually to the One who is “ enthroned in the heavens , ” so that we can perceive his will .
May we never allow our relationship with Jehovah to be negatively affected by the actions of others .
The example of what happened to Moses reinforces the importance of this in our mind and heart .
Rather than overreacting to the imperfections of those around us , let it be our determination that “ our eyes look to Jehovah our God until he shows us favor . ” ​ — Ps .
123 : 1 , 2 .
This was a different location from the Meribah that was near Rephidim .
Unlike the first location , this second site was associated with Kadesh , not Massah .
However , both locations were named Meribah because of the quarreling that occurred there . ​ — See the map in Appendix B3 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures .
Professor John A .
Beck says of this account : “ According to one Jewish tradition , the rebels criticize Moses with these words : ‘ Moses knows the properties of this particular rock !
If he wishes to prove his miraculous powers , let him bring out water for us from this other one . ’ ”
This is , of course , only a tradition .
See The Watchtower , October 15 , 1987 , “ Questions From Readers . ”
Yes , if there are no extenuating circumstances , a judicial committee would be formed on the basis of strong circumstantial evidence of sexual immorality . ​ — 1 Cor .
6 : 18 .
The body of elders carefully evaluates each situation to determine whether a judicial committee is warranted .
For example : Have the couple been pursuing a romantic relationship ?
Have they been previously counseled regarding their conduct with each other ?
What circumstances led to their spending the night together ?
Did they plan ahead to do so ?
Did they have a choice in the matter , or were there extenuating circumstances , perhaps an unforeseen occurrence or genuine emergency that left them with no choice but to spend the night together ?
What were the sleeping arrangements ?
Since each situation is different , there may be other relevant factors that the elders will consider .
After the facts are established , the body of elders will determine whether the couple’s conduct warrants judicial action .

While professing to worship Jehovah , how did Cain and Solomon lose Jehovah’s favor ?
How did Moses and Aaron seize opportunities to show that they were on Jehovah’s side ?
How can we fully benefit from Jehovah’s mercy and forgiveness ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) Why is it wise to be on Jehovah’s side ?
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
IT MAKES sense to cling to Jehovah .
No one is more powerful , wise , or loving than our God !
Who of us would not want to be on his side ?
Still , some of God’s worshippers have wavered when a situation called for them to take sides with Jehovah .
In this article , we will consider examples of individuals who claimed to be on Jehovah’s side while at the same time following a course that offended him .
These accounts contain vital lessons that can help us remain fully loyal to Jehovah .
Why did Jehovah reach out to Cain , and what did He tell him ? Consider the case of Cain .
He did not profess to worship any other god but Jehovah .
Cain’s worship , however , was not acceptable to God .
There were seeds of wickedness growing deep within his heart .
Jehovah reached out to Cain and told him : “ If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
Jehovah was , in effect , telling Cain , “ If you repent and take a firm stand on my side , I will , in turn , be on your side . ”
Given the opportunity to be on Jehovah’s side , what did Cain do ?
If only Cain would correct his thinking , Jehovah would restore him to favor .
But Cain did not listen to the counsel .
Wrong thinking and selfish desire led him to wrong actions .
In his youth , Cain may never have imagined that he would take a stand against Jehovah .
In time , however , he did the unimaginable ​ — he rebelled against God and killed his own brother !
What kind of thinking could cause us to lose Jehovah’s favor ?
Like Cain , a Christian today could be following the wrong path even while professing to worship Jehovah .
For instance , one could nurture immoral fantasies , greedy thoughts , or hateful feelings toward a fellow Christian .
This thinking can lead to sinful actions .
All the while , one could be active in the ministry and regular at congregation meetings .
Other humans may not be aware of our thoughts and conduct , but Jehovah sees all things and knows if we are not wholeheartedly on his side . ​ — Read Jeremiah 17 : 9 , 10 .
How does Jehovah help us to “ get the mastery over ” sinful inclinations when we take a firm stand on his side ?
Even so , Jehovah is not quick to give up on us .
When a person’s steps lead him away from God , Jehovah urges him : “ Return to me , and I will return to you . ”
Especially when we struggle with weaknesses , Jehovah wants us to take a stand against badness .
If we do , he will in turn prove to be on our side by giving us the spiritual , emotional , and physical strength needed to “ get the mastery over ” our sinful inclinations . ​ — Gen .
4 : 7 .
How did Solomon lose his good standing with Jehovah ?
We can learn much from the example of King Solomon .
During his younger years , Solomon looked to Jehovah for guidance .
God gave him great wisdom and entrusted him with the building of a magnificent temple in Jerusalem .
But Solomon lost his friendship with Jehovah .
God’s Law specifically prohibited a Hebrew king from taking “ many wives for himself , so that his heart [ might ] not go astray . ”
Solomon disobeyed , eventually marrying 700 women . He brought into his household an additional 300 concubines .
Many of his wives were non - Israelites , who worshipped false gods .
Hence , Solomon also disobeyed God’s law against marrying foreign women . ​ — Deut .
7 : 3 , 4 .
To what extreme did Solomon offend Jehovah ?
Solomon’s gradual departure from Jehovah’s requirements led him in time to extreme wrongdoing .
Solomon built an altar to the idol goddess Ashtoreth and at least one other altar to the false god Chemosh .
There he joined his wives in pagan worship .
He built those altars on , of all places , a mountain located directly in front of Jerusalem , where he had built Jehovah’s temple !
Perhaps Solomon fooled himself into thinking that Jehovah would overlook his disobedience as long as he also continued to offer sacrifices at the temple .
What resulted from Solomon’s disregard for God’s warnings ?
But Jehovah never overlooks wrongdoing .
The Bible reports : “ Jehovah became furious at Solomon , because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah . . . , who had appeared to him twice and had warned him about this very thing , that he should not go after other gods .
But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded . ”
As a result , God withdrew his approval and support .
Solomon’s heirs lost the unified kingdom of Israel and suffered many calamities for generations to come . ​ — 1 Ki . 11 : 9 - 13 .
What can threaten our good standing with Jehovah ?
As in Solomon’s case , one of the greatest threats to spirituality is friendship with those who do not understand or respect Jehovah’s standards .
Some may be associated with the congregation but may be spiritually weak .
Others could be relatives , neighbors , coworkers , or schoolmates who are not worshippers of Jehovah .
In any case , if our close associates do not show a high regard for Jehovah’s standards , they can in time destroy our good standing with God .
What effect are your associates having on your relationship with Jehovah ?
( See paragraph 11 )
What can help us to determine whether an associate should be avoided ?
Read 1 Corinthians 15 : 33 .
Most people have some good qualities , and many outside the congregation do not engage in blatant misconduct .
If that is true of your acquaintances , can you assume that they are good associations ?
Ask yourself what effect their companionship will have on your relationship with Jehovah .
Will they improve it ?
What is in their heart ?
For example , are their conversations almost exclusively about fashion , money , gadgets , entertainment , or other material pursuits ?
Does their speech often include disparaging comments about others or obscene jesting ?
Jesus aptly warned : “ Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks . ”
If you realize that your associates pose a threat to your good standing with Jehovah , act decisively by limiting and if necessary ending such friendships . ​ — Prov . 13 : 20 .
( a ) What did Jehovah make clear to the Israelites shortly after they left Egypt ?
( b ) How did the Israelites respond to God’s requirement for exclusive devotion ?
Additional lessons can be learned from what took place shortly after the Israelites were freed from Egypt .
The people gathered in front of Mount Sinai .
There Jehovah made his presence strikingly real .
A miraculous dark cloud formed . Jehovah produced thunder , lightning , smoke , and what seemed to be the loud and constant sound of a horn .
In this setting , Jehovah revealed himself to the Israelites as “ a God who requires exclusive devotion . ”
He assured them that he would be loyal to those who love him and keep his commandments .
( Read Exodus 20 : 1 - 6 . )
In effect , Jehovah was telling his people , “ If you prove to be on my side , I will prove to be on your side . ”
How would you respond to such a promise of loyalty from Jehovah God ?
You would surely do as the Israelites did .
They “ answered with one voice : ‘ All the words that Jehovah has spoken , we are willing to do . ’ ”
Soon , however , something unexpected put the Israelites ’ loyalty to the test .
What circumstances put the loyalty of the Israelites to the test ?
The Israelites had been frightened by the dark cloud , the lightning , and the other awe - inspiring signs from God .
At their request , Moses agreed to be their spokesperson for all communication with Jehovah on Mount Sinai .
Moses was on the mountaintop for a long time .
Were the Israelites now stranded in the wilderness without their trustworthy leader ?
Apparently , the people’s faith was too dependent on Moses ’ visible presence .
They became anxious and told Aaron : “ Make for us a god who will go ahead of us , because we do not know what has happened to this Moses , the man who led us up out of the land of Egypt . ” ​ — Ex .
32 : 1 , 2 .
What did the Israelites fool themselves into thinking , and what was Jehovah’s reaction ?
The people knew that idolatry was a serious offense against Jehovah .
But soon they were worshipping a golden calf !
Despite this obvious act of disobedience , the Israelites somehow fooled themselves into thinking that they were still on Jehovah’s side .
Why , Aaron even called their calf worship “ a festival to Jehovah ” !
How did Jehovah react ?
He felt betrayed . Jehovah told Moses that the people had “ corrupted themselves ” and had “ deviated from the way [ He ] commanded them to go . ”
In his “ burning anger , ” Jehovah even considered wiping out the newly formed nation of Israel . ​ — Ex .
32 : 5 - 10 .
15 , 16 .
How did Moses and Aaron show that they were firmly on Jehovah’s side ?
( See opening picture . )
Jehovah decided not to eliminate the Israelites .
His mercy gave loyal worshippers an opportunity to take a firm stand on his side .
After witnessing the unrestrained behavior of the people ​ — shouting , singing , and dancing before an idol — ​ Moses crushed the golden calf into powder .
He then proclaimed : “ Who is on Jehovah’s side ?
Come to me ! ”
In response , “ all the Levites gathered around ” Moses . ​ — Ex .
32 : 17 - 20 , 26 .
Although initially involved in setting up the idol , Aaron repented and joined the rest of the Levites on Jehovah’s side .
These loyal ones were not just taking sides with Jehovah but were at the same time separating themselves from the wrongdoers .
That was a wise move ; that day thousands lost their lives because of their idolatry .
However , those who were on Jehovah’s side were promised a blessing . ​ — Ex .
32 : 27 - 29 .
What do Paul’s words about the golden calf episode teach us ?
The apostle Paul drew attention to the golden calf episode and warned : “ These things became examples for us , in order for us not to . . . become idolaters , as some of them did .
[ The examples ] were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have come .
So let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall . ”
As Paul pointed out , even true worshippers could become involved in wrong practices .
Those who give in to temptation may think that they still have a good standing with Jehovah .
But merely wanting to be Jehovah’s friend or claiming to be loyal to him does not always mean that one is actually approved by Jehovah . ​ — 1 Cor .
10 : 1 - 5 .
What could cause us to drift away from Jehovah , and with what consequences ?
Just as the Israelites became anxious over Moses ’ delay in coming down from Sinai , Christians today may feel anxious over the seeming delay of Jehovah’s day of judgment and the coming of the new world .
The fulfillment of these promises may seem too far off in the future or too good to be true .
Left unchecked , such thinking can lead us to put fleshly pursuits ahead of Jehovah’s will .
In time , we could drift away from Jehovah and eventually engage in practices that we would never have considered being involved in when we were in good spiritual health .
What fundamental truth should we never forget , and why ?
Never should we forget that Jehovah requires wholehearted obedience and exclusive devotion .
Any wandering away from Jehovah’s worship really means doing Satan’s will , and that could lead only to disaster .
Hence , Paul reminds us : “ You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons ; you cannot be partaking of ‘ the table of Jehovah ’ and the table of demons . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
10 : 21 .
Even after we take a false step , how can Jehovah help us ?
The Bible accounts about Cain , Solomon , and the Israelites at Mount Sinai have a noteworthy element in common .
These individuals had opportunity to “ repent . . . and turn around . ”
Clearly , Jehovah is not quick to give up on those who take a false step .
In Aaron’s case , Jehovah extended forgiveness .
Today , warnings from Jehovah may come in the form of a Bible account , Bible - based publications , or kind advice from a fellow Christian .
When we heed the warnings , we are assured of Jehovah’s mercy .
What should we be determined to do when our loyalty to Jehovah is put to the test ?
Jehovah’s undeserved kindness has a purpose .
It gives us an opportunity “ to reject ungodliness and worldly desires . ”
( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
As long as we live “ amid this present system of things , ” we will face situations that will put our exclusive devotion to Jehovah to the test .
May we always be ready to take a firm stand on his side , for it is ‘ Jehovah our God we should fear , him we should serve , and to him we should cling ’ ! ​ — Deut .
10 : 20 .
“ Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah , the people he has chosen as his own possession . ” ​ — PS .
33 : 12 .
SONGS : 40 , 50
What are some of the things we accomplish through dedication and baptism ?
Why should it be obvious to others that we are exclusively devoted to Jehovah ?
Why is it important to be hospitable , generous , forgiving , and kind to fellow worshippers ?
Why can Jehovah rightfully claim ownership of everything ?
( See opening picture . )
EVERYTHING belongs to Jehovah !
He owns “ the heavens , even the heavens of the heavens , and the earth with all that is in it . ”
Hence , by reason of their very existence , all humans belong to Jehovah .
Yet , throughout human history , God has designated specific groups of people as belonging to him in a special way .
Who have been identified in the Bible as belonging to Jehovah in a special way ?
For example , Psalm 135 refers to faithful worshippers of Jehovah in ancient Israel as “ his special property . ”
Also , the book of Hosea foretold that some non - Israelites would become Jehovah’s people .
Hosea’s prophecy was fulfilled when Jehovah included non - Jews in his selection of prospective corulers with Christ .
This “ holy nation ” is Jehovah’s “ special possession ” in an outstanding way , its members having been anointed with holy spirit and chosen for life in heaven .
What about the majority of faithful Christians today who have an earthly hope ?
Jehovah also calls them his “ people ” and his “ chosen ones . ” ​ — Isa .
65 : 22 .
( a ) Who enjoy a favored relationship with Jehovah today ?
( b ) What will be considered in this article ?
Today , the “ little flock , ” with a heavenly hope , and the “ other sheep , ” with an earthly hope , compose the “ one flock ” that Jehovah highly regards as his people .
We surely want to show deep appreciation to Jehovah for granting us such a favored relationship with him .
This article will consider various ways in which we can show our gratitude to Jehovah for giving us that special honor .
What is one way we can thank Jehovah for making it possible for us to have a relationship with him , and how did Jesus do something similar ?
We show appreciation to Jehovah by wholeheartedly dedicating ourselves to him .
By water baptism , we formally and publicly acknowledge Jehovah’s ownership of us and our willingness to subject ourselves to him .
Jesus did something similar when at his baptism he , in effect , said to Jehovah : “ To do your will , O my God , is my desire . ”
Jesus presented himself to do Jehovah’s will , even though since birth he had been part of a nation dedicated to God .
5 , 6 . ( a ) How did Jehovah respond when Jesus was baptized ?
( b ) Illustrate why Jehovah appreciates our dedication , even though everything belongs to him .
How did Jehovah respond to Jesus ’ baptism ?
The Bible account says : “ After being baptized , Jesus immediately came up from the water ; and look !
the heavens were opened up , and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him .
Look !
Also , a voice from the heavens said : ‘ This is my Son , the beloved , whom I have approved . ’ ”
Although Jesus already belonged to his heavenly Father , Jehovah was delighted to see his Son’s willingness to do His will exclusively .
Jehovah is likewise pleased to accept our dedication , and he will honor us with his blessing . ​ — Ps .
149 : 4 .
To illustrate , imagine that a man has planted many beautiful flowers in his garden .
One day his little girl picks one of those flowers and offers it to him as a gift .
Did not the flower already belong to the man ? How could she give him something that he already owned ?
A loving father would not even think of such questions .
Rather , he would be delighted to accept the gift as a token of his daughter’s love for him .
He would surely treasure that single flower from his daughter above all the other flowers in his garden .
Jehovah is no less delighted when we willingly devote ourselves to him exclusively . ​ — Ex .
34 : 14 .
How did Malachi highlight Jehovah’s feelings toward those who willingly serve him ?
Read Malachi 3 : 16 .
If you are not yet dedicated and baptized , consider the significance of taking such a step .
Granted , from the moment you came into existence , you belonged to Jehovah , along with the rest of mankind .
Yet , think how greatly it would please Jehovah if in recognition of his sovereignty , you were to dedicate yourself to him and do his will .
Jehovah , in turn , recognizes those who willingly serve him , and he writes their names in his “ book of remembrance . ”
8 , 9 .
What does Jehovah require from those whose names are inscribed in his “ book of remembrance ” ?
Having our name inscribed in Jehovah’s “ book of remembrance ” as his people comes with certain obligations .
Malachi specifically stated that we must ‘ fear Jehovah and meditate on his name . ’
Giving our worshipful devotion to anyone or anything else would result in our name being removed from Jehovah’s figurative book of life . ​ — Ex .
32 : 33 ; Ps .
69 : 28 .
Hence , our dedication to Jehovah involves much more than a solemn promise to do his will and to submit to water baptism .
These actions are brief , and they quickly become part of the past .
Our stand on Jehovah’s side as his people requires an ongoing demonstration of our obedience to him both in the present and in the future ​ — for as long as we live . ​ — 1 Pet .
4 : 1 , 2 .
What clear distinction must exist between those who serve Jehovah and those who do not ?
The preceding article considered the Bible accounts of Cain , Solomon , and the Israelites .
All of them professed to worship Jehovah , but their devotion to him was far from exclusive .
These examples clearly establish that those who truly belong to Jehovah must firmly take their stand for righteousness and against wickedness .
Appropriately , after Malachi mentioned the “ book of remembrance , ” Jehovah spoke of “ the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person , between one serving God and one not serving him . ” ​ — Mal .
3 : 18 .
Why should it be obvious to others that we are devoted to Jehovah exclusively ?
Here , then , is another way we can show appreciation to Jehovah for choosing us as his people . Our spiritual progress must be “ plainly seen by all . ”
Ask yourself : ‘ Is my complete allegiance to Jehovah evident to others ?
Do I look for opportunities to identify myself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses ? ’
Jehovah would be deeply saddened if after he has selected us as his people , we were to hesitate to let others know that we belong to him . ​ — Ps . 119 : 46 ; read Mark 8 : 38 .
Does your lifestyle clearly identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
( See paragraphs 12 , 13 )
12 , 13 .
How have some obscured their identity as Jehovah’s Witnesses ?
Sad to say , some individuals have blurred ‘ the distinction between their serving God and their not serving him ’ by imitating “ the spirit of the world . ”
That is a spirit that caters to ‘ the desires of one’s flesh . ’
For example , despite all the counsel that has been given on the subject , some still prefer styles of dress and grooming that are immodest .
They wear tight - fitting and revealing clothing , even to Christian gatherings .
Or they have adopted extreme haircuts and hairdos .
As a result , when they are in a crowd , it may be difficult to tell who belongs to Jehovah and who is “ a friend of the world . ” ​ — Jas .
4 : 4 .
In other ways , some Witnesses have not firmly rejected worldly conduct .
Their dancing and actions at parties go beyond what is acceptable for Christians .
They post on social media photos of themselves and comments that are unbecoming to spiritual people .
They may not have been disciplined in the Christian congregation for a serious sin , but they can be a negative influence on their peers who are striving to maintain fine conduct among Jehovah’s people . ​ — Read 1 Peter 2 : 11 , 12 .
Do not let yourself be affected by those who are not taking a firm stand on Jehovah’s side
What course of action is vital if we are to protect our special friendship with Jehovah ?
The world aggressively promotes “ the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life . ”
Yet , because we belong to Jehovah , we are admonished to “ reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things . ”
Our speech , our eating and drinking habits , our dress and grooming , our work ethic ​ — everything we do — ​ should tell onlookers that we are exclusively devoted to Jehovah . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 31 , 32 .
Why should we treat fellow worshippers with kindness and love ?
Our appreciation for Jehovah’s special friendship is shown in how we treat fellow worshippers . They too belong to Jehovah .
If we never lose sight of that fact , we will always treat our brothers and sisters with kindness and love .
Jesus said to his followers : “ By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 35 .
What example from the Mosaic Law illustrates Jehovah’s feelings toward his people ?
To illustrate how we should treat one another in the congregation , consider the following .
The utensils in Jehovah’s temple were dedicated , or set aside , exclusively for pure worship .
The Mosaic Law outlined in detail how to care for these utensils , and violators were subject to death .
If Jehovah so jealously protected lifeless implements used in his worship , how much more would he protect his dedicated loyal worshippers whom he has chosen as his people !
Speaking to his people , Jehovah once declared : “ Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye . ” ​ — Zech .
2 : 8 .
Jehovah is “ paying attention and listening ” to what ?
Interestingly , Malachi depicted Jehovah as “ paying attention and listening ” as His people interact with one another .
Jehovah indeed “ knows those who belong to him . ”
He is keenly aware of every single thing we do and say .
When we are less than kind to our fellow worshippers , Jehovah is “ paying attention and listening . ”
When we are hospitable , generous , forgiving , and kind to one another , we can be sure that Jehovah takes notice of that as well . ​ — Heb .
13 : 16 ; 1 Pet .
4 : 8 , 9 .
How can we show appreciation for the honor of being Jehovah’s people ?
Surely we are eager to show our appreciation to Jehovah for the honor of being his people .
We see the wisdom in acknowledging his ownership of us by voluntarily dedicating ourselves to him .
Even while living “ in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation , ” we want people to see that we are “ blameless and innocent , . . . shining as illuminators in the world . ”
We take a firm stand against badness .
And we love and respect our fellow worshippers , recognizing that they too belong to Jehovah . ​ — Rom . 12 : 10 .
How does Jehovah reward those who belong to him ?
The Bible promises : “ Jehovah will not forsake his people . ”
This ironclad guarantee is binding despite any calamity that might befall us .
Even death cannot stand in the way of Jehovah’s love for us .
“ If we live , we live to Jehovah , and if we die , we die to Jehovah .
So both if we live and if we die , we belong to Jehovah . ”
We eagerly look forward to the day when Jehovah will bring to life all his loyal friends who have died .
Even now we enjoy many blessings .
As the Bible says , “ happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah , the people he has chosen as his own possession . ” ​ — Ps .
33 : 12 .
WHEN Jesus taught his disciples how to preach the good news , he acknowledged that the Kingdom message would not always be welcomed .
In our ministry , we may encounter some who respond harshly or even act abusively .
Admittedly , such responses can make it difficult for us to maintain compassion for those to whom we preach .
A compassionate person sees the needs and problems of others , feels sympathy for them , and wants to help .
However , if we begin to lose our compassion for those whom we meet in the ministry , we may also begin to lose our zeal and effectiveness .
On the other hand , when we cultivate compassion , it is as if we were adding more oxygen to a fire ​ — we keep our zeal for the ministry burning brightly ! ​ — 1 Thess .
5 : 19 .
How can we cultivate compassion even when it is challenging to do so ?
Let us consider three examples worthy of imitation ​ — the examples of Jehovah , Jesus , and the apostle Paul .
For thousands of years , Jehovah has endured the reproach that has been brought on his name .
Yet , he remains “ kind toward the unthankful and wicked . ”
His kindness is demonstrated by his patience .
Jehovah desires that “ all sorts of people ” be saved .
Although God hates wickedness , he views humans as precious and does not want any to lose their lives . ​ — 2 Pet .
3 : 9 .
Jehovah understands how effectively Satan has blinded unbelieving humans .
Many have been taught wrong beliefs and attitudes since childhood , making it a challenge for them to accept the truth .
Jehovah is eager to help such ones .
How do we know ?
Consider Jehovah’s view of the ancient Ninevites .
Despite their violent ways , Jehovah said to Jonah : “ Should I not also feel sorry for Nineveh the great city , in which there are more than 120,000 men who do not even know right from wrong ? ”
Jehovah viewed the Ninevites as spiritually disadvantaged , and he mercifully commissioned Jonah to warn them .
Like Jehovah , we view people as precious .
We can imitate him by eagerly trying to help any who might listen , even if they seem unlikely to respond .
Like his Father , Jesus was moved with pity for people who were in spiritual need .
“ On seeing the crowds , he felt pity for them , because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd . ”
Jesus saw beneath the surface ; he recognized that those who came to hear him speak had been taught falsehoods and had been mistreated by their religious leaders .
Although he knew that many would allow various obstacles to hinder them from responding favorably , Jesus still proceeded “ to teach them many things . ” ​ — Mark 4 : 1 - 9 .
Do not be frustrated if a person does not initially show interest
Circumstances in life change , as may a person’s attitude toward the truth
When people react unfavorably to our message , we need to see beneath the surface and ask ourselves why they respond as they do .
Some may have a negative attitude about the Bible or about Christianity because of the bad examples of those who claim to be Christians .
Perhaps others have been told lies about our beliefs .
Still others may face the scorn of members of the community or of family members if they receive us favorably .
Some we meet in the ministry may react unfavorably because of traumatic experiences that have left them emotionally damaged .
A missionary named Kim says : “ In a certain part of our territory , many people are victims of a war in which they lost all their possessions .
They have no real hope for the future . They are frustrated and very distrustful .
In this area , we regularly encounter those opposed to our message .
On one occasion , I was assaulted while preaching . ”
How does Kim maintain her compassion despite such treatment ?
She says : “ When treated abusively , I try to keep in mind Proverbs 19 : 11 , which says : ‘ The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger . ’
Remembering the background of those in our territory helps me to cultivate compassion for them .
And not everyone we meet is hostile .
In that same area , we have some nice return visits . ”
We might ask ourselves , ‘ How would I respond to the Kingdom message if I were in the position of those to whom we preach ? ’
For example , what if we had repeatedly been told lies about Jehovah’s Witnesses ? In such circumstances , perhaps we too would respond negatively and be in need of compassion .
When we recall Jesus ’ command to treat others as we wish to be treated , we are motivated to respond empathetically even when it is difficult to do so . ​ — Matt .
7 : 12 .
The apostle Paul showed compassion even for violent opposers .
Why ?
He did not forget his own past .
He said : “ Formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man .
Nevertheless , I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and with a lack of faith . ”
He recognized that Jehovah and Jesus had shown him great mercy .
Likely , he could see his former self in some of those to whom he preached .
At times , Paul encountered strongly entrenched false beliefs . How did he react ?
Acts 17 : 16 reports that while Paul was in Athens , “ his spirit within him became irritated on seeing that the city was full of idols . ”
Nevertheless , Paul used the very source of his irritation to give a fine witness .
He adapted his preaching methods to the backgrounds of various types of people so that he “ might by all possible means save some . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
9 : 20 - 23 .
We can imitate Paul by acknowledging negative attitudes or wrong beliefs that we encounter and then by skillfully introducing “ good news of something better . ”
A sister named Dorothy says : “ In our territory , many have been taught that God is harsh and judgmental .
I commend such people for their strong belief in God and then draw their attention to what the Bible says about Jehovah’s loving personality and his promises for the future . ”
As we move deeper into “ the last days , ” we can expect that the attitudes of some to whom we preach “ will advance from bad to worse . ”
But we must not let this downward trend erode our compassion or cause us to lose our joy .
Jehovah can give us the strength to “ keep conquering the evil with the good . ”
A pioneer named Jessica relates : “ I often encounter people who lack humility and who belittle us and our message .
This can be annoying .
When I begin a conversation , I pray silently to Jehovah and ask for his help to see the person as he does .
This takes my focus off of my feelings and instead makes me think about how to help the person . ”
We keep looking for those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life
Some respond to our patient efforts to help them spiritually
We should also consider how to encourage our fellow workers .
Jessica says : “ If one of us has a bad experience , I try not to dwell on it .
Rather , I shift the conversation to positive topics , such as the good that our ministry accomplishes despite the negative responses of some . ”
Jehovah is well - aware of the challenges we encounter in the ministry .
How he must rejoice when we imitate his mercy !
Of course , Jehovah will not extend his compassion indefinitely .
We can be confident that he knows exactly the right time to end this system of things .
Until then , our preaching is urgent .
Let us continue to carry out our assignment with zeal and tender compassion for “ all sorts of people . ”
JOSHUA faces a daunting challenge .
He has to lead the nation of Israel into the Promised Land in the face of formidable obstacles .
Jehovah assures him of success , though , and encourages him : ‘ Be courageous and strong .
Observe my Law .
Read it day and night , in order to observe carefully all that is written in it .
Then you will be successful and you will act wisely . ’ ​ — Josh .
1 : 7 , 8 .
In these “ critical times hard to deal with , ” we too face formidable challenges .
Like Joshua , we can succeed by following the advice Jehovah gave him .
We can read the Bible regularly and carefully apply its principles to the tests we face .
However , many of us would admit that we are not the best students and that studying is not easy for us .
Yet , since studying the Bible is so important , review the box “ Try These Suggestions ” for some good tips that can make your study more effective and enjoyable .
“ Guide me in the pathway of your commandments , ” sang the psalmist , “ for in it I take delight . ”
You can derive great pleasure from considering God’s Word .
Rewarding gems are awaiting discovery as you dig for spiritual treasures .
Although you do not have to lead a nation as Joshua did , you have your own challenges to face .
So , like Joshua , study and observe what has been written for your benefit .
When you do , you too will be successful and act wisely .
Pray before you study .
The Bible contains the thoughts of the almighty God that he had recorded for your benefit .
So when you read the Bible , seek his help to understand it , retain it , and apply it in your life . ​ — Ezra 7 : 10 .
Ask yourself questions as you read the Bible or Bible - based literature : ‘ What does this passage tell me about Jehovah ?
How does it contribute to the overall message of his Word ?
How can I use these thoughts to help others ? ’
Meditate on what you study .
Stop reading and think : ‘ How does this material make me feel ?
Why does it make me feel that way ?
How does it relate to my past experiences , to my current situation , or to possible future events ?
How can I apply these Bible principles and this counsel in my life ? ’
See if you can explain why Jehovah urges his people to avoid certain practices or what the consequences of a different course of action would likely be . ​ — Deut .
32 : 28 , 29 .
Use your imagination when reading descriptive passages .
Can you , for example , picture the scene as Joseph’s brothers sell him to the Ishmaelites ?
What do you see , hear , and smell ? Put yourself in the place of the characters .
What are they thinking and feeling ?
Such thoughts will make your study more vivid and meaningful .
Use the study tools that have been provided to enrich your research .
Get familiar with the tools available in your language , both online and in print .
Do not hesitate to ask others to help you learn how to use them effectively .
The Watch Tower Publications Index or the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses , for example , will help you to locate what has been written on many topics and to find explanations of many Bible verses .
Use the appendixes of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures if available in a language you know . These provide useful information on geography , chronology , weights and measures , and so on .
Summarize key points in the material to help you remember what you have just studied .
Better still , share it with others .
Is there something you can use in your ministry ?
In these ways , you not only fix the main points in your mind but also use what you have studied to benefit others .

18 Generous Givers Are Happy People
23 Work With Jehovah Each Day
Jehovah made humans to live well and be happy .
If you can see how your daily activities contribute to the advancement of Jehovah’s purposes , you will be happy .
These study articles consider the benefits of being generous in various ways .
28 Patience ​ — Endurance With a Purpose
31 From Our Archives
“ There is . . . happiness in giving . ” ​ — ACTS 20 : 35 .
SONGS : 76 , 110
Why can we say that humans were made to be generous ?
What is the connection between generosity and happiness in the preaching work ?
What Scriptural reasons do we have for being generous ?
How does creation give evidence of Jehovah’s generosity ?
EVEN though Jehovah was completely alone before he began to create , he was not thinking only of himself .
On the contrary , he gave the gift of life to intelligent creatures , both spirit and human .
“ The happy God , ” Jehovah , loves to give good things .
And since he also wants us to be happy , he teaches us to be generous . ​ — Rom . 1 : 20 .
2 , 3 . ( a ) Why does giving make us happy ?
( b ) What will we consider ?
God made man in his image .
That is , we were created to reflect his personality .
In order to attain happiness and fulfillment , then , we need to follow Jehovah’s example by being interested in others and by being generous givers .
Why ?
Quite simply because Jehovah lovingly designed humans that way .
Despite our imperfection , we can succeed in imitating Jehovah’s generosity .
The Bible tells us how we can be generous givers .
Let us review some of the lessons that the Scriptures teach on this topic .
We will see how being generous leads to God’s favor and how cultivating this quality helps us to fulfill the role God has given us .
We will also examine how our generosity is connected with our happiness and why we need to keep on cultivating this quality .
4 , 5 .
What examples of generosity have Jehovah and Jesus set for us ?
Jehovah wants his human creation to imitate him , so it makes him happy when we are generous .
It is very clear from the way that we are made and from the beauty and riches of our natural environment that God wants humans to be happy .
Hence , we honor him when we strive to make others happy .
True Christians imitate the Christ , who provided us with the perfect example of how a human can be generous .
Jesus himself stated : “ The Son of man came , not to be ministered to , but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many . ”
Hence , the apostle Paul urged Christians : “ Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus . . .
He emptied himself and took a slave’s form . ”
Each of us would do well to ask , ‘ Can I follow Jesus ’ example even more closely than I am already doing ? ’ ​ — Read 1 Peter 2 : 21 .
What lesson did Jesus teach us in the parable of the neighborly Samaritan ?
( See opening picture . )
We can enjoy Jehovah’s favor by imitating his and Christ’s perfect examples , by being interested in the welfare of others , and by looking for ways to care for their needs .
Indeed , in the parable of the neighborly Samaritan , Jesus made clear that he expected his followers to go out of their way to help others , even those of a different background .
( Read Luke 10 : 29 - 37 . )
Do you recall the question that moved Jesus to recount the parable of the neighborly Samaritan ? A Jew asked him : “ Who really is my neighbor ? ” Jesus ’ answer shows that like the Samaritan we must be willing to give generously if we are to enjoy God’s favor .
How is our being selfish or unselfish connected with the universal issue ?
Christians have many good reasons to practice generosity .
For example , this quality is related to the issue Satan raised in the garden of Eden .
How so ?
Satan asserted that Adam and Eve ​ — and by extension all humanity — ​ would be better off focusing on themselves and putting the pursuit of their own interests ahead of obedience to God .
Eve acted out of a selfish desire to be like God .
Adam manifested a selfish desire to please Eve .
The results of their decisions are plain to see .
Selfishness does not lead to happiness ; quite the opposite .
By being generous , we demonstrate our conviction that God’s way of doing things is the best .
Why should the first human couple have been interested in giving ?
God gave the first human couple instructions that should have made them think about the welfare of others , even though they were alone in the garden of Eden .
Jehovah blessed Adam and Eve and encouraged them to multiply , fill the earth , and subdue it .
Just as the Creator was keenly interested in the welfare of his creation , the first human parents should have been interested in the happiness of their unborn children .
Paradise was to be extended earth wide for the benefit of Adam’s offspring .
That huge project would require the cooperation of his ever - growing family .
Why would extending Paradise have led to happiness ?
For perfect men and women , working to extend Paradise would have meant cooperating to the full with Jehovah to achieve his purposes , thereby entering into his rest .
Imagine how fulfilling and rewarding that project would have been !
Giving of themselves for the welfare of others would have brought them great blessings and immense satisfaction .
10 , 11 .
How can we fulfill the commission to preach and make disciples ?
Today , Jehovah has given his people the work of preaching and making disciples .
To fulfill that commission , we need to be sincerely interested in the welfare of others .
We can endure in this work only if we have the right motivation ​ — love for God and love for our neighbor .
In the first century C.E . , Paul referred to himself and certain close associates as “ God’s fellow workers ” because of their role in planting and watering the seed of Kingdom truth .
Today , we too can be “ God’s fellow workers ” by generously giving of our time , resources , and energy to the divinely commissioned preaching work .
What a tremendous privilege this is !
Few things are more gratifying than helping appreciative individuals to grasp spiritual truths ( See paragraph 12 )
12 , 13 .
What would you say are the rewards of disciple - making ?
Being generous with our time and energy in the preaching and disciple - making work brings great joy .
Many who have had the privilege of conducting progressive Bible studies will tell you that few things are more rewarding .
Great happiness comes from seeing appreciative individuals light up when they grasp spiritual truths , grow in faith , make changes , and start sharing the truth with others .
Jesus also experienced great happiness when the 70 preachers whom he had sent out to the field “ returned with joy ” because of the favorable results they had experienced . ​ — Luke 10 : 17 - 21 .
Publishers worldwide rejoice to see the message of the good news affect people’s lives in positive ways .
Consider the experience of Anna , a young single sister , who expanded her ministry by moving to serve in an area of Eastern Europe where the need for preachers is great .
* “ There are a lot of opportunities to conduct Bible studies here , and I like that very much , ” she writes .
“ My service gives me great joy . When I get home , I don’t have time to focus on myself .
I think about those with whom I am studying ​ — their troubles and anxieties .
I look for ways to encourage them and help them in practical ways .
And I have become convinced that ‘ there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving . ’ ” ​ — Acts 20 : 35 .
When we visit every house in our territory , we give people the opportunity to respond to the Kingdom message ( See paragraph 14 )
Even if few people respond favorably to the good news , how can you find pleasure in your ministry ?
We can find happiness in giving people the opportunity to respond to the message of good news even if they choose not to listen .
After all , our commission today is similar to that of the prophet Ezekiel , to whom Jehovah said : “ You must speak my words to them , whether they listen or not . ”
Even if some do not appreciate our message , Jehovah appreciates our efforts .
( Read Hebrews 6 : 10 . )
One publisher showed an excellent attitude in this regard .
He wrote concerning his ministry , “ We have planted , watered , and prayed in hopes that Jehovah will make the interest grow . ” ​ — 1 Cor .
3 : 6 .
How do many people react to generosity , and should their reaction affect the way we act ?
Jesus wants us to find happiness by being generous .
Many people react favorably to generosity .
“ Practice giving , and people will give to you , ” he urged .
“ They will pour into your laps a fine measure , pressed down , shaken together , and overflowing .
For with the measure that you are measuring out , they will measure out to you in return . ”
Of course , not all respond positively to our generous giving , but when they do , their gratitude can start a chain reaction .
So practice giving whether people seem to appreciate it or not .
You never know how much good you can do with just one act of generosity .
What should motivate our acts of generosity ?
Truly generous people do not give in order to get something in return .
Jesus had this in mind when he taught : “ When you spread a feast , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ; and you will be happy , because they have nothing with which to repay you . ”
“ The generous person will be blessed , ” said one inspired writer .
Another said : “ Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one . ”
Indeed , we should give because we derive pleasure from helping others .
What kinds of giving will make you happy ?
When Paul quoted Jesus ’ words “ there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving , ” Paul was referring not only to sharing material things but also to giving encouragement , guidance , and assistance to those in need of these .
By word and example , the apostle taught us to give of ourselves ​ — our time , our energy , our attention , our love .
What have many secular writers concluded with regard to generosity ?
Researchers in the field of social sciences have also observed that giving makes people happy .
According to one article , “ people report a significant happiness boost after doing kind deeds for others . ”
Helping others , researchers say , is important to developing “ a greater sense of purpose and meaning ” in life “ because it fulfills basic human needs . ”
Hence , experts often recommend that people volunteer for public service to enhance their own health and happiness .
This comes as no surprise to those who accept the Bible as the Word of mankind’s loving Designer , Jehovah . ​ — 2 Tim .
3 : 16 , 17 .
19 , 20 .
What reasons do you have for wanting to be generous ?
It can be a challenge to maintain a generous spirit when we are surrounded by people who put their own interests ahead of those of others .
However , Jesus stated that the two greatest commandments are to love Jehovah with our whole heart , soul , mind , and strength and to love our neighbor as ourselves .
As we have seen in this article , those who love Jehovah imitate him .
Jehovah gives to others , and so does Jesus .
And they recommend that we do the same , for it will make us truly happy .
If we strive to manifest this generous spirit in our dealings with both God and neighbor , we will bring honor to Jehovah and benefit ourselves and others .
No doubt you are already striving to give of yourself to help others , especially fellow believers .
If you continue to do so , you will surely be loved and appreciated , and you will be happy as a result .
“ The generous person will prosper , ” says Proverbs 11 : 25 , “ and whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed . ”
Of course , selfless giving , kindness , and generosity can be shown in many ways and in many areas of your Christian life and ministry , with rewarding results .
The following article will explore some of these ways and areas .
Name has been changed .
“ We are God’s fellow workers . ” ​ — 1 COR .
3 : 9 .
SONGS : 64 , 111
by assisting your family and fellow worshippers ?
by being hospitable ?
by volunteering and by expanding your service ?
In what ways can we work with Jehovah ?
THE Creator envisioned that perfect humans would cooperate with him to accomplish his purposes .
Despite mankind’s current imperfect state , faithful people can still work with Jehovah each day .
For example , we become “ God’s fellow workers ” by preaching the good news of his Kingdom and making disciples .
Just think what a privilege we have to be counted worthy of cooperating with the almighty Creator of the universe in a work that he considers important !
Yet , preaching and making disciples are not the only ways that we work with Jehovah .
This article will examine other ways we can do so ​ — by assisting our family and fellow worshippers , by being hospitable , by volunteering for theocratic projects , and by expanding our sacred service . ​ — Col .
3 : 23 .
Why would it be unwise to compare what you do to promote Jehovah’s purposes with what others do ?
As we consider this material , do not compare what you can do for Jehovah with what others can do .
Remember that age , health , circumstances , and abilities vary from one person to another .
The inspired apostle Paul said : “ Let each one examine his own actions , and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone , and not in comparison with the other person . ” ​ — Gal .
6 : 4 .
Why can it be said that everyone who cares for his family is cooperating with God ?
Jehovah expects his servants to care for their families .
For example , you may have to work to provide financially for your loved ones .
Many mothers stay at home to look after their infants .
And some adult children may have to care for infirm parents .
These are necessary activities .
God’s Word states : “ If anyone does not provide for those who are his own , and especially for those who are members of his household , he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith . ”
If you have such responsibilities , you likely cannot set aside as much time for theocratic activities as you would like to . But take heart !
Jehovah is pleased when you provide for your family . ​ — 1 Cor .
10 : 31 .
How can parents put theocratic interests ahead of their own , and with what results ?
Christian parents cooperate with Jehovah when they set theocratic goals before their children .
Many who have done so have later seen their sons and daughters take up full - time service assignments far from home .
Some are missionaries ; others pioneer where the need for publishers is greater ; still others serve at Bethel .
Distance might mean that families cannot get together as often as they would like to . Nevertheless , the self - sacrificing parents encourage their children to persevere in their assignments .
Why ?
They find great joy and satisfaction in knowing that their children are putting Kingdom interests first .
Perhaps many of these parents feel like Hannah , who said that she “ lent ” her son Samuel to Jehovah .
These parents rightly view such cooperation as a precious privilege . They would not want things any other way . ​ — 1 Sam .
1 : 28 .
How might you be able to offer practical assistance to members of your congregation ?
( See opening picture . )
If you do not have pressing family responsibilities , could you assist fellow worshippers who are caregivers and those who are infirm , elderly , or otherwise in need ?
Why not look around in your congregation and take note of who needs help ?
Perhaps you could spend time with the elderly parent of a Christian sister who is a caregiver while the sister attends to other matters .
Or maybe you could help those who need assistance by offering to take them to meetings , to go shopping , to run errands , or to visit someone who is in the hospital .
In doing so , you might be working with Jehovah to answer a prayer . ​ — Read 1 Corinthians 10 : 24 .
What is involved in showing hospitality ?
God’s fellow workers are noted for practicing hospitality .
In the Christian Greek Scriptures , the term translated “ hospitality ” means “ kindness to strangers . ”
God’s Word recounts events that teach us to show such love .
We can and should seize opportunities to help others regularly , whether they are “ related to us in the faith ” or not . ​ — Gal .
6 : 10 .
Why might you consider showing hospitality to visiting full - time servants ?
Can you work with God by showing hospitality to visiting full - time servants ?
( Read 3 John 5 , 8 . )
Such occasions often provide an opportunity for “ an interchange of encouragement . ”
Consider the experience of Olaf .
He recalls that decades ago , no one in his congregation could accommodate the circuit overseer , who was single .
Young Olaf asked his non - Witness parents if the circuit overseer could stay at the family home .
They agreed but pointed out that Olaf would have to sleep on the couch .
That adjustment was well worth it .
“ What a wonderful week ! ” Olaf recalls .
“ The circuit overseer and I got up early each morning and discussed many interesting topics over breakfast .
The encouragement I received kindled my desire to take up the full - time service . ”
Over the last 40 years , Olaf has served in various missionary assignments .
What reasons do we have for showing kindness even if at first it does not seem to be appreciated ?
Illustrate .
You can show love to strangers in many ways even if at first your efforts are not appreciated .
Consider this example .
While conducting a Bible study , a publisher in Spain noticed that her student Yesica , from Ecuador , could not stop crying .
The publisher asked why .
Yesica related that before emigrating she was so poor that one day she had no food .
All she had to give her daughter was water .
Yesica tried to rock her child to sleep as she prayed for help .
Soon after , two Witnesses visited her , but Yesica was unkind to them and tore up the magazine the sisters offered .
“ Is this the food you want me to give to my daughter ? ”
she asked . The sisters tried to comfort her , but their attempts were in vain .
Later , they left a basket of food at her door .
Yesica was touched by their kindness and felt bad as she recalled that she paid no heed when God answered her prayer .
Now , though , she was determined to serve Jehovah .
What a fine effect their generosity produced ! ​ — Eccl .
11 : 1 , 6 .
9 , 10 . ( a ) What were some of the occasions in Bible times when a need arose for volunteers among God’s people ?
( b ) What are some of the needs that are generally cared for by willing men in the congregation today ?
On various occasions in the history of ancient Israel , volunteers were needed .
Today , you also have many opportunities to volunteer your time , resources , and skills to help your brothers and sisters .
And you will feel great joy and receive many blessings from making yourself available .
God’s Word encourages men in the congregation to work with Jehovah by reaching out for privileges of service and oversight .
Those who do so want to assist others in both practical and spiritual matters .
Have the elders asked if you would be willing to serve as an attendant or to help with literature , territories , maintenance , or the like ?
Those who care for such duties will tell you that it is most enjoyable to assist others .
Volunteering for theocratic projects offers many opportunities to make new friends ( See paragraph 11 )
How has one sister benefited from the friendships she made on theocratic projects ?
Those who volunteer for theocratic projects often make new friends .
Consider the example of Margie , a sister who has worked on Kingdom Hall construction projects for 18 years .
Over the years , she has taken several younger sisters under her wing to give them training .
She has found the experience to be an excellent way of encouraging one another spiritually .
During trying periods of her life , Margie has received encouragement from those whose friendships she forged on construction projects .
Have you ever volunteered for such a construction project ?
Whether you are skilled or not , can you make yourself available ?
How might you be able to contribute to disaster relief ?
When disasters strike , God’s people have opportunities to work with God by helping their brothers in practical ways .
For example , they give financial support to those affected .
Another practical way is by assisting with cleaning or reconstruction .
Gabriela , a sister from Poland whose home was virtually destroyed by a flood , cheered up when brothers from nearby congregations came to her aid .
“ I don’t want to talk about what I lost ​ — those are just material things , ” she relates .
“ Rather , I want to tell you how much I gained .
This experience reassured me that being a part of the Christian congregation is a unique privilege as well as a source of joy and happiness . ”
Many who receive help after a disaster say that they feel richer from the experience .
And those who work with Jehovah to provide such help enjoy great satisfaction themselves . ​ — Read Acts 20 : 35 ; 2 Corinthians 9 : 6 , 7 .
How can volunteering strengthen our relationship with Jehovah ?
Give an example .
Stephanie and other publishers had the joy of working with God by assisting Witnesses who had arrived in the United States as refugees .
They helped to find and furnish homes for families relocating from war - torn areas .
“ We were moved by their joy and appreciation as they experienced the love of their worldwide brotherhood , ” says Stephanie .
“ The families think that we have helped them , but in reality , they have helped us much more . ”
She adds , “ The love , unity , faith , and reliance on Jehovah that we have witnessed have truly strengthened our love for Jehovah , and this has given us a deeper appreciation for all that we receive through his organization . ”
14 , 15 . ( a ) What spirit did the prophet Isaiah manifest ?
( b ) How can Kingdom preachers today imitate Isaiah’s attitude ?
Would you like to work with Jehovah more fully ?
Would you be willing to relocate to serve him where there is a greater need for workers in his organization ?
Of course , God’s servants do not have to travel far from home to express generosity .
But the circumstances of some brothers and sisters allow them to make themselves available farther afield .
Their attitude is similar to that of the prophet Isaiah .
In response to Jehovah’s question , “ Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? ”
he replied : “ Here I am !
Send me ! ”
Do you have the desire and circumstances to respond in a similar way to theocratic needs ?
What needs exist ?
Concerning the preaching and disciple - making work , Jesus said : “ The harvest is great , but the workers are few .
Therefore , beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest . ”
Can you serve in a field where the need is greater , perhaps as a pioneer ? Or can you help someone else to do so ?
Many brothers and sisters have felt that the best way to show love for God and neighbor is to pioneer in areas or in territories in which there is a greater need for harvest workers .
Can you think of other ways to expand or increase your service ?
Great joy comes from doing so .
16 , 17 .
What further opportunities exist if you desire to expand the work you do for Jehovah ?
Would you be willing to serve at Bethel or assist in the construction of a theocratic facility , either as a temporary worker or as a commuter ?
There is a constant need for individuals who can serve Jehovah wherever they are assigned and at whatever task they are given to do .
This might require that they work in a field where there is a specific need , even though they have skills and experience in another field .
Yet , Jehovah appreciates the self - sacrificing spirit shown by individuals who offer themselves to serve wherever there is a need . ​ — Ps .
110 : 3 .
Do you desire to receive further training so as to be better equipped to carry out your sacred service ?
If so , you may qualify to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers .
This school gives training to spiritually - minded men and women who are in full - time service , so that they can expand theocratic interests in the field .
Those who apply to attend this school need to be willing to accept any assignment when they graduate .
Would you be willing to take advantage of this opportunity to reach out for greater privileges of service ? ​ — 1 Cor .
9 : 23 .
What do you stand to gain by working with Jehovah each day ?
As Jehovah’s people , we are moved to be generous ​ — which is a manifestation of goodness , kindness , and love — ​ and to care about others each day .
When we do that , we gain joy , peace , and happiness .
Whatever your circumstances in life , you can find joy by imitating Jehovah’s generous personality and by being one of his precious fellow workers ! ​ — Prov .
3 : 9 , 10 .

Why must we be selective about what we read and about what we share via e - mails or text messages ?
How can we imitate Jesus if others spread false reports about us ?
What three Bible principles will help us to evaluate information accurately ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important ability do we need to cultivate , and why ?
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
AS TRUE Christians , we need to develop the ability to evaluate information and reach accurate conclusions .
If we do not cultivate this ability , we will be far more vulnerable to the efforts of Satan and his world to distort our thinking .
Of course , only if we have the facts can we reach right conclusions .
As Proverbs 18 : 13 says , “ when anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts , it is foolish and humiliating . ”
In this article , we will consider several challenges associated with obtaining the facts and reaching proper conclusions .
In addition , we will consider practical Bible principles and examples that can help us improve our ability to evaluate information accurately .
Why do we need to apply the Bible principle found at Proverbs 14 : 15 ?
( See opening picture . )
Today , people are bombarded with information .
Internet websites , television , and other mass media present a seemingly unending array of ideas .
Many people are also flooded with e - mails , text messages , and reports from well - meaning friends and acquaintances .
Since the deliberate spreading of wrong information and the distorting of facts are common , we have good reason to be cautious and to evaluate carefully what we hear .
What Bible principle can help us ?
Proverbs 14 : 15 says : “ The naive person believes every word , but the shrewd one ponders each step . ”
How does Philippians 4 : 8 , 9 help us in selecting what material we read , and why is it vital to have accurate information ?
( See also the box “ A Few Provisions to Help Us Get the Facts . ” )
To make good decisions , we need solid facts .
Therefore , we need to be highly selective and to choose carefully what information we will read .
( Read Philippians 4 : 8 , 9 . )
We should not waste our time viewing questionable Internet news sites or reading unsubstantiated reports circulated via e - mail .
It is especially important to avoid websites promoted by apostates .
Their whole purpose is to tear down God’s people and to distort the truth .
Poor quality information will lead to poor decisions .
Never underestimate the powerful effect that misleading information can have on your mind and heart . ​ — 1 Tim .
6 : 20 , 21 .
What provisions have been made to keep God’s people up - to - date with accurate information ?
BREAKING NEWS : The feature Breaking News on the jw.org website provides quick , brief updates to Jehovah’s people on major events happening worldwide .
NEWSROOM : This regular section on jw.org contains more extensive reports on matters affecting our freedom of worship and on our response to natural disasters .
JW BROADCASTING : This Internet television station provides video updates on the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide .
What false report did the Israelites hear , and how were they affected ?
Believing a false report can be disastrous .
For example , consider what happened in Moses ’ time when 10 of the 12 spies who were sent to explore the Promised Land brought back a bad report .
Their exaggerated and outrageous account completely disheartened Jehovah’s people .
Why did the people react this way ?
Perhaps they thought that since the majority of the spies brought a bad report , their account must be true .
They refused to listen to the good report brought by the trustworthy men Joshua and Caleb .
Instead of getting the facts and showing confidence in Jehovah , they chose to believe the bad report .
How foolish !
Why should we not be shocked if we hear outrageous reports about Jehovah’s people ?
We need to be especially cautious when we come across reports regarding Jehovah’s people .
Never forget that Satan is the accuser of God’s faithful servants .
Therefore , Jesus warned that opposers would “ lyingly say every sort of wicked thing ” against us .
If we take that warning seriously , we will not be shocked when we hear outrageous statements about Jehovah’s people .
Before sending e - mails or text messages , what do we need to consider ?
Are you the kind of person who enjoys sending e - mails and text messages to your friends and acquaintances ?
If so , when you see a newly published story in the news media or hear an experience , you might feel like a news reporter who wants to be the first to break an exciting story .
However , before you send that text message or e - mail , ask yourself : ‘ Am I certain that the information I am about to spread is true ?
Do I really have the facts ? ’
If you are not certain , you could unwittingly circulate false information among our brotherhood .
If in doubt , hit the delete key , not the send button .
What have opposers in some lands done , and how could we inadvertently cooperate with them ?
There is another danger in quickly forwarding e - mails and text messages .
In some lands , our work is under restriction or outright ban .
Our opposers in such lands may purposely circulate reports designed to instill fear or to cause us to distrust one another .
Consider what happened in the former Soviet Union .
The secret police , known as the KGB , spread rumors that various prominent brothers had betrayed Jehovah’s people .
* Many put confidence in such false reports , and as a result , they separated themselves from Jehovah’s organization .
How sad ! Thankfully , many later returned , but some never did . Their faith was shipwrecked .
How can we avoid such a disastrous outcome ?
Refuse to circulate negative or unsubstantiated reports . Do not be naive , or gullible .
Be sure you have the facts .
What is another challenge to obtaining accurate information ?
Reports that contain half - truths or incomplete information are another challenge to reaching accurate conclusions .
A story that is only 10 percent true is 100 percent misleading .
How can we avoid being misled by deceptive stories that may contain some elements of truth ? ​ — Eph .
4 : 14 .
How did the Israelites nearly come to war against their brothers , and how was that avoided ?
Consider what happened to the Israelites dwelling on the western side of the Jordan River in the days of Joshua .
They received a report that the Israelites living on the eastern side of the Jordan ( the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh ) had constructed a large , impressive altar near the Jordan .
That portion of the report was true .
Based on this incomplete information , those on the western side concluded that their brothers had rebelled against Jehovah , so the Israelites living on the western side assembled to wage war against those living on the eastern side .
( Read Joshua 22 : 9 - 12 . )
Thankfully , before attacking , they sent a delegation of trustworthy men to get all the facts .
What did the men learn ?
The Israelites from the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh had built the altar , not for sacrifices , but as a memorial .
It was built so that in the future all would know that they too were faithful servants of Jehovah .
How thankful those Israelites must have been that they did not massacre their brothers based on incomplete information but took the time to get the facts !
( a ) How did Mephibosheth become a victim of injustice ?
( b ) How could David have avoided this injustice ?
As individuals , we may also become victims of injustice because half - truths or incomplete information is circulated about us .
Consider the example of King David and Mephibosheth .
David showed generosity and kindness to Mephibosheth , returning to him all the land of his grandfather Saul .
Later , however , David received a negative report about Mephibosheth .
Without verifying the information , David decided to strip Mephibosheth of all his property .
When David finally spoke with him , David recognized his error and restored to Mephibosheth a share of the property .
But this injustice could have been avoided had David taken the time to get the facts instead of rashly acting on incomplete information .
12 , 13 . ( a ) How did Jesus deal with slanderous reports ?
( b ) What can we do if someone spreads a false report about us ?
What , though , if you are a victim of a slanderous accusation ?
Jesus and John the Baptizer experienced such a challenge .
( Read Matthew 11 : 18 , 19 . )
How did Jesus deal with false information ?
He did not spend all his time and energy defending himself .
Instead he encouraged people to look at the facts ​ — what he did and what he taught .
As Jesus said , “ wisdom is vindicated by its works . ” ​ — Matt . 11 : 19 ; ftn .
There is a valuable lesson here that we do well to learn .
At times , people may say unfair or critical things about us .
We may long for justice and wish that we could do something to undo the damage to our reputation .
Yet , there is something we can do .
If someone spreads a lie about us , we can live in such a way that no one will believe that lie .
Indeed , as Jesus ’ example shows , our personal record of upright Christian conduct can wipe out half - truths and false accusations .
14 , 15 .
How can leaning on our own understanding become a snare ?
Obtaining reliable facts is only one challenge to reaching good conclusions .
Our human imperfection poses another major challenge .
What if we have been serving Jehovah faithfully for decades ?
We may have developed fine thinking ability and discernment .
We may be highly respected for our sound judgment .
Nonetheless , can this also be a snare ?
Yes , leaning too heavily on our own understanding can become a snare .
Our emotions and personal ideas could begin to govern our thinking .
We may begin to feel that we can look at a situation and understand it even though we do not have all the facts .
How dangerous !
The Bible clearly warns us not to lean on our own understanding . ​ — Prov . 3 : 5 , 6 ; 28 : 26 .
In this imaginary scenario , what happened in a restaurant , and what conclusions did Tom quickly draw ?
Consider this imaginary scenario .
While in a restaurant one evening , an experienced elder named Tom was shocked to see a fellow elder , John , sitting at another table with a woman who was not his wife .
Tom observed the couple laughing , thoroughly enjoying each other’s association , and sharing an affectionate embrace .
Tom became more and more disturbed .
Would this lead to divorce ?
What would happen to John’s wife ?
What about John’s children ?
Tom had seen such heartbreaking situations before .
How would you have felt if you had witnessed this scene ?
In this imaginary scenario , what did Tom later learn , and what lesson does this teach us ?
But wait .
Although Tom quickly concluded that John had been unfaithful to his wife , did he really have the facts ?
Later that evening , Tom telephoned John .
Can you imagine how relieved Tom felt when he learned that the woman was John’s fleshly sister , who was visiting from out of town .
The two had not seen each other for many years .
Because she was just passing through for a few hours , John was only able to meet her for a meal in the restaurant .
His wife was unable to join them . Thankfully , Tom had not spread his wrong conclusions to others .
The lesson for us ?
No matter how much experience we may have in Christian living , experience alone is never a substitute for the facts .
How might our judgment be clouded by personality conflicts ?
Another challenge to evaluating matters accurately may be faced when we have a personality conflict with a brother in the congregation .
If we constantly dwell on our differences , we may begin to look at our brother with a measure of suspicion .
Thus , if we hear a negative report about this brother , we may be eager to believe it .
What is the lesson ?
Harboring ill feelings toward our brothers can lead to distorted judgments that are not based on the facts .
We can prevent our judgment from becoming clouded by refusing to allow envy and jealousy to take root in our hearts .
Instead of giving in to such bad feelings , may we recognize our obligation to love our brothers and freely forgive them from the heart . ​ — Read Colossians 3 : 12 - 14 .
19 , 20 . ( a ) What Bible principles will help us to evaluate information accurately ?
( b ) What will we examine in the next article ?
Obtaining the facts and evaluating them accurately present a challenge today because of the abundance of low - quality information , reports filled with half - truths , and our own imperfection .
What will help us with this challenging task ?
We must know and apply Bible principles .
One such principle is that it is foolish and humiliating to reply to a matter before hearing the facts .
Another Bible principle reminds us not to accept every word without question .
And finally , no matter how much experience we have in Christian living , we must be careful not to lean on our own understanding .
Bible principles will safeguard us if we are certain to use facts from reliable sources to draw good conclusions and to make wise decisions .
But an additional challenge remains . It is the tendency to judge matters based on the outward appearance .
In the next article , we will examine some common pitfalls in this area and see what can help us to avoid them .
See the 2004 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses , pp . 111 - 112 , and the 2008 Yearbook , pp . 133 - 135 .
“ Stop judging by the outward appearance , but judge with righteous judgment . ” ​ — JOHN 7 : 24 .
SONGS : 142 , 123
Acts 10 : 34 , 35
Leviticus 19 : 15
1 Timothy 4 : 12
What did Isaiah prophesy concerning Jesus , and why is this encouraging ?
THROUGH his prophecy about our Lord Jesus Christ , Isaiah warms and reassures our hearts .
Isaiah foretold that Jesus would “ not judge by what appears to his eyes , nor reprove simply according to what his ears hear . ”
He would “ judge the lowly with fairness . ”
Why is this encouraging ?
Because we live in a world filled with bias and prejudice .
We all long for the perfect Judge , who will never judge us by our outward appearance !
What did Jesus command us to do , and what will we discuss in this article ?
Each day we make judgments about people .
Yet , as imperfect humans , we are not able to judge matters perfectly as Jesus does .
We tend to be influenced by what appears to our eyes .
Nonetheless , when Jesus was on earth , he commanded : “ Stop judging by the outward appearance , but judge with righteous judgment . ”
Clearly , Jesus wants us to be like him and not judge others by their outward appearance .
In this article , we will discuss three areas in which people are frequently influenced by what appears to their eyes : race or ethnicity , wealth , and age .
In each area , we will consider practical ways to obey Jesus ’ command .
3 , 4 . ( a ) What events led the apostle Peter to reevaluate his view of the Gentiles ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What new truth did Jehovah help Peter to understand ?
Imagine the thoughts that were going through the apostle Peter’s mind when he was called to Caesarea to the home of the Gentile Cornelius .
Like other Jews of his time , Peter grew up believing that Gentiles were unclean .
Yet , Peter had experienced events that caused him to reevaluate that position .
For example , Peter had just had a miraculous vision .
What had Peter seen ?
A sheetlike vessel filled with unclean animals was lowered before him while a heavenly voice ordered : “ Get up , Peter , slaughter and eat ! ”
Peter firmly refused .
Then that heavenly voice told him to “ stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed . ”
As he awoke from the vision , Peter was perplexed as to what the voice was trying to tell him . Just then , the messengers from Cornelius arrived .
After receiving direction from the holy spirit , Peter pressed forward and accompanied the messengers to the home of Cornelius .
If Peter had judged matters solely on outward appearance , he would never have entered the home of Cornelius .
Jews simply did not enter the homes of Gentiles .
Why did Peter move forward despite deep - seated prejudices ?
Peter was profoundly affected by the vision he had seen and by the reassurance he received from the holy spirit .
After he listened to what Cornelius related , Peter , no doubt moved by the account , declared under inspiration : “ Now I truly understand that God is not partial , but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him . ”
What a thrilling new understanding for Peter ​ — one with far - reaching implications !
How would this truth about being impartial affect all Christians ?
( a ) What does Jehovah want all Christians to understand ?
( b ) Despite our knowing the truth , what may linger within us ?
By means of Peter , Jehovah was helping all Christians to understand that He is not partial .
He places no significance on racial , ethnic , national , tribal , or linguistic differences .
Any man or woman who fears God and does what is right is acceptable to him .
No doubt , you acknowledge that this is true .
But what if you have grown up in a land or in a home filled with prejudice ?
While you might see yourself as being impartial , deep inside , prejudice may linger .
Even Peter , who had the privilege of revealing Jehovah’s impartiality , later manifested prejudice .
How can we listen to Jesus and stop judging by the outward appearance ?
( a ) What can help us to root out prejudiced attitudes from our hearts ?
( b ) What did one responsible brother’s report reveal ?
We need to examine ourselves carefully in the light of God’s Word to see if we are holding on to any prejudiced thoughts or feelings .
We might also need loving help from others who may see prejudiced attitudes in us , even if we cannot see them in ourselves .
It could be that these attitudes are so ingrained in us that we are not conscious of them .
Consider , for example , one responsible brother who submitted a report on a fine couple in full - time service .
The husband was from an ethnic minority frequently looked down on by others .
Apparently , the responsible brother was not aware that he himself harbored prejudiced views about this minority .
In his report , he said many fine things about the husband ; yet , he concluded by saying : “ Although he is of [ this nationality ] , his manners and way of life help others to understand that being [ from this ethnicity ] does not necessarily mean having a dirty , inferior lifestyle , typical of many from [ this ] descent . ”
Do you see the point ?
No matter what our responsibilities are , we must examine ourselves carefully and be willing to receive help so that we can identify any remaining traces of prejudice in our hearts .
What else can we do ?
How can we demonstrate that we are opening our heart wide ?
If we open our heart wide , we will allow love to replace prejudice .
Are you in the habit of having close association only with those of your own race , ethnicity , nationality , tribe , or language group ?
If so , widen out .
Why not invite those of a different background to work with you in the field ministry or invite them to your home for a meal or a gathering ?
If you do so , you will fill your heart with so much love that there will be no room for prejudice .
But there are additional areas in which we tend to judge others by their outward appearance .
Let us next consider material wealth .
According to Leviticus 19 : 15 , how can riches or poverty affect our judgment ?
Material wealth is another factor that can affect our view of others .
Leviticus 19 : 15 says : “ You must not show partiality to the poor or show preference to the rich .
With justice you should judge your fellow man . ”
But how could a person’s wealth or his poverty affect the way we view him ?
What sad truth did Solomon record , and what does it teach us ?
Holy spirit moved Solomon to record a sad truth about imperfect humans .
At Proverbs 14 : 20 , he states : “ The poor man is hated even by his neighbors , but many are the friends of the rich person . ”
What does this proverb teach us ?
If we are not careful , we could desire the friendship of brothers who are wealthy while shunning brothers who are poor .
Why is it so dangerous to measure the value of others solely on the basis of their material wealth ?
What problem did James identify ?
If we judge others on the basis of their material wealth , we could create class distinctions in the congregation .
The disciple James warned that this problem was dividing some congregations in the first century .
( Read James 2 : 1 - 4 . )
We must be on guard not to allow this thinking to affect our congregations today .
How can we fight against such judgments based on the outward appearance ?
How does a person’s material possessions affect his relationship with Jehovah ?
Explain .
We need to see our brothers as Jehovah sees them .
A person is not precious to Jehovah because he is wealthy or because he is poor .
Our relationship with Jehovah will never be determined by how many material possessions we have or by what we lack .
While it is true that Jesus said that “ it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of the heavens , ” he did not say that it would be impossible .
On the other hand , Jesus also said : “ Happy are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God . ”
Yet , this did not mean that all poor people were specially blessed and responded to the teaching of Jesus .
Many poor people did not respond .
The point is , We simply cannot judge a person’s relationship with Jehovah by his material possessions .
What instruction do the Scriptures provide to the rich and to the poor ?
We are blessed to have many brothers and sisters , rich and poor , who love and serve Jehovah with a complete heart .
The Scriptures instruct those who are rich “ to place their hope , not on uncertain riches , but on God . ”
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 17 - 19 . )
At the same time , God’s Word admonishes all of God’s people , rich and poor , to be careful not to love money .
Indeed , when we open our eyes and see our brothers as Jehovah sees them , we will not be tempted to judge them solely on what they have or do not have materially .
But what about a person’s age ?
Is that a sound basis for judging others ?
Let us see .
What do the Scriptures teach us concerning respect for older ones ?
The Scriptures frequently instruct us to show proper respect for older ones .
Leviticus 19 : 32 says : “ Before gray hair you should rise up , and you must show honor to an older man , and you must be in fear of your God . ”
Proverbs 16 : 31 similarly instructs us that “ gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness . ”
Then , too , Paul admonished Timothy not to criticize an older man severely but to view such an older brother as a father .
Although Timothy had a measure of authority over such older brothers , he was to treat them with compassion and respect .
In what circumstance might it be proper for us to give needed counsel or discipline to a person who is older than we are ?
However , how far would we take that principle ? For example , should we feel obligated to defer to someone older if he is willfully sinning or is advocating something displeasing to Jehovah ?
Jehovah will not judge by the outward appearance and will not excuse a willful sinner simply because he is older .
Note the principle found at Isaiah 65 : 20 : “ The sinner will be cursed , even though he is a hundred years of age . ”
A similar principle is demonstrated in Ezekiel’s vision .
Thus , our main concern must always be to show respect for the Ancient of Days , Jehovah God .
If we do so , we will not be afraid to correct a person needing counsel , regardless of his age . ​ — Gal .
6 : 1 .
Do you show respect for younger brothers ?
( See paragraph 15 )
What lesson do we learn from the apostle Paul about showing respect for younger brothers ?
What about younger brothers in the congregation ? How do you view them ?
To the young man Timothy , the apostle Paul wrote : “ Never let anyone look down on your youth .
Instead , become an example to the faithful ones in speaking , in conduct , in love , in faith , in chasteness . ”
At the time that Paul wrote these words , Timothy may have been in his early 30 ’ s .
Yet , Paul had assigned him to care for weighty responsibilities .
Regardless of the underlying reason for this counsel , the point is clear .
We must not judge younger brothers simply based on their age .
We do well to remember that even our Lord Jesus carried out his entire earthly ministry while he was in his early 30 ’ s .
16 , 17 . ( a ) How do elders determine if a brother is qualified to be recommended as a ministerial servant or an elder ?
( b ) How might personal or cultural viewpoints conflict with the Scriptures ?
We may be part of a culture that tends to look down on younger men .
If so , elders in the congregation may hesitate to recommend qualified young brothers to serve as ministerial servants or elders .
All elders do well to remember that the Scriptures do not give a minimum age for a man to be recommended as a ministerial servant or an elder .
If an elder establishes a rule based on culture , he is not acting according to the Scriptures .
Younger men must be evaluated , not by personal or cultural viewpoints , but by the measuring stick of God’s Word . ​ — 2 Tim .
3 : 16 , 17 .
Consider how such unscriptural cultural views can hold back qualified brothers .
In one country , a well - qualified ministerial servant was entrusted with weighty responsibilities .
Although the elders in his congregation agreed that the young brother met the Scriptural qualifications of an elder to a reasonable degree , he was not recommended for appointment .
A few older elders insisted that the brother looked too young to be viewed as an elder .
Sadly , the brother was held back from appointment simply because of the way he looked .
Although this is only one experience , reports indicate that this way of thinking affects many in various parts of the world .
How important it is that we rely on the Scriptures rather than on our own cultural or personal viewpoints !
That is the only way to obey Jesus and stop judging by the outward appearance .
18 , 19 .
What does it take for us to see others as Jehovah sees them ?
In spite of our human imperfection , we can learn to see others through the impartial eyes of Jehovah .
But it takes continual effort on our part and constant reminders from God’s Word .
By applying these reminders , we will progress in obeying the command of Jesus to stop judging by the outward appearance . ​ — John 7 : 24 .
Soon our King , Jesus Christ , will judge all mankind , not by what appears to his eyes or by what his ears hear , but by righteous judgment .
How wonderful that will be !
LIFE STORY
As told by Maxim Danyleyko
“ DADDY , ” “ PAPA , ” “ UNCLE . ” That is how many young ones at Bethel have often addressed me .
And as an 89 - year - old , I like it .
I view these expressions of affection as part of the reward from Jehovah for my having served him for 72 years in full - time service .
And based on my experiences in God’s service , I am able to assure these young ones from my heart , ‘ Your activity will be rewarded ​ — if you do not let your hands drop . ’ ​ — 2 Chron . 15 : 7 , ftn .
My parents immigrated to Canada from Ukraine .
They settled in the town of Rossburn in the province of Manitoba .
My loving mother bore 8 boys and 8 girls , no twins ​ — I was number 14 .
Father loved the Bible and read it to us on Sunday mornings , but he viewed religion as a money - making scheme and often jokingly asked , “ I wonder who paid Jesus for his preaching and teaching ? ”
Eight of my siblings ​ — four brothers and four sisters — ​ eventually accepted the truth .
My sister Rose pioneered until her death .
She spent her final days encouraging everyone to pay attention to God’s Word , saying , “ I want to see you in the new world . ”
My older brother Ted was at first a hellfire preacher .
Every Sunday morning he preached on the radio , hammering away at his listeners , telling them that sinners would burn forever in the unquenchable fire of hell .
Later , however , he became a faithful and zealous servant of Jehovah .
One day in June 1944 when I came home from school , I found a booklet entitled The Coming World Regeneration * on our dining - room table .
I read the first page , then the second , and then I could not stop reading .
After I had finished reading the whole booklet , my mind was made up ​ — I wanted to serve Jehovah just as Jesus did .
How did the booklet end up on our table ?
My older brother Steve said that two men “ selling ” books and booklets had been at our home .
“ I bought that one , ” he said , “ because it only cost five cents . ”
The men returned the following Sunday .
They told us that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that they used the Bible to answer questions that people might have .
We appreciated that because our parents had brought us up to respect God’s Word .
The two men also told us that the Witnesses would soon have a convention in Winnipeg , the city where my sister Elsie lived .
I decided to attend the convention .
I pedaled my bicycle for the roughly 200 miles ( 320 km ) to Winnipeg but stopped along the way in the town of Kelwood , where the two Witnesses who had visited our home were living .
While I stayed there , I attended a meeting and learned what a congregation was .
I also came to realize that every man , woman , and youth should be a house - to - house teacher , as Jesus was .
In Winnipeg , I met my older brother Jack , who had traveled to the convention from northern Ontario .
On the first day of the convention , a brother announced that there would be a baptism .
Jack and I decided to get baptized at that convention .
We were both determined to begin to serve as pioneers as soon as possible after our baptism .
Jack entered the full - time service right after the convention .
I was 16 years old and had to return to school , but the following year I too became a regular pioneer .
Together with Stan Nicolson , I began pioneer service in Souris , a town in the province of Manitoba .
I soon learned that pioneering was not always smooth sailing .
We saw our funds diminishing , but we plodded on .
One time after preaching all day , we headed home with not a single penny left and very hungry .
What a surprise it was to find a big sack of food at our door !
To this day , we do not know who put it there .
That evening , we ate like kings .
What a reward for not having let our hands drop !
In fact , at the end of that month , I weighed more than I had ever weighed in my life .
A few months later , we were assigned to the town of Gilbert Plains , located about 150 miles ( 240 km ) north of Souris .
In those days , each congregation had a large chart on the platform that showed the field service activity of the congregation month by month .
When the activity dropped one month , I gave a talk to the congregation to stress that the brothers and sisters needed to do better .
After the meeting , an elderly pioneer sister , whose husband was not in the truth , said to me with tears in her eyes , “ I tried , but I just couldn’t do more than what I did . ”
Then it was my turn to cry , and I apologized to her .
As was the case with me , energetic young brothers can easily make slips like that and then feel disappointed with themselves .
But I have experienced that instead of letting the hands drop , it is best to learn a lesson from a mistake and remember that lesson as you move on .
Further faithful activity will be rewarded .
What a privilege it was for me as a 21 - year - old to attend the 14th class of Gilead School , which graduated in February 1950 !
About a quarter of my classmates were sent to the French - speaking province of Quebec , Canada , where religious persecution against the Witnesses ran rampant .
I was assigned to Val - d’Or , a town in the gold - mining country .
One day , a group of us went preaching in the nearby village of Val - Senneville .
The local priest threatened us with violence if we did not leave the village at once .
His threat led to a court case in which I was a plaintiff . The priest was fined .
*
That incident and many similar ones became part of the “ Battle of Quebec . ”
The province of Quebec had been controlled by the Roman Catholic Church for more than 300 years .
The clergy and their political allies persecuted Jehovah’s Witnesses .
It was not an easy time , and we were few in number ; but we did not let our hands drop .
Honesthearted Quebecers responded .
I had the privilege of studying with several individuals who accepted the truth .
One of my Bible studies was with a family of ten . The entire family began to serve Jehovah .
Their courageous example incited others to leave the Catholic Church .
We kept preaching , and eventually the battle was won !
In 1956 , I was reassigned to serve in Haiti .
Most new missionaries there struggled to learn French , but people listened .
Missionary Stanley Boggus stated , “ We were amazed that people did all they could to help us express ourselves . ”
At first , I had an advantage because of having learned French in Quebec .
But soon we realized that most local brothers spoke only Haitian Creole .
So if we missionaries were to be effective , we had to learn the local language .
We did , and we were rewarded for our efforts .
To help the brothers further , we received approval from the Governing Body to translate The Watchtower and other publications into Haitian Creole .
Meeting attendance throughout the country soared .
There were 99 publishers in Haiti in 1950 , but that number rose to over 800 publishers by 1960 !
At that time , I was assigned to serve at Bethel .
In 1961 , I had the joy of sharing in conducting the Kingdom Ministry School . We were able to give training to 40 congregation overseers and special pioneers .
At the convention in January 1962 , we encouraged qualified local brothers to expand their ministry , and some were appointed as special pioneers .
This proved to be timely because opposition loomed .
On January 23 , 1962 , just after the convention , missionary Andrew D’Amico and I were arrested at the branch office , and the stock of Awake !
of January 8 , 1962 ( in French ) , was confiscated .
Awake !
had quoted French newspapers that reported that voodoo was practiced in Haiti .
Some did not like that statement and claimed that we had written the article at the branch .
A few weeks later , the missionaries were deported .
* But the trained local brothers carried on magnificently .
Today , I rejoice with them over the endurance they showed and the spiritual progress they made .
They now even have the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Haitian Creole ​ — something we could only have dreamed of back then .
After serving in Haiti , I was assigned to serve as a missionary in the Central African Republic .
Later , I had the privilege of serving there as a traveling overseer and then as branch overseer .
In those days , many Kingdom Halls were extremely simple .
I learned how to collect straw in the bush and how to thatch a roof .
Seeing me struggle with this new trade was quite a spectacle for passersby .
It also encouraged the brothers to become more involved in constructing and maintaining their own Kingdom Halls .
Religious leaders mocked us because their churches had tin roofs and ours did not .
Undeterred , we continued with our simple straw - roofed Kingdom Halls .
The mockery stopped when a severe storm hit Bangui , the capital .
It lifted the tin roof off a church and crashed it down onto the main street . The thatched roofs on our Kingdom Halls stayed put .
To provide better supervision for the Kingdom work , we constructed a new branch office and missionary home in only five months to the day .
*
On our wedding day
In 1976 the Kingdom work was banned in the Central African Republic , and I was assigned to N’Djamena , the capital of neighboring Chad .
On the positive side , I met Happy , a zealous special pioneer , originally from Cameroon .
We married on April 1 , 1978 .
That same month , civil war broke out , and like many , we fled to the south of the country .
When the fighting was over , we returned to find that our home had become the headquarters of an armed group .
Gone was not only the literature but also Happy’s wedding dress and our wedding gifts .
But we did not let our hands drop . We still had each other and looked forward to further activity .
About two years later , the ban in the Central African Republic was lifted .
We returned there and served in the traveling work .
Our home was a van with a folding bed , a barrel that could hold 53 gallons ( 200 L ) of water , a propane - gas refrigerator , and a gas burner .
Travel was difficult .
On one trip , we were stopped at no less than 117 police checkpoints .
Temperatures often rose to 122 degrees Fahrenheit ( 50 ° C ) .
At assemblies , it was sometimes difficult to find enough water for the baptism .
So the brothers dug into dry river beds and little by little collected sufficient water for the baptism , which was often performed in a barrel .
In 1980 we were transferred to Nigeria .
There , for two - and - a - half years , we helped with the preparations for the construction of the new branch .
The brothers had purchased a two - story warehouse that was to be dismantled and then set up on our site .
One morning , I climbed up pretty high on the building to help with dismantling .
Toward noon , I started climbing back down the same way I had come up .
But the dismantling had changed things , and I stepped into air ​ — and down I went .
My condition looked quite serious , but after X - rays and an examination , the doctor told Happy : “ Don’t worry . He has just torn some ligaments and will be OK in a week or so . ”
On our way to an assembly using “ public transportation ”
In 1986 we were off to Côte d’Ivoire , where we served in the traveling work .
That work took us up to neighboring Burkina Faso .
Never could I have imagined that years later , Burkina would become our home for a time .
While we were in the traveling work , our home was a van
I left Canada in 1956 , but in 2003 , after an absence of 47 years , I was back at Bethel in Canada and this time with Happy .
On paper we were Canadians , but we felt that we belonged in Africa .
Conducting a Bible study in Burkina Faso
Then in 2007 , when I was 79 years old , it was off to Africa again !
We were assigned to Burkina Faso , where I helped as a member of the Country Committee .
The office was later converted into a remote translation office under the Benin branch , and in August 2013 , we were assigned to Bethel in Benin .
With Happy , while serving at the Benin branch
In spite of my physical limitations , the ministry is still dear to my heart .
During the past three years , with the kind help of the elders and the loving support of my wife , I have had the joy of seeing two of my Bible students , Gédéon and Frégis , get baptized .
They now zealously serve Jehovah .
In the meantime , my wife and I were transferred to the branch in South Africa , where the Bethel family kindly provides for my health needs .
South Africa is the seventh country in Africa where I have been privileged to serve .
Then in October 2017 , we received an outstanding blessing .
We were able to attend the dedication of the world headquarters in Warwick , New York .
What an unforgettable event that was !
The 1994 Yearbook states on page 255 : “ To all who have endured in the work for many years , we exhort : ‘ Be courageous and do not let your hands drop down , because there exists a reward for your activity . ’ ​ — 2 Chron .
15 : 7 . ”
Happy and I are determined to follow this exhortation and to encourage others to do the same .

LOVE
JOY
PEACE
PATIENCE
KINDNESS
GOODNESS
FAITH
MILDNESS
SELF - CONTROL
BECAUSE of the increasing pressures of “ the last days , ” Jehovah’s people need patience more than ever before .
We are surrounded by a world in which people are often lovers of themselves , not open to any agreement , and without self - control .
Those who display such characteristics are frequently anything but patient .
Hence , each Christian should ask himself : ‘ Has the world’s impatience rubbed off on me ?
What does it mean to be truly patient ?
And how can I make this outstanding Christian quality a permanent part of my personality ? ’
In the Biblical sense of the word , patience is more than simply putting up with a trying situation .
A person with godly patience endures with a purpose .
He sees beyond his own needs and considers the welfare of the one causing a disagreeable situation .
For this reason , when a patient person is wronged or provoked , he refuses to give up hope for improvement in the disturbed relationship .
Little wonder , then , that the Bible lists being “ patient ” as the first of many fine qualities that stem from love .
* God’s Word also includes “ patience ” as an aspect of “ the fruitage of the spirit . ”
What , though , does cultivating this godly quality require of us ?
To cultivate the quality of patience , we must pray for the help of Jehovah’s spirit , which he gives to those who trust in him and rely on him .
As powerful as God’s spirit is , however , we need to do our part and work in harmony with our prayers .
This means that we must do our best to exercise patience each day in order for this quality to take root in our heart .
Yet , even then , we may need to do more to make patience a permanent aspect of our personality .
What else can help us ?
We can develop patience by examining and imitating Jesus ’ perfect example .
In harmony with that example , the apostle Paul under inspiration described “ the new personality , ” which includes “ patience , ” and then he urged us to “ let the peace of the Christ rule in [ our ] hearts . ”
We can let such peace “ rule ” in our hearts by imitating Jesus ’ unbreakable faith that in His due time , God will correct matters that concern us .
When we follow Jesus ’ example , we will not be provoked into losing our patience , no matter what may be happening around us . ​ — John 14 : 27 ; 16 : 33 .
Although we are eager to see God’s promised new world , we learn to be more patient when we meditate on Jehovah’s patience with us .
The Scriptures assure us : “ Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise , as some people consider slowness , but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance . ”
As we contemplate Jehovah’s patience with us , are we not moved to be more patient with others ?
With that in mind , what are some circumstances that call for patience ?
For example , if you feel that you have something important to say , you may need to exercise patience in order to avoid interrupting others .
You might also need to show patience when associating with fellow believers whose habits irritate you .
Instead of overreacting to such things , you are wise to consider how Jehovah and Jesus react to our weaknesses .
They do not focus a critical eye on our minor failings .
Rather , they see our good qualities and patiently observe our efforts to improve . ​ — 1 Tim .
1 : 16 ; 1 Pet .
3 : 12 .
Another situation that may test our patience is when someone suggests that we said or did something wrong .
All too often , we may be quick to take offense and justify ourselves .
However , God’s Word recommends a different response .
It states : “ Better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit .
Do not be quick to take offense , for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools . ”
Hence , even if an accusation is completely untrue , we should patiently weigh our response .
Jesus followed that principle when others unjustly ridiculed him . ​ — Matt .
11 : 19 .
Parents especially need to show patience when they find it necessary to address any wrong attitudes , desires , or leanings that may develop in their children .
Consider the case of Mattias , who serves as a member of the Scandinavia Bethel family .
As a teenager , Mattias endured endless taunting at school because of his beliefs . At first , his parents were unaware of this .
Nevertheless , they had to deal with the effect that this opposition had on their son , who began to question whether he had the truth .
“ The situation required a lot of patience , ” recalls Mattias ’ father , Gillis .
Mattias would ask : “ Who is God ?
What if the Bible is not God’s Word ?
How do we know that it is actually God who wants this or that from us ? ”
He would also say to his father : “ Why am I to be judged if I don’t feel and believe as you do ? ”
“ Sometimes , ” explains Gillis , “ our son’s questions were expressed in anger , not against his mother or me , but against the truth , which he felt made life so difficult for him . ”
How did Gillis handle this situation ?
“ My son and I would sit and talk for hours at a time .
Mostly I listened and asked occasional questions to get the full picture of his feelings and views .
Sometimes I gave him an explanation to think about for a day or so before we resumed our discussion .
At other times , I would say that I needed a few days to think about a viewpoint he had expressed .
By means of these regular conversations , Mattias slowly progressed in his understanding and acceptance of such teachings as the ransom , God’s sovereignty , and Jehovah’s love .
It took time , and it was often difficult , but slowly , love for Jehovah grew in his heart .
My wife and I are so happy that our patient efforts to help our son through his teenage years paid off and reached his heart . ”
Gillis and his wife trusted in Jehovah’s support as they patiently worked with their son .
Looking back , Gillis says : “ I often told Mattias that our deep love for him moved his mother and me to pray even more intensely that Jehovah would help him to understand . ”
How thankful those parents are that they exercised the vital quality of patience !
In addition to providing spiritual help , true Christians must cultivate loving patience when providing care for chronically ill family members or friends .
Consider the example of Ellen , * who also lives in Scandinavia .
About eight years ago , Ellen’s husband was afflicted with two strokes that damaged the functions of his brain .
As a result , he is no longer able to feel compassion , happiness , or sorrow .
The situation is very demanding for Ellen .
She says : “ It has taken a lot of patience and many prayers . ”
She adds : “ My favorite scripture that brings me comfort is Philippians 4 : 13 , which says : ‘ For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power . ’ ”
Thanks to that power , Ellen endures patiently with full confidence in Jehovah’s support . ​ — Ps .
62 : 5 , 6 .
Of course , when it comes to exercising patience , Jehovah is the most outstanding example for us to follow .
There are many accounts in God’s Word of times when Jehovah displayed great patience .
For instance , how did Jehovah react when Abraham questioned His decision to destroy Sodom ?
First of all , Jehovah did not interrupt as Abraham spoke .
Instead , Jehovah listened patiently to each of Abraham’s questions and concerns .
Then , Jehovah showed that he had listened as he repeated Abraham’s concerns and assured him that He would not destroy Sodom even if just ten righteous men were found in that city .
What a fine example of patient listening and of not overreacting !
Godly patience truly is a vital part of the new personality with which all Christians must clothe themselves .
If we work hard to develop this valuable and enduring quality , we honor our caring and patient heavenly Father , and we will be counted among “ those who through faith and patience inherit the promises . ” ​ — Heb .
6 : 10 - 12 .
The quality of love was discussed in the first article of this nine - part series on the fruitage of God’s holy spirit .
Name has been changed .
FROM OUR ARCHIVES
AS THE Atlantic waves battered the ship on its journey toward Europe , one of the passengers , George Young , reflected with satisfaction on the Kingdom fruitage he had left behind in Brazil .
* However , as the journey continued , Brother Young turned his attention to his new assignment ​ — the largely untouched territories of Spain and Portugal .
Once there , he hoped to arrange Bible lectures to be given by Brother J .
F .
Rutherford and to distribute 300,000 tracts !
George Young traversed the seas on many preaching journeys
Upon his arrival in Lisbon in the spring of 1925 , Brother Young found a turbulent scene .
The republican revolution of 1910 had ended the monarchy and stripped the Catholic Church of its favored status .
The population obtained greater freedoms , but civil unrest continued in the country .
Just as Brother Young made arrangements for Brother Rutherford’s talk , the government imposed martial law because of an attempted coup d’état .
The secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society warned Brother Young that he surely would meet much opposition .
Even so , Brother Young requested a permit for the Camões Secondary School gymnasium , and permission was granted !
Then , May 13 arrived ​ — the day scheduled for Brother Rutherford’s lecture . Anticipation ran high !
Placards on buildings and newspaper advertisements announced the public lecture “ How to Live on the Earth Forever . ”
The religious opposers hurriedly published an article in their newspaper to warn its readers against the newly arrived “ false prophets . ”
At the entrance of the gymnasium , the opposers also handed out thousands of brochures with information directed against the teachings presented by Brother Rutherford .
Nevertheless , some 2,000 people packed the venue , with an equal number having to be turned away .
Some intrigued listeners hung from rope ladders on the sides of the gymnasium ; others perched atop the exercise equipment .
Not all went smoothly .
Opposers shouted and smashed chairs .
But Brother Rutherford kept his poise and calmly climbed onto a table to make himself heard .
After he finished ​ — close to midnight — ​ over 1,200 interested ones left their names and addresses in order to receive Bible literature .
The very next day , the newspaper O Século published an article about Brother Rutherford’s lecture .
By September 1925 , the Portuguese - language edition of The Watch Tower began to be published in Portugal .
( Earlier , a Portuguese - language edition had already appeared in Brazil . )
About that time , Virgílio Ferguson , a Bible Student in Brazil , began making plans to move to Portugal to help with the Kingdom work .
Earlier , he had worked with Brother Young in the small branch office of the Bible Students in Brazil .
Before long , Virgílio set sail with his wife , Lizzie , to join Brother Young again .
Brother Ferguson’s arrival was timely because Brother Young would soon move to other preaching assignments , including the Soviet Union .
Residence permit of Lizzie and Virgílio Ferguson , 1928
When a military coup installed a dictatorship in Portugal , opposition increased .
Brother Ferguson stood his ground and took steps to protect the small group of Bible Students and bolster their activities .
He sought permission to use his home for regular meetings .
In October 1927 , that permission was granted .
During the first year of the dictatorship , about 450 people in Portugal subscribed to The Watch Tower .
In addition , through tracts and booklets , the word of truth spread to the far reaches of the Portuguese Empire ​ — Angola , the Azores , Cape Verde , East Timor , Goa , Madeira , and Mozambique .
In the late 1920 ’ s , a humble Portuguese gardener , Manuel da Silva Jordão , came to Lisbon .
While living in Brazil , he had heard a public talk given by Brother Young .
He readily recognized the ring of truth and was eager to help Brother Ferguson to expand the preaching work .
To do so , Manuel began to serve as a colporteur , as pioneers were then called .
With the printing and distribution of Bible literature now well - organized , the fledgling congregation in Lisbon thrived !
In 1934 , Brother and Sister Ferguson had to return to Brazil .
However , the seeds of truth had been sown .
Amid the upheaval in Europe during the Spanish Civil War and World War II , the faithful group of brothers in Portugal managed to survive spiritually .
For a while they resembled glowing embers , but in 1947 the group’s fire was rekindled , so to speak , when the first Gilead - trained missionary , John Cooke , arrived .
After that , the growth in the number of Kingdom proclaimers was unstoppable .
Even when the government banned the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1962 , the increase continued .
In December 1974 when Jehovah’s Witnesses gained legal recognition , there were more than 13,000 publishers in the country .
Today , over 50,000 Kingdom publishers preach the good news of God’s Kingdom in Portugal and on several islands where Portuguese is spoken , including the Azores and Madeira .
Among these publishers today are third - generation descendants of some of those who attended Brother Rutherford’s historic lecture in 1925 .
We give thanks to Jehovah and to those early faithful brothers and sisters who courageously took the lead in spearheading the work as ‘ public servants of Christ Jesus to the nations . ’ ​ — Rom .
