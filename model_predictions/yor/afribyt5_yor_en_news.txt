International social media act protects freedom of speech online in Nigeria
The act will prohibit internet criminalisation in Nigeria

On November 20, the 2019 Constitutional Act on the Protection of Indigenous and Constitutional Constitution of the 2019 Constitutional Constitution, was amended by the Nigerian Government.
The agenda of the social media usage is to block comments and unjust information on online social media.
Although the constitution is not legally banning social media usage, the constitution is not legally banning social media freedom, but it will increase the freedom of social media freedom.
Nigerians implemented this constitution in 2016.
It’s job if you accuse government (accuse government)
According to Section 1A, the constitution’s aim is to "[prohibit] the publication of nonviolent information in the constitution.
We will continue to put in place such publications that could cause Nigeria to "safe" and without believing other challenges like the disasters such as political disasters, such as political disaster
Section 1c describes how the law will protect, protect, and protect digital devices and digital devices to "protect, protect, and protect digital devices and digital devices to protect digital device
Additionally, there is nothing that the new proposal will not be available online — under the controversy of the constitutional conscientious objection — under the conscientious objection of the
The constitution of the social media usage of social media usage is not all Nigerians, but all Nigerians should be used.
Section 3a to b(i) of the Social Media Act states:
Anyone should not be abandoned by anyone in or after Nigeria to express information that we cannot explain that we cannot explain that we cannot explain that we cannot explain that we cannot explain
The law is an issue of "national security" in the month when the law stopped to protect the freedom of speech freedom.
However, no one can accuse Nigerian government or criticize the government because it is not working.
In Section 3b(vi), speech including “activity or activity, of the country’s government” cannot be available online.
According to Section 3b(v), this is actually done with the expression of the following words: "threatening, speaking to one or another between the brothers and sisters".
This is difficult because it allows officials to use power.
Who does someone say that a speech can cause persecution?
This means that using something or something of politicians can lead to hate themselves.

Online providers must abandon this law or pay thousands of thousands of thousands of naira [$10].
Additionally, the law promises to protect internet providers who will not cause "city or other" incidents that will not cause "city or other" incidents.
The human rights violation is significant because the law allows police to protect police under the law that allows police to protect police under the law.
Section 15a states that police activities during "clear investigations" need to endure internet development.
In final, “there is no opportunity to appeal in the Supreme Court” [Section 13(2)] where anyone can convict anyone without permission.
This is difficult — nobody cannot appeal to a court for defending this loving love that still exists.

Speak, write, write.
The law has been approved for the second time by the National Assembly.
Before law, it must be approved by a lawmakers’ committee. The committee will investigate the results of the lawmakers’ decision.
We should appreciate the decision of the Constitutional Constitution to amend the social media usage.
Because Africa’s largest country will begin a democratic democracy when the freedom of religion will begin with freedom of religion and freedom of religion.

The LMA allows young women over five years old to marry without conscientious objection, without conscientious objection, without conscientious objection, without conscientious objection.
According to her representatives, Gyumi explained that the LMA program gives women more power than women because it gives women more power than women.
Additionally, they concluded that the constitution protected human rights and provided spiritual assistance.
Gyumi appealed to the Supreme Court to appeal the LMA.
The Supreme Court did not do.
However, they found it very clear that the government would not allow the government to change anything in the project.
According to a judiciary representative, the government has allowed the government to seven years of marriage for women and men.
However, the representative responded to the decision and filed an appeal to the Supreme Court:

The video of'speaking speaker'
The International Voices of Yoruba, Mr. Yooba interviewed Mr. Oguntosin through a videoconference campaign through a videoconference campaign.
Oguntosin, a 43-year-old student, explains that he could read more than higher homes after his father in 1997, and he could read more than his father in 1997.
However, as a Yoruba activist, his cultural activity on the identity of Oduduwan people is the most important part of his cultural activity.
As this cultural development is continuing, you don’t want to do what you want.
In 2011, he took three tours, three tours, and three tours.
The brother, Olokun Awopetu, asked him to visit his family in the Farasinmi Region of Agbadarigi (Badagry), the United States.

When I started, the photographer struck my head and showed me as an example of my faith.
Everyday, I have a very good way, moving from one area to other area, and I moving from one area to other area, and I moving from one area to other area, and I moving from one area to other.
For three years, I didn’t know about the footballer, I didn’t know about the footballer, but I didn’t know about the footballer.
In that time, in 2016, I made another trip to the east, met a man, Lamurudu, who told me about the story.
I live on the sun — which will help me — if I go on the sun.
It started to be difficult for the Oguntosian — he is from coming, he is for the Global Voices.
He decided to tell Journalist, the Director of the Circuit Overseer in Port-Novo, who would know how he was killed.

Unusual words in Yoruba: How language changes
Why do you call the bean cake?

There is a relationship between many languages in the world.
For initial, let us look at the words of "restaurant" translation from French to English.
However, this word — what we used from one language to other language without its knowledge — is not necessary.
These languages occur as a result of the meetings of various people across the world, economic, and social.
Due to the interviews between these people, languages, speech and speech have become difficult.
This incident does not affect the Yoruban heritage.
Over 40 thousand Yoruban people speak in Nigeria, with over 40 thousands of people speak in the country.
Let’s see how the word "cup" has been used in Yoruba. Let’s see how the word "cup" has become different.
Phone is called "phone" in phone, "ball" is television, "television" is television, and so much.
These "unusual" words make the Yoruban language strengthened.
Additionally, thousands of thousands of Nigerians in the southern parts of Nigeria have been used by thousands of thousands of people in the northern parts of the country.
The language is used from African language, including words like alubarika ("alubarika"), albarika ("albarika"), albarika ("albarika"), albarika ("albarika"), albarika ("albarika"), albarika ("albari
The most dangerous words in the Yoruban language is how people use them in interviewing international interviews.
We will hear songs like "Help the child take the ball" in English.
Adi, a speech that is unique in the Yoruban language, is unique in Yoruba, and publishers know how they use it.
There is a challenge that Yoruban language has more than the difficult speech that Yoruban musicians use to translate the language.
For example, bean cake — which Yorubans translated to bean cake — especially in interviews with guests.
The use of speech in a simple language causes culture — an unusual — that will contribute to the language — that will contribute to the language — that will contribute to the language.
Today, there is no other name of Japanese sushi — it is sushi.
The Yoruba’s language, their language, their language and culture, will continue to strengthen the country and where they live.
For example, amala is a major food, especially in the mountains, especially in the mountains.
The statement has been used in other languages as Yoruban activists respond to it.
Translating "yam flour" to "yam flour" increases the power — says "Yoruba's ranking."
Looking at the translation of English translation to the English translation "fanimorious", which is currently available in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.
It means “appreciate,” or “appreciate,” which refers to the significance of the Yoruban significance.
This comes with digital and digital relationships: the Yoruban language cannot continue to receive conversation and speech.
Therefore, the entire translation of the English-language translation of the English-language translation of the English-language translation of the English-language translation of the English-langua
However, there is a truth that it is from the Yoruban language. It is for Yorubans.
However, numerous English-language languages used in Nigeria have been added to the translation of the English-language translation.
The majority of Yoruban languages will increase in the development of the language; its use in public media and social media activities.
In the end, this will help the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Democr
Why Google Translator is failing — in translating Yoruba — and other other languages
Many of the translations that the computer uses are not translated.
User of the Nigerian Wikimedia Commons, October 2018, via Wikimedia Commons CC.BY.2.0.
The English language has been considered as the "global language" as a "global language" for international communication.
In February 2020, according to WebTech3, according to WebTech3, according to the WebTech3 report, the global international campaign was published in Germany.
However, as many international people speak internationally on the internet, it has become a campaign for people who speak internationally.
Many technological companies have worked various work on the translation of English-speaking words.
Before the end of February 2020, Google announced that it would introduce five new languages in its Google Translation system, including five new languages.

But have you ever expected to see a translator that explained that it was, also, the best?
Additionally, it took a lot of time, it wasn’t difficult?
There are a lot of questions and difficulties when you use this translation and use it.
Twitter translates Yoruba’s translation to English via Google Translation and its release is now available.
What caused these difficult challenges is more than that technologists have been using their language online because of their language.
These speeches can work for several languages, but two languages, such as Yoruba and Igbo, are two languages in the country.
To address the effects of Google in five years before releasing five new languages, the company spokesman said:
Google translators have continued to translate speech, but if the language does not have a lot of speech that has been translated, the language does not have a lot of speech that has been translated
However, due to our development in technology, and Google Translation experts, recent advances in the translation of technology have been expected.
Additionally, many don’t know how we speak clearly — or speaking clearly — in these languages.
Therefore, the imprisoners who care for these activities are not impossible because there is no way to create these activities because there is no way to create these activities.
Most of the computers have no translation, especially in the cultural translations that have more than one translation.
For example, Yoruba speech about mother and sister has a different translation.
Many devices can translate both words to "queen".
However, when we look at it, it is necessary to say that the translation of mother and sister different: Mother translation of mother and sister different: Mother translation of mother and sister dif
With these innovations, technology has contributed to the development of African languages on the different languages.
African African language has been highlighted by the use of new technologies such as computers and digital devices, such as telephones and digital devices.
This has encouraged us to use these languages.
Due to these new technologies, many African conventions have increased.
For example, the Yoruban language has a variety of technologies such as computers ("air conditioner"), telephones ("telephones"), and television.
However, the Igbo language has words like telephone ("telephone") and vehicle ("vehicle").
These names were created in accordance with their work.
In the Yoruba media and marketing school, students have experienced that television has been used as a result of internet activity.
The creation of the question caused various questions and questions — some students suggested that the video can call the video in the camera.
These technological importance of technology will help development in the language — providing spirit for language stability and science.

In Turkey, a population of over 83 million people (83 million), people have to travel throughout the country.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of thousands of people have been displaced and thousands of thousands of people have been displaced.
On June 26, the Nigerian School Federation (NSF) announced the dates from 25 to 26 June.
But on February 4, Turkish President Recep Erdoğan changed the date from 27 to 28 November.
These changes and these changes have been caused by Turkish people, between city and social media and social media.
How does this day have an impact on the experience of students who are planning for a few months?
How will the principles and legislations of the COVID-19 prevention for COVID-19 prevention measures to be implemented (Collaboration with social media, collaboration with social media, etc.)
In 2019, there were more than five points in the competition, while eight points were more than five points in the competition.
Turkey reported their first COVID-19 pandemic on November 11, when it will be the first time this year.
On November 1, the government announced various services:
The marketplaces such as food carts, internet carts, concentration centers, and wedding halls have been killed for many years.
The visitors now need to continue to wash their hands, and they will continue to care for their safety.
As students appealed to the YKS examination, the government did not respect its opinion:
In the end of November, the campaign began at the end of May...
According to this tweet, we found out in this tweet, with a comment on the immunity of human rights in the social media:
Two million YKS payments alongside all the challenges: Two million students have been displaced
New YKS Recognition: good view
Not only the COVID-19 pandemic was the result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
Since the beginning of November, there have been several questions since the beginning of the elections.
One of her own questions related to “Fırtınadayım, (I’m in the storm), the song of LGBTQ performer Mabel Matiz who was a LGBTQ performer.
The question about the translation of the translation of “Seeing, seeing, seeing is what my mother sees” (what my mother sees).
In a Twitter post, President of the Center for Measurement, Selection and Placement (ÖSYM), a government department that coordinates the affected brothers and sisters.
He said that the investigation would be conducted and all those involved in the investigation would be released.
The 2020 YKS tournament ranged throughout 188 stadiums in the three seasons, with participants in the three seasons.
His results are the results of academic experts across the country.
The investigation of home students and groups in the global schools has become an important challenge.
Workers who are interested will be evacuated from the relief process.
For some Twitter users, this decision is unjust:
[Oke] OSYM President speaks for the first time after visit!
"The investigation has been developed to identify the situation and those involved will be recognized.
[An experience] Not only a president who has not read it all the time, a president who has not read it all the time so that his head will continue.
The group of journalists also explained the decision and organization of such questions:
During the #YKS2020 campaign this year, you have never seen anyone explaining these young girls who were described as an activist.
(A person who calls "We are politicians" and criticizes that "We are politicians"
What do you try to do?
Twitter users’ opinions are different than what others relate to Mabel Matiz’s success and how she was in the past.
Hi members of the investigation committee. I want to see the stories of Mabel Matiz.
Because we have no other culture that has used our culture in many years.
That’s why mabelmatiz is our persecution.
Netizens online say that torturing a musician that is an activist, politicians will kill the politicians and politicians will kill the politicians and politicians.
None of the attackers have been convicted, but Mabel Matiz’s investigations are considered as an expert.
These are the following:
You say "security protects our lives" but Mabel Matiz is the only publisher who published our culture.
We need to investigate those who killed Mabel Matiz and suffered her. #MabelMatizisnotalone [Original post]
Mabel Matiz's response to the case
On November 3, as the game continues, Matiz returned to the voice:
Thank you:) I am happy that my music is used for such special events like this.
Now, it’s so difficult for me that my life has become just what we are talking about.
Look at what happened to me...how someone came out with my name with my name...how someone came out with my name...how someone came out with my name...how someone came out with my name with my name.
It’s not difficult, the life is not end:)
The sister has also been arrested.
I read a lot of publications before me.
What I wanted to say in the song, I knew that it was the same and myself.
I will continue to sing the music, to share stories and to be a national citizen.
Continue to meet on another occasion...
Matiz is also confident: after Aygun speaking to the television, he won two medals in a competition through Aygun.
She won two prizes in two groups, “The most strongest song” and “The most strongest man” awards, “The most strongest man” and “The most strongest man”.
This indicates that many people were after him against the government and other journalists who have been criticized by the government and other journalists who have been criticized by the government
On November 5, Mabel Matix also tweeted:
I won the awards "the most important music video" and “the most important musician” and “the most important musician”.
