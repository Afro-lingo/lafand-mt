Some residents of the Effia-Kwesimintsim Municipality and the Sekondi Takoradi Metropolis have expressed fears over what they say is the increasing spate of robberies in the area.
It follows the mob arrest of two out of three suspected robbers at Tanokrom, a suburb of the Effia-Kwesimintsim Municipality after the suspects on a speeding motorbike snatched a bag containing an undisclosed amount of money from a lady around the ‘God is Love chop bar’ area.
Luck, however, eluded them after they were given a hot chase and later apprehended close to the Takoradi Mall but one managed to escape in the process and is currently at large.
Bystanders who witnessed the incident reportedky handed the robbers severe beatings before they were handed over to the police. The victim was lucky to have had been given her valuables.
Last weekend, residents of Anaji SSNIT flats had to sacrifice their sleep as a gang of motor riders took over the area to display their riding skills till the morning.
Again on Monday morning June 21, three suspects on a motorbike were captured on CCTV camera attempting to break into a popular pub at Anaji Westline Back in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis. The Assemblymember of the Amanful West electoral and Takoradi Constituency Chairman of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) Prince Kojo Arthur has for the umpteenth time complained about how the riders are endangering the lives of people.
He said several reports to the police about the criminal activities of the motor riders have all not received favorable responses.
Nelson Roland, a robbery victim sharing his ordeal said a motor rider rammed into his back bumper while in traffic and when he decided to step outside the car to check the extent of damage, he returned to realize his iPhone 12 and other valuables on the front seat of his car had been stolen within a spate of two minutes.
Some market women and traders at the Koforidua Central market who were customers of defunct Fanteakwa Rural Bank have resurfaced with fresh agitations over their locked-up savings.
The agitating victims have called on President Akufo-Addo and the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin as well as the Bank of Ghana to help them retrieve their monies.
Fanteakwa Rural Bank owned by the incumbent MP for Fanteakwa North Amankwah Asiamah was established in the year 2004 but collapsed in 2012.
The Bank had its headquarters at Begoro and branches in Koforidua, Osiem, Suhum, Anyinam, and other parts of the region.
It is estimated that over 1,000 customers had their funds locked up.
The victims are mostly farmers, traders, drivers, teachers, fetish priests, small-scale miners, and small-scale enterprises.
The locked-up funds unleashed hardship on the victims some of whom died as a result while affected small scale enterprises collapsed
Most of the customers had between five hundred Ghana cedis (GHS500.00) and twenty-seven thousand Ghana cedis (GHS27,000.00) locked up in the collapsed bank.
Many demonstrations were staged particularly before the 2016 election by the victims to exert pressure on the then Opposition lawmaker to refund their locked-up fund. Some victims received their funds but many others have still not received theirs.
Addressing the media in Koforidua, the aggrieved victims, numbering about twenty (20), chastised the lawmaker for failing to initiate plans of paying back customers.
According to them, several attempts to get their funds refunded have proven futile as they accused the MP of even failing to respond to their calls.
A 72-year old trader Elizabeth Amoah, narrating her ordeal to the media, revealed the MP promised to refund her money after the 2020 general elections but has since refused to even respond to her calls.
“I went to Begoro during the 2020 campaign season to demand my money but the MP apologized to me and promised to pay it soon after the election is over. It is sad to inform you that, the MP has not been picking my calls since after the elections, which he won,” she lamented.
She added “how can I be defrauded by an MP of my GHC12,000.000 after so many years of savings and be walking freely as a lawmaker. I am appealing to President Akufo-Addo and the Speaker to speak to Amankwah Asiamah to refund my money or we shall gather ourselves at the Jubilee House and Parliament to demand our money”.
Another victim stated “we are pleading with President Akufo Addo and the speaker, Kennedy Agyapong to intervene I am a strong NPP supporter but this MP is treating us bad. During the 2020 election I went to Begoro with my daughter to see the MP he snubbed us, I cried why should we be treated like this ”
Several other traders shared their harrowing situation including collapsed marriages as a result of hardship the locked-up funds brought upon them.
The Member of Parliament for Fanteakwa North Amankwah Asiamah who was the Chief Executive Officer of the collapsed Bank declined to comment on the latest agitations
But had earlier denied loaning deposits of the victims to sponsor Nana Akufo Addo’s campaign as alleged in 2012, hence the collapse as is peddled.
According to the MP, it is also incorrect that the bank owes over 1,000 customers explaining that his outfit managed to refund deposits of the majority of the customers.
The former Ranking Member for the Mines and Energy Committee of Parliament, Adam Mutawkilu has taunted Ghana’s Attorney General over the $170 million judgment debt case saying he would have won if the case was tried in Ghana.
According to him, the AG would have resorted to means and ways to win the case.
“We looked at it meticulously and realized that it has met all the conditions and parliament approval was condition precedent. So for me, there was no need for government to have canceled the project. No! And they know that when it goes anywhere in the world, government will lose. Then probably they thought it will be handled in Ghana. Maybe they can flex their muscles to find their way out,” the former lawmaker told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Thursday.
The Attorney General has however blamed the erstwhile Mahama administration for the situation.
Background to the arbitration
The International Court of Arbitration in January 2021 awarded a cost of $134 million and an interest of $30 million against the Government of Ghana over the cancellation of an Emergency Power Agreement with GCGP limited.
The Contract was cancelled under the former Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko as part of several other energy contracts cancelled by the NPP on the basis that the country did not need those power agreements.
The ruling by the International Court of Arbitration ordered the government to Ghana to pay to “GPGC the full value of the Early Termination Payment, together with Mobilization, Demobilization and preservation and maintenance costs in the amount of US$ 134,348,661, together also with interest thereon from 12 November 2018 until the date of payment, accruing daily and compounded monthly, at the rate of LIBOR for six-month US dollar deposits plus six per cent(6%).”
The Government of Ghana was also to pay GPGC an amount of “US$ 309,877.74 in respect of the Costs of the Arbitration, together with US$ 3,000,000 in respect of GPGC’s legal representation and the fees and expenses of its expert witness, together with interest on the aggregate amount of US$ 3,309,877.74 at the rate of LIBOR for three-month US dollar deposits, compounded quarterly.”
Residents in the Ajumako Ochiso Community of the Central region are excited beyond measure as a mammoth quantity of fish has appeared in their river [Ochi], which used to be just a source of drinking water for them.
This happened after Thursday dawn’s downpour. According to the residents, the mystery was a blessing from the gods.
Leaders in the community poured libations and opened up for inhabitants to apportion the bounty and take it home.
Speaking to Kasapa FM’s central regional correspondent Yaw Boagyan, Wofa Yaw Obosu who used to work at the bank of the river narrated that this has never happened since he came into the area and he also believes it’s a blessing for the community.
According to him, they will send some of the fishes to the market for sale. “Since the fishes appeared at the river bank, I have been able to employ over twenty youth to work for me to process for sale at the Mankessim, Kasoa, markets.”
“This is beyond my understanding since something of this nature has never happened in the Ajumako Ochiso Community.”
Meanwhile, some of the residents who came went the scene also appealed to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture to come and assist them in terms of providing them with tricycles to be able to transport the fishes to the market.
“We don’t have job to do in the Ajumako Ochiso Community here so this will enable us to be employed to get money to take care of our children’s education and household. We are therefore calling on authorities to come and assist us to address the challenges we are facing in the Ajumako Ochiso Community as regards employment,” a resident appealed.
The Assembly Member of the Ajumako Ochiso South Maxwell Mensah also appealed to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture and other government to assist the community members in terms of providing logistics to be able to fish for more fishes in the river for the youth to be employed.
The Executive Director for the Institute of Energy Security, Nana Amoasi VII, has taken a swipe at the Attorney General, Godfred Dame, describing him as negligent for his failure to defend Ghana on the $170 million judgment debt awarded to power company, The Ghana Power Generation Company (GCGP).
In an interview on the Morning Starr on Thursday, Nana Amoasi VII called on the Attorney General to account to Ghanaians why he failed to appeal the $170 million judgment debt in time.
“We had an opportunity to go and appeal against the decision and we chose to use Covid-19 and election as excuses. The Attorney General was negligent as well. He didn’t act well. He could have defended us better so we should look into it.”
His comments come after the Commercial Court in London rejected a late appeal from Ghana against a judgement debt award of US$170 million in favour of power contractor, The Ghana Power Generation Company (GCGP).
According to the London Court, the government of Ghana failed to apply and set aside the January 26, 2021 decision of the London-based United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Tribunal.
The court in a ruling on Wednesday, June 8, refused to grant the government of Ghana an extension to apply to set aside the award – adding that the state’s grounds for challenging it were “intrinsically weak”.
The government through its lawyer Godfred Dame had attempted to hide behind the 2020 general election and the COVID-19 pandemic as excuses for the delay, but their excuses were dismissed by the London court.
GPGC was represented before the court by Charles Kimmins QC and Mark Tushingham, where Ghana was said to have been too late to challenge the decision against it.
Ghana had used Khawar Qureshi QC of Serle Court and Volterra Fietta, having initially retained Omnia Strategy. In the arbitration, GPGC, used Three Crowns and Ghanaian firm, Kimathi & Partners, along with damages experts from FTI Consulting.
Ghana also had representation from the attorney general’s office and Amofa & Partners in Accra.
The three-member arbitration tribunal chaired by John Beechey, a former President of the International Criminal Court’s Court of Arbitration, and co-chaired by Prof Albert Fiadjoe, a Ghanaian academic, sided with the power producer and awarded almost US$170 million, including interest.
Out of the total, U$134.35 million represents the early termination payment claim, which itself is made up of US $69.36 million as an early termination fee, US$58.49 million for mobilisation costs, US$6.46 million as demobilisation cost and US$32,448 as preservation and maintenance cost.
The tribunal also awarded US$614,353.86 against the country as the cost of the tribunal, and costs of US$3 million against Ghana, being the legal fees expended by the GPGC during the arbitration.
Major highlights of the tribunal’s decision included the fact that the Ahenkora Committee which recommended the termination of the contract did not have sufficient ground in coming to the conclusion that the GPGC was entitled to only $US18 million in early termination fees.
The tribunal, in dismissing Ghana’s case, delved into the basis for terminating the contract, stating that the evidence before it indicated that “GPGC did have a building permit for the Blue Ocean Site issued by the Kpone-Katamanso District Assembly on August 15, 2017.”
“GoG [The government] has not been able to adduce any statute or regulation, including the Energy Commission Act, which addresses the requirement for any such additional construction permit,” the Tribunal ruled.
“On the basis of the record as it now stands, it is apparent that even as Dr. Ahenkorah [Energy Commission Executive Secretary at the time] was putting up further hurdles over which he required GPGC to jump in pursuit of its provisional generation license in November 2017, the Minister of Energy was about to seek the approval of the Ghanaian Parliament of a decision to terminate the EPA along with a number of other PPAs, based upon the Report of the PPA Committee chaired by Dr. Ahenkorah,” it said.
Under British law, the government had 28 days to challenge the tribunal’s decision. However, it went to sleep only to appear in court three days to the expiry of the deadline to ask for an extension.
Omnia Strategy, a British law firm, made the case for extension and asked for 56 days—twice the allowed grace period.
However, the court set March 8, 2021, for the Government to file the processes to challenge the Tribunal’s decision in January. But again, the government took a long nap until April 1, 2021, before filing. This time, another British law firm, Volterra Fietta, had instructions from the government to begin the process.
The law firm, which tagged itself as the only dedicated public international law firm in the world, explained that the new Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame, had only been sworn in on March 5, and the firm received the directive to represent Ghana 10 days later.
But ruling on the matter on June 8, 2021, the court had no sympathies. It said the excuses were unreasonable and “intrinsically weak.”
The presiding judge, Justice Butcher did not hold back.
The judge said the government’s delay was “significant and substantial” as its request for a second extension had come 38 days after the statutory deadline and 27 days after the first extension expired, the Global Arbitration Review (GAR) reported.
He noted that the large sum of money involved in the arbitration was not enough grounds for the appeal to take as long as it did.
“The fact that the Attorney General had not been sworn until March 5 did not mean the government was unable to act in the meantime, the judge said.

A baby has been reportedly washed away in Sawaba in Kumasi following the Wednesday evening rains in the Ashanti regional capital.
The baby was traveling with his parents in a tricycle when they got stuck in a flood causing the tricycle to tip over.
Residents in the community, according to reports, moved in to save the parents but could not find the baby as he was washed away by the flood.
“The body of the baby who was washed away hasn’t been found. The parents are not taking it easy at all. When it rains, it’s difficult to use the Sawaba road. The gutters become flooded so we don’t know why the tricycle rider tried using the road that led to the death of the 1-yr-old baby,” a resident told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Thursday.
Other reports also say the convoy of President Akufo-Addo which was returning from the Upper East region got stuck in the flood.
A suspected notorious armed robber, Iddrisu Adams alias Koomi, who was arrested by the Ashanti Regional Police Command in connection with a series of robberies has been shot by Police in a bid to stop him from escaping lawful custody.
The suspect was on the wanted list of the command and was arrested on 22nd June 2021 through a special police operation.
On 23rd June 2021, he was being escorted to places named by him as hide-outs of his accomplices when he attempted to escape. The police responded swiftly by shooting him.
The suspect was taken to the St. Martins Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
A release by the police stated that they are on the lookout for his accomplices who are advised to surrender by reporting to the nearest Police Station.
The Police also assured the public of their commitment to prevent and fight crime and called on the public for cooperation.
The Minister for National Security Albert Kan Dapaah has revealed details surrounding the forceful eviction of former Ashanti Regional Security Coordinator DCOP Opare-Addo (rtd) from office by some National Security operatives.
According to Kan Dapaah, the move became necessary after several attempts to get the security Coordinator to vacate post after the termination of his appointment proved futile.
The ejected coordinator told Starr News he was evicted by members of NPP affiliated vigilante group, Delta Force, who assaulted him in the process for failing to do their bidding in the region.
But answering questions from South Dayi MP Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpo, the national security minister explained the men dispatched were national security operatives.
He, however, refused to disclose reasons for the termination of the appointment of Mr. Opare-Addo insisting the use of force was necessary under the circumstances.
“He [Opare-Addo] was on a three-year contract to serve as the Ashanti regional security liaison officer after the expiration of an initial two-year contract which began on January 5th, 2018. His new appointment took effect from January 1, 2020, and was to expire on December 31, 2022.”
“However, his appointment was terminated on February 19, 2021, by the national security coordinator. Upon the termination of his contract, DCOP Opare-Addo was paid his entitlements as per his appointment letter. Subsequent to the termination of the appointment, the ministry appointed Col Francis Arthur (rtd) as the new Ashanti regional security liaison officer. The colonel’s appointment took effect from 1st May 2021. But he [Opare-Addo] refused to hand over to Colonel Francis Arthur. He then declined numerous invitations from the national security coordinator to explain his refusal to vacate the office.”
Mr Dapaah further explained “Meanwhile, his continuous stay in office obstructed the work of the new regional security liaison officer. Against this backdrop, personnel from the ministry of national security were on 11th May 2021 dispatched to the Ashanti region to ascertain the reason for DCOP Opare Addo’s refusal to vacate his office. And if it became necessary to change the locks of the door to his office. On arrival, the personnel duly introduced themselves but were met with acts of hostility from DCOP Opare-Addo, including drawing his sidearm. The personnel managed to persuade him and retrieved the sidearm.”
He added “till date, no official complaint has been made by DCOP Opare-Addo either to his immediate boss the national security coordinator or to me as the sector minister regarding the alleged assault on him. Neither has the minister of national security received any correspondence from the police in relation to the allegations.”
“I will want to assure the house of our willingness to investigate the incident should any official complaint be made by DCOP Opare-Addo.”

The Government has moved to avert attacks from Burkinabe bandits in Ghana as it announces the construction of permanent barracks in Bawku to enhance security in that part of the country
The announcement made by President Akufo-Addo comes just a week after security agencies were put on high alert to fore-planned attacks by bandits from Burkina Faso.
He was speaking at a meeting with the Bawku Naba to end his tour of the Upper-East region.
“The proximity of your region to Burkina Faso makes it an obvious potential target for these murderers and criminals who want to destabilize and terrorize our lives in Ghana.”
He went on”Bawku Naba, you are aware of the measures that the government is taking to strengthen the security agencies here and protect us from terrorist attacks emanating from Burkina Faso.
“And I’m happy to inform you that a permanent baracks is going to be established here in this area to be able to address the issue of terrorism.”
Meanwhile, the Bawku Naba, who is also President of the Kusaug Traditional Council, Asigiri Abugrago Azoka II, said the Chiefs and People of the Kusaug Traditional Area, and, indeed, all Ghanaians appreciate the policies of the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
Congratulating President Akufo-Addo on his electoral victory, “which has put the destiny of Ghana firmly in your hands for the next four (4) years”, the Bawku Naba told the President that “you have worked hard to earn that enviable position. I wish you God’s continued blessing in wisdom as well as good health to execute your policies.”
A survey conducted by Child Rights International has revealed that 55% out of 11, 288 children between the ages of 12 and 17 sampled want to leave Ghana for greener pastures abroad.
Eleven percent said they were not certain about staying or leaving the country.
“55% of the respondents say they wish to migrate to another country, while 11% would either stay in the country or leave. A majority of the respondents cited greener pastures, education and better standard of living as reasons why they would leave the country when there is a chance,” the survey said.
On whether they are optimistic in the future of the nation, the survey said: “Nearly 80% of the respondents say they are optimistic about Ghana in the next 20 years. More than two in ten (22%) see the country’s future as bleak”.On Education and opportunities, the survey said: “Over half of the children (53%) say they are optimistic. 47% of the respondents paint a bleak picture as to how the country’s current educational system would help them find jobs in the next 20 years”.
Some youth groups in the Ashanti region have threatened to shut down branches of the Lighthouse Chapel International in the region over a critical sermon delivered by the leader of the church Bishop Dag Heward-Mills which appeared to attack the Ashanti Monarch Otumfuo Osei Tutu.
The said sermon, which has found its way onto social media, is said to be questioning the impact of the influential king on his subjects and community.
According to the group, the popular televangelist has slighted the revered traditional leader and must go beyond an apology to atone for his sins.
“We are calling on Bishop Dag to seek wise counsel within 48 hours. Otherwise, none of his churches in the Asanteman enclave will be allowed to operate. Also, we are warning all and sundry who hide behind religion and politics to push this evil agenda against Asanteman and his royal majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu. We will let them know that we will meet them up with brute force” the General Secretary of one of the groups Kwabena Frimpong said.
Bishop Dag Heward-Mills has however apologised over the sermon.
In an apology, the Preacher said: “I am deeply saddened that a message I shared at a conference, nearly 20 years ago, has been taken out of its context and circulated by persons who have previously declared that they will maliciously cause our churches in Kumasi to be closed down.
“I wish to apologize to His Majesty Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II for any disrespect, insult or harm caused him or his royal court. Please accept my profound apologies for the statements I made”.
The National Democratic Congress has slammed Chief Justice Kwasi Anin-Yeboah, describing his petition to the General Legal Council against lawmaker, Dominic Ayine, as an attempt to suppress free speech.
Dr Ayine is reported to have said the Supreme Court failed to apply the rules of procedure during the trial. He is also believed to have raised concerns over the regular dismissal of the petitioners’ applications during the case.
He made the comments at an event organised by the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD) and the KNUST.
The petition by the Chief Justice urged the GLC to probe the lawmaker over the comments and apply the necessary sanctions.
Addressing a Press Conference on Monday, the General Secretary of the NDC, Johnson Asiedu Nketia called on the Chief Justice to immediately the petition against the MP for Bolgatanga East.
“Public confidence in the judiciary must be earned and not forced on us. How many times have you heard any court telling anybody that I’m going to give a judgment but I’m warning you not to talk about it?” Mr Asiedu Nketia popularly known as General Mosquito said.
He added that “The judiciary, like parliament or executive, is not above criticism…Our laws and constitution protect the integrity and independence of the judiciary and not the sensibility of a judge. The notion that the judicial arm of gov’t is beyond reproach is a fantasy that can’t be sustained.”
Mr Asiedu Nketia also accused the Chief Justice of targeting NDC affiliated lawyers and called on him to stop the witch-hunt.
“It’s no coincidence that virtually all the lawyers who have been reported to the disciplinary committee of the General Legal council by the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah in recent times are aligned to the NDC. What is the Chief Justice’s personal interest in the punishment of NDC affiliated lawyers that his he’s so keen to initiate unwarranted actions against them”
Ghana has been ranked the second most peaceful country in Africa behind Mauritius in the 2021 Global Peace Index report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP).
The Global Peace Index is the world’s leading measure of global peacefulness. The index ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their level of peacefulness. This report presents the most comprehensive data-driven analysis to date on trends in peace, its economic value, and how to develop peaceful societies.
In the latest rankings, Ghana ranked 38th in the world out of a total of 163 countries reviewed. Ghana scored 1.715 which represents a two-point move upwards from the country’s previous position.
Mauritius, the most peaceful country in Africa ranked 28th globally, while Botswana ranked third place in Africa and 41st in the world. Nigeria ranked 146 globally behind Togo, Uganda, Kenya, The Republic of Congo and Cameroon.
Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Denmark, Portugal, and Slovenia.
Afghanistan is the least peaceful country in the world for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Iraq. Burkina Faso recorded the largest deterioration in the Global Peace Index 2021.
According to the report, half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had a recent experience of violence. Those living in Namibia had the highest experience of violence in the world at 6 per cent.
South Sudan remains the least peaceful country in the region and one of the least peaceful countries in the world, despite an improvement in peacefulness in the 2021 index.
The largest deterioration in peacefulness in the region occurred in Burkina Faso. This was also the single largest deterioration of any country. The government’s decision to fund and arm civilian auxiliary groups in its fight against insurgents drove the plunge.
The report highlighted that civil unrest rose 10 per cent globally, driven by the coronavirus pandemic. There were 14,871 violent demonstrations, protests and riots recorded globally in 2020.
The report said Covid was a “multiplying force” in future political instability and civil unrest. It added the level of this unrest going forward is likely to hinge on the speed and effectiveness of economic recovery. Countries with less debt and higher levels of positive peace were more likely to recover faster.
Despite this, overall three-quarters of people globally feel as safe or safer today than they did five years ago. Some indicators of violence have recorded significant improvements since the start of the index, and 123 countries have seen murder rates fall since 2008.
The Index also revealed that “the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.07 per cent in the 2021 Global Peace Index. Although a relatively small deterioration, this is the ninth time in the last 13 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated”.
The report added that “in the past year, 87 countries recorded an improvement in peacefulness, while 73 countries recorded a deterioration. Three countries recorded no change in their overall score. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world’s least peaceful region. It is home to three of the five least peaceful countries in the world. However, it recorded the largest regional improvement over the past year”.
“Europe…remains the most peaceful region in the world. The region is home to eight of the ten most peaceful countries, and no country in Europe is ranked outside the top half of the index”.
President-elect Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has assured Ghanaians that they will see an improvement in the standard of living under his presidency.
According to him, the next four years must have a positive impact on the life of the ordinary Ghanaian.
“I am extremely concerned, that the next four years will see a marked improvement in the living standards of the people of Ghana,” the president-elect made the comments during his official tour to Nigeria after he won the presidential elections.
Mr. Akufo-Addo addressing the Governor of the Imo State in Nigeria Owelle Rochas Anayo Okorocha, Monday added: “the Ghanaian economy has taken a hit in these last three or four years but we believe with discipline, with hard work and correct set of policies we should be able to bring the country back to prosperity.”
The president-elect who beat Incumbent President, John Dramani Mahama in the just ended presidential election is on a three-day visit to Nigeria where he will have discussions with the oil producing country’s leader, Muhammudu Buhari.
Mr. Akufo-Addo also assured the Imo State governor that relationship between the two West African countries will be strengthened under his presidency.
“We value the historic relationship between the two countries. It is important that such links are established between our people and our leaders. They give confidence to our populations that we are working to try and resolve their problems and help them progress with their lives…the stronger the relationship between the two countries is, the better it is for the West Africa Region and the continent large,” he added.
President John Dramani Mahama has confirmed Joseph Whittal as the new Commissioner for the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ).
Mr. Whittal was sworn-in at a short ceremony at the Flagstaff House Tuesday afternoon.
Mr. Whittal has been acting as the head for CHRAJ since the former commissioner, Lauretta Vivian Lamptey was removed by the President after causing financial loss to the state.
The President has appointed Ms. Josephine Nkrumah as the substantive head of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE).
Ms. Nkrumah who was a deputy chairman for the commission replaces Mrs. Charlotte Osei, wdho was as the head of the country’s Electoral Commission by the President in July last year.
The appointments come few weeks after the President lost the presidential election to opposition NPP leader Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
The president-elect will be sworn-in on January 7, 2017.
GN Health Insurance Company Ltd, one of the 75 companies of Groupe Nduom has begun operating Ambulance Services in Ghana.
It is expected to among other tasks offer emergency medical service and administer emergency care to those with acute medical problems.
The GN Health Ambulance Service shall also provide a 24-hour response to medical and trauma related emergencies and interventions.
The chairman of GN Health Issah Adam noted “once again the President and CEO of Groupe Nduom, Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom, as well as the Senior Vice President, Mrs Yvonne Nduom and all the Directors are once more setting the pace in terms of providing improved welfare services to employees of the Group”.
He told the gathering of health professionals “this marks yet another milestone in the annals of Groupe Nduom. In addition to providing free medical services, they are adding this Ambulance Service to complete the bouquet of Medical Services for the benefit of employees of the group in Greater Accra and Central Regions”.
Over 60% of deaths in Ghana, according to available statistics, are as a result of unavailable ambulance service to transport women in labour and accident victims to the appropriate medical facility. Experts believe the conditions leading to deaths can be addressed by appropriate and timely emergency care like what GN Health Ambulance Service seeks to achieve.
“GN Health will make sure that we have well trained EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) and Ambulance Drivers who are well trained and know exactly what to do in emergency situations.
“The Ford 350 ambulances, are well equipped with modern equipment and consumables needed for emergency situations and pre-hospital care to patients. Please take note that these are not just ambulances to provide transport services that cannot provide proper pre-hospital care,” he added.
The Ambulances have a more robust set of equipment for pre-hospital care. They are equipped with tools necessary for multiple types of emergencies, from respiratory assistance machines and defibrillators to items as simple as bandages and disinfectant solution.
Government has promised to absorb the costs of treatment for injured victims of Thursday’s gas explosion at La.
Six people have been confirmed dead in the gas explosion that occurred near the Trade Fair Centre in Accra while over 20 people have sustained various degrees of injuries.
The Health Minister Alex Segbefia visiting victims at the La General, Police and 37 Military hospitals where some of the victims were receiving treatment, commended medical officers for their professionalism in caring for the victims.
“The president has indicated clearly that all the costs of the burn victims from this incident will be covered by the state, so we’ve made it clear to the management and the Brigadier General-in-charge, the commandant, that they should quickly put together all the logistics and costs of caring for these patients.
“As you know with burn victims, there is the need to constantly wash, constantly change dressing, and put them on antibiotics and very strong pain killers, so there is for each patient a cost. You have to bring in extra staff to actually deal with it and this has been done in a very military-type fashion in this hospital,” he stated.
Meanwhile, President John Dramani Mahama has called on Ghanaians to pray for victims of Thursday’s gas explosion.
In a Facebook post Friday, the outgoing president took to his Facebook wall to console the victims.
“My condolences to families of the victims of yesterday’s gas explosion; let’s continue to pray for the injured.”
A gas station near the Ghana International Trade Fair Centre in Accra has exploded with five people burnt to death.
The fire, according to an eyewitness also affected parts of the national exhibition and trade centre.
According to Veronica Koomson, an ambulance and fire tenders at the scene managed to fight the intense blaze which has sent people running helter-skelter.
“The fire is blazing and we are doing everything possible to quench it. The Armed Forces fire fighters are here too and doing everything possible to ensure this fire is actually extinguished,” the spokesperson of the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) Prince Billy-Anaglatey told Starr News’ Kemini Amanor on Thursday.
Koomson said another gas station which is situated near the burning one is likely to go up in flames if the fire fighters do not put up measures to salvage the situation.
However, Billy-Anaglatey said he cannot confirm any casualty, adding “our concern now is to confine the fire” so it does not catch up with the other.”
The cause of the explosion is not known. There is total blackout at the area as electricity cables also caught fire in the melee.
One person has died in a ghastly accident which occurred last night at Ekumfi Akoti in the Ekumfi district of the Central region.
The deceased, a Nigerian, lost his life when the truck he was driving veered off the road and caught fire.
The truck which was loaded with Cola was on its way to Nigeria from Mankessim.
According to eyewitnesses, the vehicle veered into a nearby bush when the deceased lost control.
However, bystanders managed to save two other passengers who were in the vehicle before it caught fire, and burnt the driver to death on the spot.
The two are currently receiving treatment at the Cape Coast regional hospital.
Officers of the Ghana Fire Service later arrived at the scene to control the inferno.
The accident brings to two, the number of terrible accidents that have occurred in the area over the last two weeks.
A fortnight ago, 15 people died on the same stretch of road in a crash between a Yutong bus and a Sprinter.
Some chiefs in the Ga traditional area have given the Gbese mantse, Nii Ayibonte, a seven-day ultimatum to relinquish his throne.
The Chiefs are angry with the Gbese Chief over claims he made prior to the 2016 general elections.
Nii Ayibonte promised to abdicate his throne if president John Mahama loses the presidential election.
Nii Ayibonte told his subjects before the election that he had no doubt Mahama would win the election based on the numerous infrastructural projects.
But luck eluded the former Chairman of Accra Hearts of Oak after he gambled with his seat.
Nii Ayibonte has not whispered a word about what he intends to do after the massive victory of Nana Akufo-Addo.
The Ga Chiefs who are demanding he abdicates his throne have also pricked old wounds. They are also challenging his eligibility as the Gbese chief.
Two women were killed and more than 12 others injured, after a car lost control on the abandoned Daboya- Busunu road in the Northern region and rammed into a gutter Tuesday evening, police have confirmed.
The car, a mini van had 14 passengers who were being transported to Daboya from Sawla to attend an Islamic wedding ceremony.
The West Gonja district police commander ASP Seidu Wemeh said the car with registration number AS 2304-15 upon reaching a community near Daboya suddenly veered off the road and summer saulted into a gutter killing the two instantly .
The deceased were female adults between the ages of 42- 45 respectively.
It is still undetermined what caused the crash but according to ASP Seidu, police will technically investigate the mental state of the driver and whether alcohol was involved.
He added most of the injured were transported to the regional hospital in Tamale with only one being treated at Damongo.
Accident on the Daboya-Busunu road are uncommon despite its bad nature.
Community members have denied the report saying this is the first time in the year an accident is recorded on the neglected road.
They say most accidents go unreported.
The Minister of Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has said the Government is working towards boosting Ghana's industrialisation with clean and reliable energy systems, such as nuclear and renewables.
He said there was a growing consensus that nuclear energy had an important role in decarbonising electricity generation for accelerated industrial development.
“While renewable energy sources are expected to continue to grow significantly, nuclear power, an important part of today’s clear energy, is also the largest source of lower-carbon electricity generation in advanced economies, providing approximately 40 percent of all low carbon generations,” he said.
He referred to an International Energy Agency report on clean energy system asserting that without nuclear investment, achieving a sustainable energy system would be much harder with implications to emissions, cost and energy security.
Dr Opoku Prempeh stated this, in a speech read on his behalf, at a Stakeholders Forum on Ghana’s Nuclear Power Programme in Accra.
Under the theme: “Nuclear Energy Innovations: The Future Technologies for Clean Energy and how to drive deep decarbonisation of Ghana’s power sector", the forum was organised by the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), in collaboration with Nuclear Power Ghana (NPG).
Dr Opoku Prempeh noted that turning to clean energy systems for electricity generation would also decarbonise other areas, such as transportation, and other environmental pollution activities.
"Within Ghana’s power generation side, issues on consistent demand growth, high tariff for industries, affordability, reliability, and resilience criteria have brought to the fore the issue of an alternative base-load power," he stated.
Considering the facts available on the country's energy needs, capacity, cost and other related issues, nuclear energy, he said, could provide that alternative clean base-load power.
“A new nuclear power station does not only generate reliable low carbon electricity but also provides wider social-economic benefits both during its development, construction and the subsequent 60 years that the plant would be in operation.”
He recalled that in 2007, former President John Agyekum Kufuor set up a committee, chaired by Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe, to explore the possibility of Ghana using nuclear energy as an alternative based-load source of power.
This was around the time that Ghana was faced with supply power challenges.
To sustain the natural progression of the country’s technological energy advancement, he noted, subsequent governments had supported this effort to improve the country’s energy security to provide leadership and resources to facilitate the nuclear power programme.
This has given birth to the NPG to become the owner/operator of Ghana’s first nuclear power plant.
He said the NPG Board, under the chairmanship of Mr Fred Oware, was focused on providing relevant resources to build a strong safety culture and resilience management systems that adhered to standards in the planning and development of nuclear infrastructure and related activities across the country.
In addition to electricity generation, nuclear energy, the Minister said, could provide solutions to an even wider range of applications - those innovative nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors would complement existing large reactors to enable deep decarbonization as part of the clean energy transition.
"Nuclear technologies are equally improving people’s lives in many other ways and are supporting sustainable developments," he said.
"Medical, industry and agriculture applications of nuclear technology are in use all over the world, including Ghana.
The affixing of tax stamps on alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages has grown exponentially since its introduction about four years ago.
From an initial 28.5 million tax stams affixed in 2018, the number increased to 38.5 million the following year and 70.2 million in 2020, with managers of the project projecting to affix some 90 million stamps in 2021.
The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) said it was also engaging the Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) and local manufacturers to pay for the affixing of the stamps on their beverage products at the stamping facilities.
The Ghanaian printing company, Buck Press, and its partner, DelaRue, a British security printing company, are responsible for printing the tax stamps on behalf of the GRA, while Streamline Resources, which is located at the Tema Port, assists companies without the technical capacity to fix the stamps on individual products.
The Project Manager of Excise Tax Stamp at the GRA, Mr Kwabena Apau Awuah Anto, who disclosed this, said the move would reduce the incidence of product fraud and piracy, where importers and manufacturers applied for the stamps for specific products but affixed them on pirated products that had no approval and safety certification from the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA).
Speaking during a tour of the tax stamp facilities at the Tema Port by a team from the Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) last Thursday, Mr Anto noted that the Commissioner General of the GRA had already granted authorisation to some 34 large importers and manufacturers, including Guinness Ghana Limited and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, to undertake the affixing of the stamps at their factories at their own cost.
The GGCL team, which was led by the Managing Director, Mr Ato Afful, included the Editor of the Daily Graphic, Mr Kobby Asmah; the Director, Marketing, Mr Franklin Sowa, and the Editor of The Mirror, Ms Doreen Hammond.
The team was in Tema to have firsthand appreciation of progress of the excise tax stamp policy and also explore collaboration with the GRA on how to further advance the initiative.
Mr Anto said the excise stamp policy would reduce product fraud and ensure that only wholesome products were allowed into the market space to ensure public health and safety..
Similarly, he said, the policy would ensure revenue assurance and further level the playing field for importers and manufacturers to compete fairly on the market through the payment of appropriate taxes.
Mr Anto said: “What we do here at the Tema facilities and 13 other stations across the country where we have affixing facilities is at no cost to importers.”
Operating the facilities, he said, came with headline costs such as the procurement of the stamps, utility, labour, operational cost and materials such as shrink wraps
He indicated that when the project took off in 2018, the government decided to give a six-month window to supply the stamps for free, but that had continued till date, hence the Commissioner General's directive for the stakeholders to be engaged and sensitised to the need for them to pay.
The engagements, Mr Anto said, would determine whether the GRA would charge the full cost or there would be cost sharing between it and the stakeholders.
“In countries such as Kenya, importers pay for the stamps or they get the products stamped at the point of export.
Ghana's policy on the tax stamp policy places the responsibility on the affected excise product on the importer or the manufacturer.
In many countries where similar policies are implemented, manufacturers have affixing facilities at their production units,” Mr Anto said.
On the recent challenges that saw delays and congestion at the facility, which led to an outcry among importers, Mr Anto explained that the Tema facilities were not meant for large volume importers but for people who only imported occasionally.
However, he said, large volume importers, in their attempt to avoid associated costs that came with the affixing, often sent their products to the facilities for stamping, a situation which resulted in congestion and delays.
Similarly, challenges with the stamps after a change in the service provider also resulted in some delays, he noted.
However, engineers worked on the machines to be able to pick the new stamps.
In his remarks, Mr Asmah called on the GRA to intensify education on policies that were periodically introduced into the trade space.
Tax education, he said, was important, since it would ensure compliance at all levels and also ensure that people did not short-change the system.
He commended officials of the GRA and the service provider, Streamline Resources, for taking steps to address the challenges.
The GCGL, he said, would collaborate with the GRA to scale up its sensitisation efforts, having had an insight into the operations of the excise tax stamp policy.
“I believe this is the right time for the GCGL and the GRA to deepen collaboration for the purpose of public sensitisation, so that we can get a buy-in from the public,” Mr Asmah said.
The Institute of Energy Security (IES) has said prices of fuel will appreciate marginally at the pumps. A statement issued by IES indicated that the price of fuel on the local market increased within the window under review.
Within the first pricing window of June 2021, majority of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) increased their prices of petroleum products by 3% at the pump. Based on this increase, the current national average price of fuel per litre at the pump is pegged at GHS5.97 for both gasoline and gasoil.
For this pricing window, Zen Petroleum, Benab Oil, Cash Oil, Goodness Oil, Top Oil and Frimps Oil sold the least-priced fuel on the local market, according to IES’ market scan.
For the window under assessment, international benchmark Brent crude price averaged $73.98 per barrel, representing a 4.05% increase from the previous window's average price of $71.10 per barrel.
This window’s increase in price has been largely in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases propelled by the Delta variant in parts of Europe and amid warnings of a dense outbreak in the United States.
For the first time in two years, the price of Brent reached the $75-mark at the end of the pricing window. The global crude demand is rebounding as the summer driving season begins and economies reopen from restrictions in mobility.
This is particularly the case, as road and airline travel continue to increase.
The increase in Brent crude prices has also been attributed to the tightening of the physical crude supply in parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as a result of the dynamics in spread between the regional benchmarks within the period.
The July 1st OPEC+ meeting to decide on the production policy for August is also expected to offset the markets, as we go into the month of July.
Gasoline and gasoil prices, as monitored on Standard and Poor’s global Platts platform, show that the prices of international commodities gasoline (petrol) and gasoil (diesel) experienced marginal differences within the period.
Gasoline saw an increase in price by 3.47% to close the window at $694.78 per metric tonne from an earlier $671.45 per metric tonne in the previous window.
Gasoil price also increased by 3.53% to close trading at $597.30 per metric tonne from the earlier window's price of $576.89 per metric tonne.
Data collated by IES’ Economic Desk from the Foreign Exchange (Forex) market shows the cedi maintained its stability, still trading at GH¢5.77 to the US dollar.
South Africa has been added to Nigeria’s ‘red list’ of countries for arriving passengers. Nigeria took the decision because of the covid19 Delta variant in South Africa.
Travelers who visited South Africa in the past 14 days are now banned from entering Nigeria.
Nigerian passport holders and residents coming from South Africa have to undergo a seven-day quarantine.
Brazil and Turkey are also on the list.
The killing of Kaaka Mohammed is unfortunate and regrettable.
My condolence to the family and may his soul Rest In Peace.
But quickly, some have started pointing accusing fingers at the current regime with others expressing the hope that this shouldn’t be state-sponsored.
This is also not too good, as it would not allow proper investigations to be undertaken.
Looking at the official government responses to the “Fix The Country”, agitation, I doubt whether this killing may be sanctioned by the state, even though I am also very much aware that, in our kind of nauseating politics, everything may be possible, including turning a man into a woman and vice versa.
Government met the agitators to try and calm them down.
Later, the agitations compelled, at least, two pressers to explain what government is doing to fix the country.
But of course, there are the hawks within the regime, who demonstrated intolerance by calling the bluff of the agitators and asking them to first fix themselves.
Then, we have our Police Service, that typically tried to frustrate the intentions of the agitators to demonstrate, using very nonsensical explanations of Covid as basis, when they could not prevent or disperse the mammoth crowd at Sir John’s funeral.
These things make any attempt to link the state to abuses, including murder of an agitator, easy and plausible, even though skepticisms can be entertained because of the absence of watertight evidence.
We must also know, and not be oblivious of the fact that sometimes, our nasty and very dirty politics may push individuals outside government, to carry out such abuses, just for the purposes of deepening agitations and making governments unpopular.
Again, there is no evidence to support this, in the case of Kaaka’s death.
But as we analyze the situation, through the lenses of fairness and objectivity, we must do so broadly, to cover all probabilities.
For the ignorant and unprofessional soldiers who went to kill two more human beings, I won’t blame them too much.
We must blame their mode of recruitment and training.
Regimes would continue to suffer even more monumental embarrassments from unprofessional security forces, so long as recruitments into these agencies are politicized and based not on meritocracy was part of the 2000 Mobrowa Struggle and I played an active role, sometimes as the “Divine Drummer” for our group.
We saw the professional manner with which the police and the soldiers handled us even when they had to physically stop us for being unruly.
Who squats to shoot when demonstrations are on going?
What was he aiming at? Human being or “beela”?
Is that how to shoot to disperse?
How was this soldier recruited?
Who hired him? Who trained him?
He is indeed a square peg in a round hole, wearing a military camouflage attire.
Elsewhere, I am touting our democratic credentials to some scholars and African leaders.
But behind the scenes, they are pointing these abuses to contradict my claims about Ghana’s drive towards democratic maturity.
The point is, the kind of unbridled hawkish-intolerance exhibited by some elements within regimes and the childish manner with which our security agencies act in dealing with demonstrators, constitute a severe blot on the maturation of our democratization process.
Are Ghanaian demonstrators immune to tear-gas?
How about the hot water canons and rubber billets?
Government may want to fire some security heads to send a certain signal that would compel and elicit highly professional conduct of our security agencies when it comes to crowd management and dealing with demonstrators. Government may also want to send top security brass to school again for them to be socialized in the dogmas of the kind of relational competence they need, to talk agitators out of demonstration, if need be, rather than the very cheap and democratically infantile way of quickly running to court, to seek injunction.
This only annoys and presents a needless potential recipe for revolt.
The President may have to personally intervene to give the needed assurances, bring peace and finality to this impasse.
The security agencies have lost credibility in the sight of the agitators and demonstrators.
The near-docility of our Peace Council has also created a certain legitimacy deficit that may make the Council ineffective in intervening. Given these challenges, the President’s personal intervention may be helpful and this must be done in a timeous manner.
19-year-old Thomas Amoani, a graduate of the Adeiso Presbyterian Senior High School who was offered a full scholarship by the Ghana Scholarships Secretariat has expressed his appreciation to the government of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo.
Thomas Amoani, who had eight A‘s in last year’s West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination was immediately offered a scholarship to study at the prestigious Brunel University in London after a directive to the Registrar of the Secretariat, Mr Kingsley Agyemang.
The 19-year-old boy, from Asuaba, near Adeiso and from a very poor background, will be studying Economics and Business Finance for his bachelor’s degree.
The story of the former student of the Adeiso SHS made headlines after he was interviewed by a news portal. Sharing his story, Thomas Amoani recounted how he used to trek for about 12 kilometres to school.
This caught the attention of His Excellency President Akufo-Addo who immediately asked that he be offered a full scholarship.
During a short media engagement held for him prior to his departure at the Scholarship Secretariat, the Registrar said the honour done Thomas by the President will go a long way to motivate others to also strive hard academically irrespective of their background.
“I foresee a lot of Thomases coming up and I can assure them that the Scholarships Secretariat will be there to offer them the needed support. Thomas’ story should be a motivation to others like him. And I must commend President Akufo-Addo for his swift intervention,” Mr. Agyemang said.
Arriving at the university campus, Thomas Amoani, who could not hide his joy says he is ready to raise the flag of Ghana high and will not let the country down.
“I never imagined I will be given such an opportunity by Mr. President through the hardworking Registrar. I am very grateful for the confidence reposed in me. I will not fail my country Ghana,” he said.
Brunel University London is a public research university located in the Uxbridge area of London, England. Founded in 1966 and named after the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it is ranked as the 93rd best university worldwide in the field of engineering and technology, 32nd among European institutions and 11th among British institutions according to THES world rankings.
There is no problem with the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah filing a disciplinary complaint against legal practitioner and Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga East, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine at the General Legal Council (GLC).
According to private legal practitioner and former Member of Parliament for Zebilla, Mr John Ndebugre, the arguments being made by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and other people against the complaint are issues, which should be dealt with when Dr Ayine appears before the Disciplinary Committee of the General Legal Council (GLC).
"I think he [Chief Justice] was the proper person to initiate a complaint because the statement that Dr Ayine made which resulted in this complaint was that, in summary, his confidence in the independence of the judiciary has been shaken somehow by the manner in which the presidential election petition was handled or determined."
The Chief Justice has reported lawyer Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine to the Disciplinary Committee of the GLC for statements he allegedly made during a panel discussion on Presidential Election Petitions and their impact on Africa's Democracy.
Dr. Ayine has been accused of questioning the independence of the Judiciary due to the manner the Supreme Court adjudicated the 2020 presidential election petition.
The petition says Dr. Ayine’s basis for his assertion during the discussion is the Supreme Court's failure to apply the rules of procedure as well as the consistent and continuous dismissal of the petitioner's applications or reliefs.
“These comments are made against the backdrop of the Supreme Court discharging Dr. Ayine on a charge of contempt for similar comments made against members of the Supreme Court during the Election Petition hearing. Dr. Ayine apologized profusely when he appeared before the Court on the Contempt charge and admitted to having made comments which were unbecoming of a Lawyer of his standing and a former Deputy Attorney-General."
Dr. Ayine, in his eleven-paged response to the CJ's complaint, is insisting that his comments did not attack the reputation of the justices who sat on the election petition case.
He insists that his comments were in good faith.
“As I have stated in this response, as a lawyer, I have a special responsibility to engage in criticism of the work of the judiciary. By reason of my training and experience, I am better placed than most of my fellow citizens to point out deficiencies in judgments and in the performance by the judiciary of its core constitutional mandate.”
He further posited that his comments were within the confines of fair and temperate speech.
The main opposition political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at a press conference in Accra on Monday asked the Chief Justice to withdraw his disciplinary complaint against Dr Ayine.
Disagreeing with positions that the Chief Justice should withdraw the complaint and that he has no locus to file such a complaint, Mr Ndebugre said Dr Ayine was not talking about an individual member of the panel or the members of the panel who were just seven. He wasn't talking about combination of them. He talked about the whole judiciary and the Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and therefore he was the proper person to lay the complaint.
Speaking in a radio interview monitored by Graphic Online on Accra based Citi FM on Tuesday evening (June 22, 2021), Mr Ndebugre said: "I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."
Comparing that to what happened in 1996 - the Republic against Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarcoo and Tommy Thompson - in that case Mensah Bonsu attacked an individual judge, Justice Abban and therefore he made the complaint and then the Attorney-General took it up from there and prosecuted the matter on behalf of the judiciary or the court.
No problem about CJ filing complaint
"So I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint.
The other matter is that, Dominic Ayine was Deputy Attorney-General, and he and his boss at that time took people to the criminal court, proceeding to the civil court... so if the Attorney-General approves the prosecution of a person, can somebody say that no, the person was expressing freedom of speech... therefore he should not be sent to court.
No, you are to go to the court and make your case, and state your case, and say that you were not guilty of the offence charged.
So in the same measure, the Chief Justice thinks that the statement was untoward so far as the independence of the judiciary is concerned.
So you go there, all those arguments that are being bandied about now, both by the NDC and Dr Ayine himself are matters that should be at the Disciplinary Committee," Mr Ndebugre added.
Insisting that he does not want to discuss the merits, he maintained that there are two forms, it is like contempt, whiles the matter is still pending, which is you are interfering with the administration of justice if you make prejudicial statements whiles the case is still pending, then after the judgment has been given and you make statements that scandalise the courts, you can be pursued for that.
If you lose a case in court, you can say that you don't agree, "but to say that... I say that I don't want to discuss the merits, all I'm doing now is that I don't agree with the position that because in the view of the political party, he [Dr Ayine] was expressing his right to free expression and therefore the matter should not be pursued. I don't agree."
"The point is that you must go to the Disciplinary Committee and state there that you were exercising your right to free expression, but you cannot say that the Chief Justice cannot make a complaint, he is the head of the judiciary, and you say your confidence in the judiciary has been dampened because of the way the case was handled. So he should go there [GLC], and point out those aspects of the handling of the case that led him to the conclusion that the judiciary in Ghana is not independent."
Asked about the notion that the Chief Justice chairs the GLC and therefore the Disciplinary Committee, is a sub-committee of his court and therefore he was sending Ayine to his own "court" to be tried, Mr Ndebugre replied, "are you saying that those who constitute the Disciplinary Committee are robots, and that they are going to take instructions from the Chief Justice. When you do these things, you don't help the development of our democracy. Freedom of speech does not mean that you can just say whatever you like."
He used the Parliamentary Disciplinary Committee where the legislature has been dragging people there, "have those people not been expressing their views or expressing their rights to free speech. If you go and say that errh! Parliamentarians are all corrupt without any evidence, you will be dragged to Privileges Committee... why are you saying that you cannot be questioned in another forum?
"I'm not saying that the Chief Justice is right or wrong.
All I'm saying is that the Chief Justice has made a complaint, as far as I am concerned he is the right person to make the complaint because the statement was against the judiciary, the independence of the judiciary, and he is the head of the judiciary and he has to come forward with a complaint.
The complaint doesn't mean that you have been condemned, you are to go there and make all the arguments that you are making with press conferences and so on, and then the matter will be determined.
It is only when you go there and there is evidence of bias, that you can start complaining but I think at this stage, it is premature and I'll advise Ayine to try and go to the Disciplinary Committee and make his case, it is in their interest for them to go and prove the Chief Justice wrong."
The National Peace Council (NPC) has initiated measures to deepen national unity by tackling the polarisation of the country in the aftermath of last year’s general election.
According to the council, political polarisation was a major issue that had the potential to bring about a crisis situation, hence the need to nip it in the bud.
The NPC said this at a dialogue for political parties and other stakeholders in Ada in the Greater Accra Region.
The dialogue, dubbed: “Countering post-2020 election violence and building consensus for greater political tolerance in Ghana”, was supported by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The objective was to build concensus among stakeholders to strengthen mechanisms for greater national cohesion, political tolerance, peace and nation-building.
Participants included the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Rt Hon. Patricia Scotland; the UNDP Resident Representative, Dr Angela Lusigi; the ministers of Information, Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah; the Interior, Mr Ambrose Dery, and National Security, Mr Albert Kan-Dapaah.
Others were a Deputy Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, Dr Eric Bossman Asare; a representative of the Inspector-General of Police, some executive members of the National Democratic Congress, the New Patriotic Party, the Convention People's Party, faith-based organisations, traditional rulers and civil society organisations.
Mr Dery said notwithstanding the security strategies that were put in place ahead of the December general election, there were still some pockets of violent incidents which claimed some lives and led to the destruction to property.
He said 32 violent incidents were recorded by the police in five constituencies across the country, out of which six persons died.
Mr Dery said the government would not relent in its effort to get those behind the disturbances to face prosecution.
For his part, Mr Kan-Dapaah said political tolerance and consensus building remained critical ingredients for the social, economic and political advancement of the country.
The Rt Hon. Scotland commended the people of Ghana for the peaceful manner in which they engaged in political discourse in the country, which she said was acknowledged by the entire Commonwealth family.
According to her, Ghana had historically led the way in democracy, which she said was "a heavy burden on the people’s shoulders, but it’s a burden that the people have carried with pride. We have always hoped in Ghana".
She, however, called for the inclusion of more women and the youth in policy formulation in the country.
The Chairman of the NPC, Rev. Dr Ernest Adu-Gyamfi, said his outfit was working at strengthening mechanisms for inter- and intra-party dialogue to deepen trust and confidence in key state institutions responsible for elections.
He expressed the hope that the issues discussed would significantly contribute to the healing of wounds created in the aftermath of the 2020 elections.
The Chief Servant of Transeco Minerals and Mining, Mr. Godwin Amarh has constructed a six-unit classroom block at Akyem Ampapatia in the Atiwa West District of the Eastern Region.
The classroom block, estimated at a cost of GH¢295,000 forms part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
Speaking at the inauguration, Mr Amarh underscored the need to give good and quality education to children at lower levels as it helps to give them strong foundation in education.
He said the role of education in every country’s development cannot be undermined, hence the reason his company prioritizes education.
“We at Transeco Mining and Minerals Company have decided to ensure that children in communities where we operate are exposed to the best of teaching and learning environments at the lower levels of education. That is why we have made education a top priority on our corporate social responsibility.
I’m excited to be back at Ampapatia to commission this school. We all know how important education is to the growth of individuals and the country. In order to have brilliant students at higher levels of education, they must first have a strong foundation that is why we have built this Kindergarten”, he said.
Mr. Amarh said the school is also an appreciation to the chiefs and people of Ampapatia who have maintained a healthy relationship with the company since they started their operations in the community.
Contrary to rumors and wild speculations that government has placed a ban on mining activities in the country, Mr. Amarh debunked the rumours and described it as not just inaccurate but false.
According to him, government has rather introduced new measures, policies and programmes aimed at making small scale mining productive and not destructive.
“Government has not banned activities of miners but rather categorized areas close to water bodies and forest reserves as red zones where no individual or company should mine. So what government is saying is that small scale miners should move away from the red zones. So anyone who does contrary to the directive by government will be dealt with by the laws of the country”, Mr. Amarh said.
He therefore advised small scale miners to go work but ensure that they mine at designated areas.
Mr. Amarh who also doubles as the General Secretary of the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners (GNASSM) admonished members of the group to impact positively on communities where they have concessions.
He said small scale miners must work to change the narrative that they are destroyers who only take from communities and give nothing back.
He said although many small scale miners are already doing that, there remains more to be done.
“Our sector employs a lot of people in communities where we operate. We must therefore work assiduously to leave a footprint. I know a lot of our members who have built schools and others have helped communities get electricity. We must push those stories out there to change the narrative that small scale miners only destroy’, he advised.
The Rebecca Foundation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative (ASR Africa) for a grant of $500,000.
The grant will be drawn from ASR Africa’s annual $100 million Africa Fund for Social Development and Renewal to support the Rebecca Foundation’s education initiative.
Speaking at the meeting, the Managing Director of ASR Africa, Mr Ubon Udoh, commended the foundation for its commitment to the welfare of women and children in the country.
He also praised the foundation for its adherence to good corporate governance and practices which have enabled the foundation to deliver infrastructure and services in the areas of education, health and women’s economic empowerment.
"We did our homework and identified the Rebecca Foundation as one of the most reputable charities in Ghana, which encouraged ASR Africa to support the Rebecca Foundation.” he said.
The Executive Director of the Foundation, Mrs Rebecca Akufo-Addo, thanked ASR Africa for the support to the foundation.
She pledged the commitment of the foundation to utilise the grant to benefit the education of children in the country.
The UK has denied involvement in the arrest and extradition of Nnamdi Kanu, who leads a banned group seeking a breakaway state in south-eastern Nigeria, where the ethnic Igbo people form the majority.
Mr Kanu, who holds British and Nigerian citizenship, was detained on Sunday with the help of Interpol and flown back to Nigeria, according to the attorney general.
He faces treason-related charges in Nigeria, but fled the country in 2017 while on bail.
There has been speculation that he might have been arrested in the UK, where it is believed he was mainly based.
“We can confirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK for extradition purposes,’’ a British High Commission spokesperson told the BBC.
He is currently in the custody of Nigeria’s secret police after a brief court appearance on Tuesday.
His trial is expected to resume on 26 July.
The 53-year-old came to prominence in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra and broadcast to Nigeria from London, using the platform to call for Biafran independence and urging his followers to take up arms against the Nigerian state.
Five years later, he founded the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), which has since been labelled a terrorist organisation by the Nigerian authorities.
Mr Kanu's initial arrest in 2015 triggered massive protests.
I was excited when I saw the Independence Square being renovated late last year.
The renovation, comprising painting and concrete works, was meant to prepare the Square for the funeral rites of former President Jerry John Rawlings.
The Institute of Directors-Ghana (IoD-Gh) has commended the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for taking significant steps to promote good corporate governance in the country.
It has also called for stronger collaboration between the institute and the bank to help promote proper governance of companies in the country.
During a courtesy by the institute on the management of BoG, the President of IoD-Gh, Mr Rockson Kwesi Dogbegah, eulogised the Governor of the central bank, Dr Ernest Addison, for providing transformational leadership in reforming the financial services sector.
He said the effort by BoG led by Dr Addison had led to a vibrant and resilient banking sector.
A statement from the institute said the visit was to commend the bank for its significant role in promoting the culture of good corporate governance in Ghana and to seek mutually beneficial relationships between BoG and the institute.
Speaking on the strategic projects of the IoD-Gh, Mr Dogbegah said the IoD-Gh is developing a charter aimed at setting standards for the practice of corporate governance in Ghana.
He indicated that the development of a national governance code was another key strategic project to be undertaken by the institute.
He disclosed that the institute had established the ongoing annual corporate governance excellence awards as part of its strategic efforts to celebrate the achievements of outstanding individual personalities and corporate organisations that have represented excellence in leadership and corporate governance and have made significant contributions to the socioeconomic development of Ghana.
He added that the Institute, working in collaboration with key stakeholders, had championed the formation of the Ghana Association of Integrated Thinking and Reporting aimed at stimulating a strategic and sustainable way of value creation and reporting by organisations.
BoG Governor stated that corporate governance played an important role in the financial sector.
According to him, corporate governance breaches, overbearing shareholder behaviour and related-party transactional breaches as some of the factors that led to the failure of some banks in the financial sector and their consequent resolution.
He reiterated the need for the Ghanaian society to uphold good corporate governance practices and pledged the bank’s support for the work of the institute, especially as events in the banking sector have a rippling effect on the Ghanaian economic sector.
Arteta must deliver next season
As I have already mentioned, Arsenal do not intend to sack Mikel Arteta and the club management will back him to turn the Gunners around next season.
No one can say for certain if Arsenal have made the right decision but the club intends to bring in more talented players this summer.
Serious questions are being asked about the manager’s ability and even in his own dressing room players are looking at him and wondering if he is the right man for the job.
At 39 years-of-age Arteta has a reputation, built alongside Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.
However, after seventeen months in charge the fortunes of Arsenal have not progressed and many would argue that the team performances are inferior to those of Unai Emery, the man he replaced and who knocked him out of the Europa League.
Arteta captained Arsenal and was welcomed by the fans as their new champion but they are getting restless and agitated as they watch Chelsea and Tottenham move further ahead.
The Super League disaster will not be forgotten for a long time
but I can tell you that the Kroenke owners are going nowhere
so it is up to Arteta to mend bridges, build a strong team and get his tactics right next season otherwise the proud Gunners could well crash and burn.
De Gea won’t accept being No2
Despite Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea having a contract until 2023 his agents are testing the waters to see which clubs would be interested in signing him.
I am hearing from inside Old Trafford that despite being on good terms with current No1 Dean Henderson, De Gea will not sit back and accept a role on the bench for much longer.
I am picking up interest from Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid.
The 30-year-old is arguably at the peak of his career although some inside the club believe he has declined slightly over the past two years.
Manager Solskjaer said, “Goalkeeper departments are a very tight knit group.
They work in preparation, they have different gym sessions, individual sessions to the rest of the squad and they stay together more.
Naturally they create a bond and the spirit in the goalkeeping department has been top.
It’s a healthy competition.”
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesn’t regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion.
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire-fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay.
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him.
Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira, Callum Robinson, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league.
Fastest man at City
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad?
No, it isn’t Raheem Sterling.
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards.
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest.
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham.
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen, things have not gone well for the German.
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid-19 and had to battle back to fitness.
The upcoming Champions League final and the next pre-season, Tuchel believes, will show the best of the attacking midfielder and forward.
Solskjaer is turning United into winners again
Manchester United might have big problems with the fans actively showing aggression towards the owners but inside the club there is a new belief, a new harmony and renewed confidence that they can achieve.
The man responsible is Ole Gunner Solskjaer and after speaking with many United staff and supporters this week, everyone recognises that it is time to praise the manager for achieving so much in the last eighteen months.
Solskjaer paved the way to sign Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani and both have proven to be excellent additions to United’s line-up.
Cavani has confirmed that he is staying for another season and it is mainly his belief in Solskjaer which has persuaded him.
Paul Pogba looks settled and happy and his relationship with the manager is at an all-time high.
When United fall behind in a matches these days, they get back up, fight and more often than not they win.
There is one thing to thank out-going Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward for and that is allowing Solskjaer time to succeed in the job, survive the rough patches and turn his players into winners.
Solskjaer is now the most important and the strongest foundation brick of the revitalised United and critics, staff and fans believe this is the beginning of a golden era for the Reds.
Tell-tale sign
Kane thinking about leaving
I noticed a significant silence during the match against Leeds at the weekend.
Harry Kane usually runs as much, if not more, than any other player and constantly barks out orders and instructions to other players to play more effectively.
Against Leeds he was very quiet and more so than I think I have ever seen him.
I suspect this is a tell-tale sign that Harry is seriously doubting his tenure at Spurs and is already looking for a way out.
Wolves desperate for a striker
Nuno Espirito Santos has at last recognised that during the transfer window he must prioritise signing a new striker.
Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Ruben Neves are the leading scorers which pinpoints the weakness in Wolves strike force.
Fabio Silva and Raul Jimenez are next on the list however Jimenez has been out of action since November after fracturing his skull.
Wolves have 13 goals less this season than last year.
The Wolves board have promised Nuno money to sign a proven goalscorer.
Jimenez by the way will be told on May 18th if he is medically safe to play in the final two games of this season.
He has been training for two months but was banned from heading the ball and having physical contact with his teammates.
Sir Alex praises McTominay
When the great Sir Alex Ferguson speaks about Manchester United he is always worth listening to.
His admiration for Scott McTominay is immense and the master says the midfielder should automatically play in every United game.
“Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of United’s big players,” Sir Alex said.
“When you watch United pick their team for an important game, McTominay’s name is in it.
He’s a good character and a great trainer.
I signed him when he was just a kid of seven or eight years of age
and he was actually a centre-forward.”
What higher praise can a player receive.
Three astonishing football facts…
*Manchester United have not lost an away game in the PL for a year and four months!
*If they do not win their next game, Sheffield United will become the first team since the 1904-05 season to have gone without winning two consecutive games.
Dr Madzorera said the health ministry should also raise awareness about the disease, as well as make phone calls in all parts of the country so that people can call at any time to talk about the disease.
They are also advocating for hygienic hygiene check-ups, rather than waiting for a suspected antibody to take them to the hospital.
Caps United chairman Lewis Uriri says they have resolved the problems facing their club and the striking players have begun preparations for their Castle Premier Soccer League matches.
Speaking to Studio 7, Uriri said the players were given their outstanding bonus money.
But he said last month's salaries would be paid to players soon. He also mentioned that there were some unnamed people who were influencing Caps United players to stop playing football.
Uriri said he had spoken to the players and also said the reason for the delay in paying the players was that things were difficult for everyone in the country and that the real government had not paid last year's bonuses.
Sexual rights activists say abortion laws need to be amended to keep up with the times and to protect the lives of girls and women.
Sayendisa Ndlovu of SayWhat says the public is unaware of the abortion law and says it is important for the government to publicize the law.
Ndlovu told Studio 7 that it was important to amend the law as it was written long ago. He said the law needed to be amended to add other factors that could lead to a miscarriage.
Ndlovu said such factors as mental illness, HIV / AIDS or disability were some of the factors that could be considered for abortion.
Ndlovu also explained that the law as it stands does not limit public hospitals to public abortion services and did not require a child nurse or doctor to abort a person legally.
Ms. Tendaishe Changamire, a civil rights activist under the Right Here Right Now program, has also called for the law to be amended to increase the risk of abortion.
Ms. Changamire says many studies show that young girls are losing their lives through abortions.
Although many young people are pushing for the law to be amended, some older women are opposed to it, saying abortion law should not make abortion more acceptable, saying it will make young people less respectful of life.
The Termination of Pregnancy Act was enacted by a parliament in 1977 before the country gained full independence.
Police have arrested several members of the MDC-T led by Nelson Chamisa as they tried to enter the party's Harare headquarters at Morgan Tsvangirai House.
This came after the capture of the center by the MDC faction led by Ms Thokozani Khupe.
Ms Khupe has been declared by the Supreme Court to hold office following Morgan Tsvangirai's death two years ago.
Police in custody include Chamisa's two deputies, Tendai Biti and Lynett Karenyi Kore, as well as David Chimhini, Lovemore Chinoputsa, Gladys Hlatywayo and others.
The detainees were said to be on their way to the party's headquarters, where they were surrounded by armed police.
Studio7 has not been able to hear from the police how many people have been arrested, and what charges have been leveled against them as police spokesman Paul Nyathi was not answering his phone.
Chamisa's MDC spokesperson, Fadzai Mahere, said he was shocked by the arrests.
The situation in the MDC is tense following a Supreme Court ruling this year that ruled that Chamisa and Ms Khupe's congresses were unconstitutional, and that Congress should be held at a time when Ms Khupe is the caretaker incumbent.
Following the ruling, Ms Khupe fired four members of parliament and the senate, saying the people were no longer representing the interests of their party.
Dismissed are Thabitha Khumalo, Prosper Mutseyami, Lilian Timveous and Charlton Hwende.
Some Zimbabweans in various countries say they were forced to leave the country because of the rule of Robert Mugabe, who they say is ruling with an ax.
A political scientist who teaches at Bergen University in Norway, and a member of the Zimbabwe Yibuya / Mayibuye Zimbabwe organization, Dr Victor Chimhutu, says that although Mr Mugabe was seen as a champion of African unity, one Zimbabwean family did not view him that way.
Dr Chimhutu says Mr Mugabe's alliance with other African leaders is one of the reasons he has gained so much respect from African leaders.
They say Mr. Mugabe will also be remembered for insulting and expressing his views on the West and his criticism of the leaders of countries such as the United States and Britain.
Mr Mugabe allegedly did not beat the dogs and hid the culprit if members of his Zanu PF party defected, or even insulted opposition parties.
Mr Mugabe is expected to be laid to rest on Sunday, although his whereabouts have not yet been announced.
Doctors and nurses working in public hospitals have told the government they will stop working at the beginning of next month if they are not paid before the end of December.
The president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Fortune Nyamande, who said his organization was affiliated with the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, had written a letter to the government informing them of the move.
Dr Nyamande said he had written to the government informing him of his strike from January 1 next year.
They say they and nurses in government hospitals have taken this step on the grounds of lack of transportation costs as they have not yet received their monthly salaries as well as bonus payments promised by the government.
Dr Nyamande also criticized the government's alleged use of the media to discredit traditional newspapers.
Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has already announced that the government will not be able to pay some of its employees this year due to a lack of funds.
"Mr Chinamasa has used the newspapers to announce the change in our pay dates, so we will use the same methods," Dr Nyamande said.
The coaches, who were due to receive their pay on Monday, have been announced on Tuesday, but the general public, including doctors and nurses, are expected to receive their pay on January 5 next year.
But many civil servants who spoke to Studio 7 said they were not confident they would get their money back on the new deadlines.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Health, David Parirenyatwa, and the Minister of Labor, Priscah Mupfumira, to find out what steps they will take to prevent a strike.
The main opposition MDC party has complained that its members are being harassed by the police.
The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says 47 people have been arrested in recent days, mostly MDC supporters and seven other students at Allen Wilson School in Harare for allegedly protesting illegally.
Other detainees include Makomborero Haruzivishe, a former student leader from ZINASU, who appeared in court today, along with his colleague Allan Moyo.
We were unable to reach the police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, as their phone was unanswered.
Lawyer Innocent Gonese, the MDC's legal adviser, said Haruzivishe and Moyo would return to court on Monday to discuss the court's decision.
The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has declared China that the corona virus, which has killed 233 people in China, has become a global epidemic.
In the last two days alone, about 2,000 people are estimated to have been infected with the corona virus and 9,800 have been infected worldwide in 244 countries.
WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while they were confident of China's efforts to prevent the disease, they feared that if it spread to other parts of the world, it could kill more people.
Health Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo says Zimbabwe is testing more than 200 people from China or countries with a corona virus infection.
People under investigation in Zimbabwe are being held at their home for 14 days.
Former health minister Dr Henry Madzorera says Zimbabwe needs more money to prevent the spread of the disease.
The body of former president Robert Mugabe will arrive in Harare on Wednesday afternoon and his funeral will be announced.
This was announced by the Minister of Information, Ms Monica Mutsvangwa, after a cabinet meeting.
Ms Mutsvangwa said government committees were preparing for Mr Mugabe's funeral.
Asked why it was taking so long to talk about Mugabe's funeral, Mutsvangwa and Foreign Affairs Minister Sibusiso Moyo said it was "unusual" that he would announce his funeral arrangements after the Mugabe family in Singapore arrived in the country.
He said the government and President Mugabe's family were working together.
Meanwhile, King Katizagombo's spokesman, Gibson Jenami, said there was no longer any controversy over Mugabe's funeral as the government, led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, was at the forefront of the process.
Meanwhile, Major General Trust Mugoba, who also passed away last week, will be laid to rest on Wednesday at the Heroes Acre burial ground in Harare.
In other news, the government says 178 Zimbabweans have been affected by the violence in South Africa and that two Zimbabweans have died in the violence.
Moyo said the government was planning to bring the victims home with the bodies.
The government also claims that health workers, including doctors, have been paid an additional 60 percent of their benefits, and today the cabinet has decided that the health and finance ministry will sit down to ensure that the workers are paid fairly.
Health Minister, Dr Obadiah Moyo, has said he will sit down with the finance ministry to ensure that the cabinet resolution is implemented.
Doctors went on strike last week complaining that their salaries were too low.
An organization formed to commemorate human rights activists and former Occupy Africa Unity Square leader Itai Dzamara, the Itai Dzamara Trust, today celebrated International Women's Day.
The ceremony was held in Highfield where women and girls who attended the event were provided with follow-up equipment or sanitary pads and more.
A spokesman for the Dzamara family who is also a member of the board of the Itai Dzamara Trust, Mr Partson Dzamara, told Studio 7 that he saw fit to show love to women this month, the month of his brother Itai's disappearance five years ago.
He said although his brother was involved in politics, human rights and journalism, he did it all out of love and the Itai Dzamara Trust will continue to be kind to him.
He said his organization had launched its operation in the village of Highfields because it was the birthplace of Itai but said they would go elsewhere to help women and the poor with knowledge and experience in many areas including law, education and health.
Among the participants in today's event was Rememberance Zuze, who said that although Mr Dzamara had not yet been found, he was happy with the actions of the organization that monitors his life.
An unnamed girl told Studio 7 that she has benefited a lot today.
Meanwhile, Partson Dzamara has announced that a five-year anniversary rally for his brother abducted by unknown individuals in Glen View will be held on Tuesday in Harare.
He said so far they did not know the whereabouts of his brother or whether he was alive.
He said police, human rights activists, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission and others who worked with Itai Dzamara were among those invited to the event.
As the world celebrates refugee day, tomorrow, some Zimbabweans living as refugees in South Africa say there is nothing to celebrate as South Africa is in dire straits.
Some Zimbabweans say South Africa does not respect the agreements it has signed with organizations such as the United Nations in respecting the rights of refugees.
The secretary general of the Zimbabwe Migrant Support Network, Shelton Chiyangwa, told Studio 7 that although refugee day is important, South African refugees are being held hostage.
Chiyangwa said the Zimbabwean family living in South Africa was also the main victims.
He added that his organization was working with Zimbabweans and other countries to help them obtain travel documents
Zimbabwe Exemption Permits vice-chairwoman Gladys Mangwende said her organization was interested in the refugee awareness program but was concerned about the lack of human rights.
The chairman of Human Rights Watch in North Africa, Dewa Mavhinga, says refugee day is important in South Africa as there are many Zimbabweans living as refugees.
Mr Mavhinga went on to urge the South African government to relax the rules, especially in the area of ​​immigration.
Another Zimbabwean, George Manyika, also backed Mavhinga's statement.
Gabriel Shumba, head of the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, has called on the United Nations, the AU and SADC to take a closer look at the treatment of refugees by SA, especially Zimbabweans.
The Lions also appealed to South Africa's interior minister, Aaron Motseledi, to relax his department's rules so that refugees do not have to struggle to obtain documents.
He urged human rights groups to work with his organization to fight for the rights of all refugees.
One of the refugees, Francis Mukono, said he did not see the importance of refugee day as the situation in South Africa was difficult.
Another refugee, Steven Chiweshe, also said he was unaware of the stabbing.
Mandela Madumise, South Africa's director general of refugee affairs, said his department had applied to the United Nations Human Rights Council for assistance in resolving the problems they were facing in the department.
Madumise said by the end of next month, his department would know what needs to be done to address these issues.
It is estimated that more than three million Zimbabweans have fled South Africa to South Africa, accusing the government of harassment.
But the Zimbabwean government says some people have fled to the countryside in search of better pastures.
Hospital staff, including nurses and doctors, have been on strike for more than 33 days, saying their salaries were not enough to go to work without any hope of a solution.
The situation in public hospitals is tense, with some patients being sent home without treatment.
The situation in hospitals is expected to worsen as the Senior Health Doctors Association has already announced that if the financial issues and strikes of the junior and senior doctors are not resolved by them they will also go on strike. Spokesman for the medical association Dr Aaron Musara told Studio 7 that things were not going well in the hospitals.
Dr Musara said although he had informed the government of his intention to step down through letters to various departments, he had not received a response.
Nurses in public hospitals are not going to work and are demanding that the government pay them their salaries with the US money they received in October 2018 as well as provide them with equipment to protect themselves from illness when they are on duty.
The president of the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, ZINA, Enock Dongo, says talks with the government are a goat's head.
Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA) spokesperson Dr Tapiwa Mungofa also said that the lack of access to health care services by the government has left patients without treatment.
Mr Mungofa also said that at the time the children's nurses went on strike, many of their members were at home as a precautionary measure against the transmission of COVID-19 to self quarantine.
Studio 7 was unable to hear the government's side of the story to address the grievances of health workers as former health minister Professor Amon Murwira was unresponsive to his phone call.
But last week, Mr Murwira announced that he had started a conversation with a nurse. His deputy John Mangwiro also told Studio 7 that they were too busy to speak.
Chairman of the Health Services Board, Dr. Paulinus Sikosana, also said they had been in a meeting on the COVID-19 epidemic and were therefore unable to speak to us.
Health experts also say that if the government does not address the issue of nurses returning to work and also preventing pediatricians from continuing to set themselves on fire, especially now that the country is facing the COVID-19 epidemic that has killed 25 people so far.
Chinhoyi City Council says it is ready to comply with the High Court's ruling on Monday that the council should rebuild buildings that it demolished in the city.
Speaking at a meeting with traders who had their buildings demolished by the Chinhoyi council, the council's secretary, Abel Gotora, said they would abide by the court's order for the council to build commercial buildings which had been demolished by some traders.
But Mr Gotora said the council would not rebuild all the buildings it had demolished, but would only build the buildings that the high court had ordered for the six people who took the council to court.
Tafadzwa Marimo, Emmanuel Ngwaru, Richard Svosve, Pepukayi Marega and Devis Shopo were among those who took Chinhoyi to court.
One of the six, Emmanuel Gwaru, said he accepted the court ruling with great joy as the government had told the councils to clean up the area only, not demolish buildings.
Mr Gwaru said one of his biggest grievances was that he was paying money for the council to build better commercial facilities. Gadzema Councilor Patricia Chibaya said she was pleased with the court's decision as she was in a difficult situation because, on the other hand, as a councilor, she had to comply with a letter from provincial minister July Moyo to clean up the cities, but at the same time. they also sympathize with the people who live by the trade whose markets have been destroyed.
Mr Gotora announced that the council would build a new market for 50 traders at the Gadzema market.
A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Kumbirai Mafunda, said traffickers were coming to their offices seeking legal representation.
Many councils in the country are demolishing buildings that they say were built illegally.
But traders in various parts of the world are protesting in court what their councils are doing.
Following the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday as to who should lead the MDC party since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai, many people want to know who the real owner of the Richard Morgan Tsvangirai House or Harvest House is.
The court ruled that Ms Thokozani Khupe should take over the reins of the MDC-T until an election is held within three months.
But the issue of who enters the party's headquarters is a bit difficult as there are two people guarding the building, namely Ian Makone and Reverend Tim Neil, a former head of the Church of the Province of Central Africa or CPCA.
The secretary general of the MDC Alliance, Charlton Hwende, believes that the center is in the hands of the two and that they are currently the only ones allowed to use it.
Douglas Mwonzora, who also claims to be the party's secretary general, has returned to the party in 2014. He also believes that the party is in the hands of Makone and Neil.
But they said they think they will be allowed to work in you. We have not been able to contact Mr. Makone and Mr. Niel to hear their side of the story.
The deputy chairperson of the MDC led by Nelson Chamisa, Job Sikhala, says the St Marys area in Chitungwiza has given birth to leopards which is prompting party supporters to flee their homes and seek refuge.
Sikhala, a former Zengeza West MP, said his party's supporters were being sought by a senior police officer named Jabangwe in the area for his arrest.
We tried to contact Mr. Jabangwe but he did not want to answer our questions.
Studio7 was also unable to hear from a police spokesman. Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, why the supporters want to be arrested by the police.
But it is alleged that the issue of arrests of MDC supporters was aimed at protesting the party's nationwide protests.
Sikhala, who was arrested last month on charges of plotting to overthrow the government of Emmerson Mnangagwa, told Studio 7 that many people were fleeing their homes for fear of arrest.
More than 90 people were arrested in Harare last Friday in connection with a protest organized by the MDC on the same day.
The MDC wants to protest in major cities in the country but the police are using part of the Public Order and Security Act to ban the party from continuing its protests.
Police have so far banned the MDC from protesting in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru and Masvingo.
Political analysts say this could also happen in Mutare where the MDC plans to hold a protest on Thursday.
The High Court has suspended Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube from funding the MDC-T led by Thokozani Khupe under a parliamentary budget law.
High Court Judge Priscilla Munangati Manongwa ruled on Thursday that she had suspended Ziyambi and Ncube from presenting the MDC-T faction, which claims to be the legitimate party, to fund political parties under parliament under the Political Parties (Finance) Act.
The MDC is due to receive R7,500 million in RTGS.
Experts say Nelson Chamisa's MDC has gone to court after Ms Khupe's faction had written letters to banks seeking to remove Chamisa's members from the list of people who were required to sign statements to withdraw money from the party's Steward Bank.
Chamisa's MDC-T deputy spokesman, Luke Tamborinyoka, said he was happy with the ruling.
But Morgen Komichi, who has been claiming to be the party's chairman following a Supreme Court ruling that ruled that Chamisa had not complied with his party's constitution to become MDC leader, said he would take steps to get the money as he was the party's official leader.
But Mr Tamborinyoka said he was entitled to the money as the MDC MPs entered parliament using his name.
But Komichi said Mr Chamisa and others should abide by the law.
Meanwhile, a Harare lawyer, Kudzai Kadzere, said the court's decision could be appealed within 10 days.
Ziyambi told Studio7 by telephone that they could also file their papers in court within 10 days if they want to challenge the ruling as ordered by the court.
We have not been able to speak to the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, or the Minister of Finance to hear his side of the story as he has also been named in the court papers.
Some legal experts say the provisional order was issued by the court to the nominees that if they did not object to Chamisa's MDC case, the court could fulfill its decision to transfer the money to Chamisa's MDC.
This is not the first time the MDC has fought for these funds.
In 2006, after former MDC secretary general Welshman Ncube opposed Morgan Tsvangirai in October 2005 and formed his own MDC, he continued to receive all the MDC funding for the parties, leaving Mr. Tsvangirai, the majority party in parliament, without a single penny.
Another Zimbabwean, Dr Rita Nyampinga, of the Female Prisoners Support Trust, which fights for women's rights in prisons, said she was happy to receive the 2020 International Women of Courage Award.
The award recognizes the heroic deeds of women around the world, and is presented by the United States Department of International Relations.
Dr Nyampinga said she never thought she would receive such an honor, saying she was thrilled to be recognized along with 11 other women from around the world.
Dr Nyampinga says they will be traveling to various parts of the United States to learn about prison conditions so that they can strengthen their work at home.
Dr Nyampinga says their work requires courage and they are happy that others have seen the work they are doing back home.
Speaking at the event, Secretary of State for International Relations Michael Pompeo said the work done by the 12 women is admirable and requires courage.
The program was launched 14 years ago.
Other women who have received this award are from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Burkino Faso, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
Mr Pompey said such programs were important as they gave women the opportunity to work for the rights of others around the world.
Speaking at the event, the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump, said she was pleased with the human rights work being done by women around the world.
He said that since they first met the women who have been selected for recognition four years ago, they have continued to meet women who are doing admirable work around the world even though some of them do these jobs and face harassment but continue to do so.
Dr Nyampinga says he started his career as a human rights activist 30 years ago.
In addition to her party, Ms Nyampinga is a board member of the Women's Coalition Of Zimbabwe, Crisis In Zimbabwe Coalition, Women Academy on Political Leadership Excellence and Women And Aids Support Network.
Other Zimbabwean women who have received the award include Ms. Jenni Willaims, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, Ms. Jestina Mukoko and Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa.
The health ministry said it had asked South Africa to test whether a Zimbabwean woman from China arrived in the country on Tuesday with a coronavirus infection.
A study conducted in Zimbabwe by China shows that it does not. South Africa's National Institute of Communicable Diseases has the highest level of expertise in northern South Africa to determine if a person has been infected with the coronavirus.
The woman is at Wilkins Hospital in Harare. Infectious disease specialist Dr Portia Manangazira says they expect to know the status of the situation within five days.
The ban on the operation of minibuses and buses under the ZUPCO bus company has caused problems for the lack of transportation, which has led to people gathering at bus stops as the country struggles to spread the Covid-19 epidemic in the country.
Many people are said to be suffering from a lack of transportation, especially in the evenings, which is causing them to squeeze into the few available buses.
The government has enacted a law banning passengers from transporting people during the Covid-19 epidemic as a way to prevent the spread of the virus, stating that only ZUPCO-owned buses are allowed to carry passengers.
But some buses and buses are said to be reluctant to go under the scheme for various reasons including delays in payment by ZUPCO.
On Monday, the private bus operators reportedly held a meeting with ZUPCO officials to try to resolve their grievances, including late payment of their buses.
On Tuesday, the buses were expected to meet with government officials to resolve the dispute.
Studio 7 has not been able to hear from ZUPCO as to what plans are in place to address the shortage of transport.
But the head of the Harare Residents Trust, Precious Shumba, said the government should address the transport crisis as soon as possible before things go awry.
Lions say the government should put police, army or council police at the bus stops in order to enforce a law to protect people from spreading the disease.
They also say that health workers should also be patrolling the bus terminals to check that they are HIV-negative or Covid-19.
Businesses in Bulawayo in conjunction with various city organizations have met with city officials to discuss problems they say are caused by water shortages, which are said to have taken a long time.
The head of the Association for Business in Zimbabwe (ABUZ), Victor Nyoni, said the closure had disrupted the operation of many businesses as their members needed water to carry out their daily activities.
Mr Nyoni said he had been assured by the council officials he met to expect water supply early next week, as the council hopes to complete its work by the end of the week.
The city of Bulawayo is said to have entered its second week without water following a move by the council to repair water pumps at the Criterion Water Works.
This is also said to be due to the declining water levels in the city's main source of water for Criterion and Magwegwe as well as power outages for pumping water.
Mr. Nyoni says it is well known that the city of Bulawayo is over 120 years old, and that machinery and water pipes are old.
He called on the government and the council to take steps to address the problem once and for all.
Studio7 failed to hear the council's side of the story.
The Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, which represents striking doctors, said it was waiting to hear from President Emmerson Mnangagwa after a meeting with its envoys on Wednesday.
The treasurer of the meeting, Doctor Prince Butau, said he was looking forward to hearing from Mr Mnangagwa any time on Thursday or Friday.
Mr Mnangagwa, who was on leave, returned immediately to try to resolve the doctors' strike.
Things in all public hospitals are said to be in a state of disarray since doctors went on strike on December 1 last year.
But the head of the Community Working Group on Health, Mr Itai Rusike, said the government should address the problem urgently and provide doctors with money to prevent them from picking ants by mouth.
Some Zimbabweans in South Africa have protested at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, where Deputy President Constantino Chiwenga is being treated, demanding that Chiwenga return to a local hospital for treatment.
Mr Chiwenga was reportedly rushed out of the country over the weekend for medical treatment in South Africa, although Studio 7 could not find any evidence that he was in South Africa's largest hospital.
Media Minister Monica Mutsvangwa and Information Secretary Nick Mangwana declined to comment on the matter on Sunday when contacted by VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe, urging them to arrest George Charamba.
But Studio 7 failed to contact Charamba to find out if it was true that Chiwenga was ill and was being treated at the hospital.
Another Zimbabwean, Carlos Chimbi, who lives in Cape Town, joined other Zimbabweans in the protest.
Chimbi said he was "deeply saddened" that the vice president had violated the rights of people with disabilities in the country as he knew he would seek medical treatment abroad if he became ill.
He said he was happy to be able to deliver his message to the hospital as the head of the hospital had asked to speak to him, although he did not say whether Mr Chiwenga was at the hospital or not.
Chimbi said the head of the hospital had told him that the law did not allow him to talk about patients who would be at the hospital if they were not at the hospital.
Chiwenga angered the people last year when doctors went on strike, saying they were not skilled workers but ordinary workers, and that the government had not taken steps to address the problems in hospitals that are causing people to lack proper treatment.
Groote Schurr Hospital is best known for being the world's first heart-to-heart transplant.
Police have banned the main opposition MDC party from holding a rally tomorrow when the party's leader, Nelson Chamisa, was expected to announce his party's direction and plans for this year.
Speaking after a meeting of the party's Standing Committee in Harare, MDC deputy spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka said police had banned the rally and said they were busy with the reopening of schools.
Tamborinyoka said the meeting would not be held tomorrow because the MDC wanted its supporters to avoid being beaten or attacked by the police.
He said it was clear that the police were trying to attack the party's supporters as they had done when the party planned to protest in all the cities and towns in the country.
He said the conference, which had the theme of Agenda 2020, was to be held at Ms Musodzi Hall in Mbare and would be held on Tuesday next week at a venue to be announced later.
Mr Tamborinyoka said the MDC was tired of being considered a terrorist organization and was considering whether to continue to follow the law or change its policy.
We were unable to hear from Zimbabwe Republic Police, ZRP spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, as their mobile phone was not working.
Independent political analyst Masimba Kuchera told Studio7 that he felt the police were harassing the MDC.
In August last year, the ZRP banned the MDC from protesting in cities and towns across the country, saying it feared the protests would lead to riots as had happened in January.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Norway offers this award.
Ahmed was praised for bringing peace between his country and Eritrea after a 20-year war over differences between the two countries.
The first black person to win the award was Albert Luthuli of South Africa in 1960.
Other recipients include the late Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Anwar Sedat of Egypt and Kofi Annan of Ghana.
Other winners include, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, were Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the late Wangari Maathai of Kenya, the first black woman in Africa to win the award.
In Zimbabwe in 2011 the late Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was nominated for a prize although he was unsuccessful.
Dr Pedzisayi Ruhanya, a political scientist at the University of Johannesburg, says President Emmerson Mnangagwa has a lot to learn from Ahmed's leadership style.
Many elephants and other animals are dying of starvation and water in the Hwange National Park, prompting the government to intensify its efforts to reduce the number of elephants.
During a visit to Studio7 in the Hwange National Park area, we saw the bodies of many elephants who have died of malnutrition caused by drought in some areas this year.
Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) spokesperson Tinashe Farawo told Studio7 that 85 elephants have died since September and more than 200 have died this year due to starvation.
The Pharaohs also said that in addition to the famine, one of the main causes of death is the shortage of food and water, which has led to a reduction in the number of elephants and other animals.
When eating, one elephant is said to need more than 200 pounds [500 kg] of food and to require more than two gallons [200 L] of water.
But now ZimParks estimates that there are more than 45,000 elephants in the area.
Some animal rights activists say the figures provided by ZimParks are false and say they are doing this as a way of getting support to be able to sell elephants.
Advocates4Earth member, Lenin Chisaira, admits that elephants and other animals are starving and malnourished, but he is one of the proponents of ZimParks' lack of transparency.
According to Chisaira, one of the main causes of hunger for animals in the Hwange National Park is the government's decision to allow people to do things such as mining, which they say should not be done in the area.
But Mr. Farawo said he was concerned about the views of animal rights activists who said they did not want to accept the fact that elephants and other animals are increasing due to the good work of his department, adding that the department is open and its doors open to all who want to know the situation in zoos.
Zimbabwe and other northern African countries, including Botswana, say they want the International Convention on the Trade in Endagered to allow them to sell their elephants as the number of animals has increased, which has led to a number of problems, including human and animal poaching.
Thirty-three people have been killed by the animals of the organization this year alone.
At a CITES summit in Geneva, Switzerland in August, the organization rejected a call for the lifting of the ban on the sale of elephants and their ivory.
The head of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe, Emmanuel Fundira, said it was important for CITES and animal rights activists to understand the problems facing Zimbabwe and other countries due to the high number of elephants in these countries.
The Minister of Climate and Tourism, Nqobizitha Ndlovu, told Studio 7 that the government is trying its best to work with other countries to give CITES a new perspective.
But they also said they could take a move called reservation which allows them to export elephants to other CITES countries that have taken the same step.
Hwange National Park opened in 1928 and is the largest national park in the country.
The organization is over 14,000 square miles [14,000 sq km] and at its inception was estimated to have only about 2,000 elephants.
The General Secretary of the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe, FUZ, Paul Gundani, died in Kwekwe on Wednesday afternoon after a short illness.
But it is still unknown how things turned out.
According to FUZ, Gundani died at Topomasi Private Hospital in Kwekwe.
The club also says their absence has left a large gap that will be difficult to close as they have a passion for helping football players.
Gundani, who previously played for Zisco Steel, also played for the Young Warriors, and played for the Warriors at a time when the team was known as the "Dream Team" under the tutelage of the late Reinard Fabisch.
FUZ media officer Marlene Gadzirayi said she was shocked to hear that Gundani had passed away.
"I am very sad as I spoke to them yesterday and we were already planning how to proceed. But I heard today that they are missing but at this stage I do not know what Mr Gundani ate," Ms Gadzirayi told Studio7.
Ms Gadzirayi says the country has lost a great football hero. Ms Gadzirayi also said there were no plans for Mr Gundani's funeral as he was waiting to hear from his family when he would be laid to rest.
The Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has announced on its website that it is saddened by Gundani's death and will stand by the family in all his funeral arrangements.
ZIFA communications officer Xolisani Gwesele said Gundani's death was a national tragedy and it would be difficult to find a man with a passion for football.
"Peace be upon you Paul Gundani," Gwesela wrote on the ZIFA website.
Former President Robert Mugabe's body could not be flown to his home in Zvimba today as his wife, Grace Mugabe, has fallen ill.
Some relatives say the body is due to arrive in Zvimba on Monday.
As many as 1,000 people have been waiting for President Mugabe's body for a day in Zvimba this afternoon.
A spokesman for the Mugabe family, who is also the grandson of the deceased, Leo Mugabe, said Mugabe's body could not be found today for reasons he said he did not know as he had just been sent by King Zvimba.
Leo Mugabe said the body would arrive home early in the morning.
But King Katizagombo, also known as Gibson Jenami, said the body would not return to Zvimba as expected since Ms Grace Mugabe was ill.
King Katizagombo also said the body will be in the hands of the government until the day it is laid to rest.
But this contradicts Leo Mugabe, who said Mugabe's body would be kept by his family until a high-level grave was completed.
Uncertainty at President Mugabe's funeral procession has left many in a state of shock as to whether or not Mugabe's body will arrive as it is almost 30 days before his burial.
Leo Mugabe said Mugabe's body would remain in Zvimba for a day and then return to Harare where he would be laid to rest.
Leo Mugabe said people had gathered in one place at President Mugabe's home in Harare.
A member of the opposition MDC-T led by Nelson Chamisa who was also expected to die in Zvimba today, Lloyd Tarubwa of Banket, who was abducted and detained for nine months without trial, said they had come to see if President Mugabe was really dead.
The conduct of Mr. Mugabe's funeral has shocked many in the country, claiming that Mr. Mugabe's troubles during his tenure were the cause of his death.
Mr Mugabe passed away in Singapore on September 6 after a long illness.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, or ARTUZ, says one of its leaders, Godfrey Chanda, was abducted by detectives and detained for two hours in Gweru without the public's knowledge.
But Chanda, who is a member of the ARTUZ committee in the Midlands region, has been released after being forced not to hold meetings with coaches in Gweru.
ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure said Chanda's dismissal came as coaches under his two-day strike went on strike for a three-day strike.
Masaraure says some coaching associations are also striking as a way to support their union.
The demonstration ends on Wednesday.
But Masaraure said a meeting would be held after the strike to plan for action.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Labor, Ms Sekai Nzenza, to find out the government's position on the matter but her mobile phone has not been answered.
FC Platinum's sudden exit from the Caf Champions League has raised many questions about Zimbabwean football.
Although they still have two games left in the competition, FC Platinum will no longer be able to hold Esperance who have eight points, nor will they be able to beat Horoya Athletic Club who have seven points. as they were beaten at home and outside by Horoya which is the first to be watched if these teams finish the games equally on points.
At the moment, FC Platinum have only one point from four games so they are just playing to complete their remaining games in order to gain the respect of another fan of the game Spencer Mushambadope.
Mushambadope says there will be no results for the remaining matches.
Last year, the same team was released in the first round by Angola's Primeiro de Agosto after being beaten at home by Lunda again.
In 2017, Caps United reached the mini league stage of the tournament but failed to reach the quarter-finals after being beaten 4-2 at home by Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya.
The same year, the Ngezi Platinum Stars who were representing Zimbabwe in the Caf Confederation were knocked out of the tournament in the first round when they were beaten by the Angolan Libolo.
In 2016 Harare City who were in the same competition were eliminated in the first round by Zanaco of Zambia after being beaten 2-1 at Rufaro Stadium and then finished 3-1 in Zambia.
This shows that local teams are failing to stand up to other African teams as was the case in previous years when Dynamos competed effectively in reaching the Caf Champions League final in 1998 and the semi-finals in 2008.
What hurts the most is that FC Platinum have only one point in four games, they have not scored a single point, moreover, they have conceded six points in four games.
The question is, if a team is beating all the teams at will in Zimbabwe and they are playing like this in Africa, what does it mean for national football?
Caps United supporter Tinashe Musebi says football has deteriorated to such an extent that there is a need for more reforms, before Zimbabwean teams fall short of surpassing Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland.
Football commentator Farai Kambamura says Zimbabwean teams are failing to play in Africa because the players who helped them win the league title in Zimbabwe are going abroad, especially to South Africa when they are competing in Africa.
Last year, FC Platinum lost Gerald Takwara, Elvis Chipezeze and Talent Chawapiwa, this year lost to Rodwell Chinyafanere who won the soccer star of the year trophy who went to Baroka.
But John Chikochi, who led the Lengthens team in the Premier Soccer League, said Zimbabwe needed to increase its football competitions in the country so that clubs could pay players a fee that would prevent them from fleeing to South Africa and Zambia.
Currently, Zimbabwe has only two clubs, the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League and the Chibuku Super Cup. The Zifa Cup was last played in 2005.
A football fan, Musa Masepe, says Zimbabwe has no football talent as players are opting to sing or something else as their salaries in football are no longer viable.
If this continues, it will take time for local teams to compete with other African teams.
Elections to represent the Democratic Party in the US presidential election in November are raging following the election of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Bloomberg, who has become a very rich man, did not run in the by-elections to represent his party in the presidential election, which will be contested by Republican Party spokesman Donald Trump.
Mr Bloomberg announced in November last year that he was joining the party, spending more than $ 400 million on advertising. This money is theirs.
The rich man did not run in the by-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire, nor will he run in the by-elections in Navada and South Carolina, pending the March election, when 14 states will elect a candidate to represent the Democratic Party in the US presidential election.
As soon as Bloomerg put his foot down in the running for office, former members of the party, such as Bernie Sanders, who represents Vermont in the Senate, and Elizabeth Warren, who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, began tearing down Bloomberg's record.
Speaking ahead of a Nevada political rally, Mr. Sanders said that in order for his party to defeat Mr. Trump, it needed someone who could mobilize more people than ever before in American history.
Mr Sanders said Mr Bloomberg was a well-known figure in New York mayor's decision to suspend and search for black people, as well as to Latinos, who were unfairly doing so. He said such a move could not get more people to vote for Mr. Trump's removal in November.
But Bloomerg slammed Mr. Sanders' comments, saying Mr. Sanders, who is leading the polls, has been elected a Democratic Party candidate in the presidential election, which will be with Mr. Trump for the next four years.
A political analyst and Zanu PF member, Frank Guni, said it was clear that the main match was between Sanders and Bloomberg, although it was clear that Sanders now had too many supporters.
Guni says, in his view, Sanders and Bloomberg should run in the presidential election together in order to defeat Trump.
Some candidates in the Democratic Party say; Barack Obama's former successor, Joe Biden; Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, as well as former mayor of South Bend in Indiana, and a gay man, Pete Buttigieg.
The Democratic Party has 3,979 delegates, and for a person to be nominated as a candidate for the presidential election, he or she must have 1,990 delegates (1,990).
In addition to the delegates, there are also super delegates so that when the Democratic Convention is held in July in Wisconsin, there should be 4,750 delegates and supervisors, and the person elected at this meeting, should get 2,200 votes. three seventy-six votes (2,376 votes).
Many people go to the banks early in the morning in the hope of making money as a guarantee of the world's largest bank but have ridden a rotten donkey.
A survey conducted by Studio 7 at various banks in Harare, Bulawayo, Chinhoyi, Masvingo, Mutare, Gweru and other cities revealed that no banks have received the new money and many banks have not been able to provide the people with the old one.
Jossam Marwira, one of the bankers, said he had been waiting for the money for a day as he had heard in the news that a new currency would be added.
Mr Marwira said he was particularly concerned about buying money on the streets and said it would be better for people like him to be able to get money from banks free of charge.
A man who buys and sells money on the street who declined to be named also told Studio 7 that he was also looking forward to the new currency but saw nothing.
RBZ, the central bank, recently announced that it would launch new investments in the hope of alleviating the country's financial woes.
RBZ Governor John Mangudya has announced that he will issue a $ 2 gold bond as well as a $ 2.5 bond bond that was expected to come into effect today.
Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president Webster Rusere also said they had not yet checked whether any of the banks had received the money, saying RBZ was the only source of information.
The issue of money laundering is causing controversy in the country, with some saying it will help people who are worried about money while others say it is a scapegoat.
Zimbabweans driving in South Africa have been living in a state of shock following the burning of cars by suspected South Africans who do not want foreign nationals to find work.
South African government ministers for police, Bheki Cele; Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula; and the Minister of Labor, Thulas Nxesi, held a meeting with truck drivers, job seekers and the owners warned to take action against those who are burning the trucks.
Cele warned truckers were on fire that they would be arrested as they were disrupting economic affairs.
But just two hours after they finished talking a truck burned down on the N2 in Durban.
A police spokesman, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, acknowledged that another truck had been set on fire.
Over the weekend, 18 trucks, including those feared by other Zimbabweans, were also set ablaze in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.
The chairman of the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, Gabriel Shumba, said the trucks had been set ablaze on highways in the SA, prompting the temporary closure of the roads.
Representing South Africa's Zimbabwe Exemption Permits, Edward Muchatuta, said that after the incident, he and other foreign drivers also protested, demanding that the SA government intervene.
One of the drivers, George Nanyika, has called for a dialogue.
Davie Munodawafa, another driver, said he also feared for his life.
Munadawafa went on to say that many drivers do not know their future.
South Africa's police chief, Bheki Cele, yesterday warned that the police would take strict action against those who set fire to the vehicles. This, in turn, is what caused the other side of the coin to stop.
Lions told Studio7 that the incident was a repeat of what South Africans had previously said that foreign nationals should leave SA.
Journalists have also been criticized by Shumba for failing to inform the public about the incident.
Lions went on to say that their organization has written letters to foreign embassies in South Africa, including Zimbabwe, asking them to work together to end the crisis.
Dewa Mavhinga, Human Rights Watch's regional director for North Africa, condemned the incident and urged motorists not to travel at night.
The country's economic woes are prompting Zimbabweans to seek employment in South Africa, which has sparked tensions as South Africans complain of being deprived of jobs by foreigners.
The court has ordered the police not to ban former Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors' Association president Dr. Peter Magombeyi, to go to South Africa for medical treatment following alleged beatings by kidnappers on September 14.
The United States is giving Zimbabwe another $ 42 million. The money will be used to buy food for one million people from next month until May 2020.

Zimbabwe on Friday joined the rest of the world in marking International Women's Day, with many women saying they continue to be oppressed and deprived because leaders in the country do not care to promote them to equal opportunities.
Although Zimbabwe has a constitution that binds equality of opportunity between women and men, many of the women we spoke to said there was no need or concern from government officials, political parties, churches or companies to ensure that this happened.
A former member of parliament and lawyer, Ms Jessy Majome, told Studio 7 that women are suffering the most in the country due to the negligence of men in leadership positions.
They say there is a great opportunity for the country to close the gap between women and men if the constitution is adhered to.
The head of the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association, Abigail Matsvai, told Studio 7 that today is a very important day and they are using it to encourage leaders in government to adhere to laws that equalize opportunities between men and women.
A member of the Gender Commission, Ms. Tsungirai Hungwe-Chimbunde, told Studio 7 that strong education is needed to make the public aware of the importance of equal opportunities between women and men.
He said his commission was trying its best to reach out to various political parties to give their members equal opportunities in the elections so that more women could run for office.
This year's celebrations are being held under the theme, Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change.
Ms Majome said in line with the theme, the electoral commission should use these powers to provide equal seats for women and men in the 2023 elections.
Ms. Matsvai has supported these reform groups in the leadership positions.
Ms Majome also said it was important for women to unite and fight their battles together and not be exploited by men.
He said it was clear that many men in office did not want to leave the party, which was why they were fighting women and giving them less opportunities to run for office.
International Women's Day is celebrated annually on March 8 as a way to celebrate women's progress in economic, political and other fields as well as to promote equality of opportunity between women and men around the world.
Government-sponsored celebrations were held in Gokwe in the Midlands region and many organizations also held ceremonies in various locations. MDC leader Nelson Chamisa was marking the day in Chitungwiza.
Other media outlets today, including the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, said it was difficult for women to move forward with the current economic situation as no one was giving them a chance.
The Zimbabwe Peace Project has also issued a statement marking the day to protest against human rights abuses, including violations of human rights abuses in January following a nationwide protest.
The Labor Court has ruled that children who are absent from work must return to work within 48 hours as their activities are illegal.
Labor Court judge Rodgers Manyangadze and Lawrence Murasi have given the doctors two days to return to work.
The court also ruled that a dispute between the children's doctor and the government should be referred to a mediator in order to resolve the matter within 14 days.
Former vice-president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors' Association, Doctor Masimba Ndoro, said despite the ruling, doctors were not qualified to go to work.
Asked by Studio7 if they were afraid of losing their jobs if they did not comply with the court's order, Dr. Ndoro said employers should take action to get workers back to work.
The lawyer for the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors' Association, Doug Coltart, said he did not agree with the outcome but would look into the reasons.
Coltart also said he had a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling if doctors wanted to take action.
Studio7 was unable to hear the side of the health minister, Dr. Obadiah Moyo, along with the Health Services Board,
The doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they had no work to do.
Remaining senior doctors at work also staged a sit-in on Thursday last week complaining about salaries and conditions in hospitals.
The US government says that Cyclone Idai devastated Manicaland province and that the tragedy will continue to affect its people.
Speaking to Studio 7 at the US embassy, ​​Jason Taylor, USAID's director of disaster relief, said that while they were working with other agencies to rehabilitate roads and rebuild damaged buildings, they were now focusing more on food security to save lives.
Taylor said the crisis in Manicaland was so serious that the Zimbabwean government could not do it on its own.
Taylor, who visited Manicaland province with a World Food Program helicopter, where he is investing, said he was shocked to see the mental anguish in the region.
He said the children he saw were unhappy. He said it was important that after the people of Manicaland benefited from such things as food and housing, they should also be helped to regain their composure.
Taylor also said that in Chimanimani and Chipinge they did not see or meet with residents who said they were not getting help because of the political party they support.
USAID has also said it has the expertise to train Zimbabweans to look into the sky to determine when, and where the storms are likely to occur, as well as what steps they can take to prevent the destruction of lives and property if requested by the government.
Since the outbreak of Cyclone Idai, the United States has provided Zimbabwe with $ 2.6 million.
Meanwhile, the government, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations today launched a $ 60 million emergency relief fund for Cyclone Idai.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people need help in Manicaland province, and of these, 129,000 are young children.
In the nine districts disrupted by Cyclone Idai, 113 schools were destroyed, leaving 90,000 students homeless.
The government says more than 300 people are unaccounted for, and another 399 people died in the crash.
This number is expected to rise.
Some patients say they are being treated abroad following a strike by children's nurses who say they fear they may die in hospitals without treatment.
A study conducted by Studio 7 has revealed that some patients are now traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Botswana and Zambia for treatment there following the strike by the children's nurse.
One of the patients we spoke to at Parirenyatwa, Ms Molline Chindove, said she had been coming to the hospital for days for treatment but nothing was moving.
Ms Chindove said she was going to South Africa for treatment for fear of dying of thirst with her legs in the water.
One of her relatives, Fiona Muchabaiwa, said she had no choice but to transport her patient to Zambia tomorrow for treatment, saying it was too expensive.
A study conducted by Studio 7 has revealed that many of the previously closed public hospitals are causing more and more people seeking treatment to leave public hospitals for treatment in private hospitals.
Wilbert Kasanze said he had taken his wife from Chegutu General Hospital to be treated at a private hospital in Chitungwiza.
Kasanze says the daily bus ride from Chegutu where he lives to Chitungwiza is causing his pocket money to run out.
The Health Services Board has announced that the retired child nurses will return to work immediately.
The board also called on all strikers to resign and urged them to re-apply if they still wanted a job.
This follows a statement issued by Deputy President Constantino Chiwenga calling for all striking nurses to resign.
But Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights says the dismissal of children by the government as a nurse without a dismissal certificate is illegal.
Football star Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Spanish club Barcelona, ​​says he is breaking up his marriage with his country after failing to win a single trophy.
Messi made the remarks after the Copa America tournament hosted in the United States when Argentina lost in the final to Chile for the second time as Chile lifted the trophy.
Chile defeated Argentina on Sunday when Francisco Silva drunkenly sent Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero to the wrong side.
The two teams had drawn 0-0 in front of 82,000 supporters in East Rutherford in New Jersey.
Teams playing in the Copa America come from North and South America.
Three years ago, Argentina lost to Chile in the finals after the teams drew 0-0 again. Messi scored the first penalty and failed. Argentina lost 4-2 on penalties.
Messi then told Argentina's TyC Sports broadcaster that he had stopped playing for Argentina because he had failed to win the trophy despite his ambition.
Messi is 29 years old.
And he managed to win four Champions League trophies with Barcelona. But he has not won a Copa America or World Cup with Argentina.
Some patients in Bulawayo were failing treatment at two of the city's largest public hospitals when a doctor's strike entered its fourth day on Tuesday.
When Studio7 arrived at Mpilo Hospital during the day, some patients were being sent home as they were being treated for serious illnesses such as pregnant women with birth defects.
A resident who identified herself only as Ms Dlamini told Studio7 that she had come to the hospital with her swollen legs and was told to return home as they could not be seen by doctors.
We have tried to hear the situation from the hospital's director, Leonard Mabande, but he said we have spoken to the former chief medical officer, Dr Xolani Ndlovu, who said he could not speak to us as he had a lot of work to do.
At United Bulawayo Hospitals the hospital's outpatient unit or Outpatients Department has been closed and a notice issued by the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Narcisaus Dzvanga, also indicates that the hospital is only accepting patients who are critically ill.
Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association spokesman Dr Mthabisi Bhebhe said doctors were continuing to strike across the country despite government calls for them to return to work, saying they had not heard from the government.
Dr Ndlovu said the poor state of affairs in hospitals, including the lack of medicines and other facilities, was the main reason for the strike.
Studio 7 was unable to hear the government's side of the story as we were unable to contact the health minister, Dr Obadiah Moyo.
But Dr Moyo's deputy, Dr John Mangwiro, told Studio 7 on the phone that they could not comment on the matter as they were out of the country and the department's secretary, Dr Gerald Gwinji, did not return calls.
Bulawayo Metropolitan Province MP for proportional representation, Dorcas Sibanda, told Studio 7 that the doctors' strike had been going on for some time, adding that it was unfortunate that the lives of many people were being jeopardized by the government.
Government doctors went on strike on Saturday and in large public hospitals are working doctors who have been working for many years as consultants, or consultant physicians.
Former Highlanders player and coach Barry Daka, 71, has died after a short illness.
Their daughter, Lorraine has told Studio 7 that her father passed away today at their home in Barbourfields.
He said they became ill on Sunday when they were leaving a concert at Barbourfields Stadium and he is thought to have suffered a stroke.
The Highlangers team posted a message on Twitter saying they were "deeply saddened" by the death and said they were mourning the loss of their family and others in sports news.
The club says Mr Daka started coaching the team in 1986 and managed to lift several trophies including the Independence Cup, Chibuku Trophy, Rothmans Shield and NetBrew Cup.
Arrangements for Mr Daka's funeral have not yet been announced.
Prominent musician Thomas Mapfumo says he will join other Zimbabwean children who will protest next month in New York at the start of the United Nations General Assembly, which is expected to be attended by President Robert Mugabe.
Mr Mapfumo said it was important for Zimbabweans to show their displeasure with the way things were going in the country as it was everyone's right to do so if things did not go well.
Mr Mapfumo said he would not be playing the guitar during the protest as he wanted to join Zimbabweans in showing the world government, especially President Mugabe, that things needed to change in the country.
"I am a musician but at the New York I will not be singing I will be joining others to protest against the corruption and oppression of Zimbabweans by the Mugabe government which is no longer popular," Mapfumo told Studio 7.
Organizations such as #ThisFlag led by Pastor Evan Mawarire, Tajamuka, Occupy Africa Unity Square and other NGOs and political parties affiliated with Zimbabweans from different cities are expected to join the protest.
Others expected to be at the rally include Patson Dzamara, the younger brother of human rights activist Itai Dzamara, who went missing last year.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) says there are no talks between the government and teachers on resolving teachers' grievances.
ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure told Studio7 that his organization was unhappy to see students lacking funding for education, while teachers lacked funds to go to work.
Masaraure said many members of his party were writing letters of resignation saying they were looking for other jobs as their salaries were not enough to support their families.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Education, Professor Paul Mavhima, to hear his side of the story.
As the world marks October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Cancer Association of Zimbabwe says it is deeply concerned about the misunderstanding of some people in the country.
The organization reports that many people who claim to have been diagnosed with cancer, first go to a psychiatrist or a psychiatrist, and then to a specialist for serious illness, making it difficult to treat.
Cancer Association of Zimbabwe consultant Priscilla Mangwiro said it was important for people to go to a qualified doctor if they had the problem.
Ms Mangwiro says it is important for people to be screened for cancer, especially breast cancer.
Ms. Mangwiro says breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in Zimbabwe.
Ms. Mangwiro says that since October 1, when it launched its campaign to mark October as Cancer Awareness Month, its organization has tested more than 50 women, and the number will continue to rise until the end of this month.
After hearing about the Cancer Association of Zimbabwe program, a woman, Gertrude Magwaniza, said she took her daughter for a lump in her breast.
Ms Mangwiro says there are many factors that put women at risk of developing breast cancer.
Ms Mangwiro says women need to be monitored for changes in their breasts, and if they do, they should be screened immediately.
Ms Mangwiro says many people think that being diagnosed with cancer means they are dying but there is a lot that can be done to help women live longer.
Ms. Mangwiro says one of the main causes of cancer is eating a diet high in fat and sugar.
Ms. Mangwiro is urging women to take advantage of the October opportunity to get tested for cancer, as well as to be educated about the disease.
More than 5,000 people are infected every year and more and more will see a pediatrician for a serious illness.
The state-owned petrol company Petrotrade says if the government continues to set prices for the purchase and sale of motor fuel, the problem of fuel shortages will not go away.
Responding to a parliamentary proposal on fuel prices, former Petrotrade chief executive Godfrey Ncube said this was only possible if businesses were given the opportunity to buy fuel and sell at their own expense.
Mr Ncube acknowledged that doing so would raise prices but said it was the only way out of the country's long-running oil crisis.
Mr Ncube said waiting for the government's oil supply was slowing down oil prices in the country as they were getting more fuel in the long run.
Mr Ncube pointed out the shortage of fuel purchased by government assistance with the example he gave, saying that in the first six months last year, they sold 50 million liters, but in the same period this year they sold only 36 million liters.
Asked when her department hopes to address the fuel shortage crisis, fire department secretary Gloria Magombo said the problem would not go away if foreign investment was low.
He also said that addressing the issue needs the whole country and not just his department.
Asked whether the plan to use the Smart Card to buy fuel was mentioned by the governor of the central bank, John Mangudya, when he said the card would show the amount of fuel consumed by each car in the garage used to buy the fuel, Ms Magombo said the plan was reversed by the COVID-19 scandal. there was a need to buy in China.
Ms Magombo said she could not say when the plan would be successful, although Mr Mangudya told the committee last month that he hoped by the end of June they would try to use the card to see if it worked as intended.
This has angered a parliamentary committee that has said the fire department is failing to do its job as Ms Magombo also said she had heard from members of the committee today that many petrol stations in the country were selling for US dollars or foreign currency coupons.
The committee said it was "deeply concerned" that many developments in the country are being affected by the shortage of fuel.
Zimbabweans on Saturday mark the 40th anniversary of the country's independence from white supremacy, with blacks and other blacks being enslaved.
The advent of black supremacy raised the hopes of many that they would eventually gain a white supremacy, many of whom had been thrown into the abyss by whites as they took all their good land.
But 40 years after the country gained independence, some of them have said things have gotten worse for them compared to the white supremacy, as they no longer have jobs to support their families.
They say that the economic situation is so bad that it is difficult to know what the future holds.
Health issues are said to be at an all-time low as many hospitals in the country are no longer functioning as expected.
A few who are still working say that they often spend it on the streets protesting in order to earn a living.
The inauguration of former president Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2017, following the military ousting of former president Robert Mugabe, has given the public hope for a brighter future.
But most of them have been celebrating the witch and witch doctor, as they say things are getting worse.
But isn't there any good thing that Zanu PF has done for all these 40 years?
Zanu PF North American regional chairman Regis Charumbira says his party has done much to give land to blacks, regardless of party affiliation.
Mr Charumbira said his party had now completed an investigation into who had acquired more farms than others, and that those who had not yet acquired land, including Zimbabweans living abroad, should be acquired.
But Timothy Muringai, deputy secretary general of the MDC-T in North America, said Zanu PF had failed for many years to fulfill all the demands of the liberation struggle.
They say things have deteriorated for years in economic, health and business closures, leaving many workers on the streets unemployed.
Attorney Ntabazinduna Nhlanhlayamangwe Ndiweni or Lord Felix Ndiweni has appealed to the High Court today to challenge his sentence and sentence him to 18 months imprisonment.
Ishe Ndiweni and 23 others were arrested for breaking the fence of Fetti Mbele who wanted to evict him from Ntabazinduna district.
This follows the alleged rape of Mbele's wife, Nonkangelo Mpengesi.
Lord Ndiweni's lawyer, Dumisani Dube, told Studio 7 that the judge did not value the authority of chiefs in his constituency.
Popular musician Thomas Mukanya Mapfumo says he is looking forward to releasing his new album this month after the company's computer computer crashed.
The company is based in Eugene, Oregon in the United States and is called Tracktown Studios. Doctor Mapfumo told Studio 7 that out of the 15 songs he had recorded, only three remained.
The High Court has ruled that Heal Zimbabwe's president, Rashid Mahiya, has set aside bail to be tried from his home.
Mahiya, who has been in Chikurubi prison, is expected to be released on Friday after police said they could not complete their paperwork on time.
Mahiya's lawyer, who works with Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Tonderayi Bhatasara, told Studio 7 that in addition to the $ 1,000 bail bond, the court confiscated Mahiya's travel document and the need for his house and to report to the police twice a week.
"We have accepted the court's ruling because the important thing is for the person to be released and released from detention," Bhatasara told VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe, adding: "
Mahiya is one of a number of people arrested in recent weeks on charges of plotting to overthrow the government after protests erupted over petrol prices.
Speaking to reporters in Harare, the secretary general of the Zimbabwe Medical Association, Sacrifice Chirisa, said he had received a letter from senior doctors or consultant doctors urging them to resign if the government did not address the grievances of young striking doctors.
Chirisa, who also happens to be the chief medical officer, said the workload has increased for senior doctors as junior doctors have been on strike for a month.
Chirisa said that in order to do their job properly, they need young doctors to work alongside them.
Mr Chirisa said the problem of patients in government hospitals was exacerbated by the absence of young doctors and 533 doctors who had been suspended following a move by the Health Services Board.
The general secretary of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Mthabisi Anele Bhebhe, also said he was unhappy with the comments made yesterday by former president Constantino Chiwenga that young doctors were still in school.
Chiwenga, who was appointed by the cabinet to lead the dialogue between the government and the striking doctors, fired the nurses after the strike.
Their actions have been criticized by many who say Mr Chiwenga was using the military on issues that require dialogue.
Young doctors say they want the government to provide them with medical equipment, medicine and protective clothing while on duty as well as an increase in salaries which they say is similar to dog taxes.
But the government also says its coffers are so depleted that it cannot afford to increase them.
We were unable to hear the side of the health minister, Mr Obadiah Moyo, as he immediately attended a meeting with the pediatrician at the time we first went on air.
The Labor Court has rejected the government's request as the government has not submitted any documents in its case against doctors who are not going to work.
Doug Coltart, a lawyer representing the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctor's Association in Labor Court, said the court said there was not enough documentation from the Health Services Board, HSB, and therefore the matter could not be heard legally.
The court ordered the HSB's lawyer to file the missing documents tomorrow, Wednesday.
But doctors have also said that going to court is not the key to getting them to go to work, so it does not solve the problem.
Former vice-president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Doctor Masimba Ndoro, said his job required him to be on a daily basis and he needed to be paid for this.
The junior doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they did not have enough resources to go to work.
Senior doctors from the Zimbabwe Senior Hospital Doctors' Association also went on strike last Thursday, complaining about poor pay and inadequate medical care.
The senior doctors also wrote a letter complaining about the threats they were making and said it was useless for doctors to go to hospitals without adequate facilities to save patients' lives.
The doctors also criticized the government, saying the money had been increased by 60 percent, saying they did not agree with it.
Meanwhile, two other senior doctors have been suspended without pay by the University of Zimbabwe on charges of joining the strike and influencing others to resign.
Suspended is Dr. Bothwell Mbuvayesango, who specializes in pediatric surgery, with Drs. David Chimuka, an expert in the treatment of heart disease.
Dr. Mbuvayesangano made a name for himself in the country after his successful surgery on twins who were born with their heads together in 2014, while Dr. Wake up to a great deal of heart surgery.
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights has strongly condemned the suspension of Dr. Mbuvayesangano with Dr. Get up.
We have not been able to hear from the University of Zimbabwe or to hear from the government on the state of health issues.
But a statement from Health Minister Obadiah Moyo acknowledged that doctors had not heeded the government's call to return to work.
Moyo said the government was awaiting the outcome of the court proceedings, after which he informed the state of the situation.
Doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they did not have enough money to go to work.
The government has signed an agreement with a foreign company to assist in the export of coal to countries such as India and Japan.
Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Victoria Consulting, the Minister of Minerals, Winston Chitando, said the government's intention was for the country to have access to coal trading in India and to raise funds for mining.
Chitando said Zimbabwe has an estimated 25 billion tonnes of coal but between 2 and 3 million tonnes are mined annually.
Chitando also said India is the largest importer of coal per year compared to other countries.
Speaking at the same meeting, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said Zimbabwe should take advantage of the good relations that exist between it and India.
Studio7 has not been able to determine which Victoria Consulting company has worked with, and who its executives are.
But former deputy minister of mineral wealth in the coalition government, Gift Chimanikire, said he did not see the need for Zimbabwe to find markets for coal exports, which currently do not have enough coal mined in the country.
An economist, Nyasha Muchichwa, also said he did not see the need for Zimbabwe to find a foreign company that was interested in Zimbabwe's coal markets.
Mr Muchichwa also said it was better to use existing relations with other countries.
The Ministry of Minerals website says Zimbabwe has the best coal, and has 29 coal-mining areas.
Only two companies in the country, Hwange Colliery and Mountain Resources, are the largest coal miners.
Six members of the MDC-T party led by Nelson Chamisa, who were arrested in Harare on Friday, have been released on $ 1,000 bail each from their homes.
Given bail by Magistrate Chancellor Bianca Makwande, two of Chamisa's deputies; Tendai Biti and Ms. Lynett Karenyi Kore; foreign affairs secretary, Ms. Gladys Hlatywayo; Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Lovemore Chinoputsa; a member of the National Standing Committee, and is the party's deputy secretary general, David Chimhini and Ms Vongai Tome.
The men have been ordered to pay $ 1,000 per person following their arrest yesterday following a dispute over the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai House.
Ms Makwande said the detainees would return to court on July 24 and remain at the address they had registered with the police until their case was heard.
Speaking to Studio 7 after the verdict, one of the six lawyers, Alec Muchadehama, said the court also ordered the people they were representing not to obstruct the investigation into the case.
Mr Muchadehama also said that although the six were yesterday charged with rioting under the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, the detainees, who had appeared in court this morning, were returned to the police station where they were charged with violating the COVID-19 Prevention Act.
The six lawyers have also complained to the court about the alleged treatment of the detainees.
Mr Muchadehama said the detainees were not well protected and could not catch or transmit COVID-19 while in custody.
The party's president, Nelson Chamisa, has said he will continue to fight for change in the country despite the arrests of its members
Ms Makwande has denied that the party's deputy youth spokesperson, Womberaishe Nhende, who is being treated at a hospital, should remain in custody.
Mr Nhende was reportedly injured yesterday when he was arrested and taken to hospital.
In a separate lawsuit, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights alleges that a police officer arrested after comparing President Emmerson Mnangagwa to a used condom was suspended and released on $ 300 bail.
The officer, Shungudzemoyo Kache, will also be tried at his home.
The head of Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries, Walter Magaya, has been adamant about his detention in Zimbabwe, saying he is working with other countries to launch an Aguma drug that he says cures HIV / AIDS, cancer and more.
Speaking to Studio7 at the end of a prayer service in Francistown, Botswana on Wednesday night, Mr. Magaya said he would not back down from his plan to arrest him by police in November 2018 after announcing that he had found a cure for HIV / AIDS.
After pleading guilty to trafficking in HIV / AIDS, Mr. Magaya was fined $ 700 in February last year.
But the incident did not deter Mr Magaya, who told Studio7 that they were working with other countries they did not want to name and said they saw Aguma's cure as a solution to the HIV / AIDS problem.
Mr Magaya said HIV / AIDS was a problem in Africa and therefore required all countries to work together to find a solution to the problem.
Mr Magaya said he saw fit to work with other countries because Zimbabwe was not confident that the drug would cure the country's deadly diseases.
However, in the case against Magaya in Zimbabwe, Aretha Medical Company's company was found to be unregistered with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe, and was reportedly not authorized by the Health Professions Authority to conduct an investigation into whether Aguma's drug was effective.
A doctor at a private hospital in Francistown, Sengaphi Khuzwayo, criticized Magaya for saying he was looking for money.
Mr. Magaya had previously caused controversy in the country after he was arrested for raping another woman, but the case was later dropped by a court after the plaintiffs dismissed the case legally.
The lack of pediatricians in government hospitals has put the lives of pregnant women at risk if they have a problem like the one at Chinhoyi General Hospital.
Ms. Lisa Sibanda is a woman who has suffered from postpartum depression.
Ms Sibanda said her baby, who was still premature, died in the womb when she was delivered on Tuesday, but no doctor was able to help her, saying she had to be helped by a nurse who caused the baby to die.
Ms. Sibanda says the biggest problem has been having their cervix washed so late that it can be detrimental to their health.
Ms. Sibanda says they are also facing water shortages and the toilets at the hospital will not be accessible and they are already collecting rainwater.
Erasmus Zindoga, who brought his wife from Kariba, said he had not received any medical help from a doctor and that a doctor he had seen at the hospital had refused to treat his wife.
Zindoga said he had already rented a car from Kariba to Chinhoyi for the 250km drive as things were not going well at the Kariba hospital.
We have not heard how many women are facing such problems at the Chinhoyi hospital which receives patients from areas including Kariba, Hurungwe, Karoi, Makonde and Zvimba.
Former Mashonaland West health director Tapiwa Dhliwayo says doctors should be on duty throughout the province.
However, she acknowledged that nurses are not the only ones who should treat women who have had a miscarriage, as is the case at Chinhoyi Hospital.

Zimbabwe marked two years on Saturday since the shooting deaths of six people in Harare after scores of people took to the streets to express their displeasure with the conduct of the 2018 elections.
The killings took place around the world as journalists from various countries, who were in Zimbabwe watching the first round of elections for Zanu PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, were vying for the presidency following the violent ousting of the party's former president, the late Robert Mugabe.
Mnangagwa was running against Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance, including leaders of minority opposition parties.
Following the shooting, the government was forced to form a commission to investigate the allegations. The commission had former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe as its chairman.
The commission released a statement indicating that the military and police had killed the six, and said the killers should be brought to justice. It also demanded that the government pay the relatives of the victims.
Mr Motlanthe's commission also said the government should send the children of the deceased to school, and that the police and the army should not place the law in their hands when people protest.
Human rights experts say the government has not yet complied with the Motlanthe Commission.
But Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the government was aware of the Motlanthe Commission and had plans to ensure that the commission's commitments were met.
One of the commissioners who drafted the report, Lovemore Madhuku, who is also the chairperson of the National Constitutional Assembly, said his commission had completed its work and it was up to the Mnangagwa government to ensure it complied with the draft.
Madhuku also said his commission had issued an order for the government to compensate the relatives of the victims because the men had been shot by soldiers and police.
Human rights expert and Human Rights Watch's regional director for North Africa, Dewa Mavhinga, says the government is not showing any interest in implementing the Motlanthe Commission Report.
Mavhinga said it had been two years since the report was released, but no soldier had been arrested as recommended by Motlanthe's commission.

Mr Muchichwa also said the issue of arresting money changers would not solve the problem as they would do so for a few days and then resume their activities.
The finance ministry has also acknowledged that funding for the health sector is insufficient compared to the current health crisis but has said it will continue to improve.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube also told reporters at the press conference that he was pleased with the steps he had taken to improve the country's economy and progress.
But former finance minister Tendai Biti, one of the three MDC-T leaders, says the country's financial crisis is worsening as the country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, is doing more than it should be doing, which is costing the country a lot of money. .
Mr Biti, who also chairs the parliamentary finance committee, said the finance ministry, as well as the central bank, should act in accordance with the rules, and in such a way that the country's financial system does not disappear, as did loans from some senior government officials.
But the finance ministry says the public should be aware that there have been too many years of unspent national money in building the country, so resolving the crisis will take time.

The Guptas were smuggling money to various banks
AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (ANA) It is estimated that R49 billion was misappropriated by the state, according to Shadow World director Paul Edward Holden, according to an investigation.
The director said this at a commission headed by Judge Raymond Zondo yesterday.
According to him, they found that the amount was R49 157 323 233.
68 was regularly deposited in different banks.
Holden said this testifying to the money that was deposited and withdrawn from various banks.
Leading witness, Advocate Matthew Chaskalson, was questioned by Holden.
Holden told the commission that his testimony was based on reports and how money was being paid to Gupta's businesses.
He alleged that the Guptas smuggled R287 million from the Estina Dairy Farm Project.
The plan was to develop farmers in the Free State.
Holden said the Guptas began smuggling money a year before the Estina program began.
The Free State government began funding the Estina program in June 2011 but the Guptas began smuggling money into the program in May 2011.
"They used the Estina system to hide and smuggle money, before the program started," Holden said.
According to the report, the government paid R287 million to the Gupta family, and the money was deposited in various company accounts to make it look like it was making a profit of R880million between 2012 and 2016.

A video that shows everything about the death of the Bridegroom
A RELEVANT video has surfaced of the day Lindani Myeni was killed in Hawaii, USA
In the video, the bridegroom appears as he enters a house in Honolulu, wearing a crown and walks in behind two of the so-called couple.
He appears to have gone to the temple near their home.
He takes off his shoes from the temple and apologizes to the two men.
It is said that after about 40 seconds, the Bridegroom was seen leaving the house and apologizing to the couple.
Just then a woman appeared and called 911, reporting a burglary.
The woman told police she said her husband was in their house breaking into the house.
According to the homeowners, nothing was taken from their home.
Proponents of her case have been working to make the actual transcript of this statement available online.
Attorney Jim Bickerton, however, said the court had forced officials to release the video without filtering it.
Police were also asked to provide records of 911 calls on the day of the incident.
In an interview Bickerton had with Mr. William Denselow on eNCA he revealed that when the Bridegroom left the house he was not upset.
"His last words were to apologize until he disappeared," Bickerton said.
In the first video released police appear to the Bridegroom who asked them who they were, who shot him dead as he died in hospital.
He said they did not know Myeni was apologetic and police had the video but called a press conference saying they were attacked unnecessarily.
Bickerton said they would continue to search for the truth so that it could be known what was happening.
It is alleged that a split in the IFP erupted in Melmoth
They accused IFP councilors of harassing security guards who allegedly shot and wounded three members of the public at a party meeting in Thubalethu, Mthonjaneni (Melmoth), on Sunday afternoon.
It is said that the guards blasted by the Mayor dispersing the crowd of public members who said the bha · monarch closed the entrance to the convention hall.
One section of the community blamed the party's leadership for trying to bring them to their knees as they demanded the return of an IFP-fired local councilor.
The meeting was called by the IFP leadership in the King Cetshwayo region to clarify the issue that has divided the community, as last week he protested against the reinstatement of all expelled councilors, including former mayor Bonginkosi Biyela.
A member of the public who was part of the protest at the time of the shooting, who did not want to be named, accused IFP leaders and councilors present by telling security guards to shoot them so that they could not vent their anger.
"We were protesting on the street because we were not allowed to enter the hall because it was full of people from other areas.
The problem started when we detained another member of the public who was trying to force his way through a closed road, and security guards and councilors who were present got the chance to shoot, "said the member.
The IFP leader in Mthonjaneni, who did not want to be named, said members of the public in the area were divided.
"Last week, there was a protest demanding clarification on the dismissal of their councilor from the ward.
A meeting has been arranged for all councilors and IFP regional leaders to provide feedback to the public.
"The problem started when some members of the public stood in line outside the hall, and when the meeting started, they blocked the entrance to the hall, pelted stones at security guards and forced them to shoot because the community was attacking them.
Some members of the public were armed with firearms, "he said.
The meeting was attended by newly elected mayor Mbangiseni Biyela, his deputy Phumlani Ntombela and all councilors in the Mthonjaneni Municipality.
Attempts to get comment from the regional leadership were unsuccessful as their space calls could be intercepted and messages could not be answered.
A spokesman for the municipality, Thami Shangase, said the meeting was not planned by the municipality, adding that the matter was in the hands of the police.
Contacted, IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the party would issue a statement on the matter today.
Violence began with the dismissal of Biyela (former mayor) and four councilors, creating divisions among members of the public, especially IFP members in charge of the municipality.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said charges of attempted murder and civil unrest had been opened at the Melmoth police station.
Mbete denies ignoring corruption
FORMER Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbethe has dismissed allegations of corruption, saying some of it was a matter of debate.
Ms Mbete, responding to questions from a commission of inquiry into state control by a minority, alleging that some members of Parliament were involved in corruption, said in some cases the allegations were uncontrollable, while others seemed to be rumored because knowledgeable people had no evidence.
He even cited the issue of weapons involving former president Jacob Zuma as an example of the fact that he received a letter written on difficult material but did not know from whom it came.
"Chairperson, I know there have been people who have testified here, and the way the ANC is run.
I also know that the speaker has come here and said that you can't just talk about what you hear being said.
"I can speak of the arms case, the case that was postponed yesterday (Monday).
There is a letter placed under the door of my office.
The letter contained shocking and shocking details but was never signed and no one had written it.
Parliament is so busy, I could not take this book without knowing who wrote it and we talked about it.
The problem is who wrote it, that person had to come to me and understand me.
I am trying to answer now that in Parliament we would not be able to discuss the rumors, "Mbete said.
In June 2017, he was asked what he was doing in a case involving the Gupta family.
"I don't remember very well but I know it's about the leak of news affecting the Guptas.
I think by the time those stories came out, we would have called those who wrote them.
Let's see what they have to say about the world around you.
So that we can get an explanation and be able to do our job, "said Ms Mbethe.
They blamed NSFAS for the death of a student
STUDENTS are blaming NSFAS for the death of a student who allegedly died after sleeping for two days outside the entrance of the institution, Durban Tvet College, in Cato Manor, on Saturday.
It is alleged that the deceased, Yonwabo Manyanya (26), a graduate of Electrical Infrastructure Construction, was evicted by his tenants due to rent arrears.
The deceased was forced to sleep two days outside the center because he had nowhere else to hide following his eviction from his residence on Monday.
It was reported on Wednesday that the deceased was not in good health.
His fellow students reportedly told him he had to find a place to hide.
Yonwabo, who is said to have been living in the area, reportedly died on Saturday in the flat where his friend lived in Durban North.
One of the students, who was close to the deceased, who asked not to be named, said they were shocked by what had happened, and criticized NSFAS for dragging their feet in getting funding.
"I am not in a good mood after the avoidable incident.
I want NSFAS to intervene because it looks like there will be more incidents like this as winter sets in, "said the student.
A family member of the deceased, who could not be reached for comment, said they could not speak to the media about the incident.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no case had been reported.
The financial crisis has also spread to the college's Asherville Campus campus, Sydenham, as more than 50 students protested outside the gates yesterday.
The students told Isolezwe they slept on the street outside the center because they had been evicted from their unpaid accommodation.
Most of the students, who were wearing pajamas, came from as far away as Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga.
Mr Siyabonga Sambu, from Ermelo, Mpumalanga, a third-year Community Safety degree student, criticized the institution and NSFAS for fussing over them when they inquired about their funding applications.
He said since February they had not received any funding, the tenants had been guiding students in employment.
"There is no money for food.
Applicants were provided with transportation costs and a small amount received.
The center is useless and calls for the guards to evict us, "said Sambu.
This was confirmed by Zodwa Mabanga from Johannesburg who said he was living on the street because he had been evicted.
Dr Mthabisi Bhebhe, general secretary of the Mpilo Hospital Doctors Association, said he was unhappy with the outcome and wanted Dr Magombeyi to be found alive. Dr Bhebhe, a former secretary of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, also said he wanted his grievances resolved.
Another doctor, Dr Tawanda Manjonjo, who claims to have worked with Dr Magombeyi, said many doctors were now fearing for his life, but added that unless Doctor Magombeyi was found, he would return to work only if his grievances were resolved.
The director of Mpilo Hospital, Leonard Mabandi, said that as far as he knew, doctors had promised to return to work after a short strike.
A man who identified himself as Walter, who claims to have had his wife treated, says that many patients have not been seen by doctors.
Doctors are on strike after Doctor Magombeyi was abducted. Doctors have been out of work for two weeks saying they will no longer be able to afford transportation.
The government says it is drafting a law banning doctors from striking, but human rights experts say this is unconstitutional.
Thousands of people lined the streets of Kentucky here in the United States bid farewell to boxing champion Muhammad Ali who died on Friday last week at the age of 74.

President Obama sent a message of condolence. A Zimbabwean national living in Louisville, Kentucky, Patricia Chikanga, says the country can learn a lot from honoring deceased athletes.
"I have learned that those who represent the country and die like Muhammad Ali should be honored as we have seen with this boxer. The whole city is full of tourists and locals who have come to mourn Ali. The other day we saw his box coming from the airport. It touched my heart to see that I hope this will be done at home for our athletes when they die, ”Ms Chikanga told Studio 7.
The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) says it is deeply saddened by the experience of Matabeleland South, Matabeleland North and Bulawayo districts as they handed out protective clothing to nurses working in church hospitals in the region.
ZCC has mobilized protective clothing to donate to nurses, doctors and other staff in church hospitals in the three districts.
ZCC secretary general, Pastor Doctor Kenneth Mtata told Studio 7 that they found many people hungry and worried which upset members of their group.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture, and that his confession had been obtained through torture.
He said the government should put politics aside and immediately intervene in helping people who are starving.
Dr Mtata said his organization would inform the government of all its findings so that it could assist as soon as possible as many households are suffering from hunger and anxiety.
The Zimbabwean dollar continues to weaken and inflation continues to skyrocket as in 2007 and 2008.
The American dollar is being traded for $ 32 to $ 40.
Food, fuel, and other commodities have become so expensive that some have called for the use of the national currency.
Speaking at a rally in January, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said he had regained control of the local dollar as no country could survive without its own currency.
But the leader of the main opposition party, Nelson Chamisa, also said the use of the national currency would not work.
But an economist, Professor Gift Mugano, says politicians are not the ones who tell the stock market what to do.
The president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers, Denford Mutashu, also acknowledged the sale of foreign exchange.
The head of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, Chris Mugaga, also said the need to work together for the dollar to work properly.
But Professor Mugano says no dog master has slept in the carrier because even the government has refused to accept the national dollar.
ZCTU secretary general Japhet Moyo also told the employer that things were not going well.
Some economists say the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, RBZ, is in the process of printing money that could keep the country on the brink of collapse.
But RBZ governor, Dr John Mangudya, says this is a lie.
Zimbabwe started using foreign currency, including the US dollar in 2019, but later returned to using only the local dollar last year.
The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee, ZimVac, estimates that 59 percent of Zimbabweans in rural areas are facing starvation from January to July next year.
But in the past month, only about 1 percent of the population needed food in rural areas.
The worst affected areas are Matabeleland North, Masvingo and the Midlands.
Fewsnet, an organization that monitors food security, also says that many city dwellers need help this year as the country's economy deteriorates.
The people who are most affected by the food crisis are residents of Chipinge and Chimanimani where the Cyclone Idai has been hit by a cyclone.
A Chimanimani resident, Joel Dhumakwezu, says his area is receiving food aid from the World Vision organization after those in need of help were registered with the Red Cross.
But they say the unregistered are facing a terrible famine.
Some Gweru residents say they are worried about the spread of coronavirus or Covid-19 following the protection of the city by some local immigrants.
About 120 people have been detained at Gweru Polytechnic since Friday last week.
As many as 30 other people have been detained at Mkoba Teachers' College since yesterday.
These people are among the Zimbabweans being controlled from South Africa and Botswana.
Media secretary Nick Mangwana tweeted that Mkoba Teachers College could accommodate 500 foreign nationals. They also said Gweru Polytechnic is already full.
Resident Ms Enita Nyati told Studio 7 that they feared the spread of coronavirus because some of these people may have been infected and that these people could flee their protected areas.
But another resident, Nyasha Mahwende, said the people should be treated fairly as they are Zimbabweans and relatives and friends of other people.
They also said that in addition to fearing the spread of the disease, they were also concerned that some of these people could be involved in illegal activities and emphasized the need for strong protection.
Studio 7 has been denied access to the two sites by security officials, who say they need permission from the Midlands regional government office.
We have heard from Midlands Minister Larry Mavima and former provincial medical director Dr Reginald Mhene but when we arrived at his office he was said to be in a meeting.
Experts say that in Botswana and South Africa where they were part of the so-called illegal immigrants they were arrested, which put them at risk of contracting coronavirus.
Gweru Mayor Josiah Makombe confirmed to VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe that the coronavirus or Isolation District Hospital is still under construction.
He urged residents to adhere to the guidelines for preventing coronavirus infection but said they should not be afraid, saying they were confident that those who were diagnosed with the virus could be treated.
People's Democratic Party leader Lucia Matibenga, who is also a resident of Gweru, said it was the government's responsibility to keep the returnees safe and to ensure the safety of all other residents.
The Midlands has not yet infected anyone infected with the coronavirus. But the continued repatriation of Zimbabweans from neighboring countries is causing some to shake their heads in fear of the disease.
The president's office on Wednesday held a meeting with doctors on strike for the first time since the doctors began their strike on December 1 last year.
Some senior doctors and specialists or Registrars and Consultants have also gone on strike on Wednesday. Many people in the country say people are losing their lives because of the doctors' strike.
The president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, returned from holiday on Tuesday to join his predecessor, General Constantino Chiwenga, in trying to resolve the doctors' strike.
Spokesman Nick Mangwana said he believed Mnangagwa had returned to work to help put out the blaze.
On Tuesday, Mr Chiwenga had demanded that doctors return to work.
Senior doctors under the Zimbabwe Medical Association have given the government 48 hours to resolve the issue of junior doctors and have gone on strike.
But Mnangagwa's office held a meeting with the leaders of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Dr Elias Muzoremba, to hear the doctors' grievances.
In a letter to reporters, the doctors told the president's office that they were being misled by the Health Services Board.
The doctors say they want the government to address the issue of drug shortages in hospitals and other facilities and to provide them with US dollars in exchange for RTGS.
These doctors are currently earning $ 329 a month. But this money comes in RTGS.
But an economics professor at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Professor Gift Mugano, told Studio 7 that the government could not afford the money at all.
We also asked Dr Mugano how since some companies are now charging in US dollars for their products, how can it be improved?
The head of the Community Working Group on Health, Mr Itai Rusike, told Studio 7 that it was important for the government to give the health sector more money in the budget.
Many in the country are also complaining that Health Insurance cards are not working and when buying medicines from pharmacies they are being told to bring in US dollars just to stay home.
The Warriors national soccer team has left for South Africa for the Cosafa tournament.
The team faces two battles in the Cosafa Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations, which they must win decisively starting with the Cosafa Cup on Saturday.
In addition to using the Cosafa Cup as a preparation for the Afcon, Zimbabwe must once again defend the trophy, which it won for the sixth time last year, hoping to strengthen its reputation as a North African football champion again this year.
Due to financial constraints, Zimbabwe has not been able to find teams to play in pre-Afcon qualifiers and Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa says Cosafa is the only way to strengthen his squad.
Chidzambwa is also looking to add to his reputation in the Cosafa tournament after becoming the first coach to win the trophy four times since the tournament was launched in 1997.
Chidzambwa won the Cosafa Cup in 2003, 2009, 2017 and 2018.
Other Zimbabwean players such as Tendai Darikwa, Admiral Muskwe, and Alec Mudimu also want to appear in the Cosafa Cup which they have been feeling unaware of.
This year, Zimbabwe has the strongest team in all of the tournament as it is rocking their team heading to Afcon including other players such as Knowledge Musona, and Marvelous Nakamba.
A member of the Zimbabwe Warriors Fan Club, Shingirai Miti, says there is no competition for Cosafa because the trophy has always been Zimbabwean.
Having won the Cosafa Cup, the Warriors are looking forward to the first pass from their rally at the Afcon tournament in which they face Egypt in their first match.
The club's player, Ronald Pfumbidzai, says they are not going to Egypt to add existing teams.
Zimbabwe is in Group A with Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda where Warriors manager Wellington Mpandare is confident of leaving.
Zimbabwe is leaving South Africa at the end of the Cosafa tournament on June 8 en route to Nigeria on its way to the Afcon in Egypt.
For many athletes, the Christmas holiday season is a time to be with family and friends, while others take this opportunity to do different things. But this year at a time when some are visiting family and friends after a year without seeing each other, FC Platinum coach Lizwe Sweswe and his team are not getting the chance as they are in Cairo, Egypt, in their match against Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League.
This will be FC Platinum's third match in the competition, after being beaten 2-1 by Sudan's Al Hilal in the first leg, losing 3-0 to Tunisia's Etoile duSahel.
Sweswe says they will be at work working in the hope that Christmas will give them the good fortune to win after being beaten in both games. Another football coach, Darlington Dodo of Caps United, says after failing to win the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League trophy, this is the time to make amends where there was no standing. But the head of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee, Anna Mguni, said they headed to their home to see relatives and friends who had not been seen for a long time. Basketball player, Nyarai Musambudzi, has a similar plan to Ms Mguni's but is heading to Masvingo Triangle coach Taurayi Mangwiro says his workplace is so far away from his family that football has now stopped giving time to his family. This is also the case for former World Cup netball player Ursula Ndlovu, who says he has spent so much time in the camp that he will now be with his family and friends in Bulawayo having fun together. But the chairman of the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association, Ringisai Mapondera, says there is nothing better than a volleyball game at Christmas. Mapondera said he would be gathering with family and friends at his home in Harare to play the game in celebration of this time. There are others like Mapondera including boxer Charles Manyuchi, who says they are taking this time to prepare hard for their next season in anticipation of a strong harvest next year.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) says it has notified the government that it must resolve its grievances within 14 days, failing which it will go on strike.
The union says it wants teachers' salaries to be in US dollars, or to be paid in the equivalent of five hundred US dollars.
The ARTZ report was presented on Friday in the hands of the government through the civil service, the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
Studio7 has not been able to hear from the government side on the matter, as Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa has not been contacted on her mobile phone.
ARTUZ president, Obert Masaraure, says as coaches, they also want a better life, but it is not happening as they wish.
Masaraure says although the government says it is worried about the economy, it can improve things if it fights corruption in its branches, as well as manages public finances.
Masaraure says much of the government's money is being spent on non-essential services such as foreign trips, car insurance and other things that can be set aside in order to provide better salaries for public servants.
Masaraure says in his view, there is money in the country that can fix the problems, but the problem is that the national treasury is not being managed properly, and they do not see the need to fix things from government officials.
Foreign nationals are complaining about the rising cost of obtaining new passports or renewing existing contracts.
This follows a move by the government on Monday this week to announce that it had given permission to the Registrar-General's Secretary-General to start charging Zimbabweans abroad $ 388 million.
Speaking to reporters, Interior Minister Kazembe Kazembe said his department was aware of the high expectations of people to get their passports as soon as possible, and that people who are struggling to get these documents, especially those abroad, have expired documents.
Kazembe said in order to ensure that foreign nationals have legal documents in their home countries, the government has seen fit to raise the price, and that these documents will be issued immediately.
But some expatriates feel that the government has taken this step to raise foreign exchange.
A passport holder in the country pays an average of $ 53 for the RTGS, while the one who wants to get out within three days is charged $ 250.
Requirements for a passport issued within one day are charged $ 380.
The chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, Kindness Paradza, said his committee strongly supported the move to raise passport fees as a way to help these people create access to their documents, without compromising their residency in their home countries.
Paradza said many expatriates had heard of the theft of relatives and friends and paid large sums of money for their passports.
Isaac Nyaumba, a Zimbabwean national, said he was thrilled to have the opportunity to meet and be photographed by world-renowned footballer Neymar.
Neymar, born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and his full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior.
Neymar is currently playing for Barcelona's Spanish club along with another footballer, Lionel Messi. He also plays for Brazil, who led the Under-23 team to a gold medal for the first time in the Olympics.
But although many say Nyaumba and Neymar's picture was taken in Victoria Falls, they told Studio 7 that it was taken while working at the Ukutula Conservation Center, near Pretoria in South Africa.
The Mighty Warriors women's soccer team is facing a major game in its history, with the public wanting Zimbabwe to win in order to enter the country's sporting history.
The Mighty Warriors are entering Rufaro Stadium on Sunday in their biggest match since 1980 when Zimbabwe began international competition.
The women's soccer team is facing the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon in a match that will determine whether or not Zimbabwe is able to qualify for next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Mighty Warriors were beaten 2-1 when the two teams met in Yaounde two weeks ago but they only need a 1-0 win to qualify for the World Cup.
After qualifying for the tournament, the Mighty Warriors make it the second team in 35 years to compete in the tournament following the 1980 gold hockey girls.
But the Mighty Warriors go down in history as the first team to compete successfully in the tournament as hockey girls went to Moscow after being invited to the shortlisted teams.
Warriors Fan Club member, Zivanai Moroyiwa, says they are delaying the game saying that the Mighty Warriors will make the public happy by doing what the team or any team has not done in the last 35 years.
Caps United fan Tonderayi Matimura says looking at the Mighty Warriors' performance when the two teams met two weeks ago, they are confident the Mighty Warriors will take control and win again.
The Zimbabwe Football Association has recognized the importance of the public in the game and has arranged for the public to pay a one-dollar fee to watch this important game.
Sports commentator Andrew Rwodzi says more people will be in the stadium as the dollar is a money that everyone can afford to pay to watch this important game.
Mr Matimura said he would also be present at the stadium as the dollar is a cheaper currency than the three dollars that Zifa calls for.
The team's coach, Shadreck Mlauzi, has built a strong team that includes both seniors and juniors and he expects players such as Rudo Neshamba and Rutendo Machingura to set fire to Sunday in front of their supporters.
At the same time the Warriors team will be at Bourfields Stadium where they face Lesotho in the African Nations Championship match which weighs less than the Mighty Warriors match.
The club's coach, Kalisto Pasuwa, sacked three players Hardlife Zvirekwi and Justice Jangano of Caps United and Ronald Chitiyo of Dynamos on sexual offenses but Muroyiwa said the Warriors did not stop small teams like Lesotho.
The Warrriors are hoping to win two games between the two teams to advance to the finals of the African Nations Championships for the fourth time in a row after qualifying for the 2009, 2012 and 2014 tournaments.
But the eyes and minds of the public are on the Mighty Warriors game.
Street vendors in Harare's interior and members of the Tajamuka / Sesijikile movement have joined forces to fight against the city police and the Zimbabwe Republic Police, who have reportedly forcibly evicted them from their businesses.
The same thing happened in the town of Norton, where street vendors reportedly refused to be evicted while selling at Katanga.
Tajamuka / Sesijikile spokesperson, Makomborero Haruzivishe, said some of the street vendors were members of his organization who were constantly harassed by the police.
Haruzivishe said by the time we went on air they were still at the police station to try to determine how many people had been arrested in the incident, but said they were aware of one person.
Harare City Council spokesman Michael Chideme said they had not heard of the incident as they were not in town during the day.
But the government, through the Ministry of Information, posted a message on Twitter stating that many youths had been stoned to death by police.
The government has also said it has video evidence of the teenagers stabbing police officers, which will be used in court to impale the detainees.
We have not been able to hear from the police on the matter.
The Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, an organization representing Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa, says it is deeply concerned about the increase in robberies in Johannesburg's suburbs, which are being perpetrated by suspected Zimbabweans.
The group says the crimes, mainly in Hillbrow, Berea and Yeoville, are home to many foreign nationals, including Zimbabweans, including kidnappers, kidnappers, stabbed and murderers.
Zimbabwe Community in South Africa spokesperson Bongani Mkwananzi said they were planning to meet with the police to raise the issue, and to urge the police to take serious action.
He said February 6, which will be next month, his organization is looking forward to meeting with the police in charge of the provinces to work together to address the problem.
They also say that the police should be patrolling the area, but they are often unavailable, which will lead to thieves and robbers doing Jojina's bidding.
Mr Mkwananzi said many of the victims knew of some of the perpetrators in their own language, so the police who are committed to the crime should be working with Zimbabweans living in these areas.
Others who have spoken to Studio7 are also advocating for the deployment of troops in these areas in order to stop these crimes.
South Africans have long accused foreign nationals of increasing crime, drug trafficking, and prostitution.
Many people say that the year 2019 will mark the beginning of a difficult political and economic year for the country.
The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Dormaa East, Mr Paul Apraku Twum Barimah, has filed an urgent question in Parliament to demand the cost of chartered flights that former President John Mahama used for his overseas travels from 2013 and 2017.
He said the question, which was directed to the Minister of Finance, Mr Ken Ofori-Attah, would help him and Ghanaians to seek data to support ongoing discussions in the public domain concerning presidential chartered flights by the former president.
“I have filed the question to also understand how much it cost this country between 2013 to 2017 when former President Mahama was on series of travels using chartered flights,” he said.
No equalisation
Throwing light on his aim for filing the urgent question, which is currently in the Speaker’s Office, Mr Barimah said his question had no political connotation.
“It is about time we took a decision as a country on chartered presidential flights and we can only take such decision when we know the trend, which must be established from what has been done previously.
“Has there been a precedence? And if there is a precedence, what was done? And is there an official guideline to these presidential travels? So clearly, I do not want to achieve any political equalisation,” he said.
He added: “I only want us to have a proper debate and discourse so that we can make proper references. Today, it might be my government but tomorrow it will be somebody’s government, so if we do not seek proper clarification and end these back and forth travels, we will always find ourselves in this situation,” he stated.
Ablakwa’s urgent question
The Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, also filed an urgent question in Parliament demanding that the government explains why President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo did not use the presidential aircraft for a recent trip to France.
According to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) North Tongu Member of Parliament (MP), "It is an outrage and a blatant betrayal for Ghana to own a presidential aircraft in perfect working condition" and charter aircraft for presidential travel.”
He also estimated that the President's trip cost in excess of GH¢2 million.
The Bono East Regional Minister, Mr Kwasi Adu-Gyan, has commended the regional leadership of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) for their cooperation towards peace in the region.
“I am proud and extremely excited to see the NPP and the NDC in Bono East working together peacefully, in resolving the political impasse between them,” he said.
Mr Adu-Gyan said peace created an enabling environment for development to thrive and added that without peace it would be difficult for development to progress in the region.
The regional minister gave the commendation in a statement issued after a forum in Techiman.
The forum was attended by representatives of the NPP and the NDC, representatives of traditional authorities, security agencies, the Electoral Commission (EC), the National Commission or Civic Education (NCCE) and civil society organisations (CSOs).
The forum, which was organised by the National Peace Council with sponsorship from the Commonwealth Secretariat, was on the theme: “Countering Post 2020 Election Violence, and Building Consensus for Greater Political Tolerance in Ghana”.
Topics discussed centred on dealing with election-related violence and resolving election-related complaints and disputes.
Mr Adu-Gyan said Ghanaians ought to be proud of the country being ranked the second most peaceful in Africa by the Global Peace Index Report 2021, and underlined the importance for the NPP and the NDC to collectively help to preserve and strengthen the prevailing peace in the country.
“This achievement is a collective effort of the chiefs, political parties, security services, as well as the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and the media,” he said.
He gave an assurance that the Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) would ensure the required peace needed for development was maintained.
In a presentation on Electoral Justice, the Executive Secretary of the Bono Regional Peace Council, Alhaji Suallah Abdallah Quandah, said electoral justice played a decisive role in ensuring the stability of the political system in the country.
“The role of electoral justice, although not new, has become recognised as a crucial factor in all democracies, whether emerging or established,” it said and explained electoral justice was a prerequisite for preventing political and election violence.
Alhaji Quandah stressed the need for periodic review of the nation’s electoral justice system to ensure it fulfilled its function of guaranteeing free, fair and credible elections.
The MP for Abuakwa South Samuel Atta Akyea has assured Ghanaians a Nana Akufo-Addo-led government will ameliorate their plight when the NPP takes over power from January 7, 2017.
According to him, Ghanaians will experience economic freedom under the leadership of Nana Akufo-Addo due to prudent economic policies that will be rolled out.
“January 7 will be a new era which is going to bring our prosperity and our freedom, especially economic freedom which Ghanaians are craving. Ghanaians are going to notice that God has saved the country from hardship,” Atta Akyea said during a donation to Asiakwa SOS in the East Akim Municipality in the Eastern region.
He said he is ready to serve in a ministerial capacity should he be offered one by President-elect Nana Akufo-Addo.
Some of the items he presented include seven bags of rice, cooking oils, salt, sugar, milk, drinks and undisclosed amount of money.
Three sisters who slept in their mother’s drinking spot have been found dead at Tarkwa-Nsuta in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem municipality in the Western region.
The three died after inhaling fumes from a generator.
Chief Inspector George Sekyi of the Tarkwa-Nsuta station office said on December 18, he received a call that three children had died in a drinking spot.
He said he and his officers rushed to the scene but were told that the deceased Abena Amos, 15, Arabi Dadzi, 13 and Akaba Dadzi, 7, have already been deposited at the Tarkwa Government Hospital morgue awaiting autopsy.
In an interview with Starr News’ Emmanuel Ohene Gyan Mr. Sekyi said the deceased lived with their mother, who operates the ‘Golden City Kitchen’ drinking spot in the Tarkwa Nsuem municipality.
He said they decided to pass the night in the drinking bar after they assisted their mother to sell beverages.
The station officer said on December 17, there was a power outage as result of a heavy downpour that occurred during the day and because of that Madam Dadzi put a generator in the bar to enable the deceased have access to light as they slept. The mother of the girls later found them dead when she went to the shop the next morning.
A fourth sister who was also found unconscious is receiving medical treatment. Police in the area are investigating the incident.
Flagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) John Mahama says he will pursue the Chief Executive Officer for Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah popularly known as NAM 1, to retrieve held up investment of customers if he wins the December polls.
Speaking at Tarkwa-Nsuaem in the Western Region, Mr Mahama wondered why the Akufo-Addo government does not appear to be interested in confiscating the properties of NAM1 but rather venting their anger on customers.
“What is so special about NAM 1 that Akufo-Addo is shielding him? Why do you unleash the police on innocent customers while NAM 1 walks free,” he fumed.
He assured that his next government will thoroughly investigate NAM1 and his directors and use all legitimate means to retrieve the funds.
he Circuit Court in Accra presided over by Her Honour Ellen Asamoah on September 7 adjourned the case in which Chief Executive officer (CEO) of Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah (NAM1) has been adjourned to October 1, 2020.
The State had previously on June 24, 2020, filed new charges against NAM 1 at the Accra Circuit Court.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sylvester Asare then told the Court that his directives were that he should hold on to the new charges and the plea taking of the accused.
On July 20, ASP Asare told the court that, they were seriously working to advise the court on the matter.
To this end, he prayed the court for a long adjournment after which they would have been able to advise the court on their intention of prosecution on the matter.
He said when the advice is ready, they will issue hearing notice to the accused persons to appear before the court to to do the needful.
But in court on Monday, prosecutor prayed for an adjournment and it was granted.
The accused person NAM 1 was present in court.
The Circuit Court on July 26, 2019 granted NAM 1 bail in the sum of GH¢ 1 billion cedis with five sureties, three to be justified.
He had pleaded not guilty to all initial 13 charges levelled against him by the State. The state had since amended its charged sheet which is yet to be moved.
He is also to report to the police every Wednesday at 10:00 hours.
He was initially charged with abetment of crime, defrauding by false pretences, carrying on a deposit-taking business without licence, sale of minerals without licence, unlawful deposit-taking, and money laundering.
It is alleged that the accused had taken various sums of money, totalling GH¢1.6 billion from customers.
The surge in the use of Okada for commercial purposes is increasingly becoming worrying.
The police have also indicated an increase in incidents of crime, accidents, and violations of road traffic regulations involving motorcycles.
Without any doubt, the Okada menace is getting out of hand and something drastic needs to be done to inject sanity into its operations.
We have on countless occasions raised serious concerns about the use of Okada.
At this moment, the nation is clearly confronted with the challenge of dealing with the usage of motorbikes and tricycles, especially for commercial purposes.
Parliament in 2012 passed the Road Traffic Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180) into law to regulate road transport in the country.
Among other things, Regulation 128 under sections one to four (Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2180) outlaws the use of motorbikes popularly referred to as ‘Okada’ and tricycles for commercial purposes except for courier and delivery services. It also directs the licensing authority not to register a motorcycle to carry a fare-paying passenger.
This legislation, notwithstanding, okada and tricycle (pragya) have taken over the transportation system in many parts of the country.
In the rural communities, the okada and pragya come in handy as the only means of transport to markets, health facilities and other towns, among other places.
For people in the cities, they are able to beat the heavy traffic by patronizing the bikes.
The bikes also serve as a cheap source of transportation as they are less expensive.
They also come in handy because of the absence of an efficient and reliable public transport system.
However, many people abhor okada and pragya because of the nuisance they create on the roads and most particularly the lack of respect for traffic regulations.
The high incidence of accidents and fatalities associated with the reckless use of Okada, is also disturbing.
Indeed, many organisations, including the Ghana Medical Association and the National Road Safety Authority, have called for a total ban on their usage as a mode of transport in the country.
This has left the country in a deep-blue sea.
This is because, despite the existence of the law banning their use for commercial purposes, they are a major source of relief to many Ghanaians.
For us at the Daily Graphic, we think that the country should relook at the law comprehensively and come up with the most appropriate measures that will suit the needs of the population in line with best practice.
In India, for instance, pragya is a major means of transport but we have not heard of complaints as we have in Ghana.
So, what can we learn from India and introduce it into our system?
We need to bear in mind that with the increasing rate of unemployment, the okada and tricycle operators see it as a source of income which caters for them and their families.
But as of now, okadas and pragyas are a nuisance and we at the Daily Graphic believe that with education, regulation and enforcement of the appropriate regimes, the operators must be made to conform if it is established that the country cannot do without them.
In reviewing the current law or system under which they operate, professional training, a licensing regime both for the rider and motorcycle/motor tricycles as well an insurance cover to cater for accidents will be most appropriate.
With such a system in place, it will be easier for the Ghana Police Service to enforce the law and also deal with unregistered motorbikes and motor tricycles as well as those involved in criminal activities.
Currently, Ghanaians are divided over the regularisation of these two major means of transport because of their advantages and disadvantages.
The Daily Graphic believes that if we want to have decency on our roads and improve our transportation system, then we have to comprehensively hold the bull by the horn and address the problem now or never.
I don’t recall a happier day in my recent memory in Ghana than last Friday, the Green Ghana day.
This was the day that we were all urged to go out and plant a tree.
Since I came back to Ghana 20 years ago and to the realisation that the reality of our country was very different from what was in the Geography books, this was the most successful attempt at doing something to reverse the catastrophic degradation of our lands.
Five million seedlings were made available by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for us to plant and there was a joyful atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed for a long time.
It might well be that enough Ghanaians had noticed that the one thing that needed our attention more than anything else was the state of the land mass that we call Ghana.
Far more than any potholed road, any dilapidated school, any hospital without beds or any schoolchildren without computers and I daresay, even the worst of any rampaging virus, what we should all get and remain agitated about is the state of our land, the land that had lost its forest cover, the rivers that are drying up, what used to be a wet month of May turning out hot and totally dry.
I haven’t taken a look at the Geography textbooks that are being used in our schools today, but I do know that the characteristics of the land mass of Ghana in the books I used at school certainly do not look like present day Ghana.
We still talk about dense tropical forests, but that is not the reality of our lands.
We still talk about wild animals but they had been hunted down and their habitats taken over long ago.
The dense tropical forests and wild animals now exist only as part of our language and not part of our reality.
Even what we thought were forest reserves have been shown to have been hollowed out in the search for gold and other minerals.
Maybe our reality got through to most of us and I am hoping that those who did not take part had very good reasons not to have done so.
