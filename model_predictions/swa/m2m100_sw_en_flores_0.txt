Outside of the savannah, it’s difficult for major animals with a system of food discharge as human to explain their non-aminate needs from existing plant materials.
Unfortunately, failure to do so has severe consequences: growth disruption, disruption, and eventually death.
Obtained plant resources could easily be the proteins found in leaves and clients, but these are difficult for those of the high-quality mammal group as we breathe unless they are buried.
In comparison, animal foods (fruit, beef, beef) are not that they are easily mixed, but they also provide high levels of protein that contain essential amino acids.
All of the things understood, we shouldn’t be surprised if our creators have broken out their “proteins” in the same way as the savannah meat is doing today.
