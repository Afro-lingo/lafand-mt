Extremist Rebels Launch Deadly Attack in Northeast Nigeria
Islamic extremist rebels have killed at least seven people in an attack in northeast Borno state in Nigeria, witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The rebels attacked Kautukari village in the Chibok area of Borno on Tuesday evening, said residents.
The attack happened at the same time that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the state to meet with survivors of jihadi violence.
The Chibok area is 115 kilometers (71 miles) away from Maiduguri, the state capital, where Guterres met with former militants being reintegrated into society and thousands of people displaced by the insurgency.
They came in large number with superior firepower (and) took over the community, said Hassan Chibok, a community leader.
Troops from a nearby military base were deployed to repel the attack but "the damage had been done," Chibok said, adding that "casualties are up to 10."
Another resident Yana Galang said at least seven people were killed in the latest violence before the Nigerian military intervened.
Nigerian police did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the attack.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 206 million people, continues to grapple with a 10-year-old insurgency in the northeast by Islamic extremist rebels of Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province.
The extremists are fighting to establish Shariah law and to stop Western education.
More than 35,000 people have died and millions have been displaced by the extremist violence, according to the U.N. Development Program.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier this week that the war against the extremists is "approaching its conclusion," citing continued military airstrikes and the mass defection of thousands of the fighters, some of whom analysts say are laying down their arms because of infighting within the jihadi group.
The violence, however, continues in border communities and areas closer to the Lake Chad region, the stronghold of the Islamic State-linked group, ISWAP.
Things are getting worse in Kautukari village in Chibok and adjourning areas closer to the forest, said community leader Chibok, saying the extremists' presence near the forest is a contributing factor.
Reporting Under Attack in South Sudan, Sudan
Journalists in both Sudan and South Sudan say threats, intimidation and arbitrary arrests are part of everyday life, limiting their ability to inform the public.
South Sudan ranks 128th and Sudan ranks 151st out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders annual World Press Freedom Index, released Tuesday to coincide with the United Nations annual recognition of World Press Freedom Day.
The bigger the number, the worse the environment for news media.
Irene Ayaa of the Association for Media Development in South Sudan says government censorship in her country is widespread.
Last month, we registered four articles removed from newspapers, she said.
Between January and March alone, security personnel removed dozens of articles from the Juba Monitor, Anna Namiriano, editor-in-chief of an English-language daily, told South Sudan in Focus.
"They removed stories and we left the space blank. They say why we are not listening to them, so on 17th of March, they suspended the newspaper."
In February, a handful of journalists were briefly detained for covering a press conference by opposition lawmakers in parliament.
A Juba Monitor newspaper article about the incident was removed by security agents at the printing plant.
We dont have freedom of the press in the country, Namiriano said.
"The solution is let us do our work as media houses. We have the code of conduct, we have the media law to guide us, and removal of stories is really very bad."
South Sudans information minister, Michael Makuei, insists press freedom is alive and well in his country.
South Sudan is the only place where journalists are free, where they enjoy absolute freedom according to the law.
I say, 'according to the law,' because there is nothing absolute in this world, Makuei told South Sudan in Focus.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights refutes that assertion.
In a report issued last October, it said the government is harassing activists, journalists and their families, limiting their activities and targeting their work and finances.
South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, according to the commission.
South Sudan has a lot of work to do to establish and solidify the institutions that are critical to a well-functioning democratic state, David Renz, charge daffaires for the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan, said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the U.S. remains deeply concerned about the state of press freedom in South Sudan.
We have seen some of the local radio stations shut down over very trivial matters, Renz said.
"And we also are aware that journalists of radio and television and even social media are self-censored" and wary of local and national governments actions "to penalize journalists who say things the government would prefer that they not say."
Further complications from coup
In Sudan, journalists in the capital city of Khartoum say harassment and threats have increased since the October 25 military takeover.
Shoggi Abdulazeem, an investigative journalist in Sudan, said he received a death threat in November and was warned not to speak to international media.
I was hosting live on Al Jazeera and after leaving their office, eight armed security men followed me in a pickup.
They surrounded my car, Abdulazeem said.
He told South Sudan in Focus he was blindfolded and moved around "for more than two hours" and was ordered "not to criticize the military again."
Covering pro-democracy protests in Sudan continues to be a dangerous endeavor, Abdulazeem said.
Many newspapers, TV channels and radio stations received directives not to host or conduct interviews with some named individuals who criticize military leaders, Abdulazeem said.
He added, "There are intelligence officers who are assigned to monitor this situation."
Aisha Assamani, an executive member of the independent Sudanese Media Network, told South Sudan in Focus he has recorded more than 10 attacks on journalists and media houses since last year's coup.
They are targeting freedom of speech with so much excessive force, Assamani said.
"The majority of our journalists now are fearful and their lives are in danger.
Most of them remain anonymous due to the danger of the situation."
On December 30, Sudanese security forces stormed the offices of three television stations al-Arabiya, al-Hadath and al-Sharq firing tear gas, assaulting staff and destroying broadcast equipment, according to local news media.
That same day, security forces detained al-Sharq correspondents Maha Al-Talb and Sally Othman for hours before releasing them.
On January 16, Sudanese authorities withdrew the broadcast license of Al Jazeera Live and closed its office in Khartoum.
A letter from the Information Ministry to the director of Al Jazeera television in Sudan attributed the closing to an "unprofessional approach" and media content that "harmed the countrys higher interests and national security."
The Doha-based network condemned the closure.
In February, Sudanese authorities arrested a group of BBC reporters in Khartoum and questioned them for several hours before releasing them.
VOA repeatedly called Sudans government for comment, but those calls to Brigadier General Attahir Abu Haja, press advisor to military leader Abdul Fattah al-Burhan went unanswered.
Michael Atit reported from Khartoum, Sudan; Deng Ghai Deng and Manyang David Mayar reported from Juba, South Sudan.
At Least 30 Burundian AU Soldiers Killed in Al-Shabab Attack, Official Says
At least 30 Burundian soldiers were killed and 20 others injured in Tuesday's attack by al-Shabab militants on an African Union base in southern Somalia, according to a Burundian official.
The official, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to media, told VOA Somali that 10 soldiers died on the spot, and the rest of the soldiers succumbed to their wounds.
He confirmed that other soldiers are still missing.
Al-Shabab said it killed 173 soldiers in the attack on the AU base in the village of El-Baraf, about 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu.
The casualty figure has not been independently verified.
A separate source told VOA Somali that 161 soldiers were at the camp at the time of attack.
The Burundian official confirmed that number.
The Burundian official told VOA Somali that the soldiers had intelligence al-Shabab was gathering in a nearby village about 48 hours prior to the attack.
He said the soldiers prepared to defend themselves and dug trenches.
He said what caught the soldiers by surprise was the enormity of al-Shabab explosives detonated at the camp.
He said the militants used three truck bombs, one of which fell into a ditch.
He estimated the militants detonated about 20 kilograms of explosives, and that 450 militants overran the camp.
The official said the suicide truck bombs caused most of the casualties.
Earlier, the government of Burundi reported 10 of their soldiers were killed, with five others missing and 25 injured.
Burundi also said 20 al-Shabab militants were killed in the attack.
On Twitter, Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye said there are no words strong enough to condemn the terrorist attack against the Burundian contingent.
He wrote, "I join with all of Africa which has just lost sons and daughters to console the hard-hit families."
The African Union, the Somali government and the embassy of the United States in Mogadishu have all strongly condemned the al-Shabab attack.
AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat paid tribute to the Burundian soldiers killed, and said the "heinous" attack will not lessen support of AU forces to Somalia.
The Somali ministry of foreign affairs called on the international community to increase and provide higher-end capability to Somali security forces and AU forces so they can effectively combat terrorism in Somalia.
The U.S. embassy in Mogadishu said the U.S. extends condolences to the families of the troops killed and wished a quick recovery to those injured.
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, told VOA that Tuesday's fighting at the camp was the heaviest the area has seen.
Fighting like this never happened in this area, he said, explaining that the violence also killed two civilians and injured 10 others. "It was heavy fighting."
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, gave it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to the Somali government.
The mission's mandate runs through the end of 2024.

Kenya Trains Domestic Workers in Middle East About Rights
Kenyan authorities are training domestic workers who accept jobs in the Middle East about their rights after years of reported abuses there, including beatings, rapes and deaths.
It's been a year since Bernard Njenga learned his wife, Esther Thuku, had died in Saudi Arabia, where she had been a domestic worker for three years.
Saudi authorities reported that his wife had committed suicide at her employer's home, Njenga said, but he believes the mother of four was murdered.
Njenga said his wife's body did not have any marks that would show that she had hanged herself.
It appeared the body had been buried because it was very dirty and looked like she had been stabbed on the left side, he added.
Kenyan authorities say that since November, at least 23 domestic workers have died while working in the Middle East.
Most of those deaths occurred in Saudi Arabia, according to labor officials.
Saudi authorities have reported that all 23 of those deaths resulted from cardiac arrest.
In April of 2020, rights advocacy group Amnesty International reported that Kenyans who have jobs as domestic workers in the Middle East often complain of lack of payment, forced labor, physical abuse, rape and dangerous working conditions.
Now, Kenya is offering safety training for domestic workers who take jobs abroad.
When you don't train them, basically, you are exposing them to a lot of exploitation and abuse, said Edith Murogo, director at East Africa Institute of Homecare Management in Nairobi.
"Part of the training also includes labor rights awareness.
They have to know how to bargain and talk to employees about decent terms and conditions of employment."
An estimated 30,000 Kenyans migrate to the Middle East to find work each year.
Kenya's cabinet secretary for labor, Simon Chelugui, said his department is working with Saudi officials on labor law reforms.
We would want them also to upscale their law to protect workers and employers equally, not to discriminate and have the attitude of the employer is right always, Chelugui said.
"Number two is the pay is reasonable and commensurate to the work."
VOA reached out to the Saudi embassy in Nairobi for comment on alleged mistreatment and deaths of Kenyan workers.
In an email response, the embassy said the kingdom does not condone illegal and ill treatment of anyone and said Riyadh is working with Nairobi to protect citizens from any offense.
Meanwhile, officials say with an estimated 2 million young people graduating each year, according to national figures, and only about 800,000 new jobs, many Kenyans will continue to go abroad to find work.
South Africa Urges Africa's First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.
This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax. South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.
Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production.
Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.
So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them, he said.
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.
He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired. And more are due to expire in June and July.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.
We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now.
As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days, he said.
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.
This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform.
This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.
How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?
Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security, said Terblanche.
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.
We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination.
Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.
We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic, she said.
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives.
Journalists in Ethiopia Say Press Freedom is at 'Crossroads'
When Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office four years ago, Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based group that promotes press freedom, raised Ethiopia's ranking in its international press freedom index by 40 places.
It was a giant leap forward after decades of media repression by the state.
But since the war between federal government forces and rebels in the Tigray region began in late 2020, Ethiopia has dropped in the rankings.
To mark World Press Freedom Day 2022, VOA spoke to Ethiopian journalists about how free they feel to carry out their work.
Elias Meseret, who worked with the Associated Press, told VOA that press freedom in Ethiopia is at a crossroads.
Overall, I can say that lack of professionalism and also extreme views have become the hallmarks of the state of the media in Ethiopia, at this point in time, Elias said.
"For this to change, I think the government has a responsibility to let media professionals do their job freely.
This means without any harassment and intimidation."
Assegid Mulugeta, a radio presenter for the government-owned broadcaster, the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, or EBC, thinks press freedom has improved in recent years.
In 2018, the prime minister released all journalists from prison, However, that progress has since been reversed according to Ethiopian journalists, who documented that 46 journalists were detained in the country in 2021, making Ethiopia one of the worst jailers of journalists in Africa.
The state-backed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission released a statement Tuesday expressing concern for journalist Gobeze Sisay, whose whereabouts are unknown since plainclothes officers arrested him on Sunday.
Another journalist, Amir Aman Kiyaro, and his colleague Thomas Engida were arrested in November and released in March.
But they still may face years in prison if convicted of violating the country's wartime state of emergency law and anti-terrorism law.
Still, radio presenter Assegid said he sees improvement.
Under the pre-2018 government where the Tigray People's Liberation Front political party dominated, he said, there were "lots of stifling systems, there was lots of censorship, there was beating of journalists, there was lots of pressures and censorship against journalists and now we are seeing the booming of YouTube and online media this is a good thing to hear."
Sisay Sahlu, editor at The Reporter, a private newspaper based in Addis Ababa, said independent media often get stonewalled by the government.
My experience and the experience of my friends from public media is totally different, he said.
"As a private newspaper employee, it's tough to get information for me."
Sisay said that for a simple story, he might call 10 officials, who all may be unwilling to answer his questions.
When you call them, they don't give us any clue, he said.
"We write a letter to them, they are not talking.
Finally, when we publish [the story], they are coming to our office.
Sometimes they are on the phone and start a verbal fight.
Either they are giving us information or not."
A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
In the latest World Press Freedom Index, Ethiopia is ranked 114th, down 13 places from its ranking in 2021.
Editor's note: The story has been updated with additional information about the arrests of journalists.
As Tigray Aid Blockade Continues, Nearby Areas Also in Desperate Need of Food, Medicine
Despite Ethiopias declared humanitarian cease-fire with Tigrayan rebels, aid groups said they are struggling to get food and medicine to those in need.
Even outside the worst affected areas in Tigray, which are off limits to reporters, providing aid is fraught with risks and challenges.
In Ethiopias northern Amhara region, burned tanks and other ruined military equipment lie at the roadside four months after occupying forces of the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front, or TPLF, left the area.
As the region recovers from a brutal civil war, the U.N. said some 9.4 million people in the Amhara region and neighboring Afar and Tigray regions need humanitarian assistance.
But aid has been slow to arrive.
Seventeen-year-old Ahmed Nuru was living in the Oromia region, but said he had to flee after facing persecution for his Amhara ethnicity.
He lost his mother when he was young.
Last year, his father died after being unable to get lifesaving treatment due to the wars impact on the local health care system.
Now, Nuru is left to take care of his sisters, ages 10 and 8.
He said life is very difficult and doesnt know how he will be able to raise his sisters.
Daniel Tigabu, a public health officer based in the camp for the displaced where Ahmed lives, said there is not enough medical equipment or medicine.
The center is running out of basic medical kits, as well as a shortage of kits for malaria, hepatitis and HIV testing.
Tens of thousands live in camps for the displaced in the Amhara region.
Others live in host communities, like Tsgenet Tibebu, who lost her husband during the conflict with the TPLF.
Tibebu said she and her son rely on what her husbands friends provide as charity, which includes a room to stay in.
As tears begin to flow, she said she is a housewife who has nothing and is waiting for support to help her raise her two children.
She believes she should pay rent even though the owners have given her a place to stay.
She wonders how she can plan for the future when she has nothing.
Mulugeta Kebede, an aid worker who works in the Hayk camp, spoke to VOA and said stories like Nurus and Tibebus are not uncommon across Amhara.
He said the situation makes aid workers cry day and night.
He said if someone is hungry, they cant sleep because they think about their empty stomach.
He said he has seen displaced people sell pans or mattresses to surved and added that the situation is at a critical stage.
About 30,000 people displaced by conflict live just north of Hayk, in Weldiya.
A local government representative, Habtemariam Assefa, North Wollo Zone spokesperson, said there was a little support shortly after TPLF left, after the area had been a conflict zone for months.
But, he said, aid has been distributed only twice since and the aid provided by the U.N. or the federal government is not enough.
North of the Amhara region, in Tigray where journalists are banned from entering, the U.N. said the situation is worse, with famine-like conditions.
Tigray is under a de facto humanitarian blockade, according to the U.N.
For now, all Ahmed Nuru and his sisters can do is try to scrape by and hope more assistance arrives soon.
State Group Investigates Video Allegedly Showing Abuse by Ethiopian Army
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission is investigating a video shared online that appears to show government troops abusing and shooting an ethnic Tigrayan boy.
The four-minute video shows an alleged ethnic Tigray teenager being surrounded by men in Ethiopian army uniforms.
The forces are seen abusing the boy, who they refer to as being from Abbi Adi, a location in the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia.
In response to a query from VOA, the state-run Human Rights Commission said it was "gathering information regarding the incident."
In the video, the boy, with blood on his face, is seen sitting while the men in uniform surround him and threaten him with death.
One of the men in uniforms calls for the boy to suffer rather than being killed immediately.
They tell a teenage girl to forcefully feed the boy.
Finally, one man steps forward and shoots the boy, and the video ends.
VOA cannot independently verify the location of the incident or the identities of the individuals in the footage.
Asked about the video, both the Ethiopian government communication minister and Ethiopian ministry of defense spokesperson declined to comment.
A similar incident was reported by rights groups in January 2021 in which Ethiopian army members were seen executing a number of civilians in Mahibere Dego, in central Tigray.
Rights group Amnesty International has verified the killing of 11 civilians in that incident.
Forces from the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front also have been accused of committing human rights violations.
In February 2022, Amnesty International reported that TPLF forces and their affiliates have killed more than a dozen people and gang raped women in towns of the Amhara region they occupied.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission recently reported that more than 740 civilians were killed in the Tigray war between July 2021 and March 2022.
Both the government and the TPLF deny accusations of rights violations, saying their operations do not target civilians.
Disinformation, Censorship, Trigger Global Retreat of Press Freedom
Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and propaganda is having a disastrous effect on independent news around the world, a new report finds.
In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda.
The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level.
In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new, said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA.
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom."
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.
Russia, China among worst
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war."
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.
It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia, Clayton said.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.
But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia, Clayton said.
"At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine."
China ranked 175th in the new report.
And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention.
The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive."
President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime, RSF's country file states.
Rising authoritarianism
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.
Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence."
Afghanistan ranked 154th.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.
Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks, the group said.
Clayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.
When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect, he said.
"It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same."
US not perfect
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index.
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.
We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them.
An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event, said Beth Francesco, senior director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute.
A few bright spots
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.
If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media, he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."
Three Scandinavian countries Norway, Denmark and Sweden â€” respectively come at the top of RSF's index. Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places.
But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."
UN's Guterres Meets with Nigerian Leaders After Visiting Volatile Borno State
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres met with Nigerian leaders Wednesday at the end of a two-day visit to Nigeria and three-nation trip to Africa.
On Tuesday, he visited internally displaced people (IDPs) in northeast Nigeria and called for them to be safely returned to their homes.
Nigerian authorities plan to close all IDP camps in the next few years despite security concerns.
Antonio Guterres arrived the United Nations house in Abuja around 9 a.m. Wednesday and met with U.N. local coordinators before holding talks with Nigerian womens representatives.
The delegates, led by Nigeria's minister for womens affairs, Pauline Kedem Tallen, discussed gender equality and the inclusion of women in politics with the U.N. secretary-general.
His coming to Nigeria today has given us hope, because we know that he will lend his voice to all the issues affecting women, gender-based violence, early marriage, lack of implementation of some of our laws, said Tallen.
Guterres afterwards met with Nigeria's religious leaders and later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the U.N. house to remember the 23 people killed during the 2011 bombing of the building.
He began his three-nation Africa visit Sunday in Senegal as part of his Ramadan solidarity tour, and later went to Niger.
On Tuesday, he visited northeastern Borno state and met with the state governor as well as IDPs and families impacted by the Boko Haram conflict.
Guterres also visited repentant Boko Haram fighters and praised authorities' reintegration program for more than 1,000 former fighters.
He also commended authorities efforts to resettle displaced people back to their communities and called for more support to rebuild the region.
"The Borno that I found today is the Borno of hope, the Borno with future and I was very impressed to see the policy that is being deployed here, recognizing that you don't fight terrorism just by military means, you fight terrorism addressing the root causes of terrorism," he said.
"The people that I met today in the IDP camps want to go back home in safety and dignity.
The way to address terrorism effectively is to provide not only hope but a future of reality."
Nigerian authorities have been closing IDP camps since late last year and want to close all camps by 2026.
More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009.
But aid groups have been warning some communities may still be attacked.
There are multiple solutions when it comes to resettlement.
We need to get people stabilized, said Adenike Oladosu, a climate justice activist, met with the U.N. secretary-general.
"Climate change is leading to the rise of armed conflicts affecting people in the region and around and the need for us to see that we have more climate action and not always military action."
The U.N. secretary-general ended his visit at the Abuja presidential village, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari and his top Cabinet members.
Al-Shabab Raids African Union Military Base
Al-Shabab fighters stormed an African Union military base in the village of El-Baraf in Somalias Middle Shabelle region early Tuesday, local officials and security sources say.
Officials told VOA Somali that the militants briefly seized the base before withdrawing from it. State media said Burundian solders at the base repulsed the attack.
The Federal Government of Somalia condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack targeting the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia forward operating base in Elbaraf, Middle Shabelle, the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its official Facebook page.
We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of this terrorist attack and their families.
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs.
He said the militants then fought their way onto the base.
Al-Shabab claimed the killing of 173 African Union forces.
The group also claimed responsibility for capturing AU forces as prisoners-of-war.
Both claims could not be independently verified.
AU force headquarters and Somali military officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
In an interview with VOA, Muhumed, who was not at the village at the time of the attack, said he was told there were "many deaths" among Burundian forces but could not give an exact figure.
Fighting like this never happened in this area, he said. "It was heavy fighting."
He said two civilians were also killed and more than 10 others injured.
Muhumed confirmed to VOA that al-Shabab militants withdrew from the base.
He also reported airstrikes targeting the militants as they left the base but did not say who was responsible for the strikes.
El-Baraf, approximately 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu, is one of the forward operating bases of African Union forces from Burundi.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), gives it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity-building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to Somalia.
The mission has until the end of 2024 to operate in the country.
India's Muslims Mark Eid al-Fitr Amid Community Violence
Muslims across India marked Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday by offering prayers outside mosques, even as the celebrations this year came in the backdrop of a series of recent attacks against the community during the month of Ramadan.
We will not have the same kind of festivity this time, said Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, a civil engineer in Indias financial capital, Mumbai.
"This is the most painful Eid with worst memories for Indian Muslims."
Anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks have surged across the country in the last month, including stone throwing between Hindu and Muslim groups during religious processions and subsequent demolitions of a number of properties mostly belonging to Muslims by authorities.
The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance.
Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it.
Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions.
In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic.
The region also saw a rise in violence during Ramadan, with at least 20 militants, two civilians and five police and soldiers killed.
As we prepare to celebrate Eid, a strong sense of collective loss jars at us, said Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Srinagar.
Kashmir is the Muslim-majority disputed region where a violent insurgency against Indian rule and New Delhis brutal crackdown has raged for over three decades.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict.
Meanwhile in the capital, New Delhi, hundreds assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of Indias largest mosques, while offering Eid prayers there for the first time in over two years due to pandemic restrictions.
Families came together early on Tuesday morning while many people shared hugs and wishes.
Beijing Residents Brace for COVID-19 Lockdown
Unlike Shanghai, Beijing has yet to require that all its residents remain at home to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, many people in its Chaoyang district and elsewhere are preparing for that possibility.
On Wednesday, city officials closed 60 subway stations, more than 10% of Beijing's vast system.
They did not say when service would be resumed, according to ABC News.
Beijing, a city of 21 million people, has been on high alert for the spread of COVID-19, as restaurants and bars pivot to takeout, gyms close and schools suspend classes indefinitely, according to CNBC.
People who live in "controlled" areas, neighborhoods where cases have been discovered, have been told to stay in the city, and all residents must test for the virus three times throughout the week, according to ABC.
Chinese authorities reported 5,489 cases nationwide on Wednesday, of which 4,982 were in Shanghai, which has been under a draconian lockdown for weeks.
Beijing reported 46 symptomatic cases and five asymptomatic on Wednesday.
The city's total since April 22, what it considers the start of its omicron outbreak, is 544.
Mr. Zhang, a Beijing resident, said he had bought extra food and water, even though he doesn't think Beijing will be locked down like Shanghai.
He asked that VOA not use his full name because he was afraid of attracting official attention.
I have six bags of rice, two bags of noodles, and several boxes of water, instant noodles and (nutritionally dense) biscuits, and I haven't stocked up too much, Zhang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview last week.
He said he bought his groceries online because the supermarket was crowded.
Ms. Yao, who lives in the Chaoyang district, told VOA Mandarin that she had been stocking up on necessities since the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Commerce recommended that everyone do so.
She asked that VOA Mandarin not use her full name because she wanted to avoid official retribution.
At US Urging, Fiji Seizes Russian Oligarch's Yacht
Another Russian oligarchs yacht was seized Thursday as part of efforts to punish Russia over its war in Ukraine.
At the request of the United States, Fijian officials took a $300 million yacht belonging to Suleiman Kerimov, the Justice Department said. Officials say the yacht is in Lautoka, Fiji.
Kerimovs yacht, the Cayman Island-flagged Amadea, reportedly has been in Fiji since last month, arriving from Mexico.
Defense lawyers claimed the vessel belonged to another oligarch.
Kerimov had already been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2014 and 2018 for Russias activities in Syria and Ukraine.
The European Union also sanctioned him.
In March, the U.S. government announced a comprehensive effort to identify and seize the assets of wealthy Russians who have supported the government of Russian President Vladmir Putin, as part of the response to Moscows February 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The initiative, led by the Justice Department, is called Task Force KleptoCapture.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday in a statement there is "no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime."
He also said, "The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who facilitate the death and destruction we are witnessing in Ukraine."
In April, at the urging of the U.S., Spanish authorities seized a yacht belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, the owner of the Russian conglomerate Renova Group.
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that would allow the U.S. government to sell forfeited Russian properties worth more than $2 million for the benefit of Ukraine.
The measures next step is the Senate.

WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively.
But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas.
There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease.
Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.
Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a "modest" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly.
He said the cases were slowing and were "not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect" in another spike of disease.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly as many in the West have done.
The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become, he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants.
"If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission," he said.
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider though likely temporary impact on the national economy.
Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.
Myanmar Supreme Court Rejects Aung San Suu Kyi Appeal on Corruption Charges
An appeal of a five-year jail sentence against ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was rejected Wednesday by the country's supreme court.
The decision reportedly came as soon as the claim for an appeal was lodged, and the court didn't entertain arguments from either side in the case.
Suu Kyi, 76, was sentenced last week after being found guilty of 11 counts of corruption, including taking a bribe of cash and gold bars worth $600,000.
Her lawyer called the charge absurd.
Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to six years for actions against the military, breaking COVID-19 rules and breaking a telecommunications law.
She faces many more charges, and if found guilty could be sentenced to more than 150 years in jail.
Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since a military coup took over the country last year.
Since the coup, on Feb. 1, 2021, there have been widespread protests against the military regime.
The regime cracked down violently in many cases, leaving more than 1,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 arrested, charged or sentenced, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma).

Foreign Tourists Begin Arriving in New Zealand After COVID Restrictions Lifted
For the first time in over two years, overseas tourists have been allowed to enter New Zealand starting Monday.
The island nation known for its natural beauty enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including very restrictive travel limitations.
The country had reopened for tourists from Australia weeks ago, but the new relaxation of restrictions now allows tourists from over 60 countries to visit, including most European countries and the U.S.
Today is a day to celebrate and is a big moment in our reconnection with the world, said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash.
Tourists must show they are fully vaccinated and test negative for the virus.
Citizens of China, India and other countries not given a waiver Monday are still not allowed to visit.
Before the pandemic, tourism accounted for 5% of the countrys economic activity and 20% of its foreign income.
On Monday, 43 international flights carrying around 9,000 passengers were scheduled to leave or arrive at Auckland International Airport, Reuters reported.

Report: Iran to Execute Swedish-Iranian National by May 36
Iran will later this month execute a Swedish-Iranian national whom it has imprisoned since 2016 and convicted of spying for Israel, media reported.
Irans semiofficial ISNA news agency on Wednesday released a report in which Iranian officials stated that Tehran will implement the death penalty against Ahmad Reza Jalali by May 21.
Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016.
In 2017, Jalali was sentenced to death in Iran after he had been found guilty of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel to help it assassinate several nuclear scientists.
Rights groups have condemned Jalalis detention, citing Irans pattern of detaining dual nationals and expatriates without due process.
Iran does not recognize dual nationals.
The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019.
Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988.
Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest.
On Wednesday, the final day of Nouri's trial, a Stockholm district court judge set the date of the verdict for July 14.
Amnesty International put the number of those executed at the prison at 5,000 but said in a 2018 report that the number could be higher.
Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, said, "Iran continues to be one of the worlds leading implementers of the death penalty."
If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses.
Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case.
Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial.
It indicates that (Iran) sees him as a kind of piece in the jigsaw puzzle, which is very worrying, Aberg told Sweden's TT news agency.
Swedish law allows for the prosecution of Swedish citizens and other nationals for crimes against international law committed abroad.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy.
President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties, said Ogutcu.
"Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this.
And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed."
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals.
The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied.
But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.
Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support, said Ogutcu.
"The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey.
But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries.
So, there are real economic and political security interests involved."
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.
Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran.
Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today, said Ozel.
"And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation.
The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.
Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations.
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism."
Notorious' system
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet.
One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June.
In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.
The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image, he said.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University.
As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region, said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added.
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.
Shadow of Khashoggi
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.
In my view, this is all window-dressing, said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.
It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer.
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation.
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiance, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.
I want to, many do, but we're scared, said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.
Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi.
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war.
"A terrifying experience," he says.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims.
Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions.
Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates.
Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business.
These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path."
It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes, he said.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence.
That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says.
Ten women have graduated so far all of them since released, including eight with pardons.
Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad."
He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said.
"I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.
That period of my life has passed, he said.
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups.
Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself.
Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people.
In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.
Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported.
The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying "a prominent Russian car maker" requested parts from Iran.
He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components.
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions.
However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine.
So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart, said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart.
He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability.
Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran "opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine," and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan.
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism.
When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.
I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story, the 42-year-old journalist said.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.
She countered with a better offer.
I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect, she said.
"I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to.
Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA.
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.
If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said.
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war.
It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.
Making connections
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily.
The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.
There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting, she said.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon.
She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting.
Knowing the local language is an important part of that.
When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust, she said. "If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything.
It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out, she said.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.
Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you, she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021.
They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.
While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them, Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.
Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men.
But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents, Sancha said.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.
Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines, Abbas said.
"It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.
The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region, Abbas said.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.
We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about, she said.
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed.
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country.
It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed "Death to America, Death to Israel" slogans.
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize.
What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians, Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs.
Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century "are null and void".
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction, Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran.
Our responses are painful.
You create conditions for your own destruction.
We will not leave you alone .
You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action.
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program.
Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity.
Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.
In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its "Kheibar Buster" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles).
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list.
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.
For so much of American history, the church has really been or their congregations have really been essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.
And you see that cross-culturally whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.
Third places Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.
If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good, says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.
It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways, Espinola says.
So, places like third places can allow us to do that.
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community, says Cox.
"They're much more likely to engage in other activities there.
They are much more trusting of their neighbors.
There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.
And many are open most days of the week.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.
I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential, Cox says.
But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees.
They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other.
I don't know where else they would have gone maybe a church, but maybe not to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops.
What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021.
The respondents headed cities with at least 75,000 residents.
The local leaders are still focused on traditional issues such as violent crime, the economy and infrastructure, but they are most concerned about the pandemics long-term impact on the mental health of their constituents.
Mental health was top of mind for Michael Udine when he was sworn in as mayor of Broward County, Florida, in November 2021.
Everything that was a potential issue pre-pandemic has pretty much been exacerbated by the pandemic, he says.
"There were issues going into the pandemic, and it was becoming more and more important on everyone's radar screen about the mental health of people of all ages.
And I think the pandemic pretty much supercharged those issues."
It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic.
The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth.
What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions, Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month.
"We've also seen a lot more sadness and depression."
Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors.
Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents, Glick says.
"Concerns about polarization over vaccines and just people being pushed to their limits and certainly less on their city budgets and revenues and having to cut programs and some of those types of things that were probably more top of mind earlier in the pandemic."
Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about "lingering mental health challenges and trauma," according to the survey.
Additionally, more than one-third of mayors, 37%, are worried about learning loss among young people.
Second only to mental health and trauma, and they're probably not totally independent concerns, Glick says.
"It is part of that shift of mayors concerns from immediate threats to businesses closing and people getting sick, to some of these longer-term consequences that are going to persist in the future.
And learning loss among their students, theyre worried it's going to persist for many, many, many years into the future. It's hard to make up for."
According to the survey, other top concerns for Americas mayors include the financial insecurity of low-income residents (33%), the closing of small businesses (29%) and increased crime and violence (26%).
Just 7% of mayors are worried about the shift to remote work and the long-term impact that could have on outmigration people moving away from their cities.
The $350 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to local and state governments could help mayors address some of their concerns.
The survey found that 78% of mayors believe the money will allow them to make meaningful change.
What we're seeing is a large majority are using it for things they consider to be transformative and will make major changes to their cities, Glick says, "instead of feeling obligated or feeling the necessity to use it to plug up over-budget gaps to keep the doors open and the lights on."
Young Compete Against Old in Hottest US Rental Market in a Decade
Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials people aged 24 to 40 and even baby boomers the over-57 club.
You have aging millennials who are creating families who should be moving from rental situations into ownership but, because of the lack of housing supply, that has been stopped in a lot of instances.
And so, what you see is the aging millennial population continues to rent, says Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi-Matrix, a commercial real estate data and research firm.
It's not just about millennials, it's not just about [Gen] Z [people under 24], we also see that boomers are making a transition, he added.
Their percentage of moving into rental properties is growing in the last five years."
There are a variety of reasons older people are opting for rentals, according to Ressler.
They've lived in a home for so long and they want to be able to reduce their expenses on a fixed income, he says.
"They want to live in a social cohort, like a retirement community, and things like that where it's much more socially amenable to them."
The asking price of apartment rentals was up 10.7% in September 2021 compared to last year at the same time, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
It's a hot market.
We have never seen this market so hot in the last decade, says Gay Cororaton, NARs senior economist and director of housing and commercial research.
"The average rent growth, year-over-year, is about 3-to-5%. We're seeing 11% rent growth now, so, clearly, way above trends weve had in the past."
Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States.
Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021.
The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past.
The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues, Cororaton says.
"Shipments couldn't come in, the price of lumber was rising, manufacturing slowed, workers could not come in [to work], so you have shortages of frames, appliances.
So, essentially, just a short supply."
The housing supply got even tighter during the pandemic as more investors put their money into housing, according to Cororaton, while existing homeowners looked for second homes.
With the pandemic, there was also a big demand for second homes, for vacation homes.
Typically, vacation homes accounted for just about 5% [of the market], she says.
"Early this summer they rose to about 8%.
So again, strong demand and strong imbalance of demand and supply caused home prices to rise, made them less affordable."
The hottest rental markets right now are in the West and South.
More renters are moving to Dallas and Houston in Texas, followed by Atlanta, Georgia; New York; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington, D.C., according to NAR.
Cororaton expects the coming year to be a little better but says the housing shortage is likely to continue for the next few years.
You know, the old adage of moving from rentals into homeownership, that whole polemic may be changing, says Ressler.
"The sweet spot was always the millennials, and now the millennials are being replaced by the [Gen] Zs, but the millennials are staying longer and the Zs are coming on board, and now you've got the demographic of the boomers.
What it means is a very profitable and dynamic [rental] market that's going to continue to grow."
Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children's Immune Systems?
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.
There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.
"They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.
They are exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity.
So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things.
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."
The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.
A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in.
That also shapes our immune system's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.
There are other things that go into that equation.
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.
Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says. "Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times. "One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines.
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.
But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.
It's been well documented that both of those having a good diet, a less stressful environment can have a positive impact on our immune system.
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.
Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.
The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids against new things that then come along.
US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said.
Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans in addition to Mexicans under Title 42 authority.
Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments.
That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border.
Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level.
The vast majority enter in South Texas.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum.
Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty.
In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1.
But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23.
A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.
Limon said the administration is "trying to get every last bit out of Title 42" before it expires.
She called it "sobering" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes.
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents.
Bishop Enrique Sanchez Martanez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.
It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants, the bishop said.
"But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum on May 23.
But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date.
The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone, Ajic said.
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge.
U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S.
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks.
On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo.
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November.
It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months.
It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement.
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork.
In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing.
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.
For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity.
In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings, according to the USCIS statement.
The USCIS historically has been underfunded because most of the agency's funding comes from application fees that have stalled at $5 billion a year since 2019.
What Is the US-Launched 'Uniting for Ukraine' Program?
U.S. President Joe Biden recently announced the Uniting for Ukraine program, which aims to streamline the process for Ukrainians who have fled their country and are seeking safety in the United States.
The new program, which took effect Monday, will complement existing legal pathways available to those fleeing Russian aggression due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, Biden administration officials said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to provide relief to the Ukrainian people, while supporting our European allies who have shouldered so much as the result of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to reporters on April 21.
What is Uniting for Ukraine?
The program allows U.S. citizens and residents to sponsor Ukrainian refugees under different immigration statuses.
The online portal, open to potential sponsors or organizations, is accepting applications and has received more than 4,000 requests so far, CNN reported.
Who qualifies under the program? Ukrainians, or an immediate family member of a Ukrainian citizen.
They must have a U.S. sponsor and have been a resident of Ukraine as of February 11.
What are the requirements?
They must pass security checks including a fingerprint and an FBI name check and biographic and biometric screening and meet public health requirements, such as having the proper vaccinations, before entering the U.S.
Those approved will be allowed to travel to the U.S., be considered for humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis, stay in the country for two years, and apply for work permits.
The United States strongly encourages Ukrainians seeking refuge in the United States who do not have and are not eligible for a visa to seek entry via Uniting for Ukraine from Europe.
This will be the safest and most efficient way to pursue temporary refuge in the United States, a DHS statement said.
Who qualifies as a sponsor?
U.S. citizens and other residents who hold lawful status in the United States or who are beneficiaries of Deferred Enforced Departure, Temporary Protected Status, or Deferred Action, among others.
Sponsors will be required to prove they can financially support the refugee while they are in the U.S.
They also need to pass security and background vetting "to protect against exploitation and abuse."
The Ukrainian applicant will receive authorization only after everything is verified, including that the sponsor has the means to support them while they are in the U.S.
Who is not eligible for parole under the program?
Ukrainian citizens already in the U.S. are not eligible for parole under Uniting for Ukraine.
However, they can apply for Temporary Protected Status, which is another form of humanitarian relief that allows people to legally stay and work in the U.S.
What about those arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border?
Citing safety issues, U.S. officials have urged Ukrainians not to travel to Mexico in hopes of entering the United States.
In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has no place to hold them while they go through the Uniting for Ukraine vetting process.
Since Uniting for Ukraine's launch on Monday, Ukrainians who arrive at U.S. ports of entry without a valid visa or without preauthorization to travel to the United States through the Uniting for Ukraine program will be denied entry and told to apply to the program.
Biden officials hope this will curb the number of Ukrainian migrants seeking humanitarian parole along the border.
Those at the border must apply under the rules of Uniting for Ukraine, meaning they must have a qualifying sponsor or a non-government agency willing to sponsor them in the U.S. for up to two years.
And they need to have all required vaccinations and pass background checks.
The Biden administration announced the private sponsorship initiative as another way the U.S. hopes to achieve President Biden's commitment to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by the Russian military invasion.
As of Thursday, almost 5.4 million refugees have since left Ukraine, according to U.N. data.
Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-30
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide.
A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll.
Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand.
There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities, he says.
"If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures.
The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders.
Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view, he says.
"All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place," he says.
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government.
Rwanda Welcomes the Arrest of Former Rebel Leader
Rwandas Justice Minister said his government is pleased with the arrest Monday of a former rebel leader accused of masterminding genocide and violating human rights against Rwandans and Congolese villagers in 1994.
French authorities arrested Callixte Mbarushimana, a former leader of the infamous Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an ethnic Hutu rebel group.
Tharcisse Karugarama welcomed the decision of French authorities to enforce the international arrest warrant issued by his government and the International Criminal Court (ICC) against the former rebel leader.
It is good news that Callixte Mbarushimana has been (arrested) by the French judicial authority.
Good news in the sense that, first, there was an international arrest warrant against him issued by the Rwandan government in respect of (the alleged) act of genocide committed in Rwanda in 1994.
Karugarama said the Hague-based court sought the arrest of the former rebel leader who was believed to be hiding in France.
Genocide memorial in Rwanda
The International Criminal Court (ICC) conducted its own investigation about his other activities and they found sufficient evidence to support the charge of war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the DRC and they issued an arrest warrant, which the French judicial authorities have executed.
The Hague-based court accused Mbarushimana and other rebels in the FDLR of using violence against unarmed civilians as their main tool in a campaign to forcefully obtain political power for the rebel group.
According to the ICC, "as a result of this deadly blackmail (by the FDLR rebels), victims were killed, raped, and forcibly displaced, and entire villages were razed to the ground."
Karugarama said Mbarushimana and his FDLR rebel forces played a pivotal role in the countrys 1994 genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed.
We believe that, in the next couple of weeks after due process has taken place in France, he should be able to be transferred to The Hague in the Netherlands to face charges and be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed within the territory of the DRC.
The Justice Minister also said Kigali will be cooperating with the International Criminal Court in the imminent prosecution of Mbarushimana.
British, French Foreign Ministers to Re-Invigorate DRC Peace Process - 2002-01-33
The British and French foreign ministers travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo Monday to kickoff a three-day, four-nation tour of the troubled region of Central Africa.
The mission will be jointly led by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine.
They will be visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
Their primary objective is to breathe new life into the peace process in the war-torn Congo.
Specifically, the British and French want to see the withdrawal of foreign troops who back the Congolese government (n Kinshasa, demobilization of rebels who occupy more than half the country, and peace talks to end the conflict.
British Foreign Secretary Straw said the mission also has a broader goal of making sure the Congo does not become another Afghanistan.
The 11th of September has made it much more urgent that we take earlier action against failed, and failing states, he said.
In Kinshasa, the ministers will meet Congolese President Joseph Kabila.
He took power one year ago, after his father, President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated by one of his bodyguards.
Their next stop will be Kigali for talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and the leader of the Rally for Congolese Democracy rebels, Adolphe Onusumba.
The ministers will make a brief visit to Burundi to discuss that country's civil war with President Pierre Buyoya.
The tour will end in Uganda, where meetings are scheduled with President Yoweri Museveni and Jean-Pierre Bemba, who leads the Movement for the Liberation of Congo guerrillas.
UNICEF Pushes for Demobilizing Child Soliders Near Africa's Great Lakes
The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum.
The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives.
UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units.
"We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations. We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group. But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization," Mr. Fontaine said.
He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army.
He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves.
According to UNICEF, The Democratic Republic of Congo still has some 10,000 children recruited to fight, while Rwanda has up to 2,000 children involved in combat.
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers.
They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory.
Sometimes, boys, but mainly girls, are used as sex slaves.
They are exposed to violence and HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
The girls may become pregnant, making it harder for them to reintegrate into their communities.
UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money.
He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units.
Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives.
That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care.
You do not want to stigmatize them and individualize them.
They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited.
So, you are trying to build services in those communities that are broad services, that would be made available to all those children, Mr. Fontaine said.
He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough.
He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again.

World Bank, Nike Team Up for 'The Girl Effect' Initiative
The Adolescent Girls Initiative partners the World Bank, the Nike Foundation and governments of developing and developed nations to empower girls in poor countries.
The two-year-old program is helping girls in Asia, Africa and the Middle East gain the education and skills they need to transition into the workforce.
My name is Sanchita.
I come from a small village called Ishwarpur in Bangladesh, American actress Anne Hathaway delivered her lines as powerfully from behind a podium at the World Bank as she does on the silver screen, telling the story of an impoverished girl.
When a baby is born in Ishwarpur, families desperately hope it will be a boy, she continued.
"It has been this way for as long as anyone can remember.
It is believed that boys will contribute to the family income in a place where people are very poor.
These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative.
Who benefits?
A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.
They were just a few of the girls who benefit from training and education programs that help them transition from school to employment.
Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.
Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world," explained Hathaway.
I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.' Girl power"The Girl Effect" is what the Adolescent Girls Initiative wants to see happen for 600 million girls in developing countries.
Overall, an estimated one-third of young women in developing nations are not employed and not in school.
World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.
If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates, Zoellick said.
The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty.
Current operations The Adolescent Girls Initiative public-private partnership, with its $20 million in funds, is already at work in seven countries, with plans to expand to Haiti and Yemen.
Mayra Buvinic talks about the Adolescent Girls Initiative
So where we are in Liberia and Nepal, young women are completing the first rounds of training, explained Mayra Buvinic, director of Gender and Development at the World Bank.
In South Sudan, 100 adolescent girls' clubs will have opened in four states by the end of this month.
In Jordan, female community college graduates are gaining access to vouchers.
In Afghanistan, Lao PDR and Rwanda, assessments are being completed, and the projects will be launched at the end of this quarter.
Thanks and praise Kebbeh Kamara tells the audience how she's benefited from the World Bank/Nike initiative
Kebbeh Kamara said she has benefited from training in Greater Monrovia, Liberia.
Wearing a pink dress and sporty black headband decorated with rhinestones, she addressed the World Bank audience from the stage.
I learned how to start a business, how to earn money on your own, how to be self-sustainable, she said, "how to save money and what to spend money for.
Sarah Poni Saturnino, 19, of Juba, Southern Sudan, told VOA she is enjoying her first trip to the United States and all the empowerment training and activities.
I learned about how to express yourself. Eye contact. Speak loud," explained Saturnino. "This way can give me really a voice to speak in front of people.
She said she hopes to take the lessons she has learned here in workshops back to the Adolescent Girls Initiative clubs in Southern Sudan.
And even if I go back home, I'm not longer Sarah again -- I'm somebody now."
Somebody who has earned the admiration of a fellow Southern Sudanese citizen, child-soldier-turned-rapper Emmanuel Jal.
A supporter of the Adolescent Girls Initiative, Jal performed at the World Bank event.
The girls joined him on stage, beaming as they danced behind him -- as did at least one World Bank official -- while the audience of staffers in business suits took to their feet and raised their hands in the air as well.
Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.
She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.
Striving for peace in the region
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.
The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict, said Rostagno.
Deteriorating situation amid global concern
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.
A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us, said Rostagno.
I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today.
The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.
They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access, said Rostagno.
Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice.
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.
We waged a war that shouldn't have happened, he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.
God have mercy on us, he said.
The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday.
"The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons" he said.
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid.
Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating "a democratic and just society without racial divisions.
He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa.
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.
I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world," he said.
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.
It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur, Tutu said.Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.
But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly "shut up."
I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed, he said.
"I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better."
Many say his voice will be missed.
Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.
Malawi's Jacaranda School for Orphans Celebrates Christmas
The management for the Jacaranda School for Orphans in Malawis commercial capital Blantyre recently hosted a party for its students as it closed for Christmas and New Years Day holidays.
Around 500 people including students, staff members and others from surrounding areas attended the event, which was held at the schools premises in Chigumula area.
The party included gifts, Santa Claus, and a "dancing show case" by the students.
The school management told VOA that the yearly celebration has been a school tradition for the past 13years.
The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: "[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents.
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children.
So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas. And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."

Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to "a nice meal" from the students.
We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables.
And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people, he said.
One of the students, Eddah Zimba, said, "The celebrations are really cool, ... I have enjoyed myself.
I have eaten, and now I am here dancing.
What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.
This party has brought a change in my life.
I have learned that we have to have a heart for sharing one another as the Father Christmas was doing, he said.
Founded in 2002, the Jacaranda School for Orphans is the only one in Malawi which provides free primary, secondary and tertiary education to children without parents.
A Malawian woman, Marie Da Silva, started the school after she returned from the United States where she spent nineteen years working as a nanny.
Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2030
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate.
More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year.
Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.
This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance.
We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals.
In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time, said Mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.
My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation, said Mwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse."
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.
My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi.
We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible, said Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.
