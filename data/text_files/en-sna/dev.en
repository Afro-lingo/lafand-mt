Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year.
Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily.
Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.
We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not.
And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need.
And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative, said Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services.
She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030.
Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.
I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private.
No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them, said Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.
Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions, said Makonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed."
I fear it could end up into fights.
So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily, said Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.
Confidentiality will be upheld.
Lets consider the household setup.
I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family.
[Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately, said Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people.
The organization says it worked well.
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water.
But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.
The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky.
"We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water.
There are so many risks.
You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us."
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river.
But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.
These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked.
This has been a major embarrassment.
In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.
They punished some of them, but you know they would sometimes climb trees just to look at older women like us taking a bath, she explains.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.
Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.
January is when the project is finishing.
But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015].
That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be, Mateyu said.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks.
The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.
Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre.
The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene."
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.
I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it.
My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me.
But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace], said Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.
As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public.
This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter, said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery.
He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.
At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children, said Ligomeka.
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.
Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event.
There was a possibility that something was going to be published.
And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem, said Kanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful.
But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015.
Only four African countries Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda are likely to meet a majority of these targets.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years.
The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015.
The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.
Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing, he said.
"Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods.
This, he says, encourages investment.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly.
UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community.
And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain.
They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development.
That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.
We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities, Davis said.
"These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."
Slow progress
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow.
Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.
And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals.
They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said.
"Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa.
Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials.
Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.
Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.
In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.
Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].
So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out.
Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.
Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.
It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do.
But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, "Msowoya said.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.
"Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted.
The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses."
Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.
There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours, noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu.
"We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.
There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.
But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.
Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-39
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted.
WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it.
In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food.
So far they have received only 20 percent of that.
WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate.
"The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing," she said.
"We need more assistance now.
We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries.
About half of these people are in Zimbabwe.
The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates.
It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun.
"We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said.
"If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there.
The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October.
But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.
Canadian PM Impressed With African Development Plan
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien says he is impressed with the progress being made towards implementing an African development plan.
Mr. Chretien made the remarks Sunday after meeting with South African President Thabo Mbeki and other regional leaders in Pretoria.
Mr. Chretien, the current chairman of the group of the seven most industrialized nations plus Russia, is visiting Africa to discuss the New Partnership for Africa's Development, known as NEPAD.
He said NEPAD will be one of the top agendas at the June G-8 summit in Kananaskis, Canada.
The G-8 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia.
Mr. Chretien says topics such as human rights, democracy the rule of law, transparency and good governance will be discussed at the G8 summit.
NEPAD outlines objectives of promoting democracy and good governance in Africa in return for Western economic assistance.
It seeks to achieve an annual growth rate of seven-percent on the African continent by 2015.
South African President Mbeki said he is convinced that Africa is ready for NEPAD saying there has been definite progress toward democracy in the continent.
Later, Mr. Chretien and Mr. Mbeki were joined by presidents Festus Mogae of Botswana, Bakili Muluzu of Malawi, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Benjamin Makapa of Tanzania and Vice President Enoch Kavindele of Zambia.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who won re-election in disputed voting last month, was not invited.
Reuters news agency reports the Canadian prime minister who has already visited Morocco, Algeria and Nigeria on his six-nation tour will visit Ethiopia and Senegal after South Africa.
Some information for this report provided by Reuters and AFP.
Child Labor in Malawi
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.
It says these children risk being abused.
Some under aged children work as mini bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre.
They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child.
He says many of the children come from rural areas.
He says, "Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization.
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.
Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates.
He said, We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates.
There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. "
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country.
These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child, he said, "you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education.
So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. "
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs.
"We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child.
At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. "
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.
Over 60 per cent of Malawis nearly 11 million people live below the poverty line.
Malawi Court Convicts 12 People in Albino Attack
A high court in Malawi has convicted five people of murder for the 2018 killing of a 22-year-old albino man, including the victims brother.
The court convicted seven other people of selling the victim's body parts.
Malawi officials say more than 170 albinos have been attacked in the country since 2014 by people who believe their body parts bring luck and wealth.
Family members of the deceased, MacDonald Masambuka, left the courtroom Thursday with hopes of justice being served after the court convicted all 12 people accused in his death.
amily members, including Masambukas mother, appeared calm and composed as Judge Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga read the judgments.
Those convicted included a Catholic priest, Father Thomas Muhosa, police officer Chikondi Chileka, clinician Lumbani Kamanga, and the deceaseds brother, Cassim Masambuka.
Charges included murder, extracting human tissues, causing harm to a person with disability, and trafficking in persons.
Kamanga convicted the victims brother and four others of murder.
The court convicted seven other people, including the priest and police officer, of selling the victim's body parts.
Business with tissue According to the court, Muhosha, Chileka and others offered to conduct business using human tissue extracted from a human corpse.
The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.
She said Masambuka is the latest victim of violent attacks on persons with albinism who have not been protected by the community.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case.
He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.
Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him, Kayuni said.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.
Enticement Court documents show that Masambuka was enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found a girl for him to marry.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him.
Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.
We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients, Chamkakala said.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.
Serious sentencing'
Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.
When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case, Simbota said.
The high court is expected to sentence the perpetrators on May 30.
In another case, a high court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old man to life in prison for the 2020 murder of a 14-year-old-boy with albinism in Phalombe district.
Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.
Though "everybody's got the right to demonstrate," there have "been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence," Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview.
Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government.
They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start.
Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court.
Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police.
Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols.
The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.
Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around.
There's really nothing that we see coming out of it, James said.
"But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy: "We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums."
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption.
Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine.
With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who had predicted 3.1% growth for 2019, offered a sobering update to Zimbabwe's parliament in early August.
"The revised 2019 GDP growth is expected to be negative," Reuters news service reported him as saying.
Ncube did not provide any updated figure.
Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.
South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16.
Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people.
But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans.
They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people,' she said. "...
So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate.
But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested.
Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.
Afraid, insecure'
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning.
Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.
I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least, she told VOA, after returning home to Harare.
"Because seven security details coming over after midnight and questioning me about a demonstration and placards that I wasn't going to be able to give them, was something else. I didn't understand it. It left me really terrified."
She said police then told her and her 40-person delegation to remain in their hotel all day Saturday.
She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.
Perfectly valid'
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal.
But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.
I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do, he said.
"However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves.
This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression.
Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.
Kabendera remains behind bars.
On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate.
That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.
Worrying trend'
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.
This means the continuation of a limited civic space.
Because this has happened since 2016.
There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space.
And it is targeted to people like civil society organizations, the media, hindering the freedom of speech, the freedom of association.
Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns.
A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court.
Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.
Zimbabweans Claim Police Brutality During Economic Protests
Zimbabweans defied a police ban Friday and held demonstrations to protest the country's deteriorating economy.
Despite the High Court ban on planned protests, members of the Movement for Democratic Change took to the streets and clashed with police.
Some of the injured accused police of derailing protests, which they said were meant to persuade President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to breathe life into Zimbabwe's moribund economy.
With tears on her cheeks, 32-year-old Tafadzwa Bvuta said her degree had not helped her get anything for her three children.
They beat us up, she said of the police.
"What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all not just one person. Where will we go and survive? Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"
Make Nyashanu, 27, said he would continue protesting because he is miserable about being unemployed.
He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators even elderly ones and people not protesting.
"Is this democracy?" he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos.
The opposition said it will hold another protest Monday in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, and will go to other cities and places until the government addresses the economy.
Government response
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa called the protests counterproductive, saying January's demonstrations against fuel price increases resulted in $20 million to $30 million in losses for businesses from looting and non-productive days.
Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner, she said.
"I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation."
Daniel Molokhele, the spokesman for the opposition, said his party was against Mnangagwa leading talks and accused him of stealing Zimbabwe's last election in 2018.
He said the protests would continue until Zimbabwe's economy gets back on track.
UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare.
The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.
We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe.
While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans, Colville said.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care.
Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear.
But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.
There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders.
We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago, Colville said.
"So, it is clearly a very tense situation."
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.
The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products, Cudjoe told VOA.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude.
The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa.
In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply even overnight.
At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday.
The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.
Gasoline costs climbed, too.
In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.
Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food, said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."
There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world.
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries.
African governments must find a way of responding, he said.
It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine both big grain exporters to Africa may create opportunities for African producers.
Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities] like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine, Kanyama said.
Kanyama also said support by the international community for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations is welcome.
He noted that the Group of 20 which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union "is trying to offer some debt relief."
Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis, Kanyama added.

Zimbabwe Government Orders Vaccinated Workers Back to Work
Zimbabwes government has ordered civil servants who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to immediately report for duty after more than a year of working from home, citing a declining in new cases of the virus in the country.
Authorities also announced any government workers without proof of vaccination will be barred from workplaces and face punishments, including a freeze on their salaries.
In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.
Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.
This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off.
In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to, she said.
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.
A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.
So if the Public Service Commission wants to bar civil servants who are not vaccinated, they are in breach of contract and its unacceptable.
Secondly, civil servants have a right to dignity, they have right to make choices.
No one can be forced foreign substances to be inserted into their bodies, he noted.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.
It is something that we are strongly against.
We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory that goes around when people are saying we are being forced to be vaccinated.
We really have to get the buy in of people: spread the gospel of vaccines, how they work and then encourage people to get vaccinated and not force them to get vaccinated, he pointed out.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.
Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.
Not because they want to protect themselves, but they want to protect their colleagues at work.
Scientific evidence has it that if you are fully vaccinated it comes with a mild attack.
Why not take up that? There is nothing wrong or sinister about it, he said.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.
Zimbabwe Government Suspends Striking Teachers
Authorities in Zimbabwe have suspended striking teachers for three months without pay in a dispute that will see most schools remain closed.
The teachers went on strike this week over their compensation.
Evelyn Ndlovu, Zimbabwes minister of primary and secondary education, said late Thursday that striking teacher have been suspended due to their reluctance to resume work despite the governments offer to give them a 20 percent salary hike and additional incentives.
All officials within the ministry who absented themselves from duty since the opening of schools on 7th February, 2022 have been suspended without pay forthwith for a period of three-month.
During this period, members are not to hinder or interfere with any investigations or evidence relating to the alleged misconduct, said Ndlovu.
"Appropriate action will be taken against members who abrogate their duties and responsibilities."
Zimbabwes schools were scheduled to reopen this week after a long break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But teachers refused to resume working, asking for a pay increase.
They currently earn about $100 a month.
The government Tuesday offered them a 20 percent pay increase and other incentives, such as free school fees for their children and loans for housing.
But the teachers have rejected that offer as insufficient.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, told VOA the suspended educators are making an urgent application to the High Court to declare their suspension illegal.
Public service regulation clearly articulates clear guidelines on how people can be suspended.
We are not in a banana republic where anyone can wake up and make pronouncements which are detached and divorced from the law, said Masaraure.
"We note that the minister has withdrawn herself from the law, therefore cannot be able to speak legally on education (matters) because she has acted unconstitutionally by arbitrarily suspending teachers of Zimbabwe.
We deem her suspended as she has acted outside the law."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar.
The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing their wages.
The Zimbabwe Teachers Association the instructors biggest union - said it is hoping to meet with government officials soon to discuss the suspensions.
Zimbabwe Teachers, Calling Pay Insufficient, Refuse to Teach
Many Zimbabwean schools that closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic remain shuttered as teachers refuse to return to the classroom, citing a need for better pay.
The teachers are paid less than $100 a month.
The government has offered a 20 percent pay increase and other incentives, but the teachers have rejected that offer as insufficient.
Meanwhile, some youths are studying independently.
One such student, a 16-year-old, said, "My appeal [to the government] is for a salary increment for teachers so that they come to work, because we arent learning.
Its like we are paying fees for nothing.
Its so painful as my parents are struggling for it when I am not learning at all."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar.
The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teachers' wages.
Obert Masaraure, president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, said the instructors want their old salaries restored and that the offer of a 20 percent raise amounted to almost nothing.
We asked for the restoration of salaries, which were robbed from us by the government of the day, Masaraure said.
"And the message to the government is clear: We need our pre-October 2018 salaries of 540 dollars U.S.
We know these shenanigans of adding an extra dollar to our salaries that does not add up."
Government officials see the ongoing talks in a different light and voice optimism about a successful resolution.
Paul Mavima, Zimbabwe's minister of public service, labor and social welfare, said, "In many ways we already have a breakthrough.
The leaders of the workers have to a very large extent welcomed this package and they are only saying: Lets discuss how it is going to be implemented."
The teachers and government are expected to meet in coming days to resume negotiations.
Meanwhile, students wait to resume their studies months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced their schools to close.
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" an entity with no known legal status.
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.
Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank.
The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk, he added.
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP.
Every state has the right to defend its business assets, he added.
Hysteria'
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow.
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee.
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said.
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.
No questions asked
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.
Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions, he added.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions."
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR suspended since mid-December unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said.
They didn't have what it took to succeed, she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.
If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed, Doxsee said.
If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed.
Cyclone Batsirai Weakens After Hitting Madagascar, Floods Feared
Cyclone Batsirai weakened overnight but floods were still expected due to heavy rain after it hit eastern Madagascar with strong winds, the island's meteorological office said Sunday.
Batsirai has weakened, Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening.
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.
But "localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains," it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday.
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.
It reached the island as an "intense tropical cyclone", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP.
The national meteorological office has said it fears "significant and widespread damage."
Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.
He said his office has accommodation sites, food and medical care ready for victims, as well as search and rescue plans already in place.
Very serious threat'
The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present "a very serious threat" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days.
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly Tropical Storm Ana late last month.
In the eastern coastal town of Vatomandry, more than 200 people were crammed in one room in a Chinese-owned concrete building.
Families slept on mats or mattresses.
Community leader Thierry Louison Leaby lamented the lack of clean water after the water utility company turned off supplies ahead of the cyclone.
People are cooking with dirty water, he said, amid fears of a diarrhea outbreak.
Outside plastic dishes and buckets were placed in a line to catch rainwater dripping from the corrugated roofing sheets.
The government must absolutely help us. We have not been given anything, he said.
Residents who chose to remain in their homes used sandbags and yellow jerrycans to buttress their roofs.
Cyclone still 'dangerous'
Other residents of Vatomandry were stockpiling supplies in preparation for the storm.
We have been stocking up for a week, rice but also grains because with the electricity cuts we cannot keep meat or fish, said Odette Nirina, a 65-year-old hotelier in Vatomandry.
I have also stocked up on coal.
Here we are used to cyclones, she told AFP.
Winds of more than 50 kph pummeled Vatomandry on Saturday morning, accompanied by intermittent rain.
The disaster agency said the cyclone was expected to remain "dangerous" as it swept across the large island overnight and in the morning.
Flooding is expected due to excessive rainfall in the east, southeast and central regions of the country, it warned.
The United Nations was ramping up its preparedness with aid agencies, placing rescue aircraft on standby and stockpiling humanitarian supplies.
At least 131,000 people were affected by Ana across Madagascar in late January.
Close to 60 people were killed, mostly in the capital Antananarivo.
That storm also hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, causing dozens of deaths.
The U.N.'s World Food Program pointed to estimates from national authorities that some 595,000 people could be directly affected by Batsirai, and 150,000 more might be displaced due to new landslides and flooding.
The storm poses a risk to at least 4.4 million people in one way or another, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.
Finland Crowned World's Happiest Nation for Fifth Year
Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year running, in an annual U.N.-sponsored index that again ranked Afghanistan as the unhappiest, followed closely by Lebanon.
Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania recorded the biggest boosts in wellbeing.
The largest falls in the World Happiness table, released on Friday, came in Lebanon, Venezuela and Afghanistan.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August. U.N. agency UNICEF estimates one million children under five could die of hunger this winter if not aided.
This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims, co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data.
It assigns a happiness score on a scale of zero to 10, based on an average of data over a three-year period. This latest edition was completed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch. The United States rose three places to 16th, one ahead of Britain, while France climbed to 20th, its highest ranking yet.
As well as a personal sense of wellbeing, based on Gallup polls in each country, the happiness score takes account of GDP, social support, personal freedom and levels of corruption.
This year the authors also used data from social media to compare people's emotions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. They found "strong increases in anxiety and sadness" in 18 countries but a fall in feelings of anger.
The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing, report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote.
World leaders should take heed.
The report raised some eyebrows when it first placed Finland at the top of its listings in 2018.
Many of the Nordic country's 5.5 million people describe themselves as taciturn and prone to melancholy, and admit to eyeing public displays of joyfulness with suspicion.
But the country of vast forests and lakes is also known for its well-functioning public services, ubiquitous saunas, widespread trust in authority and low levels of crime and inequality.
Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.
Kathleen Mpofu one of Moyo's lawyers said the journalist will go on trial April 28.
The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding, Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.
It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense.
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.
We just want to see that there's law and order.
If somebody has committed a crime or is perceived, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system.
That's our position, Mangwana said.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.
MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial.
That is our position throughout till the end of the case.
All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial, Moyo said.
Moyo, a Zimbabwean national, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
Zimbabwe Police Block Main Opposition Rallies
Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018.
The police says the rally ban in Mavhunga, about 80 kilometers east of Harare, is meant to ensure peace and stability.
Police camped overnight Friday at a venue in Marondera, where the leader of Zimbabwes main opposition, the Citizens Coalition for Change, Nelson Chamisa, was supposed to address his supporters Saturday.
The 44-year-old candidate later came to disperse the crowd waiting for him.
We are a party of peace, a party of the rule of law, he said.
Chamisa said his party does not want to fight with people.
He said the government denied permission to hold a rally, so the party asked for permission to come and tell about that.
He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death.
Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.
In an interview Sunday, Fadzayi Mahere, the Citizens Coalition for Change spokeswoman said her party was not happy with the bias of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and the police in favor of the ruling ZANU-PF.
Our rally in Marondera was purportedly banned and yet ZANU-PF was car rally and other unsanctioned in the very same area, she said.
"Not once have they sought authorization or given notice to the police, yet these unlawful prohibitions are meted out against us.
Ours is a struggle of non-violent resistance.
However, the thousands that came out just to hear president Chamisa speak shows beyond any doubt that the citizens are prepared to do whatever it takes to reclaim their dignity.
We continue to urge supporters to register to vote in their masses so that we attain our target in 2023: A landslide victory."
Zimbabwe police Sunday refused to comment on the ban of the Citizens Coalition for Change in Marondera.
It issued a letter to the opposition saying it needed time to prepare to ensure there was peace at the rally.
Two weeks ago, violence instigated by suspected ruling ZANU-PF supporters at a Citizens Coalition for Change rally resulted in two deaths and dozens injured.
Alexander Rusero, a former senior politics lecturer at Harare Polytechnic college, says police and political parties must thwart violence at opposition rallies.
Police have arrested 16 suspected ZANU-PF supporters who are accused of causing the violence and who now face murder charges in connection with the deaths at the opposition rally.
Zimbabwes pre-election season has been marred by violence that has claimed lives and left thousands injured since 2000 after a strong opposition party emerged.
