For kontri dem wey don develop, di distribution of household income dey always come for olive shape form wey dey sharp for di two end and e plump for di middle.
For oda words, for kontri wey don develop di middle-income group dey usually accpount for 60 per cent go reach 70 percent of di population.

One letter to DSS and oda intelligence agencies dem
Una suppose dey smart.
I know say na from police you for evolve just as many oda agency dem.
As you take komot from di police you suppose clean pass dem, make you smart, make you dey quick for your feet.
Shey na politics come over una?
I hear say di National Security Adviser, Monguno, for di first time since dem appoint am years ago, wey he dey sound very eloquent with im Queen's English.
Make dem polish am, afta all im na one of dis ajebutter Nigerian wey get priviledge to attend Kings College back in di day.
From im speech I dey hear and I dey see one mind wey dey organised and intelligent, functional brain, and i wonder why and how Abba Kyari take manage to cage dat kain pesin and Buhari dey look.
Munguno later go on to allege say plenty inside di arms wey Nigeria pay for under di recent military chiefs wey don turn ambassador na im dem no fit find.
When im see say dem don dey ruffle feathers, im try to walk back wetin dem allege say im tok.
Some few days afta dat apun, we hear di news say Buhari be stop some weapon acquisition wey he wan make from Dubai through third parti dem.
Di report put Monguno for bad light and e wan expose im hypocrisy.
Shey we go ever get way to komot for inside dis insecurity maze?
We no longer dey hear from di leadership for inside DSS.
Afta di initial gra-gra and controversy dem don silent.
No one dey hear or dey see Yusuf Bichi anymore, but we dey see smart DSS chaps dem inside dark suits ad goggle wey dey do dem bodiguard service to di high and mighty.
We even dey see dem on top few occasion wey dem go dress like ninja, dem go complete like balaclavas plus some out-of-this-world machine guns dem.
But na there e for end.
E be like say di president no care about di efficacy of DSS and so dem sef don jejely withdraw enter dem cocoon.
Some politics dey go on for there.
Di police, we sabi dem problem; that one don tey.
I don dey write so I no go draw attention of dis bodi dem kom my side
But well I go dey available for dem attention if dem take am personal.
I dey write as concerned citizen of Nigeria.
I dey fear say intelligence no dey for dis kontri anymore.
I dey prompted to write specifically bikos di nation don drift totally and even as we accuse politician say dem don sleep, no excuse for awa intelligence services dem to dey snore too.
E dey be like say dem don abandon Nigeria for di hand of element like kidnapper, secessionist, fake news agent dem, online terrorist, plus oda form of terrorist.
Who no know say security for di level of intelligence don loss?
wiaas Nigeria don kom disrespect di police, but many still dey fear di intelligence service dem seek of say we dey see dem as elite corps.
At least dem no fit see dem for road dey kolekt money from bus drivers dem.
However, pesin fit confirm say wit di rifeness of crime, di way di society don dey fall apart, di intelligence service don loss dem bite and famed prowess, especially for inside dis goment.
How one group wey no get face wey dem name FUNAM dey plant dat kind plenty wahala for inside Nigeria society and we get intelligence service wey dey komot eye?
Whoever e be wey dey put statement out for FUNAM dey play small pikin play for inside di mind of Nigeria pipo but even professor dem dey believe dem.
Dis one na bikos, for di end, for dis kontri we dey very emotional.
However, di intelligence service don komot eye as if say dem no see as all dis things dem dey go on.
I google statement by FUNAM so I go fit get some direct quote for dis article and one statement from 2018 pop komot
wiain na dis same FUNAM claim say Nigeria na dem only inheritance and say di whole of Nigeria go reach di Atlantic na dem get am, say Plateau na dem indigenous territory, even as dem dey claim say na dem do some bad bad kilin dem.
For recent times, di same group claim say na dem attack Benue Governor Ortom, and only dem no see am kill bikos of some kind small error for communication.
Di group further tok am say dem intension no get doubt: TO KILL AM.
Dem go fulfil di mission one day and e go dey very soo too.
Furthermore, we warn pipo wey dey collabo to take work against Fulani pipo for inside Nigeria: WE GO GET YOU NO MATTER WIA YOU HIDE
We tok am clearly, we go confront any state or individual wey dey oppose RUGA
Any State or individual that opposes ranching, we shall get you.
Speak against ranching or RUGA even for internet: awa fighters dem wey no dey make noise go find you and dem go fix you
For di next few month wey go follow, FUNAM go attack some strategic human and material assests for inside states and non state group dem or individual wey we know say dem dey do anti Fulani campaign. We go hunt you down for your house, for your wrk place, inside your car, for your street.
a matter of time.
Pipo sign dis document but dem neva catch any person, and awa intellingence serveice dem neva declare say na fake.
From my own humble perception dis satement dem be like pikin tok, wey pesin wey dey look for wahala, wey wan make pipo vex, wey wan cause disunity write.
Di statement also take eye away from di real pipo wey dey do di bad.
I be don dey on top plenty WhatsApp group dem wey I dey try to calm pipo down and bring dem attention say dem dey manipulate dem mind.
But why I dey do work wey DSS suppose do?
Even Ortom don call press conference before wia im for read anoda statement wey di group put for online to di extent say Benue state na dem own and dey e dey sweet dem to kill Tiv pipo dem!
Plenty Nigeria pipo don dey hail Ortom say im na governor wey love im pipo on top im public show dem.
However, dem must catch pipo wey attack am.
We hear say police don catch some fishermen for inside di area.
I don dey careful as dem put evri crime for Nigeria on top herders dem.
Shey no be say we dey give oda criminals dem space to ride on top awa sentiment?
Shey wetin we dey tok be say with all resources dem wey awa intelligence service dem get, pesin no dey wey fit find di pipo wey dey dump things for online, wey dey stew up di mind of Nigerians, wey dey kos wahala evriwia and wey dey get pipo prepare for war or make nation scatter?
Shey na di best wey we fit do be dis gentlemen?

As partner dem do fantastic as well, he added.

(II) Why secession no be di silver bullet to di problem wey Nigeria get (II)
Di pipo wey dey do say make Nigeria break up put am on top three main reason dem; di amalgation of northern and southern protectorate for 1914 wey born Nigeria, di charter of sef determination for inside United Nation plus lack of representation and marginalisation for inside di affairs of di kontri.
The mind say na di amalgamation of 1914 wey secessionist group dey say be di foundamental move wey cause plenty inside di current challenge dem wey dey face Nigeria need make dem challenge welwel and debunk am totally.
For dis regard, e go benefit us to know say amalgation be don apun earlier for 1906 wia dem merge di Lagos colony wey don dey since 1862 wit southern protectorate.
Like di 1914 amalgamation wey follow wey dey enervate di secession pipo dem, di amalgamation wey apun for 1906 too na force dem take do am between entity dem wey no dey willing and dem get little or no cultural similarity.
Wetin di pipo of costal state for inside Niger Delta region get culturally and historically wit Yoruba pipo of southwest?
Wetin be di historical and cultural link wey di Igbo wey dey for east hinterland get wit Yoruba for dat matter?
As far as we fit see am, di reason to take reject di amalgamation of 1914 go reach for di one of 1906 on top say na force dem force di two against pipo wey get different history and culture.
Why secession pipo dey only tok about di 1914 amalgamation to take press dem demand and dem dey neglect di one wey apun for 1906?
Di reason dem dey simple bikos for dem own narrow political tok wey dey try justify North vs South secessionist agenda na di 1914 amalgamation enter am pass.
E no go form beta strategy if dem dey also tok about di amalgamation wey dey essential, by import and effect, and e dey similar to di one wey apun for 1914.
How e go take look for instance if Oduduwa secessionist tok say na bikos of si amalgamation for 1906 di Igbo wey get different history and culture don kom dominate di economic and commercial life inside Lagos and as such di Oduduwa dey seek to komot for di marriage with Igbo wey di British pipo be force on top dem.
or di Igbo dey say na di amalgamation of 1906 kos the bad nature of economic infrastructure wey dem concentrate put for Southwest wey dey carry dem (Igbo) kom invest for Lagos economic zone rather than di East wey go dey convienient pass?
Anoda falacy wey dem carry concerning di 1914 amalgamation be wey Nigerian entity dem represent sign be say e supoose expire afta hundred years wey mean say na 2014.
Say Nigeria still dey exist afta im expiry date na somethingg wey secessionist dem still dey try to instigate oda Nigeria pipo against and make sure say dem end of dis joinjoin wey don expire as dem dey call am.
Again dis one na near tok wey no get leg.
By 1914 di British don get full and total kontrol of di territory wey we dey cal Nigeria now and all di entities as dem be don dey under British rule.
Dem don establish di British colonial rule on top Nigeria and na dat one make di amalgamation pure administrative measure by colonial overload wey im no need permision from im subject to carry am out.
For this regard di amalgamation no fit get time to expire as dem dey claim, and e no get.
If time ever dey for di amalgamation to take expire as dem dey claim, e suppose be for di end di British colonial enterprise wey be say at di same time no be British go determine am.
If any genuine document dey wey carry di terms and condition of di 1914 amalgamation wey include pipo wey represent various pre-existing Nigerian entities plus clause wey dey state di clause for di expiry, na di work od di pipo wey dey pray for Nigeria to break up to present am as proof.
For any case, even if such document dey, as Nigeria take get independence for 1960 e no go dey valid again bikos na evri entity for Nigeria dey take part wit di representative wey dem elect to take discuss and agree on top di new kontri.
If di kind agreement wey dem dey carry about di amalgamation dey anywia and if di parti dem wey follow tok about di independence agree to retain am and dem include am inside di independence constitution, e for don bikom relevant constitution and legal case for di secession entity to take cite dem agitation.
On top di issue of di UN provision on sef-determination as dem take cite am for dem secession action, e dey important make dem get two important point for mind.
Di UN no be world goment wey get executive power to take stamp dem will on top national goment dem.
Kontri fit use di principle of sovereignty to take block any resolution wey UN make if dem see say e no follow dem national interest.
Although Nigeria follow sign to di UN charter wey di provision of sef-determination follow, e fit and dem get right to block attempt from any group withing wey wan break di kontri if dem use dat provision.
Thus even as e dey unlike say any group break away from Nigeria and UN support am, Nigeria fit use dem sovereign right to stand against such move.
But di thing wey dey more significant be say although di UN charter dey providde sef detrmination, di UN don place great onus to take seek dem credential and case comprehensively.
Di process to take ssek and to eventually get di support of UN for sef-determination bid dey very complicated and covoluted one wey fit take year to set and e still fit no get success at di end.
Those seeking to invoke di UN principle of sef-determination for dia secessionist bid must first of all prove say dem get di mandate of di pipo of di area dey seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through di media or internet. Di pipo wey dey try to evoke UN principle of sef-determination for dem secessionst bid must firts prove say dem dey do wetin pipo for di area wey dem dey represent want wit popular election or referendum no be through media or internet.
Dem must to show proof say di area wey want do secession dem don dey deny dem or say dem no get adequate representation for local, state and national level of di goment of di kontri.

Issue dem wey FG must fix to regain glory inside cotton matta
For di last two years, di production of cotton don dey gather momentum, but dem neva solve di challenge wey farmer dem dey face.
Farmer wey dey farm cotton mostly na smallholders, and production na largely through rain-fed system, using traditional farm tools and animal traction (animal drawn implements).
However, few don get access to tractor.
For late 1980s, e reach 900,000 smallholder dem wey dey grow cotton, den hold average of 0.5 to 1.5 hectare for di total area wey dem estimate as 700,000 hectare across di kontri.
However, as di textile and garment industry don collapse, plus poor market, most of di farmer dem abandon production enter oda crop dem wey get better market.
Current production level
Dem estimate di annual demand of cotton for Nigeari at 88,000 metric tonnes of lint, wey reach 225,000 metric tonnes of seed cotton.
Until 2019, di total domestic production dey below 60,000 as plenty farmer dem dey struggle to achieve di average yield of between 400kg and 750kg of seed cotton per hectare despite di fact say some of di field prospect of about 2.5 to 3.0 metric tonne per hectare.
Statistics from di National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN) show say di nomba of farmer dem under di association don grow from 90,000 for 2018 reach 134,000 farmer dem for di 2020 wet season.
For 2019, di farmers dem achieve 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes, wey amount reach increase of about 80,000 metric tonnes.
For inside dis 2020 wet season, dem expekt make production reach 200,000 metric tones, accordinto NACOTAN.
Di current market
A farmer, Bala Sarkin Ruwa for Shelleng, inside Adamawa State, tell Daily Trust on Sunday say e sell di two ton of im cotton early for 180,000.
But im counterpart, Mr Joshua Dadi tok say he sell for N200,000 for January 2021, he describe di price say e fair.
Mr Anibe Achimugu, national president of di NACOTAN and managing director for ARewa Cotton describe di current price say e good for farmer dem, if dem compare to previous one.
For 2019, di price for one tonne be N205,000 for farmer dem.
Dat one mean say one farmer be dey do over 100,000 profit directly into di pocket if e dey able to poduce 2 tonnes of seed cotton.
Di intervention an such say di Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wan jump start di sector.
And of course, you wan leave am, to large extend, for market-driven price dem and demand.
Now, di minimum price, at least for dis year, na N185,000 per metric tonne, wey still better pass make dem leave am on im ownand e no go encourage farmer dem, and so on, wia price dem be N150,000 per metric tonne.
I thingk say di minimum price wey dem guarantee since di intervention be don dey good, as e tok am.
Issue of quality seed
Professor Ishiyaku Mohammed, the executive director for di Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, tok say di institute don release 13 different variants of cotton seed dem wey get veri important economic attribute dat increase di income of farmer and provide different product for utilisation, either as fibre or for making textile product dem, or to even to provide oil.
Di farmer dem tok say lats year, dem access to better seed wey get quality dey improved, wey get potential yirld of 2.5 tonne per hactareif dem follow di best agronomic practice.
With dat, Achimugu tok say a farmer be dey jump for yield figure between 400 to 500 kilogram per hectare to 1.2, 1.5 and in fact, some be dey get reach 2.5 tonne per hectare.
You know say na how well you take manage your farm, di dedication plus skil wey you get, but i go tell you specifically say di lowest wey we record na around 700 to 750kg per hectare.
But farmer dem be dey hit 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes per hectare, e dey fantastic.
For 2018, di gederal goment, through di National Varietal Release and Naming Committee, be approve commercialisation of two transgenetic variety of cotton, MRC 7377 BG 11 and MRC 7361 BG II wey Mahyco Nigeria Private Ltd develop, as dem collabo wit di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in di Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.
To resuscitate cotton industry, a lifeline
Cotton na key component for di textile and garment industry dem bikos e dey provide fibre to take manufacture textile product dem.
However, di faith wey di taxtile industry get for inside di nation don go down to pulp for decade since di glorious years.
For di 1970s and di 1980s, di Nigeria textile industry be account for about 25 per cent of di manufacturing value added (MVA).
Na be largest employer of labour (e pass 600,000 people during the 1970s to 1980s) for di manufacturing sector afta public sector for di early 1990s.
However, expert don see di collapse of di textile industry wey turn Kaduna to household name for di kontri as high operating cost, wey dey result from poor energy supply, decay of infrastructure and proliferation of di market with textile dem wey cheap and di one wey dem smuggle.
Dem also force some to relocate go oda kontri dem withing di sub-region.
Among di 54 ginneries wey dey avilable for Nigeria, Only 22 dey function for very low capacity utilisation.
Di ginning capacity for di ginneries wey dey exist na about 650,000 tonnes of seed cotton but national production dey fall to less than 60,000 tonnes per year wey dey represent about 10 per cent capacity utilisation accordin by di data from di Raw Material Research and Development Council (RMRDC).
Dis trend get spirally limiting effekt on top di cotton value chain development localy, na im add to take kos make plenty textile industry (83) fold up between 1995 reach now, as di few wey dey function dey perform for low capacity utilisation, as Professor Hassaini Ibrahim Doko, the director-general, RMRDC tok.
Expert tok say to bring cotton value chain back to life and im glorious day dem, di federal goment must to champion di revival of industry dem wit many many policy dem and financial intervention.
FG must to tackle smuggling, cheap import
Di Director-General for di Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association, Alhaji Hamma Kwajaffa, tok say smuggling plus cheap Chinese product na di probblem for cotton industry inside di kontri.
Despite say procurement act dey say make dem dey look for local content first, nothingg don change much as plenty inside di material wey dem dey use for uniform dey kom from China, as oda dem dey kom from China, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Di original thing suppose be say we dey source all awa uniform locally from di textile kompany dem.
If you look awa school dem, Army, Navy, Air Force, Immigration, Customs etc, if dem dey source dem uniform locally, of kos many of di textile industry no for close.
Smuggling na awa actual problem.
You know say dealer fit go China; and for China, anything wey you ask for, dem fit do am for you.
Dem dey go China wit awa textile design and di Chinese go do am for dem as dem take want am, and dis go end up for market inside Nigeria, Alhaji Kwajaffa lament.
Cotton farmer, through NACOTAN want make federal goment take cotton up as national asset and make dem introduce Nigeria standard, wey fit help di kontri get better gradin system, as well as to establish laboratory wey dem go take dey test cotton wit high volume instrument, e also tok say na dis one go take care of di issue dem.
Bandit dem affect production.
For di last two years, plenty cotton farmer dem no fit reach dem farm, bikos of di things wey bandit dem dey do along major production area dem.
E neva tey, wey di only textile company wey dey survive for inside Kaduna State be shut down operation and dem sack pass 100 staff bikos say raw material no dey as di farmer dem dey complain say bandit dem no allow dem reach farm.
Stakeholder dem tok say make goment ginger dem security architecture make farmer dem fit return to dem farm as dat one na di only way to take reduce poverty for rural community dem.
Abdullahi Salisu Dayi, farmer for inside Malumfashi Local Goment, tok say unless some wey dey spectacular apun to take favour di production of cotton, e doubt am if farmer dem go wan do am as dem do last year.
Climate change wey dey affect production
Last year, many cotton farmer for inside Katsina, Gombe and Adamawa state dem be suffer erratic rainfall, wey do affect yield.
Some farmer dem wey speak wit Daily Trust on Sunday for Adamawa, Katsina and Gombe tok say heavy rainfall be affect dem yield welwel.
Joshua Dadi for Kem, Adamawa State, tok say im yield dey affected bikos say rain stop suddenly.
Although he get 4 tonnes for im two-hectare farm, di yield no reach di yield of 2019.
Hamisu Sani for Katsina tok say cotton farmer dem suffer most as di demand for di produce no be like as e be for rice, maize or soybeans, yet di price dey good for N200,000 per tonne.
He add say plenty rain wey fall be enter awa farm and e stop di crop to grow, and e also make di cotton ball make dem rotten for early stage.
Anoda farmer wey dey grow cotton for large scale, Alhaji Kamilu Kankara, tok say im also suffer low yield of di produce bikos say rain fall plenty.
Over di years, demand wey dey on top food don prompt make I withdraw gradually from massive cotton production.
E be like say na dis year worst pass for me as I harvest only nine bags from inside two hectare wey be dey give three tonnes of cotton, as e take tok am.
With population wey don grow pass 200 million and army of youth wey no get job wey dey waka for street, expert dem be tok make goment give priority to sector like agriculture big attention, both for budget, policies and financial intervention dem.
Farmers Cocoa production no dey progress for Edo
Cocoa farmer dem for inside Edo State don lament say lack of support from di state and federal goment dey hinder cocoa production for inside di state.
Di state chairman of di assocition, Thomas Ekpenriebe, be state dis for Benin wen im dey follow journalist tok on top di prospect of cocoa farming for di state.
He tok say di farmer dem neva get any support from either di state goment or di Federal goment, like input and funding, e tok say di development be dey affect cocoa production for di state.
As e dey now for Edo, we dey Ibadan and Ondo State to get new hybrid cocoa bikos di cocoa seed garden for inside di state no dey function, and nobody dey mange am.
Also, extension service no dey for cocoa farmer dem for di state.
For di 1960s, cocoa na im be di cash crop wey dem use to develop di kontri.
Today, nothing dey kom from di state or federal goment.
We just dey work on awa own and e dey affect cocoa production for di state and di kontri in general, as e take tok.
Di farmer dem call for support from di Edo State Goment to invest put for cocoa farming by make dem wake di extension service again, make dem re-establish cocoa seed garden to take avoid travel to oda state dem for seed and also to take generate more money for di state.
Di chairman be also lament about di acitivity of middlemen dem inside cocoa business for di state, wey im tok say dey affekt di profit wey dey on top cocoa.
When im dey call say make dem re-establish cocoa board all over di kontri, di board go serve as regulatory bodi wey go help cocoa farmer dem to know buyer wey get license and regulate price for di commodity.
He explain say currently, na Edo State get di best quality cocoa due to di concerned effort by stakeholder dem.
Ekpenriebe also point finger for climate wey no dey favour, COVID-19 plus say regulatory bodi no dey as major block for di sector.
Development on top entrepreneurship: Purpose and mindset
Afta colonial master dem arrive enter various part of wetin later bekom Nigeria, and di begining of introduction of Western-style administration, di need to train native oublic servant start.
As need for various service dey increase, di vacancy dem for trained manpower kontinu to dey plenty for many decadego reach di 1980s.
But for late 1980s, we don begin not to just dey saturate di public service dem, but be like dem don employ too much.
If any realistic and prudent thing go apun to awa public service dem ova di next one decade, e go be delibrate and systemic rightsizing, and dat na di polite way to say downsizing except for di military, di police and oda such service dem.
Yes, obviously, pipo go die or make dem retire and need go dey to employ for replacement and for some kind marginal growth too.
But di vacancies combined no dey likely to meet up wit di rate graduates from high school and university dey komot from all around di kontri.
We have to, therefore, no be to accept di reality say di public sector neva suppose dey dere to just to employ graduates alone but also to gladly accept di truism say di public sector suppose, instead, focus on to develop di enabling environment wey go see to di creation and growth of business of all size dem for all sector and crany of di kontri.
If you ask me, successive federal goment dem for di past don do well to take encourage graduates to enter sef-develoment and business through program dem wit di Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, SMEDAN, NDE, NIRSAL, etc.
But di call neva dey sufficiently loud and equivocal: Di goment must cease to dey create any impression say e fit employ di plenty youth , make dem honest and communicate clearly say employment opportunity dem dey limited for di public sector wey fit dey komot from time to time.
Instead, make di goment kontinu dey focus on top to streghten di various interventionist and enabling program dem wey go facilitate di creation of employmeny by youth demsef.
Obviously, all di program wey we donmention before fit only succeed and dem go dey sustainable if dem put a sense of responsibility of accountability for inside pou youth.
Wit population wey pass two hundred million pipo and e still dey grow, more than sufficient local market dem dey for plenty product and service dem.
From abundant land wey dey fertile for agriculture all across di kontri, reach solid minerals inside most state of di federation; information technology, manufacturing and services, we be plenty opportunity for entrepreneurs wey seriuos.
Ova weeks wey dey kom, dis column go try to bring out topical issue on top entrepreneurship wey go help awa youth to understand opportunities amd how to take seize dem and create jib for demsef and odas.
Di starting point for any and evri endeavour wey dey worthy in life na two: purpose and mind-set.
One of di reason wey plenty pipo fail to achieve maeningful and sustainable success for inside business and life na bikos dem fail to identify di purpose of dem life from di begining.
Even when dem fit boast of wetin be like outward achievement wey dey reasonable, dem fit still lack di internal satisfaction wey dey neccessary to kip dem motivated and going for di marathon wey dis life be.
Na lack of purpose be dey make us loss resources like awa time, money, effir dem, relationship, etc.
For di long run, we realise say e don deprive us of true meaning for di various sphere of awa lives and di cintentment wey go follow am kom.
Without any purpose or wit a weak one, e dey easy for pesin to sway komot form dem noble journey.
Entrepreneurship dey particularly challenging
If clear purpose wey get deep meaning wey dem internalise, you risk to miss your way or to give up when you hit headwinds, and plenty of am go dey for di journey!
Di next thing wey dey most important afta purpose na your mindset.
Either we know abi we no know, evrithing dey start wit awa mindset.
Successful entrepreneurs have an amazing perception of what dey want to achieve years and even decades before it becomes reality. Entrepreneur dem wey dey successful get perception wey dey amazing on top di thing wey dem wan achieve years and decades even before e go bekom reality.
Na di clearity of di vision wey dey dem mind dey kip motivation for dem inside and dem no dey show say dem tire outside.
And so e be like say nothing fit stop dem.
For di conceptual development and production of di Snow White and di Seven Dwarfs, DI America pesin Walt Disney be face resistance wey no dey believable from financier dem, contributor and oda associate dem, include im broda, Roy Disney.
Gossip pipo for inside Hollywood dey call di project say na Disney's Folly.
But Disney dey very clear for im mind on top wetin im be wan achieve.
Im no gree to make im focus komot for di outkom wey im desire.
For di end, di projekt be cost whopping 1.5 million US dollars of 1938.
But for di first weekend wey dem release am, Snow White bring $8 million, wey be like $134 million for current dollar!
Dis level for confidnece neva no fit be by accident.
Na consequence of mindset wey don commit say e go achieve some goal dem wey dem don identify.
Ask any entrepreneur wey don dey successful, dem go gree wit dis tori on top vision, mindset and resolve.
Wit clear purpose and mindset wey dey committed, di nect thing wey budding entrepreneur need to aware about na what dem go expekt for entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurship: Wetin you must expect for inside di journey go dey dis column next week.
Musbahu El Yakub na author, business consultant and entrepreneur.

Grazing wahala: why make state dem follow Zamfara template
Kwagga Dlama Zira Eliphelet na architect, designer and projekt manager for di Zamfara Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) projekt.
For dis interview wit Daily Trust on Sunday, he tok say dem fit use di model of Zamfara to take solve di crisis between herders and farmers across di kontri.
Im opinion na say di best way to take implement di template na base on di peculiarity of each state, wit di overall interest of creating peace, jobs and economic opportunities.
Crisis dey di livestock sector for Nigeria, especially for di area of animal feeds.
Plenty stakeholder dey suggest say one of di to move forward na to create ranches for herders to take tame grazing crisis wit farmer dem.
As expert for dis area, to what extent you thingk say dis fit help?
Di farmer-herders crisis wey don kontinu to dey apun don chop enter di fabric of dis nation and e follow join di division wey we dey experience.
As matter of fact, ranching na di solution for dis problem bikos for evri well meaning Nigerian, RUGA, wey stand for rural grazing area, don dey wit us since 1946, but e be don dey dormant.
For inside 21st century, di best way to take float production for di livestock system na to get farm or ranches for full commercial production.
Open grazing and to dey travel kilometre don komot for date for inside evri strata of humanity today.
So dis one na opportunity for us to tap awa potential for inside agriculture, wey we don forget.
Di RUGA template wey suppose adopt dey unique and peculiar.
State dem dey wey no fit get RUGA or ranch dem, but dem get di potential o take benefit for big capacity, concerning livestock production.
Di farmer need to produce wetin di herder go use as raw material, just as di cow dung be manure for di farmer.
Make dem no force di RUGA on all state dem, but each state fit take advantage of am, base on im own peculiarity.
If di state dem wey dey for far north buld ranches, i expekt say make southern state wey fit get RUGA take advantage of am make dem put up large scale fodder of pasture production farming, wey go sweep plenty of awa teeming youth komot for di street dem.
Dis one na opportunity for governor dem and commissioner of agriculture dem to look inside how we fit tap dis potential dem.
We no suppose see RUGA as program wey go kos division.
Wen di federal goment be moot di idea of national livestock program, some state, especially di south, say no to am, as dem tok say na way to take kolekt dem land give herders.
As expert wey you be, you fit torchlight how dem fit resolve am?
Di pipo wey dey sell di president no fit sell di idea welwel bikos, as a matter of fact, di issue of RUGA setllement no be to take kolekt land.
You no fit go inside Adamawa to kolekt pesin land, even if dem don mix with Fulani.
E no dey work like dat.
You go at peculiarity wey each state get to take decide if you fit establish settlement or not.
So make di president and im cabinet look inward and inside di peculiarity of each state.
Na why e be say today, despite na di main program of di president, dem neva still see am do.
Dis na bikos dem dey do am as say na di whole kontri.
Plenty goment farm dem dey wey dem don abbandon; dis na opportunity to take use dem.
Let us kom togeda to take negotiate dis project again and you go see say pipo go adopt di roadmap.
Make us make we get policy wey fit work for all of us, plus make di purpose dey sincere.
Make proper dialogue dey between state dem wey dey fit for dis project, and dis one go put harmony for di relationship wey we share.
Fear dem dey say e go difficult for di tradtional Fulani to stay inside ranch, how dem go attend to dat one? No be to stay inside ranch.
Just as indigenous pipo for oda part of di kontri dey reject dis bikos dem neva give dem sense of belonging to di project, na di same wit some indigenous Fulani wey no fit move bikos dem don internarry.
Fulani dey wey dey live for there.
For instance, inside Adamawa, some dey wey dey stay for one place, and dem fit show diffence for di ones wey dey do season movement dem.
So dem also fit adopt di system of say make dem dey oneplace if dem give proper orientation to dem.
Wetin I dey try tok be say make we find way to take stop di upward and downward movement.
Nobody go dispute di fact say fattening na when you kip cattle for one place.
Dis concept no be to imprison di herder but to provide new opportunity dem.
Zamfara na one of di state dem wey dey pilot RUGA, and you be key stakeholder for di project; wetin be di solution now?
Di project na bargaining chip for peace, so make economy for thrive.
When we be start work, dem tell us say before Governor Matawalle be enter office, di rate of bandits make di no dey accessible, but im dey able to bring peace.
Dis one no suppose apply for herder dem alone.
How we go take harness and build awa own farming community dem?
Which oda essential amenity and infrastructure dem we need to carry give awa farming community?
Shey na very good rural road go bring all di grass dem make dem kom out.
Shey na good canal dem wey go carry water reach wia di stream dem no reach, abi na borehole for interval to give good water, primary health care?
Some kind basic thing dey wey dem need to provide.
But na right of di citizen and e no suppose be priviledge.
Specifically, wetin you get inside di Zamfara RUGA project?
Di RUGA model get 23 item dem.
We get di road network, wey reach about 13.673 kilometres.
Di ranch dey for di Ranji Sakida Grazing Reserve inside Maradun Local Goment Area; and na 2,218 hectares.
Di plot phase be start wit about 100 hectare dem, but due to natural formation, e take about 300 hectare dem.
Dat one na for house and oda structure dem, but we expekt say make e take almost di whole place bikos of pasture production.
Oda reserve dey wey dem do for similar project dem, like Zumi Gidan Jaja wey reach about 36,200 hectare dem and di Dantsado Kuyanbana forest of about 10,000 hectare dem.
On top di pilot phase, di state goment be buy one pivot sprinkle system, wey get about 850 meter for diameter and radius wey reach 475.
Apart from di road dem, we get water reticulation, wey dey serve about 27 kilometre dem.
Water storage facility dey, four overhead plus four surface tank, each of dem dey carry 250,000 litre, all togeda go give you 2million litre dem.
Den we get industrial borehole wey solar dey power, wey dem 8 to each one.
We get 10 borehole wey dem don use hand sink.
As at December, di reticulation don almost reach 18 kilometres, for inside 27.
We also get health facility dem, wey include one primary health care with 30-bed capacity and theartre dem, outdoor patient department, one nursery to take deliver, dem attach am to di maternity.
We no dey expekt case wey pass di capacity of di health care.
Veterinary clinic dey, wey get capacity to accommodate reach 1,000 withing im own confines.
And e get im own thaetre and isolation room dem, e include 12 paddocks.
Market dem dey wit open and close stalls and abbattoir dem.
But for di context of Fulani man, he no dey kill im animal for im environment, so e go carry am go far to kill, so di abattoir dey outside di ranch.
Na Maradun town di abattoir go dey.
We get 210 plot dem for herders, each measure reach 2,475 square meter, and dem divide to four.
Na six hundred square meter dem give for area wey dem go live make di herder fit build im hut di way he want am.
Dem divide di three wey reamin, fence and denarcate dem, each paddock get gate.
We provide squat system for dem and soak-away for each house.
For inside di 210 plot wey dey, five bedroom dem dey for Fulani or Hausa leader dem.
Two bedroom dem dey for ward head dem.
Religion facility dem dey: one eid ground, one central mosques and space wey dey outdoor wey fit take reach 1,000 pipo dem.
Also one Islamiyya dey attached to di mosque, plus one school, so dem fit get opportunity of Islamic and western education.
Oda space dem dey for future development.
Wetin be di economic benefit of di settlement for future time?
We get phase one and two.
Phase one na to provide di basic amenity dem to bring di herder dem back into cluster.
Di economic benefit be say e go attract investor dem all ova di world.
E go bring di production of meat, wey go later provide revenue.
E go open job opportunity for veterinary doctor dem, agricultural extension worker dem, company wey fit kom dey do milk, cheese nd manure production, bio gas, bone processing, hide and skin processing, animal feed for di blood, to combine am wit oda ingredients, then pasture production from farmer dem.
Di $250m fundin wey dem plan for national acrrier dey unsetle operator dem
One projection by federal goment to raise $250 million for di national carrier wey dem propose don dey make operator dem dey ask question for inside di aviation industry, as Daily Trust report am.
According to one document weu aviation ministry release last week, di federal goment expect make private investor dem raise $250m for di carrier wey dem dey propose as dem insist say dem go deliver di project before 2023 kom.
For inside di document wey give update on top di national carrier project and oda sub-project inside di roadmap, di Ministry of Aviation explain say dem don complete di project development phase.

$250m approximately na im private investor go raise to take start up airline
But stakeholder doubt di feasibility of di project, dem tok say investor fit no get will to put dem money for such venture.
Rather, some of dem call on di goment to harvest di facility of di airline under dem management to set up di national carrier.
Di Managing Director, Flight and Logistics Solution, Amos Akpan tok say e go be big task for private investor dem $250m to take establish national airline.
He attribute di difficulty to plenty oda factor like return on top investment (ROI), business environment, and oda dem.
He tok say, to take position to attract investment dey more critical for now.
If di gestation of investment run enter di next goment wey dey kom for 2023, shey e go affect di agreement wey dem don establish wit dis goment?
Nigerians dem still dey experience discriminatory aircraft leasing agreement and insurance program dem.
We still dey try to effect di implementation of no duty on top aircraft spare part dem.
Di forex regime neva accommodate airline operator dem.
Interlining and cooperation still dey di concept stage.
Make we fix di platform or foundation first before we go fit build or launch on top am.
For im remark, aviotion analyst and Head of Research Zenith Travel, Olumide Ohunayo, state say no amount too small for national carrier if high credibility dey and contact with lessors, aircraft manufacturers and oda airline dem.
Group captain John Ojikutu (rtd), wey be aviation analyst, wonder wetin $250m go do for di project and di would-be investor dem.
Private investor dem go include foreign and local; how much be $250m for national carrier or how many aircraft dat one go buy?
How much di goment investment of 10% go be inside nationa carrier?
If we want national carrier make am now
or make we beta go for flag carrier and di goment go take rest from di journey wey im start for 1993 wen di national carrier bekom goment airline.
But anoda analyst, Mr. Chris Aligbe, tok say to raise $250m for di project no go dey difficult, e note say many investor dem dey and dem dey will to put dem money on top di project.
According to am, di $250m go dey more than enough to start di project depending on di strategy wey dem dey adopt.

Reason why wheat still dey cost.
For uncountable years, di tori of wheat for Nigeria dey dey well even as federal goment and task force take tok say take add join wheat wey dem dey produce.
Di shallenge now don force many farmers wey dey plant wheat carry dia power go dey plant rice wey dey enjoy funding and policies wey sweat body.
Wheat wey dem dey demand for we domot don rish over 6 million tonnes (MTs) as we take dey plenty more more wey dem estimate say na over 200 million.
For example, di demand of pipo wey dey do flour dey na like 5.1 MTs while odas wey still dey use am dey use about 1m MTs.
Di rice wey dem dey produce now as Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) take estimate am na 420,000 MTs, and e go climb rish 600,000 MTs wen dem start to dey plug rice next two months.
Few month ago, di price of wheat rish N32,000 for one 100kg bag wey force flour and wetin dem dey carry am do like bread put money.
As dem take dey produce wheat dey waka slow because e get one wahala wey dey am drag am since 2018.
ABP not role.
Since 2018, farmer wey dem plant wheat, dem nor enjoy wetin Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) dey give dem again
Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) after dem enjoy about N2.3 billion dat year.
This year about 285,000 farmers na im CBN done put hand but di moni palava wey show face as dem dey recover moni wey dem borrow for 2018, wey be about 40 percent, nor help mata.
The President of WFAN, Alhaji Salim Mohammed Sale, tell Daily Trust say dem no gree put dem for ABP even as dem get about 285,000 farmers wey dem don put hand and dey qualify.
Alhaji Sale tok say as dem take dey recover take dey poor, first participating financial institution witidrewcomeot hand for mata and CBN nor gree make dem shange to anoda bank.
Na di same hapun for 2019 wia dem don put hand for 11,000 farmers but dem not fit kolet di fund bicos of di recover of 2018.
Alhaji Sale still tok say, dis year dem engage 285,000 farmer dem and CBN don put hand for di list.
Afta we follow Unity Bank talk, dem say dem nor wan follow us work, we kom waka go Keystone Bank.
Afta we don meet evri requirement, Keystone write letter to kolet moni for di programme, but some kain palava dey because e get one gbese wey we nor get moni pay for.
So dem say make we waka go Unity Bank wia we get di gbese.
We draw out like three or four point say make dem continue di programme wit us so dat one; We go fit produce wheat wella; two, nor be di farmer wey march law dey go di programme so e go teach dem lesson and go make dem pay backcome join again; three, we go don learn from wetin don happun and we go bring something wey beta to take dey recover; four, to bring katapila wey go make di programme get head.
He tok di best way nor be to stop di programme patapata but to luk as dom fit take improve recovery, e add say nor be all farmer wey dey plant rice, maize and cotton pay all their gbese but programme still continue for dem.
E tok say dis go affect to dy produce wheat, tok say, as di ABP take dey, plenti farmer no go still wan go into production
Alhaji Sale tok say,na di joinbodi dey give farmers mind go plant becos of di agreement wey dem get wit pipo wey dey buy.
You nor fit plant somtin wey u nor go fit sell.
We try make market dey between we anddimillers.
Even each persin deycome tru di joinbodicome sell dia market to milling plants and dem dey find am easy.
Now we di programme nor dey, di farmer dey find am hard to sell their market inside di market.
Two, E norish don dey for subsector of wheat.
Di only way wey you fit take cut import moni wey we dey pay down na to tok to plenty farmer make dem produce.

E dey drag Nigeria comeot for up.
Security mata wey don spoil for di contri don pass normal.
Pipo wey don tok on top di mata don tok say hope nor dey.
To tok di wan wey small, e don shoke as persin, Nigeria pipo don dey doubt if we fit survive am and live togeda again as area wey get peace.
Big big pipo inside di kontri n aim e be like say dem doncomeot mind wey make dem tok say di only way wey tocomet dia palava na for federal goment to find foreign assistance to fit tackle security kasala.
Di opposition political parti inside di contri, PDP, join mouth put dey tell All Progressives Congress,APC we dey led say Nigeria need outside help to fit tackle security kasala wey don dis.
As e dey tok im own, di president of senate wey just pass, Bukola Saraki say president Muhammadu Buhari don dey taya ontop di security kasala, he de tanda say federal goment need sharpsharp help and make dem find am wit out nor waste time.
He also advise di president say make ekari all beforebefore president and heads of state, beforebefore and nownow chief justices, serving and oga dem for National Assembly, beforebefore and nownow oga dem for security agencies, traditional rulers dem wey get experience wey good, oga for private sector dem, development partners, friends of Nigeria for internationalcomemunity wit odas wey fit find solution for dimata wey dey ground.
Dis beforebefore Senate president still call di National Assembly say make dem find solution to di issue of insecurity as im add say di legislature nor gep dey help dis Buhari administration if dem nor add to dia tanda and decision for dia approach to take see di security palava tackle kiakia.
Di National Leader of di All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, say Nigeria need joinhand to tackle di security shallenge,dey tok say evri contri go pass tru hard time and we must dey united to take succeed.
He had put say nor president wan make kontri dey inside palava, e note say na only join hand response fit end dis plenty security kasala.
Di best way na wetin we dey do. Tocome togeda take reduce banditry, to move for unity and fit to bring a beta Nigeria give pipo.
The welfare of awa pipo dey very important.
And yes, everi contri go pass di hard and difficult time.
How we take dey tell am to pipo, na which area to take make am easy for pipo; na dem dat area on top how to fit change di leader for di contri; na im he tok.
The truth be say, mata neva spoil too spoil as many stakeholders take dey show am.
Hope neva lost finish.
Di one nor be say dem nor dey right for wetin dem see and wetin dem tok.
We fit savage dimata wit colabo wit all stakeholders especiallyditraditional rulers dem, religious leaders,joinjoin among security pipo and for federal goment to fit provide solution of tribe abi political interest.
Time doncome again wey be saydiwork of tradional ruler to make peace must dey recognized for every corner.
Na dem get culture of di pipo fo hand and dia religion to one place.
Traditional rulers becos of say dem dey close to di pipo, fit do big tin to take solve di security gbege if dem gather and follow dem tok wella from local goment go statecomerish federal.
If dem follow traditional ruler dem for every angle for di state yarn wella, dem fit be di koko of wia secutity pipo go dey get information as to take know criminal tin wey dey dia area because dem sabi dem wey dey di area
E dey needed for security agencies to work together as to take fight insecurity for di land.
To joinhand must dey among dem so dat one side gocomeot ahnd from wetin d other side dey do to avoid to dey two work and to shine eyes put information wey dem sendcome from every angle.
The bad mata hapun for Maiduguri some days ago as fighting jet we be dem Nigeria Airforce own take bomb Nigeria Soldiers wey dem go double cross boko haram na mata we open say beta information and coordination between two agencies nor dey.
All di agencies wey be koko for war mata must dey gather tori and spread am to dia sef to take sabi wen, wia and how enimies wan tackle wit di tori, dia plan go scatter and dem nor go fit attack not to tok of say dem go attack.
Religious leaders tru dia various organisations like Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, and others must dey follow and eye open ontop wetin dem go preach give dia pipo and how to take follow follow dia ways.
Dis men of God dem dey dey respect by dia piporish level say anything wey dem tok dem dey swallow go down whether di word go cause gbege or e nor go cause gbege.
Make dem mobilise dem well and sensitise dem on top danger wey dey for wrong preaching wey fit make one religion pipo dey fight di other.
Examples deon dey wey be say wen palava start from place wey dem dey worship becos of wetin leaders dem tell dia pipo say make dem do, whether to fight back because of one injustice or anoda one.
Witi beta training, dat kai tin nor go hapun becos dem go don train dem ontop wetin dem go preach and wetin dem nor go preach for dia pipo.
E dey koko to tok am here say all dis nor gocome for vain if goment for every level nor bring wey for peace to dey.
Goment for every level must provide beta beta tins wey youths go dey do to takecomeot their mind from crime.
As to dey try solve security yawa, goment sef suppose see say dem nor do partial ontop tribe, religion or politics as dem dey try solve security kasala.
Pipo wey do crime must dey treat disame disame as di law of di land we im dey take be.
Example of treating some criminals wit small hand na di arrest of some pipo wey dey do Bureau De Change for Kano wey dem say dem dey sponsor Boko Haram gbege.
Till now, how dem be never dey open, wey dey get bad way ontop to fight crime.
Goment must see say dem dey always get in touch wit pipo especially for di downdown for dem to sabi wetin bin dey hapun in di contri in oda not to gree for rumour to get power.
Witi dis one, Nigeria go fit bit di security kasala wey dey fight am for over 10 years wit easy.

Di call say make dem remove Khairat dey kom from di wahala of who go dey control di parti for di state between governor and some members wey dey vex ontop second term ticket for 2023 di next electioneering campaign beckons.
Di governor and some leader wey get mouth for di parti don dey digger something since dis tenure enta power in 2019 for di state ontop style wey im dey take rule.
But ontop all power to take bring everybody togeda under one umbrella, as one insider for di take tok am,dimata dey hot more more wit dis new wahala wey fit chop di parti comot for dis top seat for 2023 if dem nor dom am somtin by joining alldipower wey fall Peoples Democratic parti (PDP) administration for di state, wey former Senate President Bukola Saraki dey lead.
Many members of di group wey dey vex wey get di support of big parti leader like di Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and im fellow for transport (state), Gbemisola Saraki, under di factional caretaker chairman, Hon Bashiru Omolaja Bolarinwa (BOB), Khairat wey dem put dey among plan for di governor to hijack parti man-machine for di state as im dey build-up 2023 election.
Some of di top leaders and parti supporters inside di state, wey tok say dem don do dem ojoro ontop registration/revalidation process don accuse di former senator say im bin dey work wit Senator John Danboi committee wey head di last exercise for di state to do ojoro for members wey dem believe say dem dey fight di governor.
Im status for di committee, as dem dey drag am, bi to go finish work wey im bin start inside state for national level to clear road for di second term ticket ofdigovernor and open road wey roku for im to be di parti candidate for di next governor election.
One of di press release weu yarn d mata small, one faction of di APC for di state believe say dem loyal to di camp of Lai Mohammed and other members wey dey vex, and tok am korokoro say dem nor want make dem add Senator Gwadabe join di 61-member committee.
Di group wey pipo know as Integrity Group, inside on tok wey Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello sign yarn am kom outside dey dem nor acceptdiemployment.
As di group take talk, One governor sister dey do double mind work wit didiDanboi committee to kos many wahala and some wuruwuru against watin di parti want for inside Kwara
Anoda voice still kom outside wey dem believe say e dey front for di minister, ontop APC Youth Stakeholder, petitioned di national secretariat of di parti wey Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) dey run ontop di issue, say dem don do over 600,000 of dia member ojoro wit di wuruwuru of Senator Khairat.
Sometime after dem tok dia own, some governor men and supporters sef scatter full town dey wit trumpet dey drum and support for di governor and im sister ontop dimata.
Na di publicity secretary ofdiparty, Alhaji Folaranmi Aro, a strong loyalist of di governor first fire say; pipo wey dey against say dem put di senator nor get tok.
Under di supporter for di Reformist Progressive Forum, di group wey dey support governor inside one quick reply to di statement of integrity group, tok say di rejection of Senator Gwadabe by group of political small pikin for kwara nor get head and norish tok.
Dis one nah mumu criticism wey nor get sense and fit destroy.
When dem go meet am for tori, Saheed Popoola, one of di pipo wey dey loyal wella todiminister and im still be lawmaker for Kwara State House of Assembly from Offa, tell Daily Trust Saturday say im nor dey town.
But one top member of di parti and diehard supporter of di minister from Kwara Central tok say though Alhaji Lai Mohammed and few odas still register despite say dem condemn di exercise. Di action na to demo and to show we dey wit you give big big leaders dem for di parti like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu wey still tok say di process dey wonkain, make dem do am well.
But ontopmata on how di tin fit take affect di parti chance for 2023, dem Oga for di parti say; dimata long gan-an and dem fit put manymata ontop table before dat time.
Our workings now na to first get di wayo wey bend di last exercise and to get di hand of National leader dem to do fresh exercise for di state.
For Kunle Suleiman, lawyer wey be pioneer chairman of PDP for di state, wey still be one pesin wey sabi vex and beg di Governor and go still vex am, watin dey hapun na politics and di parti go grow pass am.
Im still tok say dia konsain na how dem go take make life beta wey di governor promise dem.

She dey entitle give am.
If she be sister to governor, shey dat one suppose deny her right?
For inside politices wey many factions dey, dis kain tin dey hapun.
Person wey dem nor give somtin go complain; and pipo wey dey complain be BOB and Lai group.
Dem think say dem fit controldiregistration exercise and parti politics but now kom see say e don comot for dia hand.
Dem dey complain because dem don lost for di power game of di parti now. E add join.

Dis same pipo wey say di governor nor go get ticket still tok like dat for im first time and dem nor vote for am, e still get am; and e go get am again.

Power: Nigeria pipo dey spend $21bn ontop generators — Reps
Di House of Representatives don tok say pipo wey dey manufacture lost $200 billion as other Nigeria pipo spend $21 billion ontop generators between 2015 and 2021 ontop light wey pesin generate for im sef ontop say light no good for di nation.
Di House also don call Di Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to suspend di increase wey dem wan do ontop price for light.
According to Aniekan Umanah wey moved di motion for di plenary for Thursday, NERC, dey work wit Distribution Companies (DisCos), and dem increased electricity tariff five times since 2015, di last one na January1, 2021.
As e take talk, despite say dem increases, Nigeria pipo neva enjoy beta ontop light, but dey suffer wit on and off light and poor service wey dem DisCos dey give.
Poor service wey DisCos pipo dey give don get bad way ontop to grow di economy of di kontri as di International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report for 2020 ontop Nigeria show say di manufacturing sector lost moni wey pass $200bn to light wey nor good and big $21bn n aim dem say Nigeria pipo don spend on top to generator inside dat time wey dem review.
Di House, now don beg di federal goment make dem direct NERC to cancel dia plan to still put moni join wey dem put for June 2021 bikos of dis hard time wey Nigeria pipo dey.
Di house don make di committees for power, poverty alleviation and labour, employment and productivity see say dem do am.
Border wey dem open back spoil to dey keepkeep tins for Katsina markets.
As di Federal Goment open four land borders last week don slow down keepkeep wey dem dey do for katsina, Daily Trust fit tok.
Before dom shout am, pipo wey dey sell grains go disquise say dem be agent from company kom buy bigbig farm produce keep to store and get profit later.
As one dealer take tok, despite say dem match leg ontop to dey carry rice and other food enter Nigeria , market pipo still get double mind to keep market ontop say goment fit change dia mind anytime depend on wetin dey ground.
Alhaji Aminu Hussain, wey dey sorghum, say to dey keepkeep market no be new tin for di market, but e kom go up wit di new agricultural policy of dis administration and border wey dem close.
Many of us chop beta gain ontop farm produce for last year, na why pipo kom out quick dis harvest time to dey buy keep but border wey dem open don slow am down.
The fear wey we get na say price for food go still kom down.
E add join say farm produces wey no kom out plenti bikos of bad way of dem bandit dis year, don give market pipo mind to keepkeep dia market.
Rice, maize and sorghum n aim dem put eye.
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, wey dey sell grain for Bakori market, say as dem shout to open border again last week don get hand ontop price for major food for di market.
E no be like last year we, by dis time, maize dey around N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum dey N7,000, nah N14,000 and N13,000 dem dey sell dem now.
Dis shout of open border again wey dem shout down spoil di price of paddy rice from N14,000 go N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 go N13,000 and maize from N15,500 go N14,000.
Tarzana add join say many market pipo comot hand to dey buy market bigbig afta dem shout am, get am for mind say di breeze from importation of food go enta anytime.
Our news pipo see say di land border wey dem open again get many eyes.
Plenti of di farmer and market pipo want make di border dey lock so dat dem go dey chop beta for di market wey we dey do for awa house.
Pipo wey dey chop am and some other pipo hapi wit di development and dey expect say goment go allow make dem dey import rice and other food.
But goment kon fall dia hand as im tok say rice, chicken and turkey, oil for cook and other food still dey under ban to dey import.
Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, wey be one agric expert, beg di goment make dem sumit give di pressure, allow food to dey enter.
Goment don invest plenti agric sector and make we nor allow dat big investment enta water wit breeze of importation inside dis kontri
Na true say fear for food crisis don burst evriwia, but we fit reduce am wit farming wit water.
To dey import food go make dis economic recession wey dey di kontri worst to tackle, na im Muazu tok
E add join say yawa go gas for farmers dem if goment cancel dia policy ontop to make food plenti.
Why rice wey flood nor dey important to farmers dem.
Di threat ontop food for Nigeria bikos of flood go soon be tin of di past as dem release FARO 66, one type of rice wey flood no fit kari.
FARO 66, wey National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI) release give farming pipo dem be type wey get some tins wey dey different from wetin farmers for here sabi before.
Dis type tall pass other one wey farmers sabi.
Witi how im tall and some betabeta farming mata, e get power to survive palava of flood wella.
To kolet new tins among farmers dem dey always be big problem and as dem introduce FARO66 no dey different.
But if dem farmer kolet am finish, di threat ontop food about rice mata go reduce.
For dis year field trip wey NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi State organise, farmers and dem oga dey introduced to dis new type afta a field trip wey dem do for di institute demonstration farm for di city.
For di demonstration farm, farmers dey expose to FARO66, wey stand gidigba wit flood inside farm and other rice follow di same flood waka.
Di two farm wey dey near each oda show di power to tanda wit flood wey FARO66 type get, wit all di wahala, e grow and strong.
One di farm of other type of rice, na di remaining of rice wey die remain dem see.
As im follow awa news pipo talk, di oga for di NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, say di FARO 66 go tanda wit flood if dem quick plant am.
E add join say, im stem wey hard and as e tall, if dem part am quick, di type go don grow reach size wey be say if flood com, di plant nor go gree for am.
He tok say FARO66 dey release two years ago but to kolet, as for di case wit any new tin, must be small small, tok say, if farmers dem don accept am wella, flood nor go be threat to rice farming again.
As im take tok, to open di eyes of farmers dem as research ontop dis new type dey go front, dem carry dem join bodi to see how e dey go and to record result.
E add join say science pipo wey dey ontop di research get sense say if dem allow farmers dem to see how dis plant fit take tanda wit flood, no be only to accept am go dey fast, to dey use sef go dey.
Shema wey tok say as dem nor give dem plenti moni be dia major wahala for di research work, e call stakeholders dem to kom invest ontop dia idea for beta tomorrow as di research no go only develop di new type but e go still create job, and still develop economy for di kontri.
E explain say dem still do public lecture wey dey among program wey dem do for di first day of di field day wey dem do, e say why dem introduce public lecture join dis year program na to show stakeholders dem say nah if moni wey reach dey n aim research fit get head.
E beg pipo wey get mouth for Nigeria and organization to kom drop put for research.
Di two days nah ontop to show how technology take enter farming
Wen we tok say he dey tanda wit flood, we no tok say flood no go affect am patapata.
Wetin we dey tok be say wit all di tin wey e get for bodi, e go tanda wit flood wahala reach one side.
FARO 66 go tanda wit flood wahala bikos e tall pass FARO 44 and FARO 52.
Im stem still hard pass other one.
To manage sky as in to plant quickquick na im be di key to tanda wit flood.
To plant quickquick dey save bigbig if flood come.
If rain don starts, farmers dem no need to dey waste time.
Dis one go make crop dey strong and hold leg for ground wella before flood go com, as im tok.
Dem suppose start to dey plant sharpsharp.

Governance wey dey poor and illegal weapon for wey dey spread by Adefolarin A. Olamilekan
Governance for Nigeria in dis new time especially since di time wey Civil rule don return in 1999 don dey make pipo dey put eye for am.
Di eye wey dem put na bad tori of di goment wey no gree tackle security mata for di country.
E get one sence wey wetin dey hapun make to take sabi governance wella, especially wit plenti plenti illegal weapon dem evriwia for Nigeria .
Di nation no dey good at all, but dey concern for di safety of im pipo.
Pipo dey cry for help for beta security of life and dere properties
As im be today, di way wey weapon dem wey dey illegal dey plenti evri wia na serious wahala for economic sustenance, unity and to dey togeda.
Na inside all dis kasala wey we take sabi wetin di link wey dey between governance and di illegal weapon wey dey evriwia be, wey be main mata for dis time of awa national life.
As Nigeria dey go up and down for di last two decades don make plenti Nigerians sabi wetin be di poverty governance.
As e take be like dat, e go beta for us make we sabi wetin governance be for simple sense and wetin in be for inside dis context.
Di Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition tok say governance na di way wey dem dey control one kontri or di way wey one kontri or institution deu dey control.
So, governance na di process of control and controlling activity wey dey a kontri join weapon wit im circulation.
Again, governance still fit dey look as di process wey dem goment pipo dey hold power, authority and di way wey dem dey give policy wey pertain to pesin life and economic decision for di beta beta of di pipo.
As e be, to dey run di goment go take make dem use decision wey dey good and wey go get good impact on top di management and di sharing of resources wey include moni, pesin and material.
E go involve di regulation, implementation and enforcement for d policy wey pesin want, wey go be for objective wey get target, goals and aspiration through capacity.
As e be, governance na to dey control di development wey pesin want, wey be say, to protect life and property of kontri pipo tru d regulate of arms and weapon dem be koko.
As e be so, e get plenty reason wey explain di poverty wey never stop since for governance for Nigeria .
For example, poor institutional capacity na im cause goment failure, wey no make everything balance in di wey dem dey do justice and fairness, wey cause oppression and jagajaga for mind.
To add join dis one, na as dem dey do ojoro dey help dere family dem, as dem dey selfish, ethnic partial wey don cut to dey togeda ontop decision making troway, and as di political representative no dey too do dia work.
Di mata wey di Chairman for di National peace Committee (NPC) and d former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar tok for Transcorp Hilton for Abuja say e pass 6 million illegal weapon wey dem fit trace to di kontri pipo, many of dem no get work and dem dey hungry and angry.
Di nomba of di small small weapon wey dey Nigeria for di hand of kontri pipo wey no dey military reach 6,145,000 and armed forces and law enforcement pipo count dia own to be 586,000 weapon.
E still tok go front about di sekuriti problem wey dey di kontri.
E tell all di nation say na 80,000 Nigeria pipo don die for recent month and like three million pipo be Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) evriwia for di kontri bikos say sekuriti problem dey plenti and illegal weapon dem waka evriwia for di country.
E kon tok say di sekuriti forces no just dey over work but dem no get moni, and e tok say dem fit do beta if dem give dem beta weapon, equipment and make dem give dem moni wey go dey accountable.
As di forma head of state and di chairman for National Peace Committee (NPC) take shuk mouth for di mata, e don show say we suppose take governance serious ontop plenty die-die tins for di kontri.
Wela, e don show say pipo wey even dey power and authority dey live for inside fear.
For dis side dem suppose hear cry for help of d pipo make dem try reduce as illegal weapon dem waka evriwia.
For onetime dem tok say na for Africa weapon dey increase pass.
Small arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration for Nigeria, tok say na as weapon too dey increase na im make bring gunpipo, n aim still kos di scatascata of many Nigeria pipo.
Di report tok say na as weapon dey plenti for Southern Nigeria n aim make kasala plenti for area like village wahala, cult, kidnapping, tribe and religion gbege, and militancy for di Niger Delta.
And na d same way di report tok say for Northern Nigeria side, as per say corruption don plenti for dat side, dem get plenti land wey no get pesin wey dey rule am, and dem no too get work and na dis tins don make criminal and wahala mani for dia side.
Di report tok say wetin we tok before hapun bikos say Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) dey increase.
Di mata dey question di feasibility of di National Task Force on top Small Arms and Light Weapons.
So, we must to find di way to dey go front, even say e no dey clear and we no fit settle am.
We suppose face di mata and tackle as di illegal weapon dey dey evriwia for di kontri wit all di goment structure wey dey tackle di mata for di federal, state and local goment level.
And as e be, di National Task Force for Small Arms and Light weapons and di office of di National Sekuriti Adviser for di President (ONSA) must tight moremore to tackle di illegal arm wey don plenty wit to disturb and to stop am.
As e kon be like dis, we need program wey go teach how dem dey carry pipo for mind for governance and di sekuriti policy dey needed no be only community policing but policing for individual and group to dey share intelligence.
Di main tin na transparency, accountability and responsibility for beta governance, if dem dey, we no go fit comot all di illegal weapon wet dey evriwia.
