Di director of MURIC, Professor Ishaq Akintola na im tok am on Sunday.
He tok dis one afa di warnin wey PFN give say make any group no use di review of constitution wey senate dey do carry shariah law enter south-west.
PFN and oda Christian joinbodi know say shariah be dey for south-west before christianity enter for 1842.
Dem be dey practice shariah for Ede, during by di time of oba Abeeb Olagunju (Abbeb na muslim name) and say
Di shariah court for Ede still dey work enter 1913, for Agbeni inside di town.

Di joinbodi wey dey review constitution don tok say make Nigeria pipo write wetin dem want for inside constitution kom.
Each group suppose bring di things wey dem need kom.
Instead make PFN tell di joinbodi wetin di christians dem want, na wetin dem think say make di christians no ask dem dey tok.
Dem wanuse am block muslim pipo wey dey for south, but e no go work.
E tok say as dem dey tok say religious tolerance dey for south, say na lie, and dem dey tok am to put Yoruba pipo wey be muslim for inside slavery.
Muslim pipo wey dey for di region don dey open eye, kom dye ask for freedom.
we deamnd say make dem stop as dem dey force us to dey wear christian school uniform, to dey go christian school, to dey use christian law.
we want shariah wey no dey cut pipo hand, but di shariah wey go dey regulate muslim marriage dem, inherritance and family affair dem.

To end Nigeria herder-farmer kasala: Di Livestock reform Plan
Nigeria federal and state goment dey struggle to implement one National Livestock Transformation Plan wey dey wan use control cattle movement throughout di kontri wey go kom turn to herder and farmer fight
Many state goment don endorse am, but e dey face some kind challenge.
Political leadership wey o dey work well, perception about hin purpose wey no korrect, budget constraints wey increase bikos of COVID-19 pandemic, experts wey no dey to do di work and insecurity wey dey evriwer, dey block di progress
If di plan go fail as like di oda plans to modernise livestock management, di farmer and herder fight go increase
National Economic Council approve am for January 2019, di plan na to represent di effort wey pipo go understand pass to examine di livestock system wey no dey work well
Di main part of di strategy na to fit kontrol wia grazin dey apun, so dem go fit reduce di fight wey go wan happen between herders and farmers
Di movement get hope say afta 10 years,herders wey dey waka up and down mainly go get mind to dey put dey put dia cattle inside ranch and reserve for public grazin, wia breedin farms and oda mechanised livestock management go support wetin di sector go produce
By di time wey 2028 go end, di authority get am for mind to don build like 119 ranch for all di state wey dey involve, make dem use am create like two million job for di livestock production, processin and market chain
president Muhammadu Buhari administration na hin make di plan afta one period wia herders and farmers dey fight, particilarly wen di fight to much and he dey affect pipo for ghetto for 2018
Di Federal Goment wey get mind to drop moni wey go carry like 80 percent of di Transformation proposal wey di states wey dey involve submit, don dey take di first step to practice wetin dem plan, wey go include technical support wey go help dem state prepare to start work, tins like field survey and site mappin.
Plenti state don dey reactivate grazin reserve wey dem demarcate, dey open office, dey kom set up steerin committee wey go dey manage di plan join.
Di authority dem don dey do workshop and oda work wey dem go use teach pipo di benefit wey livestock reform get
As two years don comot for di 10-year plan wey dem do, dey neva build any ranch and dia obstacles plenti
opposition wey dey kom from di herders, though na from di Fulani pipo e plenti pass, e kom still dey among di farmers wey no want make pastolist dem enjoy di benefit of di plan sef, dey spoil di reform effort
Distrust don plenti for Middle belt, place wey be say fight between farmers and herders too plenti bikos of land, even though peacemakin and effort wey di military dey take since 2018 don reduce di blood shed
Shortage don dey federal and state goment budget, small part na bikos of di economy wey spoil bikos of di pandemic, and bikos di kontri no get technical experts wey know how dem take dey manage ranch and grazin reserve
For many states, especially for North-West, di way wey criminal gang and group dem wey get arm dey grow dey spoil access to grazin reserves and e dey make pipo wey wan invest before no do am again
unless dey do somethin about am, dis kasala and oda ones fit delay or make e spoil di plan, wey go make di kontri dey helpless wen di fight between farmers and herders dey serious pass before own, wey fit kom turn fight between ethnic group, region and religion
To tackle dis kasala,e go dey important make Federal and State authority join hand make effort, wit donors and investors help.
First, make Abuja and oda states wey dey support am provide political leadership wey strong pass before, make dey kom increase dia communication wit public, so dem go fit spoil pipo doubt and wrong understanding of di plan
Dis one dey common pass for pastoralists dia side, wey go ask dem make dem change dia nomadic lifestlye wey dey wit dia pipo for centuries, wey still get serious doubt say di plan promise about pasture na lie.
But many farmers dey fear say dem go lose dia land give pipo wey dey produce livestock.
Many pipo for di middle Belt and oda states for di South still dey suspect di plan long-term goals, wey dem dey see as opportunity for herders and di Fulani people particularly
Wit di support from Abuja and oda partners, state goments go need find pipo wey go be expert, wey go know technical aspect of thins, especially pipo wey go dey manage di ranch and grazin reserve, dairy production and meat processin
Make Federal and State goment sef increase dia budget for di plan, release di fund quick and make dey kom create financial transparency to make sure say evrithin dey accounted for, to dey work wit donors and investors wey necessary
E dey important sef to dey deal wit insecurities wey dey rural area, to dey curb impunity and to dey kom rehabilitate communities wey di fight affect seriously for di states wey dey participate.
Authorities go need consider weather change mata join, make dem decide if herders from oda kontris sometimes go benefit from di plan sef
As some of dis step go take time,make di pipo wey dey plan am focus on how dem go fit bring result wey strong, wey pipo go fit see for small time
less dan two years from now, di kontri go hold general election
if di plan go survive di change of goment wey go follow, Politians go need bring proof wey clear say e get benefit (Change dey certain, as president Buhari and many state governor dem no go fit compete again as dey don serve two term)
By di time wey champaign for election don dey hot for 2022 endin , di pipo wey dey back di plan suppose fit show some of di ranch wey dem build or di reserve wey dem repair,strong donor wey dem get and dia investors commitment and di first group of pipo wey dey don train to be professional for Livestock mamagement

Dis development dey shift di competitive advantage away from petty farmers.

di water don flood di whole farm
farmers plenti battle for 2020
for plenti farmers and oda stakeholders for di agro-sector, di year 2020 go remain as one of di years wey worse pass for di history of Naija unto say e introduced new dynamics wey millions of smallholder farmers go contend with

dem raze down plenti farming communities
dem kidnap people and dey demand ransom

plenti villages for those states don bekom desolate
di agric sector don witness one of di worst disasters wen one of di worst disaster wen flood wipe out 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields wey dem estimate at ova N3.5 billion for kebbi, Sokoto and kano states.
plenti of di farmers wey e affect are yet to be compensated as dia livelihood don destroy

di scarcity result for serious feed crisis for di industry as prices don reach high record for hin history as e dey rise from N2,600 for February to about N5,500
di poultry industry don lose an estimate of say N7 million jobs with figures wey project reach 10 million by january 2021 whereas dem estimate di loss for investments conservatively say e dey about N1.5 trillion
while di poultry farmers still dey struggle with di challenges wey mar di sector, di crop farmers despite di daunting challenges wey confront di sector for di 2020 farming year, get buyers komin right up to dia farms even before harvest to make bulk purchase arrangements
dis na di first time wey di price of grain no gree come down for harvest time, as e dey spark fear for hunger wey dey loom and di call make dem reopen di border, wey go allow influx for products wey dem smuggle through di kontri's porous borders

But di firm wey dey for inside US don fight back, dem warn say dem fit komot dem service inside di kontri.

Although Australia no be one of di big places wey Google dey take market dem things, dis news code wey dem dey propose fit be global test of how goment go begin regulate big tech firms dem.

Na for awa parliament we dey do dat one, as im take tell news people on Friday.
Why Australia dey push for dis kind law?
Google na di dominant search engine for inside Australia, and di government don describe as essential utility wey no really get any market competition.
Di goment argument be say bkos di tech giant det get customer among pipo wey wan read news, make dem dey pay amount wey dey good to newsroom for dem journalism.
In addition, dem argue say di financial support dey necessary or dem embattled news industry bkos strong media dey vital to democracy.
Accordi to wetin Government tok, print media for inside Australia don suffer 75% reduction for money since 2005.
Na di thret wey Google tok say dem go remove dem entire seach engine na im tough pass.
Di lawmakers tok say news dey only account for 12.5% of di search wey pipo dey take Google do for inside Australia.
Poultry farmers don dey beg say make dem begin import animal grade maize and soya meal dem.
Dr. Olalekan Odunsi wey be General Secretary for South West Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) don call goment make dem facilitate as dem go dey take import animal grade maize and soya meal.
Odunsi tok say na di importation fit save di poultry business from collapse.
He tok say di importation of feed grade maize go sustain di ova 500 million layers, 100 million broilers, 1 million breeders and oda class of poultry until next harvest.
He also urge government say, for di main time, make dem no allow dem to export soya, seed and soya bean meal wey dem don process.
He beg governors for di region make dem pu effort for di production of maize as dem do for di production of rice.
Odunsi put mouth say maize farmers, soya bean farmers and di ones wey remain for Naija need to collabo to take work.
He tok say if government no intervene, say scarcity and hish price of maize and soya go threaten anoda five million poultry jobs if government no do anytin about am.
Today, na 210,000/MT dem dey sell maize for inside most state for South West, soye bena na 240,000/MT.
As di two item take important reach, di price for poultry feed just dey increaese from from N2750 to N3000 for April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now.
For December, most farmer no fit sell dem broilers bkos of di cost of production don pass wetin ordinary Naija pesin fit buy.
Presently, egg don dey pass wetin average pesin fit buy, di price na around 1,300
so we really need make goment intervene to save di remaining ten million jobs for inside di poultry value chain for di economy.

How North-Central govs dem fit optimize open grazing ban from South APC leader
As open grazing controversy don trend enter public domain, wey Southern governor dem don hit am with ban durin dem meeting inside Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association in Nigeria (FEAN), plus Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum in FCT, Honourable Obaje David, don examine how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di governor dem for Southern state be meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to take cut farmers-herders crisis plus includin oda form of criminality dem.
Wetin be your take on top di controversy wey dis decision generate?
evri human being get right for action and opinion.
But di most important thing be say once you take your own action, make you know consequence go dey.
You suppose fit consider di advantage and disadvantage.
I no be one of dose wey go tok say e good or e bad.
As a Nigerian, na your right and liberty to live for anywia for inside di kontri with good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
For dis basis, I no go tell you say na good thing.
But as a leader for North Central, I go tok say na good thing, especially for North central zone, as per di potential economic benefit for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage to us.
We need to tap into it and see how we fit make am real venture and make money from am.
Luckily for us, we get a landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herder dem, no matter di nomba wey troop from di South enter di North Central.
Wetin beyour position about open grazing?
I no be one of di pipo wey dey support open grazing.
I believe more in ranching, bikos na im I de do.
I believe say if we begin do ranching, e go work out for us.
Make di governors for North Central allow di national programme on top ranching.
Dis kind move fit make Nortj Central di place wey cow plenty pass, wia pipo fit dey buy cow and some allied products
E go kom bikom means of economic empowerment, for north central pipo.
We get di land wey southern states dem fit no get.
See for Kogi, Niger, Kwara, plus oda state dem.
We fut give di herder pipo house, and ranch make e for be awa own advantage.
Di challenges wey dey follow di Fulani herders no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching.
Di problem be say dem no really educate dem on top di advantage.
Dem culture dey nomadic.
As aresult, dem need beta education make dem for accept ranching.
We fit also adopt di method for Kenya, wey almost all family get cow, but you no fit still see open grazing, as cow take plenty there reach.
Na wetin di southern governor dem dey tok be dat.
Di governor dem no show wia dem belong in dis regard.
Dem no call for ranching or to say make federal government for put mouth.
Wetin dem dey tok be say di herder pipo don bikom problem for us, and make dem komot.
Dem tok say make herders kom apply for land, say herding na personal business.
But shey dem don ask dem pipo to apply for land like di herders?
As one of di pesin wey join for youth empowerment, especially for agriculture and value chain waka, why some government policy no really work, wetin be di way out?
Firstly, no other administration don touch able to touch di lives of individual like one of President Muhammadu Buhari, wey you fit sit for your house without wahala and apply for facility and you go get am.
Also some credit facility wey dem dey call COVID-19 loan sef dey.
Many Naija pipo don dey collect di loan for plenty hundred of thousands of naira from inside of dem house without sat dem dey go offices.
Also, with say dem don dey expand some SMEs like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and di remaining.
Di challenge be say, we get two sides, dos wey go believe you and dos wey no go believe.
So, for dos wey no get believe for di administration of Buhari, notin get benefit.
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit, and we thank god for am.

As dem don pass dis bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly say, say dem don carry dem legislative function for head, as e take be for inside di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as dem take amend am.
And dis also attests to di fact say di National Assembly don wake to di performance of dem complementary role with oda arms of Goment for di fight against corruption.
Na wit hapi mind and wit deep sense of gratitude dat I write dis, which has been put togeda as a platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed the whole world know what di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria is all about and di unique concept we are bringing on board in order to complement national efforts in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di senate dem don pass di Bill, and for view say na bi-cameral Legislature we dey operate, di House of Representatives we dey always ready and resilient, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, wey be di Hon.
Di speaker sef follow wetin dem do and he pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As una fit don hear before, di Bill wey dem wan take establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) dey among di bill wey dem don tok NO to for inside National Assembly.
Di sad thing be say na pipo wey suppose dey put mouth for di fight against corrupt waka for inside Naija dey attack di bill, dem don turn to enemy for common ood.
Gud thing na gud thing, e no get substitute, na so bad thing sef be.
No mata as e take long reach, good go always prevails ova bad just as di light superior ova darknes take dey constant and unquestionable
e dey important say say make we see small of how e take happen for di National Assembly.
E dey interestin say, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate first pass am into law on di 2nd day of March, 2021 as e done pass di legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for di 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 senate dem pass di Bill into law wit one voice when dem don consider di urgent need for di noble legislation, of kos no be sauy e apun without plenty thunder bolts from detractors wey no go stop at any lenght to see say any legislation wey go help di administration wey Buhari lead to fight corruption no see see light of day but senate stand welwel and dem see am through.
E dey very important for make public know say (CIFIPN) no be just any noble bodi but a new one for Naija wey dem target say make e bridge di gap wey don dey for long for di forensics space.
Today, di waka to get one standard bodi wey go dey regulate di practice of forensics for Naija for im peak and make Naija pipo rise make dem challenge di few anti-goment bodi wey fit intend to sabotage dis step.
Dis bill wey National Assembly don pass, show say clearly dem demonstrate say dem dey patriotic and di need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, wey don stand dey block development for evri aspect of awa national live.
Dis beta step for inside legislation , wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey historic and symbolic, e dey happen at a time wey Nigeria dey need legislation welwel.
dat one go give beta way for im anti-corruption drive as di spate of criminal and corrupt waka don rise across di globe.
As we all sabi, crime don enter anoda level as science and technology don improve for 21st century.
Therefore, as dem pass di bill dey gud and e apun for beta time, plus e don show clearly say we get flexible and responive legislature wey sabi di thing wey dey apun for di world, and dem dey redi to do legislation wey go meet wetin Nigeria pipo dey talk.
Make we also tok say di journey wey dey for inside as dem take pass di bill make e for turn to law, don start since di 8th National Assembly, wia Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Ph.D, CON wey be current Senate President sponsor awa bill, when he be senate Leader, bikos e dey important to di anti corruption waka of dis admiistration.
For beta understandin, when we be introduce awa bill for inside di two chamber durin di 8th Assembly, dem do public hearin wey carry evribodi along for inside di chamber.
Thereafter, and ontop say minority pipo wey be stakeholder oppose am, na Institute of Chatered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead dem, di National Assembly pass di bill, with view of how e take get significance and di part wey go play for di fight against corruption.
Afterward, dem forward di bill give oga Presido, make e for put hand, but e neva put hand before dem scatter di 8th Assembly for inside June 2019.
Na on dis stregth dem take bring di bill abck for di 9th National Assembly, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader for di Senate, in view of as e take dey important.
We dey pushed to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap cheap propaganda wey pipo wey dey distract us dey tok say di 8th Assembly don reject awa bill.
Also we suppose mention di fact say dem don mistake awa bill with abother bill dem wey dey similar wey dem just introduce for both di senate and House of Represntative Chambers.
Dis bill dem, as we don scrutize dem with close eye, we discover say dem just copy awa intention and di thing wey awa bill stand for.
We suppose draw hear tok am say dem no introduce any of di bills dem for inside 8th Assembly, na only awa bill.
As such, na we be di first to carry bill wey big reach like dis (Forensic)
As we don see say e dey very urgent to establish dat kind great Institute.
Dem take di decision wey dem take establish di Institute afta dem study how di Institute dey take operate for other jurisdiction and how dem don take help crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
Na part of instruction make dem for know say awa Institute don dey since 2009.
And over di years, And over di years, we don train professionala to sabi forensic science technology, targeted at inculcatin di requisite skil dem for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:

You go follow me reason say for inside di obodo world wey we dey today, di normal way wey we dey take investigate crime, on to say we want stop am don bikom old something.
As such, make we as a kontri for do something wey get meanin for dis matter, e dey paramount say make we follow global trend and new innovations, wey dem put for ground to take fight corruption.
Na dis kind way we take reason to establish dis Institute wey get betta objective dat is relevant to di anti-corruption agenda of dis administration.
Time no too dey for me to tok about evrithing wey dey inside di bill for here.
However, I wan make you allow me to mention few of wetin di Bill go do, for di purpose of dis tok, as e take be like dis:
say make we for establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria, to develop and train professional for inside dis specialised field, with systemic and professional examination and certification wey go give better skil inside use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and detection;
To provide platform wey dem go dey take train and retrain of pipo wey wan bikom professional on top how dem dey take use Forensic Science and Technology tools and techniques dey investigate fraud for both public and private sector of di economy, as dem dey take do evriwia;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes among pipo wey dey do di, in a bid to cut fraudul and corruption waka, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;
To take fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa normal system of investigation weu don old with di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di country from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for inside Naija;
To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey go cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
Dis one go enhance effective plus efficient disposition of cases as dem dey take do am globally; and
To take enhance anti-fraud mechanism for Naija, through di provision of a legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Naija, among odas.
From di foregoing, e don show say di role of dis Institute dey strategic and important.
E also dey important make we tok say forensic science dey very wide and na field wey involve many oda, and e require effective and efficient regulation make we for attain and sustain high level professionalism and ethical standard.
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, includes but no be only forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, you go agree say awa Institute don bring unique concept enter crime detection and investigation wey follow international best practices.
Di concept pass as myopic pipo dey take thingk about awa bill don cover dem sense of thingkin, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey don pass dem jurisdiction and scope of operation.
On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario dat is playin out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all beta Naija pipo.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out wit anger to oppose di passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem Institute don dey do.
However, as dem don take introduce awa bill again for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and accelerated legislative support wey di two Chambers don give awa bill, ICAn don realize say forensic science na uniques field of practice, and as we dey talk, dem don bring similar Bill kom meet di House of Representative, as dem don fail wofully for dem attempt to stop di passage of dis awa bill.
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make any oda Institute no dey regulate di practices of forensic science?
Your answer na di same thing with my own.
I for also like inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also dey part of dis di episode.
which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN. Just as dem ICAN counterpart, dey sef don introduce one bill for inside House of Representative wey di same structure with di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey be na ANAN initiate am, and na dem promote am.
I decide say make I tok all di fact dem make Nigeria pipo and even international community for understand di extent to which some pipo fit go say make dem for achieve dem aim.
However, dis development no disturb us at all, bikos we believe ontop credibility and ability of di National Assembly and also for di Presidency to do di correct thing, make dem no enter manipulate in any way, with dis unnecessarydistractions dem, make dem for no make mockery of do whole thing.
Na ICAN be di practical and antagonist for dis bill and we don dey see di reason now.
Dem engage several bystanders into make dem write bad petition, dem even target di leadership for inside Senate, and e sound like say na bleckmail.
As dem don fail for inside Senate, di antagonist shift attention go House of Representative with di same bystanders as dem just dey write many many publication.
and again, dem fail.
Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bill wey Senate don passgo only need concurrence by di House except wen dem get observation.
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di pipo wey dey against am fight am until truth win for 19 day of May, 2021 wey House of Representative pass di Bill establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin di Standard Knowledge and Skil dem wey pesin wey wan bikom rigistered member must get and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matter (HB. 791)
ICAN don register dem own Bill for inside di House of Respresentatives wey dem title (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Di new Bill wey ICAn bring get contain full provision to dey take practice forensic, plus say dem wan establish forensic university for inside Nigeria, and without am, nobodi go fit practice forensics for Nigeria, and pesin wey violate am go enter prison for some years.
Dis wan dey strange for ear for inside kontri wey plenty oepn eye pipo dey.
D tin wey make me api be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
No mata di level of coruption wey dey dere.
We don dey challenge as House of Representatives take pass bill.
We suppose note am say, as we dey challenge di bill no be for bad belle, but bikos say we dey certain say di purpose of di bill na to stop presidential assent under di disguise say similar legislation don dey before.
We no go gree make dem deceive us and Naija people with dem wayo.
You go remember how ICAn take open eye oppose di CIFIPN and for inside one pubication wey dem sponsor by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 make plenty effort to tell us say di law wey dey enable ICAN don give am power to do forensics and to pass di CIFIPN Bill go be like dem just dey duplicate law, but today ICAN don dey present dem law say make dem for include forensics inside di new law.
Di question is, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN wey ICAN don tell di public say e get forensics kom dey seek say make dem re-enact am.
As always, as we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose say make dem include forensics fot dem law, awa concern be say make one bodi no try perpetuate imsef.
ICAN and dem cohorts don realise dem inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN
So dem wan get one union for demsef.
Na checks and balances dey fear dem, dem no go want want make anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
How dem go wan dey judge dem own case by demsef?
Dis one sound strange welwel.
On dis note, we dey call on di National Assembly to beware of di wayo wey dis group get, dey no suppose dey talk from both sides of dem mouth,make dem kom dey expect to use am cajole National Assembly.
Once again, we wan appreciate di commit wey di 9th Assembly put to make sure say dem pass di Bill, Naija pipo don know say dis administration dey ready to fight corruption by evri means and dem go encourage legislation wey dem aim say fit help dem achieve dis goal
We get confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no got hesitate to put hand for di Bill as soon as e enter im table
We dey call Naija peipo make dem kom take part for Forensic Profession.
Di profession dey open to all professional pipo for different area dem.
Di Institute get trainig section wey go guide and equip una.
I wan thank all of una, and also talk am again say we dey commited to stand with ethical standards as e take follow di way dem do am worlwide, as we dey give awa professional services, plus trainin wey go give us new ways to take fight corruption and crime wey be money matter generally.
I wan appeal give stakeholders and better Naija pipo say make dem support dis noble course, and to beg all of us to make efforts, so dat we go fit finish corruption together, di plenty security wahala, all ova di kontri and oda crises wey follow am.

Tela Maize harvest get potential to give 8 tons for inside one hectare
For di Tuesday wey just pass, di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), for Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, be invite relevant stakeholders, plus journalist, to kom witness di third harvest of di Tela Maize Variety Confined Field Trials (CFT) under im Tela Maize Research Project wey di Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) dey fund.
Dem derive di name for di maize variety TELA for Latin TUTELA wey mean protection.
Dis kind maize na im get protection against pest and draught for im breed.
Professor Rabiu Adamu wey be Principal Investigator, plus oda scientist wey carry journalists round d harvest, tok say di idea of di project na to produce maize variety wey dey resistance or wey dey protected against two major insect pest: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm plus another protection against moderate draught.
Dis is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; di stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production. Na to dey produce crop wey dey yield welwel under hard condition wey dey do; di stresses dem be Fall Army Warm and stem borers, wey be major block to maize production.
If dem no control am, if fit cause loss wey reach 80 percent, plus drought if you no manage rain shortage welwel, you fit no get any yield.
Na di third time be dis wey don do dis trial,
Na for under dry season for march we do di first trial, and durin di rainy season, we do anoda one from june go enter November.

By di time wey 2022 go end, if all tins dem work wel, Naija farmers go expect say make all dis hybrids dem dey wit dem.
Dr. Muhyideen Ayekunle, wey be maize breeder under dis project tok say from di two trial wey dem do last, di transgenic variety wey dem record give 17 percent advantage ova di one wey no get BT despite say dem don infest am welwel.
We don infest di varieties wey we dey put for trial three times unlike di previous one make we for take look how di BT gene take dey effective reach for di maize product.
With di outcome, researcher dem don tok say di yield go increase reach 17 percent.
So afta, we go analyze di data, and go prepare document to take get approval for environmental release.
We go submit di dossier give National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and dem go review am.
Once dem give us approval say dis product, we fit show face for outside
and then we go fit get national performing trial.
Di Director General/CEO of di National Biotechnology Development Agency (NBDA), wey be Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, for di event, call di scientist dem to dey kontinu to search for abiotic and biotic solution to di challenge wey dey face farmers for inside di kontri.
We don test some technology wey dey capable of providing solution to problem wey farmer dem dey face, make we take advantage o am and move forward, as im tok.
Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, wey be di Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, tok di impact go plenty welwel.
Farmer dem yield go increase by 17 percent and you know say na productivity and harvest be di koko for farming.

LG polls: dem begin protest ova as dem take dey impose candidate for inside APC
Some member for di All Progressives Congress (APC) for inside Ogun state don do protest against how di parti take adopt some consensus candidate for some local goment area ahead of di July 24 local goment election for inside di state.
Top pipo for di parti don announce say di parti go adopt consensus candidate for some local goment area, and dem go conduct direct and or indirect primary votin make candidate take emmerge for some.
Di protesters dem wey enter di secretariat of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), for inside Ogun State, be accuse some leaders of APC for Abeokuta South LGA say dem impose a candidate for di post Chaiman put for dem.
Dem carry placards wey dem write many many things put wey include We Say No To Money Bags
for Abeokuta South and
Allow Member of di Parti to pick who dem want, and said dem preferred aspirant na Farouk Akintunde
One of di parti leader wey follow lead di protest waka, Balogun Ololade, tok say make Gov dapo Abiodun intervene for di matter to save democracy waka from jeopardy.
Between DSS and pipo wey wan separate for some region
As DSS don put hand for ear for group and pipo dem wey dey tok and do things wey fit provoke and distrupt di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonous co-existence of di majority common folk of di kontri, don begin dey sound like say na one pesin tok until dem force dem komot for wia dem dey deceive pipo.
Question wey don dey linger about who or which pesin and group di security agent dey follow tok na im dem promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outbust of di nation prominent geo-ethnic agitator dem.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E kom clear for all of us eye say dis na di group of pipo wey don kontinu to dey resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statement and act dem, to take set kontri pipo against demsef to take put fire of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS din charge for one of dem warning.
Interestingly, non for inside di major suspect dem for di exploitation of some fault line dem to take kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance demsef from di treacherous and subversive activity dem wey security agent detect.
Dem chorus di same conviction say di DSS sabi di pipo wey dey responsible, dem only differ for di direction wey dem dey point dem accusing finger.
AS Afenifere tok say dis pipo sabi di ones wey dey responsible for di acts, but dem no fit touch dem bikos of di connect wey dem get, PANDEV tok am again about plenty pipo wey dey run alienated and ACF dey do like say dem no know, dem dey ask who di pipo be?
Since di DSS know dem and dem satanic waka, make dem take action to take deal with dem.
Di NEF sound like pesin wey no dey convinced with if say pipo dey wey dey push di kontri enter deep crises and dem know dem, make dem treat dem accordin to di law.
You no need to be spook to know wetin di DSS sabi about dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS sabi dem yet dem insist to pass di buck outside dem clique.
Di truth be say dis pipo wey dey champion ethnic politics no sabi any better solution to di problem wey Nigeria dey face than make dem sectional enclave and chief dey lord am ova di remainin of di kontri as rulers, not leaders!
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous to pursue dem inordinate ambition dem dat dem dey agitate absurdly and frequently to take break Nigeria up.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising di territorial contours of dia enclaves with di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake.
To put am simple, to break up or out of Nigeria as one ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambition of pipo or group wey dey undermine di ambition of majority wa-zo-bia Nigeria commoner restlessly for enduring peaceful coexistence, e easy to tok pass to do.
All dis group be major block to di steady attainment of unity and to dey live together in peace wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag of independence.
For as long as dem kontinu to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, na for so long wey dem go regard Nigeria as an entitlement for dem ethnic stake for di population, to be claimed or seized, and if all fail, make dem deconstruct am and disown am as state wey don fail.
Whenever dem meet, di agenda no be for say make Nigeria for progress and develop, unless di leadership dey dem hand firmly, odawise na all about hecking and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dem existence and activities go dey oppose di quest of Nigeria for unity, peace and development.
Anoda indicment wey we no fit deny for dis regional separatist be say all of dem na sel-styled political pressure groups wey dey pretend like representative of various ethnic groups dem.
From di membership, E dey plain to see dat dey consist of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di ginger to kom togeda, desperate say make dem remain relevant for democratic system wey elected representative dey run through registered political parti dem wit legislative and executive institution wey dem establish wit constitution to take dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Na only nasty nuisance value wey di geo-ethnic groups dem get for awa democratic setin as dem kontinu with mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion wey dem intend to take make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey threaten and dem dey attempt so dat if dem get chance dem fit regain political relevance plus kontrol.
Na why dem frequesnt meetin don dey cause security alert!
Wit dis kind predator-politician dem wey dem dey waka ariund di perimeter of power wit dubious intent and dem dey undermine goment wey dem elect just bikos say dem no dey involved for di, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest dey wey dey link dem overt activity dem and di covert criminality of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combine to take make Nigeria no dey governable.
Na double danger fit describe di tryin situation of di Buhari administration as dem get to handle such nomba of formidable enemy wey dey unleash plenty assaults on national security for di time wey economy dey face new difficult things.
To dat extent, only two group of politician fit dey: dos wey dey participate with positive mind for di democratic dispensation wey dem be partner for movin di kontri forward against all odds and dos wey get negative mind wey dey bring discord and disorder to take distabilize di kontri.
By wetin dem dey tok and wetin dem dey do, we all sabi dem!
At di end of di day, di majority fo Naija pipo be ordinary citizen wey dem condition to take survive no dey follow or depend on top wia dem come from.
Dem struggle evri day to make livin dey follow dem submission to di will of one God even as dem faith dey different.
Nigeria na dem fatherland wey destiny don put dem, and dem remain loyal, dem dey follow and dem dey pray, bkos dem know say dem no get any othe kontri to call dem own, togeda dem dey show how citizenship go fit breed true patriotism.
Dem also know say Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) don dey use incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to take put citizen against one anoda say make dem fit put fire for di tribal and religious wahala for di political ambition of dem leaders.
Di prayer wey remain for poor man mouth na:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER!

For early 80s, we dey travel for nite.
But for di level wey insecurity dey now, something wey dey fundamental dey miss.
He tok say di 9th National Assembly don discuss security , pass 59 times.
We be discuss security issue pass 30 times for di 8th Assembly, and dis 9th Assembly sef don discuss am pass 50 times.
Make evribodi dey vigilant, even if change service chief plenty times, e still no go solve di security problem, as di senator tok,
Ranchers dem don support as CBN take put restriction for forex on top import of dairy
Di Commercial Ranchers Association of Nigeria (CODARAN) don show support for di restriction wey dem carry give foreign exchange for dairy products dem.
Remember say di Central Bank of Nigeria don issue one circular wey don pass one year now on top company dem wey dem don restrict from foreign exchange to take import milk and dairy product dem.
But durin one visit wey dem do to di governo of Di CBN recently, di Director-General of di World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, tok say di European Union (EU) don complian against Nigeria ova dat restriction.
For inside one statement wey Dianabasi Akpainyang, wey be di CORAN tok say Nigeria be get di potential to take harvest dairy products dem wey go provide job plus create investment for local production of milk.
Di CBN governor dey korekt.
True true Nigeria be get di potential to take meet, plus sustain di dairy requirement.
Akpainyang tok say di milk wey ground for collection and processing no near that figure for now, but he note say since e dey likely, e dey necessary make evribodi put leg for fire seek of say di development of local dairy sector dey urgent.
As e dey cite one report wey komot for inside CBN say Nigeria dey spend $1.5 billion evri year to take import dairy products dem, he tok say di figure go increase as demand for dairy products sef dem dey increase.
He be mention issue like poor productivity of local cow dem, cow nutrition, animal disease management system, as dem no get better organised system to tke kolekt milk, as dem no dey too get finance,insecurity, poor infrastructure, insufficient extension services, inadequate processing and storage facilities, low investment in research and development and and as dem no dey too dey use modern technology say na dem be di major problem wey sector dey face.
However, he tok say di Advancing Local Dairy Development in Nigeria (ALDDN) programme wey dey run presently for inside four states Adamawa, Kaduna, Kano and Plateau don dey tackle di problem.

Wetin dem no suppose wear for public: Negatin Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Shey na pure coincidence say, as trouble be dey smell for inside Kwara state recently, dem dey considr solution to am for lower House for inside di National Assembly for di capital territory wey be Abuja?
DI trouble wey dey for Ilorin na as dem take refuse of some Christian faith school dem to allow dem muslim student to dey wear hijab kom school.
Di solution for this predicament na di debate on top Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, as dem ridicule Hijab Bill for a section of media for Nigeria.
Both event be spark heated argument and often emotional debate wey, at di bottom of evritin, dey threaten to negate multicultural identity and reality of Nigeria.
Di whole idea fpr Kwara of di proprietor of school dem as dem ban Muslim student dem wey dey wear hijab nd dem sympathiser dem fit dey reduced to wetin dem no suppose wear for public.
Dis na anoda major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representative di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Wey female for Nigeria dey face bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public.
E dey clear say di former clearly breach di fundamental human right of di muslim students to take express dem faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get defence or taking dat kind position.
Di latter dey try to assert dis right no be for Muslim dem alone but also for Christians wiaver or whenever dem threaten dem wit discrimination bikos of di fauth wey dem show.
To run through di argument wey proprietor of Christian faith schools inside Kwara, easy for pesin to understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda school dem fpr oda pleces if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey die argument get many.
First, to tok say make Muslim student dem go anoda place unless dem agree to rule of di school on top uniform dey do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondaly, di position dey ask moral question: shey we fit justify to base rule for school on top di Christian majoritarian of di school?
Then, di third one, di argument o go elsewia appear say e don ignore di difficulty dem wey dey inside changing school for a pikin.
Di inconvenience plenty.
As dem dey change school for pikin dem, pipo wey dey education psychology go tell you say, e dey interfere negatively with not just emotional but academic development too.
Finally, di christian faith school by demselves risk wetin we dey call ghettorization by concentrating students with di same religious belief dem for particular schools.
Di social cost wey dis thing go get for society plebty.
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, when she dey follow press tok, say di goment dey convinced say dem policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear dem hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey build on top mutual respect and understanding.
For inside kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, wey sign di declaration of international Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e be to deny child for inside Nigeria access to school of dem choice on top di basis of dem religion?
Na great concern bikos Nigeria na signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insists say all human being dem dey free and equal, say dem colour, creed or religion no matter.
E contain 30 article dem on top right and freedom wey include, among oda dem, like di rif=ght to life, free speech and privacy.
E include economy, social and cultural rights, like di right to get health and education.
I see article 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to di issue wey dey for consideration and we quote dem for full below:
evribodi get di freedom to thingk or believe wetin dem want, including belief wey be religion own.
We get right to change awa belief or religion any time, and di right to practice awa religion for public pr private, alone or with oda pipo..
evribodi suppose get right to education.
Primary school suppose dey free.
We suppose fit kontinu awa studies as far as we get di wish.
For school we suppose dem suppose help us develop awa talents, and make dem dey teach us how to respect evrione human right.
Dem also suppose teach us how we go take get on with oda pipo whatever dem ethnicity, religion, or kontri dem kom from.
Our parent get right to choose di kind school wey we go go.
All dis kind law na dem be di instrument wey give Muslim woman dem like Ilhan Omar di equality to take sit for inside di House of Representative for inside US and she still dey wear Hijab without say dem molest or discriminate am.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omarna America politician wey dey serve for di U.S Representative for 5th congregation for Minnesota district since 2019.
Na di Deputy Chairman for House of Representative Committee on top Finance matter, wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency for Niger state be sponsor di bill.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi.
Di bill dey to address discriminatory conduct dem, plus to prohibit as dem dey discriminate on top religion matter when e concern as dem dey give pipo work and di terms and condition wey dey follow am.
E go stop qualifyin and proffesional joinbodi dem, education institution, pipo wey dey do employment and oda sector dem to dey discriminate against person, student or personnel based on dem religion or di manifestation.
When passed, di law will bury issues such as what we saw in Kwara for good. When dem pass am, di law go bury issue wey be like wetin we see for Kwara patapata.
E go also address di bigot behaviour of executive dem wey dey carry dem prejudice enter public office and dem go still allow am cover dem sense of judgement.
Dem Suppose welkom di law.
After all, na only to expand and expatiate di provision dem wey dey for inside di Nigeria constitution and for UDHR document as we take tok am above.
E follow line with similar law dem wey dem pass for di kontri to take tackle social wahal and cultural practice dem wey dey harmful di law wey dey Prohibit violence against pipo and disability law (VAPP).
As disability dey try to komot any discrimination wey dey face pipo wey get disability, VAPP dey face domestic plus oda gender violence dem for inside di kontri.
One by one, pipo wey dey represent us for inside di legislative chamber dem don dey use legal instrument dey tackle all social wahala wey dey face awa kontri.
Dem dey address all dis social roughness no be to say law be no dey before wey dey address dem, but dem wan carry evritin togeda make dem for no allow see finish.
As e be like say road still far for UDHR, and instrument to take enforce am neva dey, di RDPP law and oda law dem wey resemble am dey ground to carry punishment give offenders.
As e dey contradict di view of critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, no prove dey say dem wan dem wan put state of religion on top any state wey fit domesticate di law.
E no go against Section 10 of di Constitution for Nigeria wey support make Di Goment of do Federation or for State fit no adopt any religion as State Religion.
To push di argument, bikos di bill dey call for general public to dey respect di right of womn dem wey be muslim wey dey wear Hijab for public place, say na to only quench Islamaphobia.
For di final analysis, e dey go against awa multicultural pretenses to dey deny any Nigerian be it male or female dem religios freedom.
E dey against equality, and basic human right as e take dey inside constitution for Nigeria and di legal document for Universal Declaration of Human Rghts.
Bill wey go make dat kind decimation on religion bikom criminal, like di RDPP bill go get welkom nod.
Na from Abuja Bashir dey write.

Dr. Elendu Ukoh, wey di matter apun for im eyes, beg di state goment and igbo leaders to call di police authority to call dem pipo make dem for no cause wahala for inside di city.
Di kind of pipo wey we dey put for police dey make me wonder f we want anything wey good to from dis kontri komot.
How pesin go dey pursue pipo wey dey sell newspaperfor Aba, inside di mordrn world?
If you stop pipo say make dem no read hard copy of newspaper, shey you go still stop dem say make dem no read di same tori on top Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram, plus oda pipo?
Which kind old police style be dis?
Dem cause panic on Sunday as dem dey shoot and make noise.
Di whole neighborhood thingk say dem dey chase kidnappers.
Na later dem discover say kom arrest one vendor and pipo wey dey read, weu gather for im newspaper stand.
How police go dey follow pipo wey dey sell newspaper fight?

Dem dey empty for Tuesday.
He tok say, we hear as dem dey tok for Saturday and Sunday say di newpaper dem carry tori wey concern di sit-at-hom order wey dem take honour hero for Biafra matter, and my question be say, wetin wrong with am?
Di early political leaders dem for South East, dey remind dis reckless police officers say Biafra big pas IPOB, di better for dem.
Shey as dem proscribe IPOB mean say dem don proscribe Biafra too?
All of us na Biafra pipo.
On di 30th of May, do World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold zoom conversation, wehere dem dey tok about hero wey fall for Biafra.
Why police no go Youtube, Zoom and oda social media wey carry di matter for air?
All di thing wey dem do na to kom street and begin make trouble wey no necessary.
I wish say di leader for Igboland go warn dis reckless police officer dem make dem no allow wetin dey apun for inside Imo State to enter Aba, bikos e go worst for evribodi.
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, wey be Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), deny say police dey arrest pipo wey dey sell newspaper and pipo wey dey read am.
NAMA dey frown face as air traffic controller dey lament poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC)) for Nigeria on Sunday cry out concernin di dilapitated navigational equipment wey dey for most airport inside di kontri.
Di ATCs wey dey under di National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) tok say di situation na threat for air safety.
Dem also tok say di International Airport wey dey for inside Kaduna o get control tower wey fit help aircraft to navigate without wahala.
Yomi Agoro wey be President for NATCA or one chat with news pipo for di weekend, to say di thing wey dey for Kaduna airport na watchroom wey oda aviation personnel dey use, say no be control tower wey dey for only air traffic controllers.
E also tok say oda airport for di kontri no get di equipment wey dey necessary to take navigate without wahala.
He explain say some airport no even get equipment wey dey function.
Even Kaduna no get control tower.
Wetin deym dey use dere na watch room (for firefighters), and no be dat purpose dem build am for, and we don dey call goment to do something.
We enter Sokoto, if rain fall, controller go carry umbrella to sit for di control tower, and wetin apun, dem don seed some of di control tower wey dem attach to di terminal building give FAAN, while di one wey dey stand alone dey with NAMA, but we don follow di two organisations dem tok.
We all still follow terrestial radio frequency fight, communication here and there.
Calabar dey dere; no airport wey you fit go today wey you go fit tok say dey work up to 80 per cent.
NAMA don employ and train 40 new controllers recently, but NATCA said di nomba dey too low to meet di shortfall.
However, di Managing Director of di Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, tell Daily Trust say di claim dem no be true.
He tok say federal goment don put huge investment to take improve navigational aids and to take help safe flight operations.
He said, It is mere politics. Im tok say na ordinary politics.
Goment don spend plenty not too long to take improve aviation infrastructure.
I no just dey tok dis thing bikos say I be MD for NAMA.
If you wan hear di true tori, my suggestion always be say, ask pipo wey dey street, ask pipo for NAMA, dem go tell you, dem neva see good wey reach like dis under dis administration.
E dey painful say pipo go dey tok like dis.
We neva any Category Three (CAT3), dis goment don put two for ground, anoda two still dey come.
Goment don spend N1.7bn on top mobile control tower.
Also revitalisation of di safe tower sef dey ongoin.
We don dey reconstruct di TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Oda sector dem suppose dey jealous us.
E-commerce for Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce dey refer to di use of communication technology especially di internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
Di internet don bring fundamental shift enter economy dem wey no near each oda bikos of brier enter ross-border trade and investment, wey distance far, time zone and language and wey national goment regulation different.
E-commerce dey foster direct access to market wey no near and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities plus e dey komot distinction between domestic and foreign companies to di extent wey e no go possible to know wia di product from kom.
E-commerce no dey limited to buying of product alone, e include e-mail, plus oda communication platform dem, all di informate or service wey company fit offer customer on top net, from pre-purchase information to aftasale service and support.
Di major significance wey e commerce get dey for di fact say e dey encourage system of tradin wey be single world, wey access through electronic means to take get good and services dem dey facilitate from different parts of di world.
Most of di statue wey dey for ground for inside nigeria dey lag behind toward di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and di whole ICT.
For Nigeria, plenty legal research and study don dey conducted.
Plenty for inside di study dem carry opinion say di legal system for Nigeria ey lag behind for legislation wey involve ICT and say di statutory law dem wey don dey ground no dey adequate to take address some of di legal issue wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issue dem include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, plus plenty oda ones.
Therefore, need dey to bring out legal and regulatory measure wey dey proper, to take govern di regime wey just dey kom.
Dem don tok plenty times say for inside Nigeria, significant effort to take regulate e-commerce-related activity demstill dey di stage of Sraft Bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to know say, even wia dem pass dis bill into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issue for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Wit di speed wey di internet dey take work on top commercial transaction for Nigeria, especially for inside banking and communication sector of di economy, di best wey dem fit suggest be say di legal issues and problems dem wey dey confront e-commerce presently for di kontri should be addressed directly and espeditiously, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigeria customer dem.
To achieve dis, make dem pressure di National Assembly to take pass bill concerning electronic commerce as top priority so dat dem go enact dem into law as quick as possible.
For small time, make awa court take giant step to interprete di traditional law dem wey dey ground in a liberal way make dem take cut gap in order to make di laws dem get ammend to electronic transaction, particularly for di emerging trend of dis information age wey we dey.
Indeed, dem argue say legislation no be di only means wey electronic transaction and attendant documentation fit dey legal.
Di court fit also adapt to recognise electronic transaction for di absence of legislation or private contract.
As former Justice Bungham don tok am before: di common law dey di hand of judges di same kind facility [as law merchant dem] make e fit adapt to di need of di general public, principle no dey alter, but old rules to dey apply di change, and new rules go begin exist.
We dey hope say goment go adopt dis activism wey Nigerian judges de do for inside judiciary, Supreme Court judges sef dey involve, expexially for area wia awa existin legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to take address legal challenges for inside new technological advancements.
Dis one go set better precedence to make sure say e-commerce consumer dem get protection, to bring investor dem and bring economic development plus stability inside di kontri.
Di koko issue for contract inside e-commerce na documentation and signature.
Di provision for inside section 4 of di statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statute on real property and landed instrument dem, all of which require make dem write certain contract dem and execute dem duly.
Di question now be say shey electronic sign-off dey constitute valid sign-off contract by email or by binding?
Dem still neva settle many of dis issues dem even for inside UK although some decision dey favour toward to interprete electronic signature
So marks for inside email wey ey satisfy di tradional requirement of writing and due execusion.
E-commerce transaction na transaction wey no involve paper wey dem dey do through magnetic material like tapes or disk.
Dis one dem be contradiction to di transaction wey be say na paper dem dey take do am wey dey embodied for permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures wey dem dey use signature authenticate.
Dem no fit alter dat kind transaction without say dem alter di face of di document.
As e concern signature, di provision for inide section 93 (2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey relate to data message go conveniently satisfy any requirement for signature wey dem take hand sign as long as say e dey sufficient to take identify an electronic record to di person.
Di provision for inside article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law for e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on top dis issue.
Thus, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures.
To dey use password, identification, user names etc fit suffice.
Hence one fit safely tok say electronic signature for purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence provided say dem certify and incorporate am for electronic communication during any e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenge dem wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts.
Di element for better formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter inside legal relation.
Di question be say, for which point dem fit make offer wit regard to electronic business transaction or now to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, at which point we fit tok say dem make intention to enter legal relation?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction wey dey transmit order or invoice neva get any matter and e dey kom from whoever e appear to kom from.
Need dey for guarantee concerning level of privacy/confidenciality for information matter.
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrime for inside Nigeria, plus high level of illiterate.
No doubt say electronic transaction na aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay dis time.
Make di goment go pass to dey make law, make dem activate as dem go take dey use di electronic platform for dem commercial interaction and for delivery of goment service.

Dem fit komot Chelsea points afta di brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face deduction of point from FA for di team as dem fail to kontrol dem players, as Mirror report.
Inside seven years, dem don catch di team dey show hot temper to opponents seven times.
Di recent brawl for inside one match on Tuesday night Leicester mark di seven encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League teams.
Na katakata mark di match wey apun last week between Chelsea and Leicester among players of both teams.
Wit di same kind of offence for di past, di FA decide say dem go punish Chelsea.

US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
Dat na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo get for di thousands of American GIs wey station for inside several military bases for Britain durin di Secon World War.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising soldier dem wey from America comedey frequently get into pub fight and knife fight weu dey dangerous wey dey kos bad feeling for di yanks among di locals.
And dis don be di pattern wey America soldiers dem dey take behave evriwia for di hundred of America military base oversea from Okinawa for inside Japan, Stuttgart inside Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga inside Philippines.
Na why i dey upset, like plenty Nigeria pipo, say na for virtual meetin last week wit di di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, na dem report say president Buhari ask United States to consider as dem go take relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey for Stuttgart for inside southern German city of presently kom Africa.
We dey thingk am say wit dis kin call, president Buhari dey make way for Nigeria to host Africom.
For di first place, na breach of protocol for President Buhari to do dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
Dem suppose do di meetin wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who o kom carri di detail go meet president later.
Yes, America na superpower and all, but protocol na protocol and dem soppose follow am strictly for evri circumstance.
We understand say Nigeria dey face big internal security wahala wey be like say e pass di best effort wey goment and security establishment for inside di nation dey make to take tackle am.
Terrorist insurgency wey no dey tire for di North East banditry, kidnapping inside di North West, farmers/herders clash dem all over di kontri and as dem dey target and kill security and law enforcement personnel dem and oda Nigeria pipo plus di destruction of institutional building for di South East, na dem join take be di cokctail of insecurity wey don dey ravage di kontri.
But even at that, di call to take host Africom on top Nigeria siol when we consider m against various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria difficult to justify.
Africom na one amng nine of dat kind command wey di America military establish say make e dey serve America strategic interest around di world.
By dem rule and way of operation, dis commands, particularly di ones wey dey outside America like Africom, dem no set dem up primarily to concern demselves wit security and law enforcement issuefor dem area of coverage.
Dem only do so when such issue dey affect di interest of America directly for di area and for such situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dem modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agancy dem
If dem set Africom up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island on im ownas e go restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establishing a jurisdiction withing di teritorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agancy dem.
As e dey always apun wit America military base wey dey outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and e go source for act of sabotage and destabilisation against host kontri.
For dis particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to kontrol as di strategic influence of Nigeria dey grow for West Africa and Africa as we get successful peace enforecement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa beta record of peace keepin around di world.
Di one wey dey before Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to take counter di strategic interest of Nigeria for inside Africa.
Di Secretary of State for president Clinton, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, be visit a nomba of African countries secretly to sell di idea.
But bikos Nigeria na di target, he pointedly komot am from im itinerary.
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na im suppose be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem see am initiative to facilitate assistance of America to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocol dem mistake for military and dem target Nigeria strategically.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, which was averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di concept of di ACRI.
For di review, wey draw di expertise of america Military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di America congress carry kom for dem secret sessions, di Americans dem consider and realise di need to set up one AFrican command to add to di oda command wey don dey already and dey cover oda continent for inside di world.
Thus, to follow on di reccomendation of experts wey gather, wey dem kom form all angle of political and security establishments for inside America, na di Bush Junior administration set Africom up wit mandate wey wide pass to contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on top di strategic penetration wey Chinese pipo dey do for inside Africa.
Na as US Central Command (USCENTCOM) take be to Middle East and Asia, na so Africom go be to Africa, as e base for Florida, European Command (EUCOM), as e base for Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Di presence of French military don surround Nigeria already as dem dey for Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin.
Di America pipo also get drone base for inside Niger.
To add Africom to di mix for inside Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.
As we get am for mind say awa strategic interest plus profile for Africa no dey always follow wit di one for France and America, to host Africom for Nigeria go be di same thing like make we allow wolf enter chicken cage.
Notin dey inside di insecurity cahllenge wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed forces no fit cope wit.
Dis one na afta di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Seirra Leone against army of insurgents wey dey well-entrenched and organised for inside di kontri dem from a long logistical supply line thousands of mile; di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention few of di plenty gallant Nigeria soldier wey distinguish demsef for di operation dem.
E dey regretable say di Nigeria military, don fall from high standard wey dem take know dem, dem dey struggle now to cope wit di activity of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, di military for Nigeria still carry di capacity and capability to defeat dis threat to awa nationl security if dem get di correct leadership, doctrine plus motivation.
We need all di assistance and coopration wey di America pipo fit give us if dem wan give us.
But as dem don hold us for hand to take host Africom with awa circumstance in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, for awa soil.
Upon say dem dey face challenge, Plateau target 7m metric tons of Irish potato
For Nigeria, na Plateau state be nomba one wey dey plant Irish potato as dem dey produce am for nine of di 17 local goment area wey dey di state.
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB)initiative don Plateau as state wey get 90 per cent of di potato production for inside di kontri as kontri like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and oda ones dey get large supply of potato from Nigeria.
Di large potato production for inside Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, wey be leading source for informate for global potato industry, don make Nigeria di nomba four big kontri for inside sub-sahara Africa.
However, farmer dem tok say dam wey no good reach and bad road network, plus as di cost of fertilizer and oda farmin input kontinu to dey stand as major setback for di production of potatoes for inside di nation and to export.
Oda challenge wey dey contribute to low yield and loss for harvest to di potato value chain include disease like blight and bacterial wilt, plus poor seedlings.
According to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di ten poorest state for Nigeria as dem poverty rate pass 70%.
However, di state get comparative advange to take boost economic activities by improving di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain.
Di project Coordinator for di Potato value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say though di visibility of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment area inside Plateau, Na Bokkos and Mangu LGAs be di hub for potato.
Na dem dey produce potato pass any LGA fir di kontri.
However, Muopshin tok say adaptability research indicate say di remainin eight LGA for inside di state also fit plant potato, dat one go make all 17 LGA wey dey for Plateau fit produce tuber, especially for inside dry season.
However, di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for inside di state, tok say unless dem address di challenge wey dey face di value chain, increase production and export of potato go continue to pass di national.
Chairman of APF for inside Plateau state, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wey he do wit daily Trust, tok say di inadequate small dam, especially for remote area wia dem dey plant potato, and bad road plus high cost of farm input kontinu to dey affect potato output.
He tok say di cost of mechanised farmin wey fit increase production quick quick don dey expensive as di majority of farmers na small scale producer wey dey unable to afford mechanization.
Anoda farmer, wey be Martha Mamgup, wey dey plant potatoe for inside Ampang town for Mangu LGA. tok say water wey no reach durin dry season dey affect potato farmer and harvest dey low evri year.
Bekos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dem search for location of borehole to farm to take access irrigation water for dem farm.
Martha also explain say di high cost of fertilizer dey prevent plenty farmers from improvin quantity plus quality of yield, she add say wen fertilizer no reach, e dey affect di crop output.
Di cost dey also prevent many of us from expandin di business.
So, to get fertilizer no be dey easy for us.
She tok say di construction of more dam plus borehole for irrigation go lead to plenty production of potatoes.
If di watre no reach for di crop, e go dry and e go later die and day na why some farmer wey get di resources dey prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu for irrigation bikos, without am, season farmin go bekom difficult, as she tok.
Irish potato for one market inside Jos
Production to reach 7million metric ton afta dem complete lab
Wit potato production inside Plateau State wey don jump from 1,656,650 metric tons in 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons in 2020, di establishment of Potato Value Chain Support Project and dem expect make diconstruction of tisue culture lab kos make production triple pass seven million metric tons by di time wey 2021 go end.
Di officer wey Monitor and Evaluate state's Potato Value Chain Support Project for di state, Baleri Yakubu, tell Daily Trust say dem expect make di state start production of six million of potato evri year afta dem complete di tissue culture lab at di end of 2021 but e dey optimistic say production fit pass seven million metric tons evri year.
However, Yakubu tok say mak di state goment tackle oda challenges wey farmers dem dey face, especially di one of fertilizer as well as dam and road network as dem dey expect make farmers dem apply proper potato farming regulation to take achieve expected target.
Our correspondent hear say di tissue culture lab, wey dem intend to take improve potato yield for di state by providing seed wey clean wey dey resist pest and oda disease dem wey relate to potato na im dem expect say go commence full operation in few month dem.
Yakubu tok say e dey certain say di advent of di lab go improve income for farmers and revenue for di state goment and e go also help food security for inside di kontri.
Farmer for inside Plateau State, however, believe say di tissue la, if e dey fully equipped, go reduce di cost of treatment for di crop when disease affect dem.
Dem also hope say better quality seed go dey available for affordable price.

FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express dem absolute rejection of di insistent coercion wey UEFA don dey mentain towards di three institution wey relevant pass for di history of futbol, as di statement tok.
Dis attitude wey reach to raise alarm dey constitute breach of di decision wey courts of justice dem make, wey don make clear statement to warn UEFA to stop to take any action wey fit punish di clubs dem wey found di super League when dem still dey on top di legal matter.
Therefore, as UEFA take disciplinary proceedings dey incomprehensible and na direct attack against di rule of law wey us, wey be citizen for European Union, don build up with democracy, e still be lack of respect toward di authority of di courts of justice sef.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, dem arrest Ramoni Abass (37 years) wey dem know as hushpuppi for June 2020 for Dubai alledge say im do money laundering from business email compromise fraud and oda scams dem wey dey target firms and one English premier league club.
Di total money wey im make na $435 million afta in dom defraud 1,926,400 victims.
Afta a year, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also arrest Abidemi Rufai (wey dem dey call Sandy Tangâ), Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun for inside John F kennedy Airport, concerning criminal complain say e scam Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di money wey dem tif na relief money for pandemic wey Washington state design for pipo wey fit don loss dem job bikos of di COVID-19 pandemic.
Na during lockdown di fraud apun and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster wey for be dey make law for Nigeria Federal House of Representative if e no loss di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun wey be Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person.
Dem do di fraud by stealing identity of Washington residents wey pass 100 as dm dey fill false claim with di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
Dem create new e-mail account for each identity wey dem steal, make dem for identify di claim with different pesin to escape automatic fraud detection system.
After dat, dem don pay pass $288,000 so im bank account inside America between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisation and kontri dem.
Nigeria dey loss pass $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year.
By di time 2021 go end, di world go don loss total of $6 trillion.
Till date, e pass 40 Nigeria pipo wey dem dey or wey FBI still dey investigate for dem complicity inside fraudulent scams.
Di allege unemployemnt benefit fraud wey Rufai do go dey under wetin I don call COVID-19 fraud for Nigeria.
Dis na scam wey dey use loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic don cause to dey scam pipo, goment pr organization dem.
During di COVID-19 lockdown for inside Nigeria, cybercriminals dey do dem frauds along di interventions from goment and private sectors and scamm plenty and some of di scheme dem still dey till date.
Domino pizza fraud dey, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among oda ones.
Wen some dey wey dey cyber-criminality outside Nigeria, some youngster dem dey do am inside Nigeria.
Di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey arrest dem, also try and convict dem.
To understand di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment to fight di crime.
Di family na di di small worldfor inside di larger society.
Na di place wey dem suppose nuture normal human beign for di society.
Apart from di fact say plenty family for Nigeria dey inside dungeon of poverty and e dey hard to take care of dem children, some of di children don bikom breadwinners, as e be, e no legit.
Ethical behaviour training for plenty house na challenge as dem don dey arrest parent plus dem children wey dem gather do cyber-criminality.
For some oda places, yahoo boys mama dem dey form association to take celebrate dem pikin success nd justify di criminal thing wey dem do.
For di religious seting, pastors, alfa and traditinalist dey make home and dem dey benefit from yahoo-boyism.
Moral teachingdon komt for materialistic Pentecostalism to enter.
E get one viral video wia some boys dey spray money while pipo wey be like say dem be shepherd for inside white garment church dey enjoy di captive di moment, as dem member wey di female youth wing of di church dey lead dey record di act of shame.
Pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria enter democracy again na 21 years now.
Sadly, dem grow to dey appreciate lie as a way of life from politician dem mouth (and for plenty cases from home) wey dey decieve pipo to vote for dem nd dem no dey fulfil di promise wey dem amke for compaign.
Lying sef na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Youth dey socialise daily for inside corruption by pipo dey dey for public office.
Dem dey see how di system dey give farudulent pipo soft landing (for public or private).
Shey dem dey ask how many fraud and corruption allegation wey dem don investigate and discharge wit punishment when di accuse dey guilty?
Di plenty of cases end wit off-the-mic like as di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case take end like family affair.
Di youth dem dey see as celebrate flamboyant lifestyle inside dirty.
Dem dey see how poor politcal aspirant dey bikom millionaire withing months wey dem enter office.
Dem dey see how traditional institution don bikom cash and carry wen dem dey give chieftancy title.
Tertiary educational institutions, with few exception dem, dey award undeserving honours in exchange for money.
All of those weu mismanage monet dey get soft landing.
To add to dis list of culture wey dey nuture cybercrime na di lyrical glamour wey some Nigeria musician dem dey give cybercrime as dem dey present cybercrime as work and game wey evribodi dey do and say no be crime.
If we elect fraud pesin enter legislator, e go make law against di crime wey e dey involve?
Di process wey parti leaders dem dey take give parti nomination to di pesin wey get high bid need review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo things enter awa political system wey don already loss moral.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dem go low when dem show dem money.
Dem provide platform for dubious character to take do cover up and di society dey worse with dem action.
Greed dey also cause cyber-criminality.
Di FBI agent wey dey incestigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege dis defendant dem dey affect all taxpayer.
To move forward, we no fit dey live inside sin, dey expect grace to abound.
Make Nigeria sanitise dem anti-coruption system and make dem put accoutability policy in place to take track lifestyle with material accumulation.
We must give youth for inside Nigeria hope by creating employment opportunity, reduce poverty plus review reward system dem.
Di EFCC need to invest inside technology and expose dem detective to modern cybercrime investigation procedure dem.
Di commission need to finish investigation before dem go arrest suspect as FBI do before dem arrest huspuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless dem tackle di culture wey dey sustain cybercrimes for inside Nigeria wit social social engineering, cyber-criminality go kontinu to spread.

Di national question, insecurity and di declaration for inside Asaba.
By Segun Tomori
Recently, governor dem for inside souther Nigeria be meet inside Asaba and dem make some kind resolution on top di state of di nation, which dem don dey call Asaba declaration.
Di meetin dey kom on top di matter as insecurity for di kontri don dey worse, agitation by some kind ethnic jingoist and as di matter murderous herdsmen menace dey generate nationwide attention.
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature wey di meetin get plus di unanimity wey di 17 governor dem display show say dem mean serious business.
Restructuring inside di context of true federalism and di ban of open grazing form di koko of di declaration.
Major light follow be to bring state police, devolution of power, to review revenue formula to take favour federating unit plus di need for national dialogue to take discuss di nation question.
As dem suppose condemn di way gobernos dem dey take drag leg on top financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary and e no follow di spirit of true federalism which dem dey call for, planty for inside dem resolution na tenet for di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey di committee wey Gov. El=Rufai lead on top true federalism recommend.
One go expect say di leading light for inside APC go take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, and di support of di major opposition parti to take begin di process to address di issue.
Instead, we see attempt to take play to di gallery and for some quarter, subtle censure of di governor dem.
Di El-Rufai committee don recommend devolution of power, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy plus review inside revenue frmula for favour of federatin unit among dem.
President Buhari don give support for local government, state legislature and judiciary autonomy since, as im back amendment for inside di statutes and issue Executive Order 010.
As di state of di nation take be, wey security and economic don bikom big challenge, na dis two sector dem suppose get di untimate attention togeda.
Despite as dem rate Nigeria as kontri wey get highest GDP for inside Africa, we still neva make better effort wey reach to translate am to take improve standard of living or di majority of awa kontri pipo.
For instance now, awa annual budget wey reach $35 billion, e dey very inadequate to take cater for di need of 220 million Nigeria pipo.
South Africa wey get about 58 million pipo get National budget wey reach $75bn for 2019 and her Social Protection Programme reach 17m of im populatiom
Di effort wey di Buhari administration dey make, though na new way and e dey commendable, na just drop for inside ocean and e no dey adequate to make required impact.
Na here devolution of power and resource kontrol go enter.
Solid minerals and natural resource dem no get any business to stay pass one day inside Exclusive list.
Almost all di state wey dey di kontri get natural resources wey fit sell market wey dem fit explore to tak create wealth and generate di foreign exchange wey di kontri need.
Di present system wia state dey go Abuja to go kolekt federal allocation for inside di kontri dey breed indolence, e no follow di principle of true federalism.
Just as di El-Rufai committee take propose, say make dem review di revenue formula to take favour states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem.
On top state police, e dey undesratndable say dem dey fear say governors dem go abuse am, but like Richie Nortondon tok, To escape fear, you have to go through it, not around it.
For too long, we don dey waka round fear of abuse of state police, we don turn blind eye to di centralised Nigeria Police Force wey don dey overstretched and wey don bikom inefficient and big problem.
As vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey im time don kom.
We have to address awa fears and overcome it.
One for di way na to enact legal instrument to take establish di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), along wit constitutional amendments dem wey go permit state police.
E go dey similar function wit Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e go get wider power to take exercise appointive plus regulatory function dem.
Do ban on top open grazing wey di governors dem restate no be nwe thing, e dey part of di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey National Executive Council (NEC) approve.
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) don put di NLTP as di most comprehensive effort wey Nigeria don make to date to take overhaul di inefficient and grosly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to take curb migratory or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmersdem, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic, sef-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
Make di federal and stae goment move very fast to fully implement dis new plan so we go fit put dis farmers-herders clash wey dey apun fromtime to time behind us.
Di convocation of National Dialogue, wey be major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report from di 2014 National Conference plus recommendations of di Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on True Federalism dey.
Di two report be make far reaching recommendation wey di governor dem wey we elect and dem legislator for inside di national assembly fit agree on, instead of make dem waste resource wey no dey on top anoda jamboree.
On to di issue of separatist agitations dem, make dem bring modalities to take do referendum as e be inside di constitution.
E dey almost certain say plenty majority of Nigeria pipo wan live togeda, dem no mind awa differences.
To do dis go take di sail komo for di wind of divisive elemnet dem, wey dey fan fire of hate and discord.
di Southern Governor dem don affirm dem commitment to one United Nigeria on top basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Though we get challenge dem like evri oda kontri, we must listen to awasefs as US President Joe Bidden dey often tok.
Tomori dey live for Abuja

You fit put am on top table wia better ventilation dey.
E fit last for average of 10 days, but if dem provide evritin as e take require (evri nutrient) e fit last reach one month.
We don experiment am, but then, e no dey apun as you dey always want.

Interestingly, even as both contestants get only three African players in Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) di interest of Africa for di final don drop.
For Nigeria here, wia Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy plenty followers dem from passionate football fans dem, expection don dey cause fever, and e don lead to interestin realignment.
Fans of di oda clubus wey dem don komot for oda stages of di Champions League do re-align demselve with either Chelsea or Manchester City as dem interest take dey diverse reach.
Di consequence be say di final na one of di topic wey dem dey tok pass for inside sports at di moment and fans of di premiereship club don kontinu to dey predict as di finalresult fit be.
However, as be like say almost evribodi don dey wait to savour the football artistry wey dem fit display, some pundits dem dey as nomba of African players for di final of di biggest football competition for earth don dey reduce.
If we follow history for inside UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballer dem don contest and win di trophy with dem European clubs.
E sad say African football legends like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote as World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria, Mohamed Aboutrika of Egypt, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt no win Champions League as dem sabi ball reach.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage when Liverpool be win dem 6th UEFa Champions league title for 2019, di first African wey win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
He achieve di feat with Liverpool for 1984.
Na Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am with FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 with Olympique Marseille follow am, before Nigeria
duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am with Ajax Amsterdam for 1995.
E also dey record say na Geremi Njitap of Cameroon be di first African to win di title twice in 2000 and 2002 with Spanish giants Real Madrid, Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon kom win am three times with Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 with Inter Milan.
Oda African wey don win di highky coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali
) Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am with Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), with Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
To come close to home, di last time wey Nigeria pesin win di trophy na 2012 when Mikel Obi dey among AFricans wey lift di trophy with Chelsea at di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta dat achievement by di former captain of Super Eagles, Nigeria do see oda talented players dem rise, like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
But none of dem don feature for di final of biggest club competition for Europe.
Di reason no dey clear.
Na di di top five club for Europe Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool dominate di competition.
Unfortunately, Nigeria players dem don fail to enter highly rated clubs dem for Europe.
Na hope of Nigeria football stakeholder say very soon di new generation of players dem go break barrier and begin to play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis one fail, den di football fans wey dey for Nigeria go kontinu to dey live with di agony of watchin finakls of di UEFA Champion League dey kom and dey go, without di presence of any Nigeria player.
As Nigeria pipo dey wait for di next Super Eagle player wey go rise to di top of di European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do am with Ajax for 1995 and Mikel Obi for 2012, na few hours remain for di 2021 all English clubs final.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
