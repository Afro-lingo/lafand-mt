To my mind, if anyone or group of people need to be named and shamed in today’s Ghana, it is those who did not bother to go and get a seedling and plant last Friday.
If you see it fit to comment on anything and everything, on things that are going wrong, on unpaved roads, on Free SHS, on the rate of borrowing, on the absence of street lights and even on Supreme Court rulings and you did not plant a tree last Friday, you should be ashamed of yourself, even if you are not named and shamed publicly.
I would suggest though that it is not too late to redeem yourself if you happen to fall in this category.
Planting seedlings and having them grow into the beautiful and majestic trees that we need to cover our land is a long term undertaking.
Having planted the seedlings, they need to be tended and nurtured and it takes time and hard work.
Last Friday, it rained in Accra, (and I hear in many other parts of the country) which was enough to make a believer of me, considering how dry it had been.
The seedlings need to be watered regularly if the rains don’t come. Under normal circumstances, a better date couldn’t have been chosen than June 11 for the mass planting, but things aren’t what they used to be with our weather and our land and therefore the seedlings might need more care than they otherwise would have needed.
If you missed planting last Friday, you can still plant one or two and you can certainly help look after those that have been planted.
Cutting down a tree takes so little time, but growing a tree to full maturity to attain its regal and intimidating status takes years.
If we are to restore this land of ours to the ‘dense tropical forest’ described in the Geography books and in the songs of our festivals, then, as President Akufo-Addo said, Greening Ghana will have to become a regular and integral part of our activities.
That presupposes, of course, that we shall stop degrading the lands in the first place, give them some breathing space to rejuvenate and then when we plant, the trees can grow in peace.
I probably also have to declare an interest here. I am a child of the forest, I was born in a forest area, even though the place no longer qualifies as a forest area.
I adore trees, there is nothing that can replace the experience of an afternoon heavy rainfall in a thick forest and the sweet smell that arises from the soil after the rain.
Every child must have the opportunity to experience it and to look up and around trees that are older than their great grandparents.
Another personal declaration of interest is that one of my very favourite people in this world is the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, Samuel Abu Jinapor, the Honourable Member of Parliament for Damongo.
Once upon a time when you were appointed a Minister of Mineral Resources, it was a beautiful job, now you are dealing with the degradation of lands, the pollution of rivers and having to burn excavators.
I want Ghana to be returned to a land of thick forests, majestic trees, clean and beautiful rivers and I want it to happen under the tenure of Minister Abu Jinapor.
I couldn’t quite decide what to make of him in that Rangers uniform last Friday but I could certainly see the amount of hard work that had gone into the planning and execution of the project. I am wishing him well and I am hoping that every one of the seedlings that was planted last Friday survives and thrives.
A green Ghana will be a prosperous Ghana.
When it comes to good music, Highlife musician Akwaboah cannot be ignored, but he will easily skip your mind when you are talking about A List musicians in Ghana and that is because he is not in our faces all the time.
However, the musician is not worried that he is not at the top of people’s list. He told Graphic Showbiz that he was not in competition with any musician and not being in the public eye all the time allowed him room to release quality songs.
According to Akwaboah, releasing songs back to back just to help keep an artiste’s name out there did not guarantee sustainability.
“I don’t rush to release songs because I want to take my time and get it right. So many musicians made hits but in just a short time, they were nowhere to be found. I don’t want to be that kind of artiste. I am not under any pressure to release hit songs and anytime I drop something new, Ghanaians just love it.
“It is always not the best to keep releasing hit after hit. Ghanaians are some way and if they decide not to pay attention to you again, there is nothing you will do to impress them. I prefer to stay this way for the next 15 years than to do hit after hit songs and be forgotten in a year or two,” he told Graphic Showbiz recently.
The Zimbabwe Republic Police has launched a campaign aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, especially during elections.
Police launched the campaign on Wednesday with the support of human rights organizations, especially women's rights, the Canadian embassy in Zimbabwe, and the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe.
Speaking at the rally, the police chief, Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga, said the police would not be complacent in matters of violence against women during elections.
He also urged women to report cases of violence or abuse without fear.
The chairperson of the Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe, Sally Ncube, also said she was impressed by the police's commitment to prevent violence against women during elections.

Some doctors in the country at hospitals such as the West End and Parirenyatwa are refusing to treat people suspected of having coronavirus because they do not have the expertise and expertise.
On Monday, some nurses also protested at Mpilo Hospital, saying they did not have the necessary protection against the disease.
The Ministry of Infectious Diseases in the Ministry of Health, Dr Portia Manangazira, also told Studio7 that a Zimbabwean woman from China had failed to receive treatment in Parirenyatwa.
Parirenyatwa Hospital later investigated the case and ruled that it would not transmit the disease to patients such as coronaviruses, saying such people should be legally referred to Wilkins Hospital and Beatrice Infectious Hospital as a way of trying to prevent other patients and doctors at the hospital from being infected with coronavirus.
The hospital also said it would set up a tent outside the hospital to screen those suspected of having the disease and then refer them to the so-called specialist hospitals.
Harare City Council's chief medical officer, Dr Prosper Chonzi, also said that the West End hospital refused to help a Chinese woman who died thinking she had coronavirus but did not.
When we phoned the hospital they asked us to send questions but we had not yet received a response when we went on air.
Some 3,882 people have died from the disease worldwide.
China has the highest death toll, followed by Italy and Iran. In Africa two people have died in Egypt and Morocco.
But 11 countries in Africa have been affected, namely Algeria, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Senegal, Tunisia, Togo, Egypt, Cameroon, DRC, Nigeria and Morocco. South Africa has 13 people infected with the virus.
Harare City Council is warning residents of Budiriro and Glen Norah communities not to use water from wells or wells they are digging as the water is contaminated.
Due to the frequent lack of tap water, residents in areas such as Glen Norah and Budiriro, are using well water.
But council spokesman Michael Chideme said a study conducted in Budiriro village by Glen Norah found that many mines were contaminated with diarrheal diseases such as typhoid fever.
Mr Chideme said most of the mines being used in the area were shallow, which would lead to the severity of the sewers.
Chideme said the council is providing water to these areas on a regular basis.
The head of the Community Water Alliance, Mr Hardlife Mudzingwa, criticized the council saying the lack of council water was the main reason for residents to mine mines.
Mr Mudzingwa also said some areas do not always get water.
Many residents of Harare do not have regular access to council water which has led to mining in mining villages even though it is not permitted by council regulations.
Residents also say that although the council's water is very dirty, they are also worried about their health.
Things are not going well in public hospitals as the children's nurse is not doing their job.
Patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital told Studio7 that they were shocked by the government-sponsored gathering of people in various parts of the country as patients picked ants by mouth from hospitals.
Shupikai Gachitawa has a child with a broken leg at Parirenyatwa Hospital. Ms Gachitawa says her child is not being given pills or baths and new bandages due to the lack of a nurse.
Ms Gachitawa said the government should listen to the cries of its people and arrange for nurses to return to work.
Innocent Mazise has since seen his patient criticize the government for taking action to expel child nurses who are on strike. Mr Mazise said the government should look into the nurses' grievances and not rule with an ax.
A man who did not want to be named told Studio7 that the wards are no longer clean as there are no bathers or cleaners. He also said that patients are losing their lives due to the lack of any pills and medicines and helpers.
One mother has demanded anonymity because Ms Gumbo has said she is planning to evacuate her patient from the hospital who she says has not been given medication and pills since Monday.
The secretary of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, Evans Masitara, said the government's decision to dismiss the nurses was "disgraceful", as they were suffering from the disease.
In a written statement to its members, the Zimbabwe Nurses Association said they were not alarmed by any action being taken by the government. The report also said that the strike was continuing.
Yesterday, Deputy President Constantino Guvheya Chiwenga filed a letter dismissing all striking nurses.
A propaganda video released last month by the Islamic State (IS) group shows the Sahel's appeal to global jihadism when "brothers" in Burkina Faso and Mali were congratulated for pledging their allegiance.
Ansarul Islam, meaning Defenders of Islam, is the home-grown group, founded in 2016 by the radical and popular preacher Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who is said to have fought with Islamist militants in Mali when they took over the north of country in 2012, prompting France's intervention.
Dicko died in April 2017 and his brother Jafar is now leading the group, which has received logistical support from both AQIM and ISGS, according to Human Rights Watch.
Widespread frustration with the lack of jobs and infrastructure has made Burkina Faso a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists - and there are numerous smaller groups, not all of which are affiliated to larger ones or pledge allegiance to Islamist ideology.
According to the Economist, many are fighting for farmland or against government corruption but "adopt the 'jihadist' label because they happen to be Muslim".
But Ncube said members of parliament should trust the government as they improve the banking system and the use of funds in the country for the benefit of the people.
He said there were many steps they were taking that would make things better in the country.
Kwekwe Central MP Masango Matambanadzo also told Ncube that the issue of separating the weight of bonds from the US dollar had made it difficult for many in the country.
He said it was important for the government to see what it could do to increase the salaries of its employees and the private sector in order to keep pace with rising costs.
But Mr Ncube said the government had already adjusted the salaries of its employees and that was why it was providing them with benefits.
They also know that workers in the private sector are also getting higher salaries.
But Mr Matambanadzo said increased wages were useless because commodity prices had risen sharply.
But Mr. Ncube said he would not increase workers' wages in line with the US dollar, saying that although prices were rising, prices of other commodities were falling because they were being bought by fewer people.
He said it was clear that businesses were buying foreign currency on the street but that they should buy the money from banks.
He said banks currently have $ 800 million in foreign currency and this is the amount to be spent by industries and companies.
In a separate development, Chipinge East MP Matthew Mlambo said he was unhappy that the 2000 resettlers had been evicted for no reason.
He said this was happening in many parts of the country.
Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Douglas Karoro, said the evictees were those living in unsuitable places such as cattle grazing or barns.
There are many families who have been evicted from farms given to them by the government many years ago in Chemagora in the Midlands and Mashonaland West and freedom fighters are also complaining about this issue.
The MDC, led by Nelson Chamisa, says it did not attend the meeting convened by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, because Mnangagwa himself is the cause of the unrest in the country.
The MDC says Mr Mnangagwa should not convene a rally to mediate between the two parties if he is a member of the party.
Responding to an invitation to a meeting with the president's office, the MDC's chief of staff, Sessel Zvizvai, said his leader could not attend the meeting, as there were many issues that needed to be resolved.
Mr Zvizvai said the outcome of the presidential election was one of the first issues to be considered.
He also said that the issue of dialogue should be convened by non-political actors so that reconciliation can be done in a way that is fair to all.
Mr Zvizvai also said the talks should be supported by organizations including the Souther African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations.
The MDC has named 10 candidates for Mnangagwa before the talks with Chamisa.
These include stopping harassment of opponents; ensuring that no one is raped; the release from prison of all political prisoners; non-political interference in the functioning of the judiciary and respect for human rights.
The party's spokesman, Jacob Mafume, told Studio7 that before the reconciliation meeting, Mnangagwa should withdraw troops from the streets and allow other members of the opposition who had fled the country to return home from their homeland.
Three key Islamist militant groups have established a front in northern and eastern Burkina Faso: Ansarul Islam, the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (GSIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).
One of the most audacious attacks of recent years - the January 2016 siege on a luxury hotel that killed 30 people in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou - was carried out by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has since merged with two other jihadist groups - Ansar Dine and al-Mourabitoun - to form GSIM
Manyuchi who owns the WBO Silver belt told Studio 7 that Ali's absence has left a gaping hole as he has made the public enjoy the sport of boxing. "A man who had this talent, my father was also a boxer who liked him and I respected him as he was the one who made me strong in this sport." said Manyuchi.
He went on to say, "Muhammad Ali was known for saying - float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," I am known as a busy bee as my name is beehive so I feel happy that my band was also fought by Muhammad Ali because it has a picture of him and is the target category, I'm sorry but I will continue to use the skills I gained through Muhammad Ali, "
International leaders, including former US President Bill Clinton and other foreign leaders, are expected to attend. Many deputies are expected to say goodbye to Ali this Friday. Roads are expected to be very congested.
Ali's family said when the funeral procession was over, everyone would go alone as a family to bury the deceased.
A spokesman for the family, Bob Gunnell, said Ali's funeral was scheduled years ago based on the deceased's wishes. He is said to have wanted his grievances to be brought to the attention of anyone who wished.
Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in 1942 but later changed his date after converting from being a Christian to a Muslim.
He also won a gold medal in the light heavy weight category after defeating Zbigniew Pietrkowski of Poland.
Many American companies are considering the problem of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) as a major factor that has led many workers to work in their own homes, as a way to prevent the spread of the disease.
Other companies with jobs that cannot be employed at home, including food processors, have reportedly suspended some employees as they are unable to go to the offices.
Many states in the United States have banned the gathering of people in places including restaurants and movie theaters, prompting many workers in these service groups to be suspended until things improve.
The US government has also announced plans to set aside $ 1 trillion, which will be used to boost the country's economy by helping companies and individuals affected by the disease.
More than 6,000 people have been infected in the United States and more than 100 have died.
A Zimbabwean national living in the state of Maryland in the United States, Ms. Shingie Mangwiro, who is also working from home due to the disease, says she feels that the idea of ​​living at home is a good idea as it helps reduce social unrest.
Ms. Mangwiro, who sometimes works from home when there are other problems, says she has no problem with utilities as her home appliances are always connected to the workplace.
They also say that the steps being taken by US President Donald Trump and other government agencies are more appropriate in tackling the problem.
But Ms. Mangwiro is also urging those at home to prioritize sanitation, saying that although the disease has not yet entered the country, it is important that people take steps to prevent it.
Homeless people following the floods of the Tokwe Murkosi dam in Masvingo district last year say life is still difficult for them as they are no longer receiving assistance from the government and NGOs.
The announcement was made at the launch of a report outlining the plight of these people.
Speaking at the end of the launch of the Human Rights Watch charter, which conducted a social survey at Nuanetsi Ranch, some of the homeless following the floods said they were unhappy that the government had not yet provided them with shelter a year after the floods.
One of the victims, Kundiso Tevera, claims to have been abducted by the government. He said when they were relocated to Nuanetsi it was too small for all the families affected by the floods to do anything.
Ms. Tevera said one of the problems was the spread of diarrheal diseases which she said were caused by the unsafe water she said they were getting from the boreholes which she said were far from Nuanetsi Ranch when they were given land to live on.
Meanwhile, one of the victims, Wanisai Muzenda, said food was a problem for many displaced people in Tokwe Mukorsi, saying many people were starving due to the suspension of food aid from NGOs.
Ms Muzenda says the person is living with the virus, so the lack of food in the resettlement area has prevented them from taking their pills and says they are already dying.
One of the men, Kenneth Hlavano, a former soldier, said he was saddened by the fact that he had been evacuated three times since the floods for free.
Meanwhile, Dewa Mavhinga, working with the Human Rights Watch evacuation team, urged the Human Rights Commission to investigate the ongoing evictions in Tokwe Murkosi and the ongoing human rights abuses.
We have not been able to hear the government's side of the story as Masvingo provincial minister Kudakwashe Bhasikiti has not responded to phone calls and interior minister Kembo Mohadi has been returning questions to Basikiti.
Mavhinga urged the victims to take their cases to court.
Mavhinga was speaking at the launch of his organization's report on the evacuation of Tokwe Murkosi following last year's floods called "Homeless, Landless and Destitute - The Plight of Zimbabwe's Tokwe Mukorsi Flood Victims".
A report released by Human Rights Watch is urging the government to rehabilitate more than 20,000 flood victims and reimburse them.
The group is also urging the African Union to ensure that Zimbabwe protects human rights. President Robert Mugabe is the current chair of the AU.
The coach of the national senior and junior team, KalistoPasuwa, has resigned.
Pasuwa resigned yesterday when the Young Warriors returned from South Africa where they were beaten 3-0.
Pasuwa has told the Zimbabwe Football Association that he will not continue to work without pay, which he has not been paid for 10 months.
Pasuwa's manager, Gibson Mahachi, says Pasuwa has resigned and is looking forward to more work to come.
Rumors are circulating in Harare that Pasuwa may return to Dynamos after the sacking of David Mandigora as the club's coach.
Former Warriors kit manager Joshua Khumalo, who was unpaid during his tenure, says Pasuwa has taken a positive step instead of working for free.
Khumalo said he was surprised that Fifa was not paying its employees while receiving funding from Fifa for support.
Football commentator Prosper Muzanharwo said the beating of the Young Warriors in South Africa had nothing to do with their performance but that they were starving because of Zifa's lack of funding.
Sports commentator Howard Musonza said Zifa had failed so badly that they should be fired if they failed to pay their employers.
The Young Warriors will travel to the Africa Games in Congo Brazaville in September with a new coach, Nation Dube, who was Pasuwa's successor.
The Warriors will also have a new coach when they play Guinea in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in early September.
Church members are gathering in Harare to pray for a solution to the crisis, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa calling for unity among political parties.
The internet has been shut off and a curfew imposed in Eswatini, the southern African kingdom formerly known as Swaziland.
Security forces are on high alert as protesters demanding political reforms have vowed to step up their demonstrations.
A journalist told the BBC that overnight there were violent confrontations in the city of Manzini and that the country’s borders and airport remain closed.
Days of protests have left several people in hospital, businesses in the capital, Mbabane, remain closed after some, including those linked to the king, were destroyed.
Sporadic demonstrations over poor wages and political repression have flared up over the years in Eswatini - this most recent one was sparked by the death of law student.
While the government says his death was the result of a car accident, protesters say he was murdered by police.
The protests have highlighted long-running discontent in one of the world’s last remaining absolute monarchies.
King Mswati III, who came to the throne 35 years ago, rules by decree.
His critics accuse the 53-year-old monarch, and his 15 wives, of leading a lavish lifestyle and treating opponents harshly.
A court in Morocco is reported to have sentenced an Italian-Moroccan woman to three and a half years in prison for insulting Islam after she shared a post on Facebook of a satirical text imitating Quranic verse.
The father of the 23-year-old woman says that she was arrested at the airport in the capital, Rabat, on her return from France where she was studying.
A religious association in Marrakesh instigated the case against her by making a complaint to the authorities.
Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo has ordered a public inquiry into the shooting dead of two protesters.
Four others were injured during clashes with the security forces in the central town of Ejura on Tuesday.
The disturbances began after popular government critic Ibrahim Mohammed, also known as “Macho Kaaka”, was beaten up over the weekend in Ejura and subsequently died.
Demonstrators blocked the main road after his burial on Tuesday, the police said.
Security personnel deployed to restore calm were threatened with firearms, machetes and stones, the police statement adds.
The protesters were killed when security personnel opened fire.
A top Liberian drug enforcement officer has apologised for making allegations that an MP was caught transporting drugs.
The officer told a drug awareness forum about her encounter with an MP who, she said, was seen carrying marijuana, cocaine and heroin in his official vehicle.
She declined to name the MP at the time.
But the allegation was published widely in local dailies and on social media, prompting the 73-member parliament to summon the officer to disclose the name of the MP in question.
When she appeared before the house, the officer admitted making the allegation but refused to point out the MP and instead asked for forgiveness.
The hearing was adjourned as the officer was rushed to hospital after suddenly falling ill.
Substance abuse is a huge challenge in post-war Liberia, where the under-funded Drug Enforcement Agency struggles to tackle the drug trade.
Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has downplayed Monday’s capture by rebels of the Tigrayan regional capital, Mekelle.
"A lot of people were shocked… when we started withdrawing from Mekelle. But, by the time we exited, there was nothing special about it,” he said.
“It had lost its centre of gravity in the current context."
But the rebels insist the federal forces had been beaten and were forced to leave.
Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Redwan Hussein said the military could retake Mekelle in three weeks if necessary.
The government had other economic priorities to deal with, he said.
More than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) had been spent by the government over the past eight months in Tigray in efforts to provide aid, he added.
Fighting has been going on since November, leaving thousands of people dead and destabilising the region.
The UN has appealed for urgent access to vulnerable people in Tigray, many of whom face starvation.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders saw Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election.
The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew when the central government suspended funding for Tigray and cut ties with it in October.
At the time, Tigray's administration said this amounted to a "declaration of war".
Tensions increased, and the eventual catalyst was when Tigrayan forces were accused of attacking army bases to steal weapons.
Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a "red line".
"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation," he said.
Algerian Finance Minister Ayman Benabderrahmane has been appointed as the new prime minister following parliamentary elections earlier this month that were marred by a low turnout
Mr Benabderrahmane, who was also once the central bank governor, now has to try to form a government to tackle the North African nation’s economic crisis.
Reforms promised by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune when he took office 18 months ago have been hampered by the sharp drop in oil and gas revenues and the coronavirus pandemic.
The main Islamist party, the MSP - which came third in the election - has said it will not participate in the new government.
The new prime minister will also have to respond to the demands of an influential popular protest movement - known as the Hirak - calling for radical political change.
It brought to an end the long-time rule of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 2019.
The Hirak called for a boycott of the recent elections and continues to hold weekly demonstrations in various parts of the country.
Dozens of its members have been prosecuted and jailed, according to human rights groups.
Namibia’s President Hage Geingob has said his country is facing a “dark and sombre moment” as coronavirus deaths and cases rapidly increase.
Addressing the nation, he said that 513 Namibians had died in the last 15 days as a result of the virus and cases have trebled since the beginning of June.
With a population of just 2.5 million this represents one of the worst death rates on the continent.
Introducing new restrictions, including stopping movement between the country’s regions, Mr Geingob said that things were likely to continue to get worse until mid-August at the earliest.
Speaking after the president, Health Minister Kalumbi Shangula said the country was “literally in an existential struggle… we are in a fight for our very lives”.
He described a stretched health service and said that the country’s mortuaries “have reached maximum capacity”.
The minister announced that more intensive care beds were being prepared and steps had been taken to boost the country’s purified oxygen supply.
Rounding off his message, President Geingob urged people to co-operate with the new measures and insisted the nation would overcome the crisis.
A man extradited to Rwanda from the Netherlands has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for genocide crimes committed when he was 19.
During Jean-Claude Iyamuremye’s five-year trial, he denied involvement in the 1994 genocide when around 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in 100 days by Hutu extremists.
The high court judge said Iyamuremye had been a member of a youth militia that hunted and killed members of the Tutsi community in his neighbourhood in the capital, Kigali.
The 45-year-old defended himself, saying his own mother was a Tutsi.
The judge said he could have sentenced Iyamuremye to life, but had decided not to as he was “so young” when the crimes were committed and he had also saved some Tutsi families.
Iyamuremye was arrested in 2013 in the Netherlands, where he had worked as a driver for staff at the Israeli and Finnish embassies.
He was sent back to Rwanda by the Dutch authorities in 2016.
Two suspected jihadists have been arrested over the Solhan attack in the north-eastern region of Burkina Faso on 4 June in which more than 130 people were killed.
The prosecutor announced the arrest of two suspects, aged 28, in a statement.
Both claim to belong to the Mouhadine group, meaning "People in Solidarity", which is thought to be affiliated to al-Qaeda.
It is divided into several sub-groups based in Burkina Faso and has led incursions into Niger and Benin.
The prosecutor said the the group was responsible for previous attacks in Solhan, Sebba, Boundoré and Koholoko on the Niger border.
The prosecutor has requested the opening of a judicial investigation into the two suspects on a number of terrorism-related charges.
The attack on the village of Solhan, which took place at an artisanal mining site, is considered to be the deadliest attack in Burkina Faso since April 2015.
It has caused discontent and criticism about the ability of the defence and security forces to contain jihadist violence in the country.
On Sunday evening, in a radio and television message, President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré promised to strengthen the operational capacity of troops on the ground.
About 300 British troops have arrived in the troubled West African state of Mali at a time when the epicentre of the Islamic State group (IS) appears to have moved from the Middle East to Africa.
In a three-year mission named Operation Newcombe they are joining a force of around 15,000 UN multinational troops, spearheaded by the French, in efforts to help stabilise a part of the continent known as the Sahel.
Mali is one of several Sahel nations currently fighting jihadist insurgencies and the violence is getting worse.
According to the Global Terrorism Index published on 25 November, the "centre of gravity" for the Islamic State group IS has moved away from the Middle East to Africa and to some extent South Asia, with total deaths by IS in sub-Saharan Africa up by 67% over last year.
"The expansion of ISIS affiliates into sub-Saharan Africa led to a surge in terrorism in many countries in the region," reports the Global Terrorism Index.
"Seven of the 10 countries with the largest increase in terrorism were in sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, DRC, Mali, Niger, Cameroon and Ethiopia".
The report points out that in 2019 "sub-Saharan Africa recorded the largest number of ISIS-related terrorism deaths at 982, or 41 per cent of the total".
Jihadists have long been active in Africa.
In modern times the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden made Sudan his base before moving back to Afghanistan in 1996.
Nigeria's Boko Haram movement, infamous for kidnapping hundreds of schoolgirls at Chibok in 2014, carried out major attacks after declaring a jihad in 2010.
But today, as competition increase between rival jihadist groups, the threat of terrorism in the region is increasing.
The US State Department's coordinator for counter-terrorism, ambassador Nathan Sales, says both IS and al-Qaeda have shifted much of their operations away from their heartland in Syria and Iraq to their affiliates in West and East Africa, as well as Afghanistan.
"Africa", he says, "is a key front in the next stage in the fight against terrorism".
But it is not just a case of governments versus insurgents, there is also a deadly rivalry taking place between supporters of al-Qaeda and IS. This rivalry is becoming so intense that French expert on jihad Olivier Guitta from GlobalStrat Risk Consultancy even predicts:
"Africa is going to be the battleground of jihad for the next 20 years and it's going to replace the Middle East".
Al-Qaeda and IS share a common loathing for secular, Western-supported rulers whom they call "apostates".
But they also have major differences in their approach.
IS has a predilection for extreme, graphic, violence - as demonstrated by its gruesome beheading videos.
While this certainly attracts sociopaths and convicted criminals to its ranks, it also tends to repel the vast majority of Muslims.
Al-Qaeda and its affiliates often seek to win over the loyalty of local populations who have no confidence in their governments or their police, exploiting regional and ethnic grievances.
Several of the world's poorest nations border the Sahara desert.
This region is known as "the Sahel", an Arabic word literally meaning "the coast".
Mali, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania make up the Sahel countries and all have suffered attacks from insurgents.
Parts of the region are afflicted variously with drought, poverty, unemployment, corruption and in some cases large tracts of ungoverned space.
"West Africa", says ambassador Sales, "is a perfect storm, with nation states that don't control their territories, commit abuses by their forces, and have porous borders".
The dominant jihadist group in this region is the al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat Al-Islam wa'l-Muslimin (JNIM).
The group is in direct competition with the IS affiliate Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and this year has seen a number of low-level battles between them.
Nigeria has suffered some of the worst jihadist attacks in the region, with the government struggling to control the north-east of the country where the Boko Haram movement evolved.
According to the Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram has been responsible for over "37,500 combat-related deaths and over 19,000 deaths from terrorism since 2011, mainly in Nigeria" but also neighbouring countries.
In 2015, one faction of Boko Haram pledged allegiance to IS, becoming "Islamic State West Africa Province" (Iswap), crossing borders with ease and capturing a multinational base on the shores of Lake Chad in 2018.
IS has since been heavily promoting this African affiliate.
Attacks are still being carried in Boko Haram's name. A video posted by the group on 1 December claimed responsibility for massacring dozens of farmers in Borno state who it claimed had collaborated with government forces.
Western nations have offered only limited military and intelligence assistance to Nigeria. Western diplomats say they are constrained by the corruption and poor human rights record of the Nigerian military.
These failings have been a major contributor towards mistrust of the government and towards recruitment for Boko Haram and other jihadist groups in the region.
"The corruption angle in Nigeria" says Olivier Guitta, "is ruining everything".
Al-Qaeda's insurgency in North Africa started off in Algeria.
So it is no surprise that the newly appointed leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is an Algerian.
The white-bearded 51-year-old Abu Obaida Al-Annabi replaces his predecessor, Abdelmalik Droukdel, who was killed by French troops in Mali in June.
In a microcosm of the wider al-Qaeda-IS rivalry, his appointment has been cheered by al-Qaeda's supporters while rival IS supporters have cast doubt on his jihadist credentials.
Tunisia, the smallest country in the region, produced one of the highest numbers of volunteers - 15-20,000 - who travelled to Syria to join IS during its peak years of 2013-2018.
With high unemployment and a proximity to Libya, Tunisia continues to face an ongoing threat from terrorism.
Libya has been in a state of intermittent chaos ever since the Arab Spring revolt of 2011 and the overthrow of the despotic regime of Muammar Gaddafi.
The end of his regime not only released thousands of tonnes of weapons and explosives from government armouries, much of it making its way across the southern border into the Sahel countries, it also allowed IS jihadists to gain a foothold in the east of Libya.
Somalia's al-Shabab group - Arabic for "the young men" - has been one of the most persistent and dangerous jihadist movements on the entire continent.
"Al-Shabab" says Nathan Sales, "sees itself as al-Qaeda's most successful group"
It has survived concerted multinational military campaigns to eradicate it yet it has been able to strike across its borders in Kenya and Uganda as well as detonating massive bombs in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
US Special Operations raids and drone strikes, launched from neighbouring Djibouti, frequently kill al-Shabab leaders and yet the group has been able to keep regenerating itself.
It has also succeeded in beating back a challenge from the local IS affiliate which is now largely confined to the north-east tip of the Horn of Africa.
The foothold gained by IS in the northern district of Cabo Delgado under the banner of "Islamic State Central Africa Province" (ISCAP), could well be an example of a full-blown insurgency arranged almost entirely over the internet.
Counter-terrorism officials believe that the jihadists operating in this gas-rich part of Mozambique have been recruited online with some input from across the border in Tanzania but largely without the physical presence of recruiters sent from the IS heartlands of Syria and Iraq.
There are conflicting reports as to the veracity of some of the recent atrocities carried out in the name of IS in Cabo Delgado, such as the alleged massacre of around 50 villagers on a football field.
But IS does appear to be getting the upper hand against the government.
"IS" says Olivier Guitta, "is moving around within Mozambique unhampered by other forces".
This is a hugely contentious issue.
In June 2013 all seven leaders at the G7 summit at Loch Erne signed up to an agreement not to pay ransoms to proscribed terrorist organisations.
Seven years on and the reality remains that European citizens tend to be eventually released for undisclosed amounts while British and American hostages are the most likely to get executed.
Several French citizens have been released from jihadist captivity in the Sahel, most recently in exchange for the release of a large number of dangerous jihadist prisoners in Mali.
Analysts have put the total amount paid to jihadist kidnappers in North and West Africa over the years at more than €100m ($120m; £90m).
This ransom money is then used by the jihadists to buy more weapons, more explosives, better vehicles, night vision goggles, communications equipment as well as funding their recruitment efforts and providing bribes to corrupt officials.
Recent attacks on churches in northern Burkina Faso are likely to be the work of jihadists whose activities are growing in the region despite a military operation to contain Islamist militancy.
The country's foreign minister says tackling terrorism has become a fight "for the very survival" of the Sahel region, which incorporates Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
The militants have forced 100,000 in Burkina Faso alone to flee their homes in recent months.
In the last month there have been at least five attacks targeting Christians, several taking place during church services - though no group has said it was behind these assaults, analysts say they have all the jihadists' hallmarks.
It shows a shift in tactics, according to Djallil Lounnas, an expert on militancy in the Sahara at Morocco's Al Akhawayn University.
"Usually religious minorities have not been touched, especially Christian minorities, since jihadist violence broke out in the area," he says.
This is particularly troubling given Burkina Faso's long history of religious tolerance, but it forms part of a jihadist strategy to sow religious and inter-communal conflict.
"It's an old guerrilla, terrorist tactic to increase their ranks by fuelling mass violence," says Louis Audet-Gosselin of the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism.
Conflict and instability also create the conditions that allow jihadists to install bases and control territory.
"The security situation in the country is degrading almost daily," says Mr Audet-Gosselin. "Jihadist groups are gaining ground bit by bit, forcing state officials and state sovereignty out of several rural areas and increasingly some cities."
Those targeted are often associated with the state - village counsellors, mayors, police officers, civil servants and civilians accused of collaborating with military.
Schools and teachers are soft targets for Islamists militants, who oppose secular education. More than 1,000 schools in the north have been forced to close recently, affecting more than 150,000 children.
Human Rights Watch has also reported numerous abuses by government forces during counter-terrorism operations, including summary executions of Fulanis, a largely Muslim ethnic group of semi-nomadic herders.
"The army is pretty brutal and tends to single out the Fulani community as a whole, as guilty by association to jihadist groups... which in turn leads to increasing militancy from Fulani youth," says Mr Audet-Gosselin.
The public has been cautioned to avoid walking or driving through flood waters as the rainy season peaks in Southern Ghana.
“Sometimes, a stretch of running water might seem easy to wade or swim through, but strong currents could easily sweep you off and carry you away when you attempt to swim or wade your way through.”
Mr Richard Amo-Yartey, Director for Inspectorate at the Headquarters of the National Disaster Management (NADMO), in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, also cautioned motorists against driving through flood waters, adding that many cars were swept away because drivers had underestimated the strong currents within seemingly harmless flood waters.
He said flood waters, even if one could safely swim or wade through them, also often carried dangerous objects such as faecal matter and other forms of disease-causing material and dangerous reptiles that could easily harm a human.
“It is often a much better option to be patient and wait for flood waters to recede than to risk harm that could easily be avoided,” said Mr. Amo-Yartey.
He also cautioned people staying within places that are prone to flooding and urged them to relocate to safer places to avoid the inconveniences of flooding during the rainy season.
Mr Amo-Yartey reminded the public that while the government was always working around the clock to ensure the welfare of people, individuals had the responsibility of ensuring their safety.
“The rains are here with us.
People should be alert and stay wary of the dangers of the season, to remain safe,” he said.
Mr Amo-Yartey said NADMO was educating communities on how to stay safe in the face of floods and other ill effects of the rainy season.
He urged people in emergency situations to call the hotlines of NADMO, which are 112 or 0299350030.
Meanwhile, the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) has urged the public to read its daily and weekly forecast on the website to plan their activities.
A four-hour downpour last Saturday caused flooding in many parts of Southern Ghana, including Kasoa, Weija, Adentan and many others.
Many people had to wait for some hours before they could leave or return to their homes, because of heavy flooding.
Several communities in the Nanumba South District of the Northern Region continue to suffer as floods continue to wreak havoc in homes and farms.
Some residents living close to the Oti river are counting their losses following heavy rains on Sunday, October 11, 2020, that got the several communities flooded.
Roads have been cut off making it difficult for people to access the district capital for basic needs.
The communities include Chichagi, Lahato, Egambo, Mualaa, all in the Nanumba South District.
Buildings have collapsed, farms submerged and bridges washed off.
The people say they have no place to lay their heads and are calling on the authorities to come to their aid.
“All our belongings have been submerged in the floods, I have nowhere to go.
What to eat is even a problem.
We need the government to support us. All my belongings are gone,” a victim said.
“All my properties are gone.
All I have left are the clothes I have on.
I am begging the government to help put up our structures again,” another victim shared
The District National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO) Coordinator, Yaw Kojo Kumah Edward also appealed for support for the victims.
“Several buildings have collapsed. We can no longer identify the areas.
We have about 157 people identified, and we are still counting.
We are appealing to the government, religious bodies, and the NGOs to come to our aid.
Most of these people have no one to look up to.
They survive majorly on farming, and as their farms have been submerged in the floods, they have nothing to feed on.”
The Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), West Mamprusi in the North East Region, Aremeyaw Somo Lucky, says the GHS100,000 presented by the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia in support of flood victims has been disbursed.
Dr. Bawumia offered the money with an assurance that the government will assist in rebuilding the houses for the displaced victims in the area.
Villages were submerged in floodwaters following the massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
Acres of farmlands were submerged while some livestock were carried away by the floodwaters, a situation that led to the donation from Dr. Bawumia to enable the affected victims to get some relief items.
The Director-General of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), Eric Nana Agyemang-Prempeh, has explained that the perennial spillage of the Bagre Dam in Burkina is a contributory factor to the recent flooding in parts Accra.
A downpour over the weekend left many parts of Accra, including Weija and its adjoining communities flooded, restricting movement and causing damage to property.
“Previously, the spillage from the Bagre Dam was flowing at 4-8million gallons per minute, but now it’s flowing 29 million gallons per minute at a very tough speed to Ghana, therefore almost all the rivers in the country are full, so the little rainfall, then it floods everywhere”
The NADMO Director General said this during a visit to some flood prone areas in the Greater Accra Region.
According to NADMO, this year, it collaborated with Municipal and District Assemblies to dredge several drains in anticipation of the rains, but the rivers could not absorb the overflow from the Bagre Dam.
Mr. Agyemang Prempeh advised those who take advantage of the rain to throw to dump rubbish into already choked drains, to put a stop to the practice; as it contributes to the flooding in Accra.
The NADMO Director General, together with the Greater Accra Regional Director, Archibold Cobbina, MP for Weija-Gbawe, Tina Naa Ayeley Mensah, and MP for Bortianor Ngleshie Amanfrom, Sylvester Tetteh, visited some victims in some of the flood prone areas at Weija- Gbawe and Bortianor Ngleshie Amanfrom.
They sympathized with the affected victims and promised to assist them with some relief items.
The Municipal Chief Executive for West Mamprusi Assembly in the North East Region, Issahaku Aremeyaw Somo, has said he escaped a robbery attack on Monday, October 12, 2020.
This happened when the MCE was travelling to communities to disburse money to victims of recent flooding in the region.
Speaking on Eyewitness News, Mr. Somo said he was able to escape the attack because security personnel came in time to open fire on a group of robbers who attempted to block his convoy.
“Fortunately the police came in. But then at the time, they had already shot a motor rider on the leg.
I was with the chiefs distributing the money when they brought him.
They quickly rushed him to the hospital.
I was alarmed, so I quickly had to go back to Walewale.”
“That particular road is noted for robbery. Because of that, we mounted a number of security checks in the area and that had helped in curbing the attacks.
But recently, the police had an accident in the area, and so they had toned down a bit, so I am sure these robbers wanted to take advantage of the situation.
But luck evaded them,” he added.
On Thursday, October 1, 2020, four villages, Gaagbini, Dimia, Tinkaya, and Banawa were submerged in floodwaters following massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
The government gave GHS100,000 to the MCE to support flood victims in the municipality.
Mr. Somo said he suspects the robbers may have come after the money in his possession.
“We are suspecting they came after the GHS100,000. Since then, I have had to move about with security.
That way, my security is assured while disbursing the money.”
The Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) has begun spilling excess water from the Weija Dam.
This is due to the downpour in the catchment area of the Densu River basin.
It began the spillage on Sunday, October 11, 2020.
“The safe operating level of the Weija Dam is 47ft, however, the heavy rains shot the dam level from 46.8ft to 48.4ft in less than 24 hours, prompting the spillage immediately to prevent it from possible collapse,” the GWCL explained in a statement.
It thus said it has informed the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), the National Security, Bureau of National Investigation (BNI), Chiefs, District Assembly, opinion leaders and all stakeholders downstream the dam “to evacuate the area immediately to avoid any eventuality.”
The affected communities include Tetegu, Oblogo, Pambros Salt, Lower McCarthy Hill, Lower Weija, Bojo Beach, Ada Kopey and surrounding communities.
The company is expecting more rain in the area and has said it, along with NADMO and other sector agencies, “are making arrangement for the provision of water and other services to the people displaced by the flood.”
Residents of Weija had to contend with flooding this past weekend due to a downpour.
They have been appealing for storm drains to help with the drainage of run-off water.
Victims of flooding in the West Mamprusi municipality are still crying out for help from the state after being displaced.
A day after the government donated GHS100,000 and relief items to floods victims of Thursday torrential rain in parts of the West Mamprusi municipality, the flood victims are yet to receive improved help.
Speaking to Citi News, some displaced persons complained about hunger as food meant for the victims from the assembly are not forthcoming.
A victim of the flooding complained about the conditions in the schools being used as havens saying, “for the past three days, we have been finding it difficult to fend for ourselves.”
“We have only been provided with two classrooms to live in.
We are over 300, but because of the limited space, we the men have left the classrooms for the women and children while we hang around outside. The food is not enough, they brought in 77 food packs whereas we are close to 300 in number.”
“We do not know what to do now, the DCE allowed us to move in here until further notice.
The food they provide is not enough, we are forced to hand them over to the children while we strive to survive.
They claim they have brought us food, but we are not feeling the impact. We have nothing to survive on, with no helper,” another lamented.
“The said amount donated to us by the government has not been disbursed yet, the DCE and NPP parliamentary candidate took the money to Walewale but we have not heard from them,” he added.
Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia cut short his campaign tour of the Greater Accra Region to visit the victims of the devastating floods.
Upon arrival, he donated GHS 100,000 to food victims.
Four villages; Gaagbini, Dimia, Tinkaya and Banawa have been the hardest hit in the municipality.
On Thursday, the villages were submerged in floodwaters following massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
Acres of farmlands were submerged while some livestock was carried away by the floodwaters.
A herdsman has been arrested in Tamale in the Northern Region for allegedly swindling the Tamale District Police Commander, Chief Superintendent, Iddrisu Tanko Issifu.
In his quest to become a cattle farmer, Chief Superintendent Tanko Issifu, last year, allegedly entered into a barter agreement with two herdsmen– Osman Mumuni and Seidu Braimah– who promised to sell to him cattle.
According to a police statement, the two herdsmen initially took a sum of GHS36,100.00 to supply the police chief with 53 cattle.
The two later entered into an agreement to buy his Toyota Scion with registration number GW 7-Z in exchange for 40 cattle.
After that, they again allegedly took Chief Superintendent Tanko Issifu’s Land Cruiser Prado with Registration number GS 5939-11 with his consent to supply additional 300 cattle.
According to the police statement, the district commander also gave the suspects another GHS56,000.00 to buy 70 more cattle.
The statement further indicated that, as part of their agreement, the suspects were to take care of the cattle, which numbered about 556.
However, the District Police Commander in an attempt to inspect the animals yielded no result as the herdsmen allegedly kept giving him excuses.
“When he later tried to check up on the suspects and the animals numbering about 556 cattle and 40 calves, they told him the cattle had been sent to a far distance for grazing but failed to show the whereabouts of the animals,” the statement noted.
“He went to the location of the suspects to inspect the animals, but to his disappointment no human being was found, let alone cattle.”
According to the statement, the police chief was alarmed and caused the arrest of one of the suspects while efforts are underway to apprehend the second suspect, Seidu Braimah, who is currently on the run.
The Regional Coordinating Director for Ahafo Region, Ebenezer Amoah has admonished youth in the region to desist from shying away from informal sector jobs and take advantage of such avenues to boost their economic lives.
Youth groups across the region on Wednesday, June 30 met the leadership of the region at the Regional Coordinating Council to present to them developmental challenges they face.
Krontihene for Ntotroso Traditional area, Nana Akofo Amankonah I, addressing the issues also challenged the youth to make career choices that will help them to be innovative in order to meet the diverse available target markets.
“If you’re a tailor, you can decide to master producing only boxer shorts and prosper, same as vulcanizers. One can choose to master and work on just truck tyres or tyres of small cars”, he said.
The National Youth Authority (NYA) in collaboration with ActionAid has been organizing workshops throughout the region for youth groups to deliberate on the issues confronting youth development.
ActionAid Ghana through the implementation of its three years project; Promoting Employment Opportunities for Young people in Ghana (PEOY) is empowering young people with skills and knowledge in livelihood activities and encouraging their participation in decision-making that affects their lives.
These workshops sought to establish linkages between PEOY beneficiaries, Youth Parliament members, Young Women Movement, Activists and give them a bigger voice and enable them to grow into a movement for youth advocacy in the region.
Amongst key issues presented and discussed were youth unemployment, substance abuse, teenage pregnancy, and terrible road networks.
According to KPMG Global Mining Institute, Ghana presents several opportunities in the mining sector, especially in the gold industry. Statistically, it is proven that Gold represents Ghana’s major export commodity, providing, 50% of GDP, (Ministry of Land and Natural Resources (MLNR), 2003).
Ghana is also the second-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa and the 10th largest globally with Peru being the sixth largest producer.
The other important mineral resources are oil, diamond, bauxite and magnesium.
Mining has become a controversial business everywhere.
The continuous debate of the mining business is due to its great economical contribution to the country.
Within the past few decades, Ghana’s mining sector specifically the small-scale mining sector has been defaced with arguments mainly as a result of its threats to sustainable development.
Small scale mining in Ghana generally refers to artisanal mining of precious minerals particularly gold and diamond. Artisanal and Small-scale mining is a practice that involves rudimentary techniques of mineral extraction, highly manual processes, hazardous working conditions, and frequently affecting the human and environmental bodies negatively.
In Ghana, it is estimated that two to three million people are engaged in this activity; about 170,000 are directly or indirectly into illegal mining (galamsey) as they solely depend on it for their livelihoods.
The term ‘galamsey’ is a local dialect, coined from the statement, “Gather and Sell” as it explains what these workers do.
This activity is flagged as a lucrative venture and a quickest way of earning an income which makes local Ghanaians, particularly the youth the active participant in this sector.
Illegal mining seeks to be the only alternative of alleviating poverty to the people involved but in two folds perpetuates poverty through high sensitivity to physical hazards, illness, accidents, and lack of knowledge about more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly techniques.
In recent cases, there has been a season of tragedy as it has been recorded that people involved in this activity lost their lives as a result of being trapped when a pit collapses or a landslide occurs and affect the water bodies.
On Wednesday, November 11, 2009, an estimated 30 illegal miners lost their lives as a result of landslides at Dopoase in the Wassa Amenfi East District of the Western region where 14 out of the 18 retrieved corpses were women.
Similarly, there was another tragedy at Dunkwa-On-Offin in 2010 in the Central Region where several miners were trapped in a pit when it caved on them near the Offin river resulting in the death of 100 miners. The inception of this activity is not affiliated with a single body or organization. Citizens are equally to be criticized.
It is known that this activity takes place under cover of darkness or hidden places such as forests, existing farms, river beds, valley and remote areas aided by foreigners especially the Chinese.
Since 2000, about 50,000 Chinese gold miners have migrated to Ghana to engage in small-scale mining.
The rapid relocation of these foreigners was mainly driven by the high demand for gold prices, increasing cultural corporation between China and Ghana and the largely informal nature of the illegal mining.
The remodel traditional method of using pickaxe, shovel and pan to new technology such as the use of excavators cause environmental threats and social conflicts where the indigenes attacked the armed Chinese miners. Consequently, there is a proven climatic and social change due to the nature of the work, bad weather conditions, and degradation of natural resources which disturbs human survival in these artisanal environments.
The primitive techniques of these miners which are illegal and unregulated contaminate the water as a result of the discharged sewage which contains toxic chemicals such as cyanide and other organic chemicals used in the processing of mineral ores. These chemicals together result in waste with high acid levels which either seep into underground water or flow into the environment posing danger to the people.
The unchanged attitudinal behaviour of the political actors, law enforcement bodies, local chiefs and farmers towards the practice of illegal mining make this activity thrive. The law enforcement body provides these foreigners with guns to defend themselves from locals on the grounds of generating a beneficial budget for the police and immigration authorities.
There is also a lack of political will to combat this activity which is evidently because these politicians also benefit from these activities; the political leaders send threats to the appointed leaders of the task force to release the seized excavators or lose their jobs which derails the nation’s fight against galamsey.
Chiefs and landowners of these mining areas are rendered powerless when the foreigners proceed to work on their lands with a granted permission from the lawmakers in the state.
In a quest to fight this activity, in May 2013, former President, John Mahama set up an inter-ministerial task force to roll out illegal small-scale miners where they were able to deport 4592 Chinese officials by mid-July 2013 but despite their efforts failed to entirely wipe out illegal mining activities. Similarly in August 2017, the task force arrested over 1370 miners including 247 Chinese officials with consequent arrest 33, 15, 7, 24 in April, June, August and September respectively.
Although these actions brought about diplomatic dilemmas to Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo on his visit to China in 2019 assured the Chinese officials on how the country remains keen to encourage economic corporation but would not hesitate to persecute China national involved in the illegal mining activity to ease the diplomatic tension between these two countries.
In a scientific published article by the World Bank titled, Strategy for African Mining, it is estimated that some 30,000 people are employed within the legalized segment of the Ghana small-scale mining sector. Minerals Commission and Ghana Chamber of Mines, also noted that 60 per cent of the country’s mining labour force is, in fact, employed at small-scale mines.
Regional employment assessments have estimated that over 6,000 illegal and 117 registered artisanal gold mines are found in Tarkwa alone.
According to the 2008 Ghana Chamber of Mines (GCM) report, illegal mining activities (galamsey) have been increasing with an estimated number between 300,000 and 500,000 artisan miners comprising one of the largest groups of illegal miners on the continent disregarding the small-scale mining laws promulgated in 1989 with its continuation in the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006 (Acts 703) which expresses the basic position that minerals in their natural state are owned by the state and outlines the license scheme for mineral operations, the incidence of the various mineral rights and the power of the principal regulatory institutions yielded no results as according to the 2008 Ghana Chamber of Mines (CGM) report, illegal mining activities have been increasing with an estimated number between 300,000 and 500,000 artisan miners yielding one of the largest groups of illegal miners on the continent.
Nationally, galamsey addresses huge sums in lost incomes and exports.
In 2016, the Ghanaian government lost an estimated $2.3 billion in financial incomes through illegal mining.
Comparatively, the country’s top three major unfamiliar organizations by and large produce over 30% of the country’s gold creation and add to above half of the government incomes.
It is in this margin both in terms of the output and labour force that the government must formalize galamsey practices as it would represent a critical fiscal boost for the country not disputing the fact on how it is publicly known as a challenge for the government to set policies on how to benefits from the artisanal and small-scale mining while minimizing the negative consequences mining activities.
Similarly in August 2017, the task force arrested over 1370 miners including 247 Chinese officials with consequent arrest 33, 15, 7, 24 in April, June, August and September respectively.
Although these actions brought about diplomatic dilemmas to Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo on his visit to China in 2019 assured the Chinese officials on how the country remains keen to encourage economic corporation but would not hesitate to persecute China national involved in the illegal mining activity to ease the diplomatic tension between these two countries.

Nationally, galamsey addresses huge sums in lost incomes and exports.
The government must however educate and provide the miners in the rural areas the needed resources in terms of tools for a safer conducive environment and preserve the natural bodies.
The means of controlling the galamsey activities do not entirely depend on the political actors.
It must be recognized as a collective effort, from political actors, chiefs, the law enforcement body and the citizenry.
To conclude, this research has addressed a number of significant issues which shows that illegal mining if not harnessed would stall the country’s development and the smooth running of the country.
The 1992 constitution of the Republic of Ghana states that chiefs are the overall custodians of the customary land however, the state own the resources underneath or on the surface of the land.
It is in this regard that the government must involve the traditional leaders and other stakeholders and be on the same page in relation to the laws and policy making.
The government should employ ways to enlighten and aid the people involved in this activity to improve their standard of living.
This can be done by educating them on the prices, providing them with well-equipped tools, creating a forum where miners can share their experiences on the financial means of production and processing respectively.
The government can grant university graduates from the mines sector to regulate these activities.
Mining schools in the country with the authorization of the government can establish a consulting firm where the students and graduates can be recruited as monitoring officials instead of the security officials which also helps reduce unemployment in the state.
The government should register the small scale or galamsey business under a well-structured established corporation with norms and values to uphold which will help regulate and manage this activity to ensure an effective and environmentally friendly mining techniques.
It is quite known and asserted that abolishing galamsey is not the best option for the government.
The state can, however, curb the problems by enforcing fixed regulations in the various mining codes with regards to environmental restoration.
For instance, strict rules should be adopted to ensure that miners cover their pits when they finish their operation.
The Municipal Chief Executive for Asante Akyem South, Alexander Frimpong has denied his involvement in illegal mining activities in the area.
The MCE was accused of being complicit in a recent galamsey activity that resulted in the death of one person.
But the MCE in an interview with Citi News denied this claim
“Some persons who were pained and think that I contributed to their defeat are spreading such falsehood.”
The Assembly Member for the area also reiterated that Mr. Frimpong had never been involved in galamsey activities.
Our attention has been drawn to a media release on the subject as indicated above.
The said release is about a collapsed galamsey pit which killed one person at Obroni Junction near Ofoase.The story attributes the galamsey pit as one owned by our Municipal Chief Executive, Hon. Alexander Frimpong and the constituency Youth Organizer, Mr. Simon Agyemang.
We want to state categorically clear that, it is untrue the pit belongs to our Honorable MCE and constituency Youth Organizer.
It’s another attempt by people who are trying all negative means to destroy the reputation of our hardworking MCE and incite His Excellency the president against him.
We want to repeat here that,our MCE is not a galamseyer,he has never engaged in galamsey activities and he will never engage in acts he is helping the president to fight and eliminate. As indicated in previous press release, Hon. Alexander Frimpong is fighting the galamsey menace in the municipality. His hard work and directives has led to the arrest of 3 galamsey operatives who are currently facing trial at the Juaso Circuit Court.
Our investigations has it that the person behind the twisted story is one particular aspirant in the last NPP constituency parliamentary primaries and his cohorts who are also interested in getting their candidate nominated by the president for the position of MCE.
According to the municipal police commander and the Assembly member for the area,the said mining pit is an old pit of about 20years.
The Children had gone there in search of gold as they have occasionally been doing and unfortunately the pit collapsed and in the process killed one of them.
A leading member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sylvester Mensah, has described as lazy and reckless the burning of excavators used for illegal mining in various parts of the country.
He said the excavators can be put to better use, to develop communities and create value for the economy rather than destroy them.
In a Facebook post, the former NHIS head said the current approach smacks of ‘insufficient thinking process’.
The government in a renewed fight against illegal mining across the country especially in forest reserves and on water bodies has deployed hundreds of soldiers to remove illegal miners from different parts of the country.
Reports received so far from the grounds show that as part of the operations of the security officers, they burn excavators and other equipment used in the illegal mining process.
But according to Sylvester Mensah, the government must rethink the approach of burning the excavators.
He said a future NDC government will not burn seized galamsey excavators.
“A future NDC government would not burn seized galamsey excavators. Clearly, it is a lazy and reckless mindset.
Earthmoving equipment can be put to many other important uses, in many communities in this country,” he said.
“Considering this nauseous Bawumia economy with its self-inflicted epileptic power supply, one would have thought that this government, having dispossessed galamsey owners of their equipment, would put them to alternative uses to develop our communities and generate value for the economy…
We are witnessing the manifestation of an insufficient thinking process.”
The Minister for Defence, Dominic Nitiwul in a recent press engagement said in this new phase of the military operation, one wooden accommodation facility, ten plastic chairs, 28 excavators, 18 water pumping machines, eight (8) industry batteries, five canoes and 267 Changheng machines had been destroyed.
The rest are 21 new pumping machines, two (2) industry machines, a KIA Truck, two (2) pump action guns were also seized.
The case of the 33 supposed National Security operatives who were arrested for galamsey activities in the Eastern is getting more intense as the Kaneshie District Court refused jurisdiction to hear the case and grant them bail.
Drama unfolded when the court turned down an invitation to grant bail to 11 of the suspects who appeared before it.
The prosecutor, ASP Sylvester Asare, was in court to secure a remand order to enable the state to gather evidence and make its case against the suspects.
A case of possession of firearms without lawful excuse is being built against them.
But the defence lawyers drew Her Worship, Ama Adomako Kwakye’s attention to Section 192 (2) of the Criminal and Offences Act 1960, Act 29 as amended, which requires the Attorney General’s written consent in such matters before the court can entertain it.
Her Worship Adomako Kwakye, on the basis of the provision, declined to hear the case.
She said the consequence of the provision was that there was neither a case of bail nor remand properly before the court to be heard, and subsequently released the suspects.
But as is the situation in such cases, and was to be expected, all 11 suspects were immediately re-arrested.
According to the prosecution, the 33 accused persons presented themselves as operatives of the National Security set up but in fact, are not.
The suspects have been accused of visiting several mining communities in and around the Eastern and Ashanti Regions to undertake illegal mining activities.
They are said to have threatened residents, demanded and seized unspecified kilos of gold and varying sums of money from certain galamsey operators acting in the name of National Security.
The state submitted that security agencies picked intelligence sometime in January that the accused persons armed with rifles were undertaking illegal mining activities in the name of the National Security and harassing communities around the Eastern Region.
And on May 4, 2021, a team of plain-clothed and uniformed personnel from the National Security Secretariat were dispatched to the Akenteng forest reserve, near Osinease in the Eastern Region where they rescued the accused persons from the clutches of angry youth.
This operation the Prosecution said was supported by officers from the Eastern Regional Police Command.
The accused persons were subsequently transported to Accra for interrogations during which they are said to have admitted that they were not National Security Operatives.
They, however, claimed ownership of the weapons retrieved.
They are also said to have disclosed that they were in the forest to undertake reconnaissance.
The exhibits, according to the prosecution, included a Tudor short gun, pump-action, two shotguns, assault rifles and 10 rounds of ammunition as well as a cougar pistol.
The prosecution said exhibits retrieved from the accused persons include a Tudor shotgun, a pump-action shotgun, assault rifles and 10 rounds of ammunition as well as a cougar pistol.
The team also retrieved from the accused persons 12 Gotta handsets, three handcuffs, four shovels and an electronic shocker.
The Ghana Armed Forces have commenced the second phase of their security operation to fight illegal small-scale mining.
A statement from the Ministry of Information said the exercise, dubbed ‘Operation Halt II’ is aimed at “removing all persons and logistics involved in mining on water bodies”
“The new phase of the operation focuses on the tributaries of the Pra River, which have also been significantly affected by the activities of illegal miners,” the statement added.
The Ghana Armed Forces have also commenced armed patrols of the Pra river.
The operation is being undertaken by four hundred (400) men of all ranks.
Ghanaians have been advised to stay away from mining in water bodies to avoid any action by the forces
As part of recent efforts against illegal mining, 200 military personnel were deployed to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
The directive was based on the suggestions the government received during the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining which took place from April 14 to 15, 2021.
The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II is urging the government to ensure greater involvement of chiefs in the fight against illegal mining.
He says the seeming neglect of chiefs in the fight may have resulted in its failure in the past hence the need to do things differently.
Speaking at the Manhyia Palace after some officials of the Minerals Commissions called on him, the Asantehene says chiefs must be made to play a role in the fight against galamsey.
He said chiefs must also be involved in the process of issuance of mining permits, adding that the failure to get chiefs involved in such processes, forces them to get involved in the illegal mining instead, hence jeopardizing the fight.
“The constitution even says all minerals are vested in the president, but we know that the gold is vested in the soil and the local chief is in charge of the soil.
A stranger can be given a permit to mine on the chief’s land but the maps and licence for mining are given in Accra.
Because the chiefs are not involved, they also join in the galamsey.
If the chief is involved in the process, this will not happen,” he said.
Illegal mining locally referred to as ‘galamsey’, has, over the past few years, dominated national conversations following a major campaign by Citi FM highlighting the devastating effects of the practice.
In 2017, Nana Akufo-Addo declared that he was prepared to put his presidency on the line in the fight against galamsey.
His declaration was amidst new measures such as the deployment of police and military personnel to arrest illegal miners across the country and the introduction of a community mining programme aimed at regulating small-scale mining in communities in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Recently, there have been complaints that the water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.
President Akufo-Addo again made public statements on the development, saying that there is a need for an open discussion on the subject.
The government, through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources, subsequently held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.
As a result of that dialogue, the Lands Minister directed all persons prospecting or carrying out reconnaissance activities in forest reserves to cease within seven days.
The move is said to be one of many to be rolled out as part of efforts to deal with illegal small-scale mining in Ghana.
he fight against galamsey is assuming a wrong turn due to Government’s own past failures in the fight. As a people, we must be worried because the havoc caused by galamsey activities is life-threatening and has the potential to endanger the collective future that we all envisage.
The activities of galamseyers are gradually leading to very serious irredeemable environmental situations which include loss of biodiversity, clean water and pollution of our soil.
It is obvious that the institutional framework for the implementation of small-scale mining laws has completely broken down with corruption taking center stage.
The failure of the Akufo Addo led government to deal with the situation within the last four years shows its weakness and incompetence in dealing with the issue of galamsey.
The just ended Stakeholders dialogue was a confirmation of the failed approach adopted by the Government in the past four years.
We hoped that from the said Conference, new methodologies of dealing with the menace would have emerged for adoption.
Sadly, the Statement issued by the Minister of Information conveying the resolutions of the Stakeholders’ forum as a way of dealing with the menace is a false start.
The statement at best is hollow and lacks clarity as to the direction of these new operations.
The content of the statement suggests Government is involved in the business as usual and does not provide any critical out-of-the-box solution to addressing the challenge.
The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for the umpteenth time, indicated his commitment to fighting the phenomenon of illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
The President reiterated he will do everything in his power in his second term to bring the galamsey menace to a halt in Ghana during a courtesy call on him by Okyehene Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin and the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council.
Prior to the meeting, the government through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources had held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.
In furtherance of the resolutions of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces, to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.
Government seems to be adopting the same failed approach in the fight against galamsey, hence there is no guarantee of improved results. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different result.
Water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.
In July 2017, President Akufo Addo served notice that he was prepared to put his Presidency on the line in his quest to fight illegal mining.
However, considering the state of galamsey today and its devastating effect on the environment including land, rivers, and water bodies, it is clear to all and sundry that the President’s fight against galamsey has failed.
The President, having failed to fight the menace, the honorable thing to do would be for him to resign from office to uphold his integrity.
Dishonorably, we are again treated with a plethora of promises and assurances.
Words they say are cheap.
The President must walk the talk.
This galamsey matter is serious and must be given all the needed attention as a people.
Water is life.
Delivering a speech at the National Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on Wednesday, April 14, 2021, the President said interestingly that although he is determined to enforce the laws on individuals who are caught engaging in ‘Galamsey’, he will not activate them based on mere allegations.
No Ghanaian has said the President should convict persons based on hearsay or lack of evidence.
In any case, the President does not have the power to convict any person in Ghana – only the Courts do.
The President’s position again demonstrates the seeming lack of interest in President Akufo Addo to tackle the galamsey menace head-on and crack down the whip on corruption.
This is in sharp contrast to promises by then Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo Addo, who indicated his readiness to differently fight corruption through, among other things, the introduction of the Anas principle, the mode of investigation used by one of Africa’s ace investigative journalists, Anas Aremeyaw to create a new culture of fear for corrupt practices.
It is therefore not surprising that up to date practically no sanctions have been meted out to Western Regional Secretary of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and former Secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for his role in the galamsey fraud scandal despite corruption allegations against him by Anas Aremayaw Anas, whose principle the President promised to adopt in the fight against corruption.
It is also no wonder that no action has been taken in respect of the missing excavators’ saga.
Till now, no report has been issued by the Operation Vanguard Taskforce to update Ghanaians on their role, challenges, and impact in the fight against illegal mining.
Indeed, some military officers were caught in a Joy News documentary actively engaged in the activity.
Hence, the resolutions and approach by the Government to adopt similar strategies by involving the military in an activity they have already been engaged in shows the lack of ideas and clear direction by the Government in tackling the phenomenon.
For citizens to be fully confident of the Government’s fight against galamsey, Government must report fully to Ghanaians on the activities of the Operation Vanguard Taskforce and indicate to Ghanaians the whereabouts of the missing excavators.
If the Akufo Addo-led Government wants the full support of Ghanaians in the fight against galamsey, there must be transparent and accountable and be willing to fully disclose who the interest holders are in all these galamsey sites.
Government must be clear on the sanctions it intends to impose on perpetrators as the present state of galamsey operations contravenes citizens’ rights to life, health, environment, and the principles of inter-generational equity. Furthermore, galamsey activities violate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Mere orders to the military will not address this challenge as many of the officers themselves are complicit in the fight against illegal mining, without any known administrative actions and sanctions against them.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tamale North constituency in the Northern Region, Alhassan Suhuyini. is sceptical about the government’s renewed fight against illegal mining in Ghana.
According to him, the government’s renewed commitment to tackling the menace is “structured to fail”.
His comments come on the back of the recent deployment of 200 military personnel to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
A statement from the Information Ministry said, “In furtherance of the resolution of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on April 14 to April 15, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.”
“The operation commenced at 0600 hours on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions of Ghana.
Two Hundred (200) officers of the Ghana Armed Forces are involved in the operation,” the statement added.
Speaking on Citi TV‘s Breakfast Daily show on Thursday, April 29, 2021, the Tamale North legislator said the government should have supported the regional and district security services to deal with the menace, rather than deploying military men to the mining sites.
“I think this new approach to fighting galamsey, with the deployment of the military, is structured to fail.
I think the approach should use the regional security councils, the district security councils, and then when they require backup you give them the backup.”
“Let them deal with their operational needs, and then you [government] support from the centre [to help them] carry out these activities.
This approach will give better results than repeating what we have always done in the past.
I think that the president should have learnt some very good useful lessons from the first fight since he himself has admitted that the last four years has been a failure, given the amount of money that we have thrown at this fight.”
The Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Samuel Jinapor, has said the fight against illegal mining, locally known as “galamsey”, is at a crossroads.
He is, however, hopeful the fight will be won.
According to him, a lot of policies and programmes have been rolled out to tackle the menace in a more sustainable way.
Speaking at a meeting with Regional Ministers at the Jubilee House, Mr. Jinapor said the government will not renege on the fight against illegal mining in the country.
“Given all that has happened so far with respect to the issues to do with small-scale mining, we are now at a crossroads. In other words, we have had a Consultative National Dialogue and have put in some arrangements to regulate small-scale mining and end the issue of galamsey once and for all in the interest of the nation.”
The government recently renewed its commitment to fight illegal mining at a National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, where stakeholders charged the government to take steps to strictly apply the country’s mining laws.
This has led to many actions being taken in that regard.
The government ordered persons undertaking prospecting activities in forest reserves across the country to indefinitely suspend such activities.
It also directed the Minerals Commission to desist from processing or granting any request for the renewal of prospecting licenses in forest reserves.
“The Minister for Lands and Natural Resources hereby directs persons and/or companies engaged in reconnaissance and/or prospecting in Forest Reserves, with or without legal authorization, to suspend such activities until further notice…
The Minister for Lands and Natural Resources has further directed the Minerals Commission, with immediate effect, not to accept, process and/or recommend the grant, including the renewal and/or extension, of reconnaissance and prospecting licenses in Forest Reserves,” a statement from the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry said.
The Minister of Information, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, says government will soon roll out a sustainability programme on the deployment of soldiers to flush out illegal miners operating in the country’s water bodies.
According to him, this measure is meant to help the government deal with illegal mining issues conclusively.
200 military personnel were deployed on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
The Ghana Armed Forces took this decision based on a directive given it by the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
A statement from the Information Ministry said the operation commenced on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions.
“In furtherance of the resolution of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on April 14 to April 15, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.”
“The operation commenced at 0600 hours on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions of Ghana.
Two Hundred (200) officers of the Ghana Armed Forces are involved in the operation.”
Mr. Oppong Nkrumah in a subsequent interview with Citi News said all persons mining in the forest reserves will be flushed out.
“The Ministry of Defense and the Ghana Armed Forces would roll out in detail what the sustainability plan is to ensure that this time we get a lot more results even beyond what we got for the first time.
The forest reserves are no-go areas for mining.
It’s not about legal or illegal.
That is why the president has authorised this operation of the Ghana Armed Forces to remove all persons and logistics that are being used for mining, and they are starting on the River Pra.”
A former Minister of Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Inusah Fuseini, says President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo could create a lasting legacy by ending illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
According to him, the current generation and future ones will applaud him if he is able to end the menace.
The former Tamale Central legislator’s comments come on the back of recent statements by the president, reiterating his commitment to fighting galamsey..
President Akufo-Addo said he will do everything in his power to bring the menace to an end in his second term, which ends in January 2025.
He noted that major rivers such as the Birim and Ankobrah have been polluted due to the activities of illegal small-scale miners and, as such, he will put more effort into the fight to ensure that future generations are not deprived of the water, mineral and natural resources currently being threatened by galamsey.
“We’ve seen what has happened to River Birim, Ankobrah, and other major water bodies.
I’ll put a lot of effort into the galamsey fight for Ghanaians to know that I’m serious about the fight so that we can bequeath to the next generation the gold, water, and other resources we inherited from our forefathers.
I intend to do everything within my power in this second term to bring this galamsey menace to a conclusion in Ghana,” he stated.
Mr. Fuseini has challenged the president to walk the talk by ending the menace in order to help secure Ghana’s future.
“There is more to it than words.
It is the action that is required, but I agree with the president and challenge him to put in more effort because he has said all the right things.
Ghana’s ecosystem has taken us a long time to get it where it is and we cannot just watch on and allow a few miscreants to destroy it for their personal gain.
Our ancestors knew [about] the gold that we have but they never prospected for gold in water bodies, and they never also destroy the forest cover for gold.
They rather handed to us – this generation – an ecosystem that we were proud of and that we could even beat our chest and say that we are the largest producers of cocoa.
This is what they handed over to us, what are we handing over to the next generation?”
“We cannot allow these greedy people to destroy it for us.
We cannot and we must not. The president must act and act now.
Mr. President, if you can’t create any legacy at all, the lasting legacy will be to mitigate the harmful effects of illegal small-scale mining in this country by banning such activities.
If you so do, not only this generation but generations yet unborn will applaud you for it.”
Mr. Inusah Fuseini made the call on Citi FM/TV‘s weekend current affairs programme, The Big Issue on Saturday, April 24, 2021.
The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has, for the umpteenth time, indicated his commitment to fighting the phenomenon of illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
He said he will do everything within his power to bring the menace to an end in his second term, which ends in January 2025.
Nana Akufo-Addo said this when the Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin and other leaders of the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council paid a courtesy call on him at the Jubilee House on Friday, April 23, 2021.
He noted that major rivers such as the Birim and Ankobrah have been polluted due to the activities of illegal small-scale miners and as such, he will put in a lot of effort into the fight to ensure that future generations are not deprived of the water, mineral and natural resources currently being threatened by galamsey.

The entire cocoa industry in Ghana is at risk of collapse if the European Union (EU) carries out its threat of banning the country from its market.
This is according to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), Joseph Boahen Aidoo.
It follows threats from the EU that it will ban cocoa from Ghana if the negative impact of illegal mining on the country’s environment persists.
Mr. Boahen Aidoo, in an interview with Citi News, called on all stakeholders to help curb illegal mining in a bid to avert the collapse of the cocoa industry.
“This is a major issue because Europe takes about 80 percent of our cocoa exports.
Should they ban or impose restrictions on us, it will be very difficult for us to sell our cocoa.
As a nation, we need to take a position on this and fight these illegal mining activities together devoid of politics”, he said.
Currently, Ghana exports 80 percent of its cocoa to the European Union.
However, the Union is threatening the ban cocoa from Ghana because areas shown in satellite images to have been forest areas in the 70s and 80s in Ghana have all experienced land degradation in recent times.
Stakeholders in the agricultural value chain have expressed fears about the impact of the development on Ghana’s cocoa sector.
Already, the Deputy Chief Executive in-Charge of Agronomy and Quality Control at COCOBOD, Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh has called for immediate action to be taken to avert the possible sanctions.
“As we speak, EU is threatening to ban Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, to impose legislative instrument restrictions on the importation of cocoa from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to their courts.”
“When you take the satellite images, you will see some places in red. The EU thinks that all those places are red because cocoa is causing land degradation [in Ghana], meanwhile, it is as a result of the galamsey activities”, he added.
In January 2021, the Union announced that it will contribute €25 million to enhance the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cocoa production in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Cameroon who are, respectively, the first, second and fifth-biggest cocoa producers, generating almost 70% of the world’s total production.
This funding is to strengthen the partnership between Team Europe (composed of the EU, its Member States, and European financial institutions) and the three cocoa-producing countries and aims at ensuring a decent living income for farmers, halting deforestation and eliminating child labour.
The European Union (EU) is threatening to ban cocoa from Ghana if the negative impact of illegal mining on the country’s environment persists.
Making a presentation at the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining in Accra today, April 15, 2021, the Deputy Chief Executive in-Charge of Agronomy and Quality Control at COCOBOD, Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh, expressed fears about the impact of the development on Ghana’s cocoa sector.
Currently, Ghana exports 80 percent of its cocoa to the European Union.
Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh believes immediate action must be taken to avert the possible sanctions.
“As we speak, EU is threatening to ban Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, to impose legislative instrument restrictions on the importation of cocoa from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to their courts.”
He said the EU is taking this course of action because areas shown in satellite images to have been forested in the 70s and 80s in Ghana, have all experienced land degradation in the decades since.
“When you take the satellite images, you will see some places in red. The EU thinks that all those places are red because cocoa is causing land degradation [in Ghana], meanwhile, it is as a result of the galamsey activities.”
He further raised concerns about the devastating effects of the galamsey activities on the production of cocoa in Ghana and its exportation.
“The impact of these mining activities on cocoa production is enormous.
There is crop loss, reduction of crop yield and income, loss of vegetation, the fertility of the crop soil is destroyed and [there’s also] an early dropping of immature pods as a result of the chemicals that they use,” he lamented.
In January 2021, the European Union announced that it will contribute €25 million to enhance the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cocoa production in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Cameroon who are, respectively, the first, second and fifth-biggest cocoa producers, generating almost 70% of the world’s total production.

The Member of Parliament (MP) for Ningo-Prampram, Mr. Sam Nartey George, has urged President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to stop the rhetoric and hit the ground running in the galamsey fight.
In his view, President Akufo-Addo is only paying lip service to the fight against illegal small-scale mining, locally known as galamsey, instead of fighting it head-on.
According to him, the president is only giving Ghanaians nice “soundbites rather than real action”.
The Ningo-Prampram lawmaker insisted that those behind the menace are either government appointees or person aligned to the governing New Patriotic Party and thus urged the President to crack the whip to serve as a deterrent to others.
“Mr. President, it is your party national executives and regional executives, your party people, your presidential staffers, your former ministers who are engaged in the galamsey menace.
They are the people carrying out small-scale mining and destroying our water bodies. So Mr. President, put your money where your mouth is. If you want to fight galamsey, deal with your own appointees. Stop giving us soundbites and give us real action.”
“The truth is that Mr. President, it is your party people who are doing the galamsey.
Nobody in the NDC is engaged in it because we don’t control the security agencies that are protecting these illegal miners. We don’t manufacture excavators in this country, they all come through the port.
So who is giving permits for those excavators to be imported?
If the government is really committed to fighting the menace, can’t the government place a ban on the importation of all excavators?”
Mr. Sam George made the call on Citi TV‘s Breakfast Daily programme on Thursday, April 15, 2021.
His comments come on the back of the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue, a forum the President is hopeful will come out with a better roadmap for dealing with galamsey activities once and for all.
“Out of this maiden consultative dialogue, I hope we will build a national consensus around a national policy on small scale mining, that promotes a responsible, viable, environmentally sustainable small-scale mining industry, which has discarded the use of mercury, ‘changfangs’ and excavators, which has barred the involvement of foreign nationals, and which has rejected the destruction of our forests, environment and water bodies,” President Akufo-Addo said.
Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Samuel Abu Jinapor wants stiffer punishment for politicians, chiefs and kingpins behind illegal mining in Ghana.
Mr. Jinapor says dealing with such persons will go a long way to help the fight against illegal mining.
Speaking at the opening of a national dialogue on illegal mining in Ghana, Samuel Abu Jinapor said a lot more stringent actions must be taken to deal with the menace.
“How do we name, shame and punish politicians, chiefs, religious leaders and people with money and influence who are promoters of this criminal cartel in this industry?”
Another key question the minister was interested in was: “what kind of enforcement regime is required which bites and does so without fear or favour?”
The National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, which will end today, April 15, 2021, is expected to come out with a communiqué on the solution to the illegal mining menace.
The forum has been a two-day roundtable discussion on challenges confronting the small-scale mining sector.
It has had inputs from key mining experts, the Small-Scale Mining Association, the Coalition of Civil Society Against Illegal Small-Scale Mining, among others.
Some stakeholders at the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining have proposed the strict enforcement of mining laws as one of the solutions to the many problems in that sector.
Environmental group A Rocha Ghana has warned that the Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC) push for bauxite exploration will open doors to illegal mining.
Though the corporation has pledged to ensure safe mining activities, A Rocha feels the illegal activities will be beyond its control.
“The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators,” A Rocha said in a statement.
“The illegal mining and logging you see today will flourish in the protected area once GIADEC facilitates access for illegal actors,” it added.
A Rocha stressed that mining in in the Atewa forest “will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide over time”.
It urged GIADEC to follow in the footsteps of aluminium companies that have agreed not to use raw materials sourced from the Atewa Forest.
Members of the International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN) on November 4, 2020, voted to adopt Motion 103 calling for “Urgent measures to safeguard the globally important Atewa Forest in Ghana”.
“If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off-limits to bauxite mining,” A Rocha said.
The Atewa Forest is a Key Biodiversity Area teeming with thousands of animal species and a source of clean drinking water for more than 5 million Ghanaians.
A Rocha Ghana has read the statements made by GIADEC during a meeting with journalists and published on Monday 5 April and is responding to key points raised.
GIADEC said it rejects as ‘propaganda’ an apparent claim that the whole of Atewa Forest will be destroyed by bauxite mining.
It says the area it will be ‘playing’ with – a surprising term to use for an activity that will cause so much damage to livelihoods, species, habitats, and clean water – is about 10% or less over 50 years, and would mine 5 million tonnes of bauxite in that time.
To be clear, civil society’s concerns are over the location proposed for bauxite mining – that is, the mountain tops – as this is within Atewa’s legally protected area and is also the most critical for biodiversity and clean water. Loss of the forest and habitats here would be irreversible and would also cause wider damage to the integrity and ecosystem service provision of a much greater area of forest around it.
But GIADEC seems to completely miss this point.
Bauxite mining in Atewa Forest, no matter how small, will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide overtime.
Atewa is a critical forest ecosystem, it is not to be ‘played’ with.
The statement said that participants were briefed on a baseline biodiversity study of the proposed mining area as part of documenting the area’s life forms.
But this is unnecessary. Several research documents both recent and old have already been published of the species found in Atewa Forest including the proposed mining area.
These reports show that Atewa Forest contains many endangered and endemic species that would be threatened with extinction if bauxite mining goes ahead. Instead of another biodiversity report, an independent Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (ESIA) is what is urgently needed to document how mining will impact on the forest, species, habitats, ecosystem services, livelihoods and access to clean water.
An ESIA is supposed to form part of any decision-making process over whether or not a development action should go ahead, but this has not been done.
GIADEC’s statements did claim that reclamation plans have been proposed as well as draft report produced.
Are these documents publicly available and how can civil society access them for independent examination and validation?
Private sector investors are also urged caution. The IUCN’s Resolution 087 passed in November 2020 urging protection of the Atewa Forest and which received overwhelmingly support, “STRONGLY REQUESTS” all companies in the mining sector not to participate in any mining activities in or near Atewa Forest and all companies using aluminium to ensure that no aluminium from Atewa Forest enters their supply chains”.
The Concerned Citizens of Atewa Landscape (CCAL) have made it very clear that they do not want mining companies entering their forests and destroying their resources, livelihoods, and clean water sources.
Civil society supports their stand and urges caution to any private sector company interested in mining bauxite in the Atewa Forest.
A number of aluminium user companies have already stated their objections to aluminium produced with bauxite from Atewa.
If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off limits to bauxite mining.
GIADEC has done one good thing, though, by raising the issue of illegal mining and forest destruction in Atewa Forest, stating we will one day “get up and find that there is no forest at all”.
Civil society has also made this point countless times over the years.
The destruction of state gazetted forests by illegal activities should be the concern of any state agency that has the wellbeing of Ghanaians at its centre.
Citizens should not have to fight our government agencies to ensure that we benefit from the judicious and sustainable use of our natural resources. Or is the government and its agencies deliberately allowing the forest to be decimated by illegal actors, to serve as justification for mining it? A typical case of “give the dog a bad name so you can hang it”? (while communities continue to suffer the impacts?)
The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators.
The illegal mining and logging you see today will flourish in the protected area once GIADEC facilitate access for illegal actors.
There are currently several non-extractive uses for forests such as Atewa Forest that have significant prospects of harnessing green investments that will offer quality green jobs and ensure wellbeing for all.
We urge GIADEC to work with us to explore these green investments for the benefits of Ghanaians today and tomorrow.
The Ghana Water Company Limited in the Eastern Region says activities of illegal small scale miners, popularly referred to as galamsey, continue to hinder water operations.
Currently, the water company is rationing water in most parts of the region and has on numerous occasions shut down water treatment plants at Osino, Bunso, and Kyebi as a result of activities of illegal miners.
As Ghana joins the rest of the world today to commemorate World Water Day, the Eastern Regional Public Relations Officer of the Ghana Water Company Limited, Kwadwo Daase hopes that there is a lasting solution to the galamsey menace which affects its operations.
“The challenge with production and supply of water for us on World Water Day is the raw water source that is the rivers and water bodies which serve as the raw materials for us and our concern for years is the impact of illegal mining or galamsey on these water bodies.
Anytime we are celebrating World Water Day, we wish that we don’t talk about this menace which is still persisting in areas like Osino, Busum etc.
Our plant there has to be suspended several times.”
He however called on residents to bear with the water company as it continues with its water demand schedules.
“The water supply cannot meet the demand in Koforidua, Somanya, Odumasi areas, etc. The advent of COVID-19 and the need for people to use water has increased the demand for water.
We have stretched our plants to the elastic limit so we only have to deal with the only little we have, that is why we are trying to put in this water demand management schedule; whereby we supply this area for two or three days, and we revert to the other side of town which is really helping. There were complaints all over that two or three weeks we are not getting water and when we started this the people are appreciating it. ”
In January 2021, Mr Kwadwo Daase called on the government to streamline the activities of the illegal miners and some road contractors which was affecting water supply.
The GWCL had to shut down the Kyebi treatment plant due to high turbidity as a result of the activities of illegal miners operating along the Birim River.
The Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation-designate, Dr. Kwaku Afriyie, has targetted the regulation of excavators as a measure to tackle illegal mining.
Speaking during his vetting, Dr. Afriyie cited the introduction of heavy earth moving equipment to small scale mining in 1989 as the day “Ghana’s environmental problems begun.”
He thus said Ghana must regulate excavators “severely.”
To address the problem, Dr. Afriyie suggested that excavators be accounted for and banned.
“We should have a census of excavators in this country, and we should even consider a temporary ban on them.”
Decommission some of them, sell some of them off and then put a ban on some of them and by attrition get the numbers that we can use for small scale mining,” he added further.
The nominee also said the danger posed by chanfans which are used to wash minerals in water bodies should also be banned.
“We should criminalise the unlicensed manufacture of washing plants because you know that washing plant is going to be used to do galamsey in water bodies.”
In addition, he said the current generation of Ghanaians was not entitled to all the mineral resources thus, the overall act of mining should be regulated.
“We should have a law that based on the available resources we have, perhaps no more than 50 square km should be mined at any point in time just like we regulate frequency moderation in this country.”
He hopes to implement these suggestions, should he take office.
Dr. Afiyie said the threat of illegal mining “will be severely assuaged and this country will be the better for it”.
The Ghana Armed Forces says it has commenced investigations into allegations some of its personnel are protecting illegal mining operations.
Recent media reports suggest that some members of the Ghana Armed forces are complicit in illegal mining activities though the military forms an integral part of the anti-illegal mining taskforce.
In a statement signed by the Director of Public Affairs for the Ghana Armed Forces, Colonel Aggrey Quashie, the Military command says it does not condone such acts and will appropriately sanction any of its personnel complicit in the illegal practice.
“The Ghana Armed Forces has taken notice of media reports alleging that some of its personnel have been involved in providing security for illegal mining operations.
The Ghana Armed Forces take such allegations seriously as it does not condone such wrongdoing if true.”
“Accordingly, a full-scale investigation has commenced into the allegations and appropriate sanctions to be handed out to any person or persons found out.
The Ghana Armed forces also assure the general public of its unflinching commitment to the national course,” it added.
In March 2020, the government officially withdraw the military component of its anti-illegal mining taskforce, Operation Vanguard, from the field.
Operation Vanguard started as a Military-Police Joint Task Force set up in 2017 to combat the operations of illegal miners in Ghana.
But taskforce’s operations have been marred by controversy amid allegations of corruption.
In one instance, three soldiers of the task force were investigated for allegedly trying to extort money from illegal miners in the Wassa Akropong area in the Western Region.
The Concerned Small Scale Miners Association has welcomed President Akufo Addo’s call for an open stakeholder discussion on illegal small-scale mining popularly known as galamsey.
The Association says the move is a step in the right direction since all attempts to use security forces to clamp down on the activity has failed to yield the desired results.
The President of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Association, Michael Kojo Peprah in a Citi News interview said President Akufo-Addo’s call vindicates the association on their earlier stance that the deployment of military personnel to clamp down on the illegal activity will not yield any result.
He said the government must bring together all stakeholders and receive their inputs on how best to tackle the phenomenon.
“They should understand that, in the beginning, we told them that all these things about bringing the military will not help. In 1989, they brought the military it failed, 2000, 2012 it all failed. So when do we always do the same things and expect a different result?
What they have come to realize is that what we were saying is true. They should extend their hand, and we will all come and all the expertise and solutions we have, we will put it on paper and help mother Ghana, so the country will benefit from mining,” he said.
President Akufo-Addo in delivering the last State of the Nation address in his first term on Tuesday, January 5, 2021, said it’s about time the government, traditional leaders and various stakeholders in the mining industry discuss the impact of illegal mining on the country devoid of politics.
“There is one subject…I believe we the people need to have an open conversation, and that is the phenomenon of galamsey.
Should we allow or not allow galamsey?” President Akufo-Addo said.
“We have to talk about galamsey. We who are leaders owe it to the country to take the subject out of the party political area and have an honest conversation about this menace to our future,” he added.
A former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Bantama constituency and the Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Henry Kokofu has called on the flagbearer of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama to stop politicising galamsey issues in the country.
Mr. Mahama has promised to retrieve all confiscated excavators and concessions belonging to small scale miners in the country if he wins the 2020 elections.
According to him, President Akufo-Addo has failed in his promise to fix the problems facing small-scale miners in Ghana.
But Mr. Kokofu believes the NDC flagbearer should be blamed for all the challenges the country is facing in dealing with the menace.
The EPA Executive Director insisted that the activities of the illegal miners heightened during the former President’s tenure.
“I don’t understand the basis for the hypocrisy about the galamsey fight from NDC because it was under their tenure that the activities of galamsay heightened in this country; from 2011, 2012, up to 2014 and leading to 2016.”
“…But for me, it is not about apportioning blame.
We as a nation through President Akufo-Addo have decided to fight this and that is where the focus should be.
We shouldn’t focus on the propaganda gimmicks going around saying he will give back the seized excavators.
So he should stop this propaganda he is doing.”
He made these comments when he appeared on the news review segment of Citi TV’s Breakfast Daily on Thursday, October 22, 2020.
In a related issue, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh has debunked claims that the government has sold a number of the excavators that were seized at the height of the war against illegal mining in Ghana
According to the sector minister, such claims by the NDC that some excavators are missing, sold and stolen do not hold water.
“The number we have is 157 at Adentan, Obuasi, and Tarkwa.
The number that I have provided are numbers that are on site.
The place is not walled, they can go and check. The claim by NDC that 500 excavators are missing, sold, and stolen is neither here nor there.”
Mr. Asomah-Cheremeh further challenged any individual who has proof of the said allegations, to produce evidence to authenticate the said transactions.
“I stood at the Prestea-Huni valley area in February and told journalists that the government or the ministry has not done any such thing, but the accusations persist.
Whoever thinks otherwise should come forward with better particulars,” he dared.
Hundreds of angry miners have vowed not to leave the concession of the Ghana Rubber Estate Limited (GREL) near Adiewoso in the Western Region.
The miners openly resisted moves by uniformed personnel in the Operation Vanguard team to forcefully eject them from the concession.
According to them, they are operating legal community mines and will not leave the site, swearing not to end their operations there since that is their only source of livelihood.
Superintendent Douglas Kumi, the officer commanding for Operation Vanguard in the Western Region said their intention was to invite the leadership of the miners to engage with them on their operations and ascertain if their activities were legal.
He said they are disappointed in the leadership over their inability to control the miners in their conduct hence the security personnel will go back to their station, reorganize themselves and return to the site.
“Looking at the numbers and the situation, we will withdraw and get organized again.”
“We cannot arrest all the people and therefore we have also not inspected their documents to know whether what they are doing is legal or illegal.
We came with the intention of taking the leadership, sit down with them and know their background…
But the leadership has proven to me this morning that they will not be able to control the people and if that is so, as police we will go back and reorganize,” he said.
One of the miners who spoke to Citi News said their operations are not illegal.
“This is the community mining project for Ahanta West. This morning, police came here to drive us away. We are not doing this without permission.
Look at the number of people doing this work, this is not illegal, we are not thieves.
The government paid for our education at the University for Mines and Technology (UMAT) and opened this community mining project for us.
Our chiefs engaged the government for us to begin this project. We’ve done nothing wrong,” he said.
The Ghana Rubber Estates Limited, GREL, last week lamented over the illegal occupation of its lands by what it said was politically induced galamsey.
The company said the development threatens their investment of about £550,000.
The natural rubber producers who in 2018 with the support of the One-District-One-Factory begun expansion of its production by 25,000 tons per annum.
“The forcible take-over of GREL lands by several communities for Galamsey activities is an act of illegality that has to be condemned and the instigators or perpetrators brought to book.
This illegal invasion of GREL lands will certainly affect directly the raw material base needed for the two factories and also defeats the purpose of the support GREL had from the One District One Factory Initiative for the construction of the 1st Phase of its new rubber processing factory,” the company said in a statement.
Meanwhile, reacting to the development, the Corporate Affairs Manager of GREL, Perry Acheampong, reacting to the allegations by the galamseyers that they have permits to operate Community Mines after the Operation Vanguard failed to halt their operations said the have not permitted any such activity in their concession.
“Ghana Rubbber Estate Limited has 50-year lease to operate and has not given out any part of our concession in the area for Community Mines.
In fact, we complained about the galamsey activities in our concession to the assembly which they told us they would investigate.
If the government at any point approach as they want to to have a portion of our concession for such activity, we are ready to have a discussion on it but what is going on there is illegal since we haven’t given out any part.”
“The forcible take-over of GREL lands by several communities for Galamsey activities is an act of illegality that has to be condemned and the instigators or perpetrators brought to book.
This illegal invasion of GREL lands will certainly affect directly the raw material base needed for the two factories and also defeats the purpose of the support GREL had from the One District
One Factory Initiative for the construction of the 1st Phase of its new rubber processing factory.
It also puts at risk Ghana Rubber Estates Limited since the availability of land is very key to its existence, hence, without the availability of land for its nucleus plantation GREL will not be able to operate…
The activity if not stopped could affect an estimated area of 350 acre part of GREL Estate Division 3 located near Adeiwoso on the Apimenim-Elubo Highway. The area was planted with rubber in 1960’s and GREL recultivated it with rubber again in 2010.
The investment done by GREL from 2010 to date is about £550,000 which could be lost if they are not stopped.
GREL could also lose 3.5million of revenue over the next 30 years if that area is destroyed.”
Social commentator Sidney Casely-Hayford has described the government’s reported plans to use drones to fight illegal small mining after restructuring Operation Vanguard as a waste of time.
Speaking on The Big Issue, Mr. Casely-Hayford said he thought it was “a brain-dead solution” and that such a plan “will die before it is even born.”
“This a waste of time. It is not the answer to the problem,” he added.
These reported plans accompanied reports that the government will from March 2020 withdraw the military component of its anti-illegal mining taskforce, Operation Vanguard, from the field.
To continue effective monitoring of the sector, Citi News sources said the government was going to rely on mining guards and 144 drone pilots who are under the Nation Builders Corps.
But Mr. Casely-Hayford remarked that such plans have not been thought through.
“I think that we have not sat down to critically decide how we want to resolve this problem [of illegal mining],” he said.
He reiterated that whatever plan the government came up with must focus “on guaranteeing the cleanliness of the water bodies.”
“As to how somebody the ground and gets it, give them the regulations.
If you dig and don’t find any gold or dig up as much gold as you want, leave the place in the condition you found it.”
Findings by some lecturers in the Political Science Department of the University of Ghana cited the fight against illegal mining as the second most disliked government policy.
As part of this policy, over 200 drones were procured by the government to assist its fight against illegal smal scale mining across the country.
The drones are used to take live images in districts where the practice is rampant.
Recent trainees underwent training in how to operate the drones at the George Grant University of Mines and Technology at Tarkwa in the Western Region.
The withdrawals of the soldiers was also a reminder for some that observers had described such an approach as unsustainable.
The failings of the military over the years started with the late 1980s where the first recorded nationwide operation against illegal mining was undertaken after the passage of the Small Scale Mining Law, PNDCL 218, 1989.
Another military operation took place in November 2006 named “Operation Flush Out” and was noted for allegations of human rights abuses.
In 2013 the government sanctioned a security operation under the banner of an “Inter-Ministerial Taskforce” which made use of military personnel.
The Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) is shocked that the Office of the Special Prosecutor declined to probe acts of corruption hampering the fight against illegal mining in the country.
ASEPA had petitioned the office to probe the mining sector and ensure the enforcement of small scale mining laws with a focus on the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining and the anti-illegal mining task force, Operation Vanguard following the disappearance of hundreds of excavators seized from illegal miners.
But the Office in a response to the petition indicated that the matter presented does not raise questionable issues in terms of corruption to warrant its attention.
Reacting to the latest development on Eyewitness News, Executive Director of ASEPA, Mensah Thompson disclosed that his outfit will resort to the law courts to get the Special Prosecutor to conduct the necessary inquiry into the matter.
“I am very much disappointed at the response of the office of the Special Prosecutor.
The response smacks of some inconsistencies and dishonesty in the way the Special Prosecutor responded.
Our next line of action is to refer the matter to our lawyers.
We have a meeting coming up to consider what will be the issues in terms of the law.
We want to assure the good people of Ghana that this matter has not ended yet because we are determined to get to the bottom of the matter.
We will look at local remedies available to us including International Union on the Conservation of Nature and other international bodies that deal with the protection of the environment.
These are serious matters that we do not have to joke with,” said Mr. Thompson.
The letter signed by the Special Prosecutor, Martin Amidu explained that the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had already launched a full-scale investigation into the matter.
The Special Prosecutor in the letter said the CID is in a better position to handle the issue.
“A review of your letter of complaint, however, has led this Office to the conclusion that the facts and conjects upon which underpin your complaint do not raise any issues of corruption and corruption-related offences as narrowly defined under section 79 of office of the Special Prosecutor Act, 2017 (Act 959) to warrant any investigations by this Office,” Martin Amidu added in the letter.
ASEPA had said recent allegations of corruption in the fight against illegal mining “show that the whole fight against illegal mining was a sham and a plot to get licensed small scale miners out of business so that some elements in the government can take over small scale mining in the country.”
The group further held that the allegations “border on offences such as stealing, bribery, corruption, abuse of public office for private gain and other serious offences” which fall under the purview of the Special Prosecutor.
So far, six persons have been arrested in connection with the missing excavators and since granted bail.
The six, include the suspended First Vice Chairman of the New Patriotic Party in the Central Region, Ekow Ewusi, who was also heard in an audio recording with the Environment, Science and Technology Minister, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng discussing the prospect of mining on some concessions.
The Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng has denied allegations that his son, Jojo Frimpong-Boateng is involved in mining in Ghana’s forest reserves.
He indicated that such allegations are untrue.
Prof. Frimpong-Boateng issued the disclaimer in an interview with journalists on Thursday after the President’s State of the Nation Address.
Prof. Frimpong-Boateng told journalists that “he [his son] is not involved in anything and the world will get to know soon.”
There were some reports that a company linked to the son of Prof. Frimpong-Boateng, Jojo Frimpong Boateng, was involved in illegal mining.
The reports were trumpeted by some members of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) as well as the Assin Central legislator, Kennedy Agyapong.
Kennedy Agyapong had alleged that some mining excavators seized by the government from alleged illegal miners had been given to Jojo Frimpong-Boateng through Ekow Ewusi who is currently being held by police over the disappearance of seized excavators.
Speaking on his Net2 television, Kennedy Agyapong said, “How can you seize people’s excavators for illegal mining and turn around to give it your son for his mining activities?”
The Minister in the interview also denied any involvement in alleged corruption in the fight against illegal mining.
“Everything that I have done in this world is for Ghanaians.
I have not done anything for myself. Look at me; I have not taken bribes before.
I have not extorted money from anybody before. I have not done anything wrong before,” he said.
There have been calls for him to resign or be axed during the aftermath of revelations about the disappearance of hundreds of excavators seized from illegal miners.
The Ranking Member on the Mines and Energy Committee of Parliament, Adam Mutawakilu, even called for his arrest.
However, the Minister remained resolute when queried on the matter insisting that the state will get to the bottom of the controversy.
All seized mining excavators that have gone missing will soon be found.
This is according to Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation.
According to him, the country’s security agencies are following up on the issue closely and will soon bring it to its logical conclusion.
The sector minister who has come under serious attack from a section of the public over his inability to account for all the equipment seized from illegal miners said he is confident that every stolen equipment will be found.
He told journalists on Thursday that “every excavator that has been stolen will be found…
I don’t want to overstep what the security people are doing so let us be patient. You will get the facts pretty soon.”
It was revealed that the excavators seized by Operation Vanguard from illegal miners and some small scale mining companies which flouted the ban on small scale mining had gone missing.
There were allegations that some top members of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) were involved in illegal mining and they had appropriated some of the excavators to themselves despite the public campaign against the practice.
The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) had said that the government’s ban on small scale mining was only a “smokescreen” to kick out other miners and allow persons aligned to the NPP space to mine clandestinely whilst the ban was still in force.
Jojo Frimpong-Boateng, son of the Minister is amongst those accused of being involved in illegal mining and using a missing excavator for the act in some of the country’s forest reserves.
But the Minister said the allegation against his son is false.
“He [Jojo Frimpong-Boateng] is not involved in anything and the world will get to know soon,” the Minister said.
Meanwhile, the suspended First Vice-Chairman of the NPP in the Central Region, Horace Ekow Ewusi who has become the centre of the controversial issue of the missing equipment has been captured in a viral video allegedly claiming that he together with the NPP General Secretary, Boadu were tasked by the sector minister to use the seized excavators to mine in various concessions.
The money raised from these activities, Mr. Ewusi alleged would help fund the political activities of the NPP.
John Boadu subsequently denied the allegation.
Prof. Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng had petitioned the Criminal Investigations Department of the Ghana Police Service to investigate Horace Ekow Ewusi over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.
Ekow Ewusi was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping.
So far, six persons arrested over the disappearance of the missing equipment have been granted bail.
President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has renewed his commitment to tackling the issue of illegal small scale mining popularly referred to as ‘galamsey’ in the country.
Delivering the State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Thursday, the President indicated that government still stands by its position to use all available means to address the galamsey menace which continues to destroy large portions of the country’s vegetation cover and water resources.
This comes at a time when many have taken on the government for what they consider as government’s failure to deal with the menace as promised in the run-up to the 2016 general elections.
While commending the efforts of the media coalition against galamsey and the Inter-ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining, Nana Addo mentioned that he will ensure that no one in government neglects his or her responsibility in the fight to protect Ghana’s environment.
“When we came into office in January 2017, galamsey activities were rampant in many parts of the country. Our lands, forests and river bodies were being systematically degraded and destroyed without any care and this had been the case for several years.
The previous NDC government had given up the fight against galamsey but we determined that this was an intolerable situation and we owed it to generations unborn to tackle the problem and save our environment.
I was therefore not under any illusion about the size and scope of the problem that we are taking on.”
“I was cheered by the support of the large population that recognized the dangers posed by the degradation of our lands and water bodies and the needless deaths of many young people who were buried alive in makeshift mining pits. Mr. Speaker, the threat posed to the future of our country by galamsey is grave.
We cannot shirk our responsibility in the fight against galamsey. Government will not weaken its stance and welcomes the continued support of the media coalition.
The Inter-ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining has been working very hard and has some successes.”
The governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) says the fight against illegal mining popularly known as “galamsey” should be depoliticized.
The menace according to the party, affects all and thus a collective effort is needed to tackle it.
This appeal comes on the back of accusation by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) that the government has failed to deal with illegal mining; a situation that is adversely affecting the country.
Director of Communications for the NPP, Yaw Buaben Asamoa said all hands must be on deck to end galamsey.
“We are aware that, the allegations of the missing excavators have brought the issue of galamsey to the fore.
Happily, the matter has been referred to the police.
We expect institutions of enforcement to be bold about it.
Ideally, we would have wished the NDC leadership will deal with us rather than engage in petty politics that divide us.
We believe that this should have been bi-partisan so that we deal with it in the context of challenges that face all of us and in a better way.
Typical of the NDC, they have reduced this whole thing into three things – blame the president, scream loudly that the solution is not working and seek for the vote of the people without any alternative.”
In the past week, the NDC has described the government’s fight against galamsey as a failure because of several actions by government appointees and the issue of missing seized equipment.
But the NPP, on the other hand, has absolved itself from any wrongdoing insisting the fight against the menace is in full force.
Already, various bodies have called on the government to provide details on the progress or otherwise made on the fight against galamsey, with the NDC, demanding for a public exhibition of the seized excavators.
There has been so much talk about the fight against illegal mining in the last few months.
This is partly because of how concerted the effort to rid the country of the menace was.
Then, in recent weeks, how apparent it seems now that the battle against illegal mining has been lost.
In light of the above, we need to do some introspection of how the crusade against illegal small scale mining began, take a look at some of the gains made and how things started falling apart three years down the line.
This is necessary because it will put things in perspective.
It is also very necessary because the first gentleman’s job is on the line.
In 2016, Citi FM spearheaded the crusade against illegal small scale mining.
At the time, major water bodies in the Western, Ashanti and Eastern regions that supplied water to over ten million residents in these areas were heavily polluted.
The Ankobra, Offin and Birim rivers were the focal points.
The Ghana Water Company warned of dire consequences at the time.
The Company that treats water and distributes to our homes said if the situation was not addressed by stakeholders, the near future would be calamitous for the country.
It warned at the time that Ghana may be resorting to the importation of water in the next two decades if the problem was not addressed. Because of the turbidity of the water bodies mentioned, its production plants had to work extra to purify water for domestic consumption and most of the river bodies were drying up or being polluted beyond redemption.
This generated considerable discussion in the country, compelling government to institute some measures.
Government eventually placed a ban on all forms of small scale mining in May 2017.
It set up the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM). IMCIM is made up of ten ministries including the Lands and Natural Resources, Defence, Interior, Local Government and Rural Development, Regional Re-organization, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Monitoring and Evaluation, Information, Sanitation & Water Resources, and Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) as chair for the committee.
A military and police team christened Operation Vanguard was subsequently commissioned by the IMCIM with four operating bases in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western and Central regions.
Their mandate was to flush out all illegal miners and enforce the ban on all forms of small scale illegal mining.
Their mandate was to streamline the activities of Operation Vanguard and the small scale mining licensing regimes.
A year after its inauguration in 2018, it vetted and issued licenses to over 600 miners to go back to work.
In 2017, the Chief Justice also designated seven (7) High Courts and Seven (7) Circuit Courts located in Accra, Sekondi, Kumasi, Cape Coast, Koforidua, Sunyani and Bolgatanga to deal with all mining offences committed under the Minerals and Mining Act, (Act 703). Indeed, Parliament also amended the Minerals and Mining Act, to prescribe harsher punishments for offenders.
Mandated State institutions like the Forestry Commission and the Minerals Commission were strengthened to enforce the laws on small scale mining.
The IMCIM also acquired technologies like Galamstop, an App that integrated activities of all regulatory bodies in the fight against illegal mining.
The ban on all forms of small scale mining was partially lifted in December 2018 a year after its enforcement.
It saw over 600 miners vetted and cleared to go back to mine in an environmentally friendly manner.
The vetting had begun a month earlier, thus November 2018.
Let me take you through some of the rudiments these miners went through before they were given the permits to mine again.
All registered small-scale miners whose licenses were operational as at April 1, 2017, were to submit all relevant documentation to the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) Secretariat, before Friday, September 7, 2018.
The documents they are expected to present include Mining License, Environmental Permit, Operating Permit, Certificate of Registration, Tax Identification Number, two copies of passport size photos, Birth Certificate, Passport or Voter’s ID and current contact details.
Miners who sailed through the vetting were cleared eventually return to their sites.
Another group GalamSTOP Taskforce was commissioned by IMCIM on 29th September, 2019 to augment activities of Operation Vanguard.
This parallel force has been questioned as its role has not been properly clarified.
The IMCIM Secretariat also procured drones to monitor activities of illegal miners, especially in the forest reserves.
My checks with the IMCIM indicate that a total of 144 drone pilots from the Nation’s Builders Corps, were trained. 10 of the trainees were assigned to IMCIM, 18 for Operation Vanguard and 15 for the Minerals Commission.
It also acquired speed boats to aid Operation Vanguard to flush out illegal miners operating along water bodies.
As of 2019, Operation Vanguard had arrested about 2,000 illegal Miners with Chinese and Ghanaians being the worst culprits.
At the peak of the campaign, there were reported cases of water bodies returning to their natural states.
The government also introduced the community mining project in 2019, to streamline mining for interested indigenes in mining areas.
On the back of these gains, the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, scored their achievement at 70 percent.
Gains have been made but there are some major setbacks militating against the Stop Galamsey fight.
The secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for instance, was implicated in a documentary allegedly taking a bribe to aid the issuance of mining license
He has since stepped down from his role as Secretary to the Committee.
He was cleared of the allegations by the Criminal Investigations Department.
But the Special Prosecutor arm of the investigations is still ongoing albeit slow.
There have been allegations of bribery and extortion against members of Operation Vanguard.
This is seriously affecting their operations.
Forestry Commission officials have also stated on record that some powerful politicians are behind the illegal small scale mining enterprise, making it practically difficult for them to enforce the law.
The slow pace of prosecution of arrested illegal miners is also worsening matters.
The latest in the twist of events, is the case of the missing excavators.
The Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), Prof. Frimpong Boateng alleged that some seized excavators have gone missing.
During the peak of the crusade between 2017 and 2019, about five hundred excavators were seized from illegal miners.
They were to be kept in the custody of the police by law.
In Ghana’s mining laws all seized or confiscated item should be supervised by state security agencies like the police, military or immigration.
Reports of the disappearance of the excavators and the subsequent arrest of an official of IMCIM, who is also the suspended Central regional NPP vice-chairman, Horace Ekow Ewusi and six others beg for answers.
Another mind-boggling announcement by the small scale miners was that the ounces of gold seized by IMCIM at the period are also missing.
These are serious allegations President Akufo-Addo must investigate if he really meant putting his job on the line. Mind you the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) is directly under the Presidency.
As a mining reporter who has followed and reported on mining issues, I now understand why many at the time said the formation of the IMCIM was counter-productive.
From all indications, it has been.
Its Secretary, Charles Bissue has been implicated for allegedly taking bribes.
He is still being investigated by the Office of the Special Prosecutor.
Its Chairman, Professor Frimpong Boateng has also been caught on tape in a conversation that seems to suggest he had and his party sought to privately profit from the confiscation of the excavators to fund their political party’s activities.
That is scandalous, to say the least.
The cost of an excavator ranges between 270,000 USD and 320,000 USD.
It costs between GHS2,200 and GHS2,700 to rent an excavator for a day (that’s 8 hours).
How could they have done this?
How do we salvage the already damaged reputation of IMCIM?
It does not need any salvaging; it must be completely dissolved.
Its Chairman should have been fired or made to resign by now.
The Minerals Commission can do a better job.
There are laws that regulate the small scale mining space.
The Minerals Commission is now decentralised.
It has regional and district offices.
The recent addition is the Regional office in Tamale.
It has added four new mining district offices in addition to the existing nine and opened eight new satellite offices.
It has also recently recruited 71 people and 220 Mining wardens to assist the Commission.
While this may not be enough, there is clearly some capacity at the Minerals Commission and with their institutional understanding of the mining space, they are better placed to take over from the IMCIM.
After the dissolution of IMCIM, innovations like Galamstop, the drones and the numerous vehicles should be given to the Minerals Commission to bolster their resources and strengthen their hand to enable them do a superior job.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamale North, Alhassan Suhuyini has urged the President to account for all items seized in the fight against illegal mining.
Already, various bodies have called on the government to provide details on the progress or otherwise made on the fight against galamsey, with the National Democratic Congress (NDC), demanding for a public exhibition of the seized excavators.
Alhassan Suhuyini, on the Floor of Parliament on Tuesday, said: “His Excellency the President who boldly put his Presidency on the line to demonstrate how much this course meant to him, if for nothing at all, Mr. Speaker, has his Presidency to save and it will be important that he starts by accounting for and to the people of Ghana all equipment, vehicles, weapons, ammunition and gold which were seized and kept by officers he commissioned to help end illegal mining and if necessary, penalize all who have proven to be negligent or complicit in what may have gone wrong.”
He also urged the House to probe the amount of money released for the fight against illegal mining and whether it was used for the right purpose.
“Mr. Speaker, in the face of what is clearly less than a successful campaign, I suggest humbly that your Parliament also shows more interest in how funds approved for this exercise to the various institutions have truly be expended and the results attained.
Because these are funds belonging to the people whose interest we in all humility represent,” he added.
The NDC has asked the government to account for all excavators and ammunition seized during the Stop Galamsey Campaign.
According to the Communications Director of the party, Sammy Gyamfi, the government had seized 900 excavators during the campaign.
He cited figures in the 2020 budget presented in Parliament to support his claim.
Addressing a press conference on the banks of River Pra at Twifo Praso in the Central Region on Sunday, Mr. Gyamfi challenged the government to make a public presentation on the state of the items.
A former Minister for Environment, Science and Technology under the erstwhile Mahama administration, Akwasi Oppong Fosu, has called for an intensive investigation into the missing excavators case.
Mr. Fosu in an interview said an intensive investigation into the matter will bring some finality to the issue.
The Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council has also thrown its weight behind calls for Akufo-Addo to take a keen interest in the alleged missing excavators and gold saga.
The latest call comes on the back of a similar one made by the Concerned Small Scale Miners.
In an interview with Citi News, General Secretary of the Council, Rev. Emmanuel T. Barrigah said the Council expects that people found culpable in the ongoing investigations will be dealt with.
Meanwhile, the Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) has petitioned the Office of the Special Prosecutor to investigate alleged corruption in the enforcement of small scale mining laws.
ASEPA wants the Inter-Ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining and the anti-illegal mining task force, Operation Vanguard, to be the focus of the probe by the Special Prosecutor.
In the petition, it highlighted the need for “full investigations into the misappropriation of seized items such as excavators, mining equipment, gold and weapons by the IMCIM through the fight against illegal mining.”
The missing excavators brouhaha began when Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that some of the excavators which were seized from illegal miners between 2017 and 2018 had vanished.
Some members of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Association subsequently revealed that they knew the whereabouts of the missing excavators, with claims that they were being used for galamsey in parts of the country.
The suspended NPP Central Regional Vice Chairman, Ekow Ewusi who was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping was then seen as a suspect to the case.
A letter sighted by Citi News revealed that Prof. Frimpong-Boateng wrote a letter to the Police CID to investigate him over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.
The Ghana Water Company Limited in the Ashanti Region has warned that its treatment plant at Odaso could soon be shut down if urgent measures are not taken to prevent illegal miners from polluting the Odaso River.
According to the Ashanti Regional water Quality Assurance Manager, Alhaji Adam Yakubu, the state of the Odaso treatment plant keeps worsening by the day as a result of galamsey activities in the area.
He further added that the Owabi treatment plant is also being threatened as a result of the activities of private encroachers.
He believes designating the area as a security zone will help resolve the matter.
“The catchment area is being encroached by private developers and as a result of the activities of these private developers, the Owabi dam has silted to a level that the depth which used to be 22.5ft has now reduced to 6ft and if we don’t take time, the Owabi dam will be completely silted and that could have serious ramifications for the people of Kumasi,” Alhaji Yakubu said.
The Ghana Water Company Limited, a few months ago began rationing water supply to Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis and the Effia-Kwesimintsim Municipality.
This was due to the onset of the dry season which has resulted in the inadequate water supply to the treatment plant at Inchaban.
The ongoing water rationing in the Western Region according to GWCL officials is likely to be prolonged.
According to them, this has drastically reduced their production volumes from a peak of 4.5 million gallons per day to 2.3 million gallons.
The Production Manager at the Western Regional office of GWCL, Vincent Opoku Ware Darko, in an interview with Citi News on the sidelines of a desilting exercise at the Daboase treatment plant a few days ago said the situation might worsen if measures are not adopted to curb the activities of illegal miners.
“The weather itself has an effect on the volume of water we can draw.
We are in the dry season and in this season, we have a lot of evaporation because the weather is very dry so most of the water is taken out.
And then, we have this galamsey issue where we have a lot of silt at the intake site and with this galamsey activity ongoing, it brings a lot of silt that they deposit at our intake.
So we need to take these silts out so we can produce a lot of water,” he said.
Continuous illegal mining activities in the Wassa East District and beyond, which have resulted in the pollution the Pra River, is having a devastating effect on nearby communities.
The Shama District might not have galamsey activities ongoing along the Pra River, but the hidden operations of illegal gold miners around Daboase in the Wassa East District and beyond have resulted in the brownish colour of the Pra River, posing a danger to communities who depend on the river for water.
In the Shama District alone, there are over six communities along the River Pra which have been affected greatly by the pollution from galamsey, including the Bosomdo community.
These communities do not have any choice but to use the heavily polluted water from the Pra.
Citi News’ Akwasi Agyei Annim, who visited some of the communities, reported that these challenged communities are without health centres or even CHPS compounds.
One of the residents noted: “Because of the galamsey, we can’t do anything about [the Pra River] It is dirty and so bad.
Sometimes you have to put alum inside before you can cook with it.
It is the only source of water here.
We use it to cook or wash dishes.
We can’t bath with it or wash our clothes because it is salty.
We are hoping the government will give us boreholes,” one woman pleaded.
The caretaker chief of Shama Bosomdo also added that: “Some people recently drank the water and had diarrhoea because of its poor quality.
They cannot live without drinking water so they have no choice.
We buy sachet water from Beposo, which at times we don’t get a steady supply of.
So we plead with the government to come to the mercy of the Bosomdo and Krobo communities.”
Some fishermen complained about the negative impact the state of the river is having on their businesses.
“We don’t get enough catch when we go fishing because of the galamsey which has destroyed the water.
Our nets only catch mud when we throw them in so our fishing business has been destroyed and we don’t know what to do now.”
The effects of the pollution of the Pra River, which has affected water supply, go beyond businesses to even education.
The Bosomdo D/A Primary School’s kindergarten is facing a severe shortage of teachers due to the water supply problem, while Primaries one to six, which under normal circumstances, must have a minimum of six teachers, have only four teachers including the headmaster as most teachers are unwilling to stay in the community.
Despite all these potential health risks associated with the use of polluted water from the Pra, the community, just like its neighbours, has no health centre to deal with disease outbreaks.
The Shama District Director of Health, Alfred Osei-Assibey, reacting to the concerns of communities along the river, revealed that skin infections and water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea, are on the rise in the communities.
“In the last three years, skin diseases have increased dramatically.
From the 5,000 cases we recorded in 2017, now we are recording over 10,000 cases of skin infections.
The diarrhoea cases have also risen from 6th in 2017 and now its number 3,” he said.
The Shama District Assembly, which is responsible for the provision of quality water for its residents, says it is aware of water the problems.
The National Farmers and Fishermen Association has warned of the devastating effect on Ghana’s cocoa industry if measures are not put in place to end illegal mining.
The Association insisted that the practice of turning cocoa farms into mining concessions is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
President of the Association, Davis Narh Korboe speaking at a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House said the practice is unfavourable to the growth of the cocoa industry.
“For instance, cocoa farms are being cut down every now and then and what we are saying is that in as much as people want to make money from mining, then concession, we should look at prime cocoa and exclude them from these mining activities so that our farmers can really produce,” he said.
Some Ghanaians have already given up on the fight against galamsey saying that the fight has been lost.
The leader of the Special Team set up by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal mining to monitor, investigate, evacuate and arrest persons involved in illegal mining, Nana Yaw Boadu, had earlier stated that the team will expeditiously investigate and make sure that everyone involved in illegal mining is brought to book as it probes the issue of the missing excavators.
According to him, the issue will be treated as very important and no cover-up will be entertained.
“Now what we plan on doing is that we are not going to entertain any cover-up again.
We are going with a camera to the site.
So, when we enter the site, the camera will monitor everything.
We want Ghanaians to know whatever is happening at the mining site.
So, when you are doing the right thing, Ghanaians will know.
When you are not too, they will know,” he said.
The suspended New Patriotic Party (NPP) Central Regional Vice Chairman, Horace Ekow Ewusi was earlier arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of some excavators seized from illegal miners in the country.
It will be recalled that at the peak of the fight against illegal mining between 2017 and 2018, about 500 earth-moving machines were seized by the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry.
The then sector Minister, John Peter Amewu who sanctioned the seizure directed them to be parked at the premises of the various Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs).
Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology & Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that most of the excavators that were seized from illegal miners had vanished.
The Concerned Small Scale Miners Association subsequently told the Minister that they knew where the missing excavators were.
Ekow Ewusi was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping.
The Convener of the Media Coalition Against Illegal Mining, Ken Ashigbey, has described the country’s justice delivery system as a weak link in relation to the fight against illegal mining.
His comments come in the wake of the arrest of some individuals over some missing excavators and other seized equipment from illegal miners in the country.
Speaking on the Point of View on Wednesday, he called on the government to bring all cases related to the missing excavators to the capital, Accra to be prosecuted so the utmost focus can be given to the case.
“It [the judiciary] has been one of the weakest links.
Before this excavator issue came, it was the weakest link because the last time I heard the Operation Vanguard commander talking, he was talking about 5% convictions. All of us have been complaining about it.
I remember the Media Coalition petitioned in the situation in which Chinese were arrested and then prosecuted in a circuit court in Tarkwa. And these are foreigners.
So even before the law was amended, the sanction for them was not GH¢2,400 fines.
It was more than that if you were just going to do fines.
I remember speaking to one of the Supreme Court judges and his suggestion was the fact that to really deal with this issue, let’s bring every case, these galamsey cases to Accra, have the focus on it and prosecute them here. Because once you get them into these places all kinds of things happen.
You would not have the situation where goats and things will change hands,” he said.
Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that some of the excavators which were seized from illegal miners between 2017 and 2018 had vanished.
Some members of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Association subsequently revealed that they knew the whereabouts of the missing excavators, with claims that they were being used for galamsey in parts of the country.
Ekow Ewusi who was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping was then seen as a suspect to the case.
A letter sighted by Citi News revealed that Prof. Frimpong-Boateng wrote a letter to the Police CID to investigate him over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.
Five other individuals who are believed to be accomplices of Mr. Ewusi were also arrested with him.
They are Frederick Ewusi, Joel Asamoah, Adam Haruna, Frank Gyan and John Arhin.
They have however been granted bail and expected to report to the Criminal Investigations Department later on Wednesday 5th February 2020.
Mr Ashigbey had earlier blasted the government for failing to devise stringent measures to ensure the safety of excavators that were seized by operatives of Operation Vanguard.
Speaking to Citi News‘ Umaru Sanda Amadu, Mr. Ashigbey wondered whether these seized excavators which were reportedly carted to designated areas for safekeeping were monitored by police officers.
Mr. Ashigbey indicated that these excavators would not have gone missing if the government had put in place the necessary measures to ensure their safety.
Meanwhile, he has also asked President Akufo-Addo to dismiss Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) whose areas, small scale illegal mining activities continue to take place unabated.
According to him, this should be part of measures to deal with the upsurge of illegal mining in the country.
He indicated that beyond empowering state institutions, officials who are at the helm of affairs at the various districts must be held responsible for the menace.
A former Minerals Commission Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Tony Aubynn, says the fight against illegal mining in the last few years has clearly been lost.
“Have water bodies become clean? No. Have people stopped mining without the requisite licenses? No. It has even gone underground,” he remarked on Eyewitness News.
According to Dr. Aubynn, the metrics of success are clear when judging the compliance with the law and the state of the water bodies.
“You define all these things and the answer is obvious. We haven’t succeeded,” the former Minerals Commission’s boss stated.
Dr. Aubynn was on his way out of the Minerals Commission, in 2017, just as the fight against illegal mining was kicking into gear.
But at that time, he was confident that illegal small-scale mining, popularly known as galamsey, had stopped in the country following the intense media campaign and government action.
Under him, the government interdicted nine district mining officers of the Minerals Commission who were asked to proceed on indefinite leave, in May 2017.
The nine officers supervised mining activities in nine mining districts and were found to be negligent.
The Lands and Natural resources Minister at the time, John Peter Amewu, said they were negligent, as they allowed illegal mining to continue in their respective areas.
The Minerals Commission acts as the main promotional and regulatory body for the minerals sector in Ghana and is responsible for the regulation and management of the utilisation of the mineral resources of Ghana and the coordination and implementation of policies relating to mining.
Currently, the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) has warned that it will be forced to halt the production and supply of water if illegal small scale mining is not stopped.
The Western Regional Chief Manager of GWCL, Francis Agyei-Boateng, said rationing of water around this time each year has become more acute because of illegal mining.
Most of Ghana’s freshwater bodies have been heavily polluted with thousands of acres of fertile farmlands also destroyed as a result of the illegal mining.
Ghana was recently scored as 41% and ranked 80th country with the highest Corruption Perception by Transparency International, a body which measures annually the level of corruption in about 180 countries worldwide.
After reading portions of the report, I was stuck between smiling or crying, either way, it was not pleasant what I read.
A move from the 40% mark of last year as a perception of corruption in Ghana continuous to grow.
What this simply means is that the perception we have about corruption and its related activities in Ghana has not changed but getting worse.
Now I guess you understand my dilemma.
I kept asking myself, are we doing better as a country or we are perhaps at our ‘saturation’ level when it comes to corruption as a country?
Irrespective of how I pondered about these questions, I arrived at a simple answer, probably not the answer I wanted, but it was perhaps the closest truth I could tell my wandering mind- we are not winning the fight against corruption.
I have read about a profound statement by a revered statesman when it comes to corruption.
Former President J.A Kufuor is reported to have said ‘‘Corruption is as old as Adam’’.
A statement I tend to agree with except the connotation it carries.
Perhaps not what he meant to communicate as he will later clarify, but the baggage it conveys leaves me with no option than to steer away from it completely.
Corruption has stayed with us from generations and its impact on our lives have been dire.
Corruption at any level should not be tolerated but that seems not the case in the system we live in.
Greasing of palms and handing down cash or kind has gained notoriety in our politics, our public and civil services, our judiciary, our education system and virtually every aspect of our lives.
The consequences of widespread corruption have a horrible effect on our country’s development. Ghana’s developmental agenda has delayed partly because of corruption over the years.
Imagine monies meant for development syphoned by greedy public and civil servants through contracts and as a result, a community lacking basic social amenity such as water.
Consider corruption activities bleeding our country of taxes at our Ministries, Agencies and Departments meant for development?
It is therefore not surprising the premium that is placed on the fight against corruption by the various political parties in their campaigns over the years, except to say that, they have failed abysmally at dealing with the canker.
Government after the other since 1992 has promised to deal ruthlessly with corruption but the result after the promises leave much to be desired.
The setting-up of the Office of Special Prosecutor (OSP) by the NPP led Government was considered as a game-changer in the nation’s fight against the menace, but three years into its existence, little has been seen.
The man put in charge of that office was an honourable, effective and efficient man, but that perhaps was when he was a private citizen.
Maybe we should have left him as a ‘citizen vigilante’, by now we will have recovered the ‘Woyome’ money and many others.
This by no means seeks to ridicule the office, maybe we will be reaping the fruits soon, but three years of ‘no show’, leaves me worried.
Perhaps the political chess game we play with the fight against bribery, exploitation and sleaze in our political and public services has not helped.
Corruption fight is a non-negotiable matter in the interest of our country.
But this is not an act only politicians and people in high authority engage in, private citizens and individuals are equal culprits when it comes to corruption.
Remember, ‘the giver and the taker’ are both guilty?
We have perhaps become numb as a people to the corruption that we are willing to pay each time even without request.
Our national consciousness about corruption fight seem narrow and therefore need to be deepened.
Our understanding of what constitutes corruption is blurred hence our pride in the act.
Lest I deviate, the war against illegal mining is rearing its ugly head again, our water bodies are turning brown, water treatment plants are about shutting down.
The ongoing illegal mining activities, popularly known as ‘galamsey’ affirms my position that maybe we have become numb to corruption or we are willing to be complicit in it.
The long-held notion that ‘when the last tree dies, the last man dies’ has perhaps become an over flogged cliché that doesn’t strike to the core anymore.
The media coalition against ‘galamsey’ along with government, fought the canker to some extent but the battle is far from over.
The fight against ‘galamsey’ is imperative that needs no apathetic approach.
We are losing our forest cover and losing our water bodies as well.
A recent publication about water shortage hitting part of the central region, Cape Coast to be specific struck me to the core.
The publication suggests that the activities of illegal mining are leaving the water treatment plant in the region with no option than to ration water which in the long run will lead to a total shut-down.
According to a report by JoyNews Central regional correspondent, ‘‘the Sekyere-Hermang water treatment plant is chocked with turgid water’’.
I ask then, are we losing the fight against ‘galamsey’ too? I hope not.
Because, ‘when the last water dries, the last man dies too’.
It is perhaps overstretched, but I likened the effect of galamsey on corruption.
They are both cancerous tissues that need to be dealt with, but we seem to be losing both fights.
President Akufo-Addo led administration ‘tried’ fighting the menace but it seems ‘galamsey’ is rather fighting it.
Bodies such as GalamStop, Inter-Ministerial body, and other operations were launched to fight against corruption but none so far appears to have helped completely.
The approach helped to some extent but our water bodies are still at the mercies of the cruel individuals who are bent on making money at the expense of the national good.
Some of the bodies set up to fight ‘galamsey’ have allegedly degenerated into extortion bodies, taking kickbacks and bribes at the expense of our country.
While citizens are complicit in these acts as their role in fronting for foreign nationals smacks in the face for good citizenship, these multi-million ventures are sponsored by people in authority and well to do in society- people who have no good intentions for Ghana.
Many other approaches adopted to fight the canker continue to leave me in the dark as they have not been fruitful to the level worthy of praise.
The adoption of technology in the fight was announced in 2018 but we seem to have gone to bed after the declaration just like others. While we have good intention is solving our problems, we never follow through to the needed result.
Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Mr Asomah-Cheremeh stated in September 2019 that, the government has achieved 85% success rate in the fight against ‘‘galamsey’’.
While no evidence was given to substantiate this claim, I have no reason to doubt except to say, our rivers are still brown, indicating there is ‘galamsey’ still on-going.
The Mineral and Mining Law has been amended with 15years minimum and 25years Maximum sentences, as well as 10,000 and 15,000 penalty units to ensure stiffer punishment but the recalcitrant are still doing it, perhaps with a planned cabal.
At the Meet-The-Press by the Lands and Natural resource minister, mining contributed $1.3 billion in 2019 as revenue, creating over 26,425 jobs by the large scale mining firms.
The potential at the mining industry remains a viable one which when harnessed properly and through the legal channel will add a substantial amount to our revenue basket. But at no point should ‘galamsey’ be regularized since the result on the nation will be a disaster.
The fight against the twin-canker ‘corruption and galamsey’, that continue to obliterate our nation, need a concerted effort from us all.
The importance of water and forest reserve can never be underestimated and thus should be guarded with all our might.
Galamsey and Corruption have an awful consequence on our country’s development and the earlier we deal with them with all seriousness, the best it will be for generations yet unborn.
Dealing with corruption should be high on the agenda, teaching and practising integrity with rewards should be promoted and be seen at the fore-front in our education and religious institutions.
Appropriate punishment should be encouraged and applied impartially.
While the wheel of justice perhaps grinds slowly, fast-tracking cases of illegal mining, prosecuting and securing convictions could serve as a deterrent to the many who may want to engage in the illegal act.
We shouldn’t continue to sit detached and watch our natural resource blessings turn into a curse.
Water is life, let’s not sit on the fence about the effect of ‘galamsey.’
God bless our homeland and make her great and strong.
It appears the about 500 excavators seized during the intense crusade against illegal small scale mining between 2017 and 2018, are not missing as alleged by the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Professor Frimpong Boateng.
Members of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Union of Ghana say they know the whereabouts of the earth moving machines.
President of the Union, Richard Kojo Peprah speaking to Citi News said some of their members traced their excavators to various illegal mining sites in parts of the country.
“We were able to find some of these machines in Tamale. Some of these machines had tracking devices.
So we are able to trace them.
When they take the machine in the Ashanti region then, they send it to the Northern region.
They are engaged in one activity or the other.
Some are even engaged in galamsey”.
The chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Professor Frimpong Boateng disclosed last week that most of the seized excavators are missing.
The minister is quoted as saying that “though the excavators were seized and taken to the district assemblies, the heavy-duty machines disappeared later from the premises of the assemblies”.
The Media Coalition against Illegal Mining and Occupy Ghana subsequently demanded from government explanations for the supposed disappearance of some excavators.
According to the two organisations, the authorities responsible for ensuring sanity within the mining sector have failed to enforce the law.
Convenor of the Media Coalition against Galamsey, Ken Ashigbey said persons behind the disappearance should be named to ensure they are sanctioned.
“If we don’t ensure that the laws that we have, are working, then the impunity will continue.
How come some of the excavators cannot be found?
It is also important that we know which public officers or individuals are responsible for this.
That is something that we need answers for,” he said.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal mining was set up to oversee the implementation of the ban on all forms of small scale mining and also see to the vetting of small scale miners.
It was commissioned in March 2017 by President Akufo-Addo to reform artisanal and small-scale mining in the country.
It’s chaired by the minister of Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation (MESTI), Professor Frimpong Boateng.
The Forestry Commission says unseen powerful persons are behind the resurgence of illegal mining in some forest reserves in the country.
One of such affected forest is the Bekwai Forest Reserve in the Amansie Central District in the Ashanti Region, where illegal miners have destroyed about seven hectares of land.
The Bekwai District Manager of the Forestry Commission, Rexford Twum-Damoah, told journalists that the situation is getting out of hand as the illegal miners sometimes enjoy military protection.
He said the illegal miners often refer to the powerful people as their bosses hence carry out the destructive activity with impunity.
Many forests across the country have been under threat of the activities of illegal miners who destroy tree cover and pollute water bodies in their quest to mine gold.
Citi News‘ Jonas Nyabor in a report on how illegal mining is wiping out Ghana’s forests in 2019 found that several hectares of fertile forestlands across the country have been destroyed due to the activities of illegal miners, especially within the last decade.
The Desiri, Kutukrom, Kobro, Oda, Jimira, Atewa, and Tano-Offin forests in the Ahafo, Western, Ashanti, Eastern regions have all suffered from the illegality.
Many rivers, including the Birim River in the Eastern Region and other water bodies, that take their source from these forests have as a result been left heavily polluted, depriving residents in nearby communities of a source of freshwater and putting at risk the lives of over five million other people in major cities in the south whose potable water are sourced from the forests.
In the report, it was found that although the forestry commission makes some arrest and ensures prosecution of persons who mine illegally in forest reserves, some of those who cause the worst destructions are able to escape prosecution or sometimes arrest due to the influence of powerful people in society.
An Accra High Court says Nii Amanoo Dodoo, the Receiver of the now-defunct uniBank, can testify in the trial of Dr. Kwabena Duffuor, founder of the bank, and other officials.
Mr. Dodoo was to be called as the State’s first witness in the trial, but lawyers for Dr. Duffuor prayed the court not to allow Mr. Dodoo to testify.
Dr. Duffuor’s lawyers argued that the Receiver had breached sections of the Banks and Specialized Deposit Act, 2016 hence their objection.
According to the lawyers, the presence of the first Prosecution Witness, Nii Dodoo does not qualify him to testify because he was appointed Receiver of uniBank after being a partner of KPMG which audited the accounts of the bank.
Mrs Yvonne Attakora Obuobisa, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), opposed the objection.
She admitted that Nii Dodoo was previously a partner of KPMG, indicating that KPMG did not hold any shares in uniBank neither did it hold any key position in uniBank.
The Director of Public Prosecution argued that KPMG had not violated any rule or statute and that the appointment of Nii Dodoo was from a private sector and was legitimate.
“The fact that he has worked with KPMG does not prevent Bank of Ghana from appointing him as receiver of uniBank,” he added.
Mrs Obuobisa said his appointment as the Receiver was lawful, urging the court to dismiss the objection since the witness met the requirement for qualifying to testify.
Justice Bright Mensah, Court of Appeal Judge, sitting as an additional High Court Judge, said, ” I uphold the argument of DPP that the appointment was not illegal or void.
The appointment of Nii Dodoo by BoG is valid.”
He said Section 59 of the Evidence Act explained who was not qualified to testify, which included someone who was incapable of coherent expression so as to be understood, directly or through interpretation by another person who could understand that person; or incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.
Justice Mensah said he held the view that, the witness was qualified to testify and had personal knowledge of what was at hand.
“The appointment of the Receiver was valid,” he added.
He, however, said the Counsel for A1, A2 and A4 had impressed upon the court that, the evidence, he would give would be tainted with illegality because he was incapable to testify on those reports.
The Judge said that the argument was simplistic and that it could not be said that the method would be tainted with invalidity.
“The challenge of his validity should be a civil matter and that the witness is a competent and comparable witness,” the Court of Appeal Judge said.
The court, therefore asked the Receiver to take the oath and proceed to testify.
Dr. Kwabena Duffuor and 8 others are facing a total of 71 charges for various roles they played in what led to the collapse of some financial institutions.
The Ghana Association of Bankers says it largely welcomes the Bank of Ghana’s directives to banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to stop a number of fees and charges slapped on customers for some services rendered.
The Association is however unhappy with the instruction for the financial institutions to stop deducting maintenance charges on savings accounts.
Speaking to Citi News, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Association, John Awuah, justified the charges on savings accounts, explaining that some savings accounts are technically operated like current accounts.
“The target is not even the banking industry. It has to do with other participants in the financial system.
It is, for this reason, we support largely, not entirely, the cancellation of some charges.
We need to treat the customers fairly.”‘
“Savings accounts are not meant for daily withdrawals.
But, we see people link their MoMo wallets to it, use ATMs for withdrawing money from the account, etc.
This makes the accounts lose their character. What the banks are saying is that, in cases where customers use accounts designated for investments as current accounts, they are to be levied accordingly.
To that extent, we have a bit of a challenge,” he explained.
The Central Bank in a statement on Friday, June 18, 2021, directed banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to desist from implementing seven different fees and charges, and also stop engaging in some practices that do not auger well for the banking sector.
The fees and charges, and practices which are identified by the central bank as unfair include, Credit Insurance Premium Overcharges, Maintenance Fees on Savings Account, among others, Over the Counter (OTC) Withdrawal Charges as well as the requirement by some banks for borrowers to make them part owners in some assets they present for use as collateral for loans.
A Banking consultant, Dr. Akwasi Atuahene, has urged the Bank of Ghana to take action against financial institutions that fail to implement these new directives.
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) on Friday, June 18, 2021, directed Banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions in the country to stop charging unfair fees and charges.
Among other things, the central bank also ordered the financial institutions to stop unlawful practices that do not auger well for the financial sector.
“These practices are deemed to be unfair, inappropriate, and detrimental to the financial inclusion agenda and the protection of customers’ interest,” a statement from the BoG said.
The unfair charges, according to the Bank of Ghana, include, credit insurance premium overcharges, maintenance fees on savings accounts, over the counter withdrawal charges, among others.
Below are the seven unfair charges and fees, and the clear directives the BoG gave on them going forward:
As part of credit underwriting policies, a number of banks and SDIs require borrowers to hold credit insurance against eventualities such as death, permanent disability, and termination of employment.
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the importance of this practice as a loss mitigating norm in credit management, a number of banks and SDIs take advantage, to overprice the premiums charged to customers, resulting in the increased cost of borrowing.
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from premium overcharges and to adhere strictly to the following:
Banks and SDIs that opt to use their pre-determined insurance companies to underwrite borrowers’ loans, shall apply the same premium charged by the underwriting company to borrowers.
Banks and SDIs are not permitted to retain insurance premiums collected from customers with the intention of implementing an internal insurance policy.
This excludes commissions for Bancassurance arrangements.
The application of “Account Maintenance Fees” by banks and SDIs on savings accounts inhibits deposit mobilisation and discourages the use of banking systems by the public.
Bank of Ghana has noted that the application of such fees has driven a number of savings accounts into debt and, in so doing, eroded the deposits of vulnerable depositors who would generally expect their savings accounts to earn interest.
This practice is detrimental to financial inclusion and negates the gains of the financial literacy programmes geared towards promoting personal savings.
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs impose penal charges on customers who withdraw their own funds from banking halls of affected banks and SDIs.
The reason commonly attributed to this practice is to encourage customers to use digital platforms provided by the banks/SDIs for such withdrawals, in order to decongest banking halls.
These digital platforms are however not offered for free.
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the support of banks and SDIs in the digitization agenda, this action deters some customers, especially those who are averse to the use of digital platforms, from opening and operating accounts.
The practice also negatively affects the financial inclusion drive of the Bank of Ghana.
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from levying penalties on customers who withdraw their own funds below certain thresholds from the banking halls.
In addition, banks and SDIs shall not levy penalties against customers who request account balances within banking halls.
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs require borrowers who secure credit facilities with movable assets, to transfer ownership of such assets into the joint names of the borrower and the bank or SDI involved.
In addition, borrowers are made to bear the cost associated with the transfer prior to loan approval and after the settlement of the loan.
This practice of some banks and SDIs is contrary to section 7 of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052) which does not permit a security interest to operate as a transfer of title from a borrower to a lender.
The practice further denies borrowers the opportunity to secure multiple loans with single collateral duly registered in the name of the respective borrowers.
Banks and SDIs are barred from engaging in the practice of changing ownership of collaterals presented by borrowers to secure credit facilities from the borrower to the bank or SDI.
The Bank of Ghana has observed a practice among some banks and SDIs, where penal interest rates levied against defaulting loan customers, are made to accrue interest.
In effect, interest is computed on penal charges in addition to interest on the outstanding loan amount.
This practice results in high outstanding loan balances which customers are unable to pay, resulting in high non-performing loans.
The practice is detrimental to the credit market.
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the application of interest on penal charges.
Additionally, penal charges shall only be applied on the amount of the delayed interest or principal payment and not on the total outstanding loan amount in accordance with section 55(3) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052).
In accordance with section 55 (2) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052), banks and SDIs shall impose on a borrower an interest rate that is calculated on an Annual Basis only in all credit agreements.
Consequently, banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the quotation of monthly interest rates on all credit facilities and associated fees.
In addition to the interest rate, banks and SDIs are directed to disclose the Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) related to every credit facility in accordance with the Disclosure and Product Transparency Rules for Credit Products and Services.
Bank of Ghana has observed with concern, the lack of compliance with the requirement of banks and SDIs to obtain full personal details (name, address, ID, and telephone numbers) of a person who makes a deposit into or withdrawal from an account on behalf of another person. Deposit slips of some banks and SDIs do not make provision for depositors’ signatures.
This anomaly makes it possible for third parties to deposit into the customer’s account under the guise that the deposit was made by the customer, by simply writing “self” in the column for the depositor’s name.
Telecommunication company, MTN, has handed over a 300,000 Cedi blood bank facility to the management of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Unit at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, with a call on Ghanaians to support the work of the National Blood Service by donating blood.
The handing-over ceremony coincided with the World Blood Donors day celebration.
The Chief Corporate Services Executive of MTN Ghana, Samuel Koranteng, said, “the provision of the facility is a unique opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for our blood donation exercises over the years.
The construction of this facility, therefore, serves as a good symbolism of our contribution to the collection and storage of blood in Ghana”.
“We are even more excited because we are making a significant contribution to the health needs of the people of this country”, he emphasized.
Samuel Koranteng maintained that the significance of blood in healthcare delivery, especially in emergency cases and in cases of obstetric hemorrhage, cannot be overemphasized.
“… Because of the need, the MTN Foundation instituted an annual blood donation exercise which has over the years yielded 20,036 pints of blood”.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Dr Eric Kofi Ngyedu, disclosed that the hospital recorded twenty-six maternal deaths in 2020.
“Though a reduction from the previous year’s figure of twenty-eight, the situation is still extremely unacceptable”.
Dr. Ngyedu thanked MTN for the kind gesture “to support the hospital to improve maternal health outcomes”.
Many Ghanaians were hopeful when the government introduced the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative, which is aimed at building strong value-addition-oriented companies as well as reducing the unemployment rate in the country.
Although some private companies have received some forms of support under the initiative, many have not received the support needed as access to funds has been a challenge.
In a bid to address this, the Managing Director of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), Dr. John Kofi Mensah, says the bank is offering support to Ghanaians who are into agribusiness by financing out-grower schemes under the one district one factory initiative.
“One district one factory was brought by our president, and we are trying to move it to another level as an agricultural focused bank to finance out-grower schemes for the one district one factory initiative.
That is, the factories and the industries that are being established, we want to fund the input base, and most of them are agro.
Let’s take, for example, the Ekumfi Juice factory in the Central Region which was commissioned by the President, ADB is financing the input base, that is pineapple.
We have already pumped thirty million cedis into an out-grower scheme for farmers in pineapple production.
Another one I can talk of is the Tomato processing factory at Berekum in the Bono Region.”
“We are financing an out-grower scheme for tomato production.
So any Ghanaian who wants to go into agro-based processing should be sure that when you come to talk to ADB, we will support you to build a raw material base by financing an out-grower scheme so, that, your factory will continue producing without any break.
We are concentrating on Ghana production in terms of the raw materials and most of them are agro-based.”
Another industry in Ghana that has been struggling over the years is the poultry industry.
The Managing Director of ADB, Dr. John Kofi Mensah says in order for local poultry farmers to be globally competitive, his outfit has introduced a broiler value chain scheme where various players are given financial support with favourable interest rates.
“We have also introduced a broiler value chain scheme where we finance value chains from the hatchery to production, processing to marketing.
We have identified interest rate as an issue, and we are promising our value chain customers that we are going to see to the further suppression of the interest rate”.
The Managing Director made these comments on the sidelines of a dinner with some selected customers of the bank in Kumasi.
The Board Chair of ADB, Alex Bernasko said, although COVID-19 hit various institutions hard, ADB was able to make a profit of 65 million Ghana Cedis in 2020, and even introduced flexible terms to suit its customers.
The Board Chair added that the bank is set to introduce a three-year strategic plan to make it much stronger.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced, we came up with a few strategies to lighten the burden of our customers.
In fact, one of them was to introduce a moratorium on existing facilities.
Apart from that, some of them were given restructured payment schedule to enable them enough time to pay.
You will also appreciate that some of the charges have been reduced and all that for the benefit of the customers to make life less worrisome for them. But generally, ADB has got a three-year strategic plan which is intended to improve its structures and systems and way of doing work”.
The board members of ADB as part of their visit to the Ashanti Region paid a courtesy call on the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.
The Asantehene commended the bank for its focus on agriculture and urged it to continue to offer support to various businesses.
The Minister for Works and Housing, Francis Asenso Boakye, has disclosed that the government is partnering with the World Bank to invest $200 million in measures to tackle flooding in Accra.
According to him, this forms part of the government’s vision to end the perennial flooding in the capital city.
Mr. Asenso Boakye made this known in a press statement issued on Thursday, June 3, 2021, in commemoration of the June 3 disaster in 2015, which claimed 152 lives and injured many others.
“In line with this, the government has collaborated with the World Bank to invest $200 million to, among others, implement the Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Development (GARID) project.”
The Minister also added that the Akufo-Addo government will also “intensify efforts aimed at finding lasting solutions to the perennial flooding in Accra and other parts of the country.”
Meanwhile, Mr. Asenso Boakye also charged the citizenry to aid the government in this endeavour.
According to him, the government alone cannot end the menace if citizens do not also change their attitudes.
The project is meant to mitigate flood risks and address the solid waste management challenges in the Odaw Drainage Basin.
It also involves the reconstruction of some bridges to remove identified impediments to the flow of water in the basin when it rains, and the construction of detention ponds upstream of the Odaw Basin, to hold large volumes of water that would otherwise lead to flooding, especially around Kwame Nkrumah Circle.
