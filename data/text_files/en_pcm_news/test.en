How corpse of missing Civil Defence officer was discovered in a shallow grave
The remains of a female officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) who went missing 18 months ago has been discovered in a shallow grave in Obi Local Government Area of Benue State.
Until she went missing, the deceased, Josephine Cynthia Inalegwu Onche, was serving at an NSCDC post in the Otukpo area of the state.
Cynthia, an Idoma native of Otukpo origin, suddenly went missing while her wedding plans were underway.
Some of her colleagues who didn't want their names on print, narrated that the family of the deceased had reported her disappearance few days to her wedding in December 2019.
She was said to have gone to the market to buy some items in preparation for her wedding but never made it back home.
One of the deceased colleagues said several efforts to locate her did not yield results until a commercial motorcyclist disclosed where she was buried.
The cyclist was said to have told the family of the deceased that their daughter was allegedly killed and buried by her husband-to-be for ritual purposes.
Thereafter, he (cyclist) had led the family and security operatives to arrest the groom who in turn led the police to Ogun State where they arrested the native doctor alleged to have performed the ritual at Obi LGA before his relocation to a south west state.
While the suspected killer groom and the native doctor had been allegedly held by the police in Otukpo, the family of the late security personnel exhumed her remains and organised a burial on Tuesday, June 1st, 2021.
Spokesperson of the Benue Police command, DSP Catherine Anene, did not answer calls or react to messages sent to her over the development.
Contacted, the State Command Public Relations Officer of NSCDC, ASC Ejelikwu Michael, declined comments, promising that he would speak on the issue at a later date.
But an insider said the news of Cynthia's corpse being found has thrown the command into mourning again.
Constitution review: Shariah was in south west before Christianity MURIC
The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has asked the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to mind its business and stop opposing the Muslims right to operate Shariah.
MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, said this in a statement on Sunday.
This followed a warning the PFN issued against the move by any group to introduce Sharia law to the South-West through the ongoing constitutional review being carried out by the Senate.
PFN and other Christian groups are fully aware that Shariah was in the South West decades before the arrival of Christianity in 1842.
Shariah was practiced in Ede under Oba Abibu Olagunju (Habeeb, a Muslim name) and
the Ede Shariah Court operated up till 1913 at Agbeni area of the town.
It was moved to Agbongbon area in 1914.
Shariah was applied in Iwo under Oba Momodu Lamuye (Muhammad Lamuye) who died in 1906.
Even the seventh Akirun of Ikirun, Oba Aliyu Oyewole (died 1912), instituted Shariah in Ikirun in 1910.
These are just examples of the existence and spread of Shariah in Yorubaland and the Christian leaders are not oblivious of the fact that it was the British Christian colonialists who stopped Shariah in Yorubaland and imposed Christian common law, Akintola said.
He added that the PFN and other Christians are equally aware of the rising tide of Islamic awareness in the same South West and that they were only afraid that the sleeping giant is waking up to take back what belongs to it.
He said, Our Christian neighbours know well that Shariah is the Allah-given fundamental human right of Muslims.
But they are determined to deprive us of it using unorthodox methods.
They believe they are at war with Muslims and to them, everything is fair in war.
They are using both fair and foul means to achieve their objective.
We call on Nigerians to understand the siege mentality of our Christian neighbours.
Like all aggressors, they believe that attack is the best form of defence.
As the benefactors and inheritors of colonial rampage that lasted more than a century, they are determined to keep all the loot which their principal bequeathed to them.
They are determined to keep the Muslims in a concentration camp into which the colonial masters drove them.
The Constitution Review Panel asked Nigerians to forward their views regarding what they want in the constitution.
Each group is supposed to submit its needs.
But instead of telling the panel what the Christians want, PFN has gone ahead to say what they do not want Muslims to ask for.
It is an attempt to gag Muslims in the South West and it will not work.
He said that the claim of religious tolerance in the South-West is a sham and a mantra designed to keep Yoruba Muslims in perpetual slavery.
Muslims in the region are waking up and asking for freedom.
We demand a halt to the forceful use of Christian school uniform, Christian education, Christian law.
We demand civil Shariah, not criminal Shariah that involves the cutting of hands but civil Shariah to regulate Muslim marriages, inheritance, family affairs.
It has nothing to do with Christians.
We will use every peaceful and constitutional means available to attain this objective,he added.
Stakeholders in Edo South affirm Obaseki as party leader
Following the internal crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over who controls the party structure, members of the Edo South Senatorial district of the party Sunday passed a vote of confidence on the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki and his Deputy, Philip Shaibu.
Edo South PDP in a communique issued at the end of its stakeholders meeting in Benin City, at the weekend, also affirmed Governor Obaseki as the leader of the party in the state.
The communiqu read by its Secretary, Wilson Evbuomwan, also said the stakeholders supported harmonisation and integration of new entrants into the executive committee of the party for effective development of the state.
Police nab suspected kidnappers, recover guns in Abuja
The FCT Police Command has arrested eight suspected kidnappers along Shenegu-Tunga Maje, Gwagwalada, Kabusa village and Durumi axis of Abuja.
Spokesperson of the command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, gave the names of the suspects as Yakubu Ahmadu, Ibrahim Mallam Musa, and Bello Haruna.
She said the suspects were members of a syndicate also linked to the kidnap attempt on the Vice President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)
Gwagwalada branch, Barrister David Aigbefoh.
She said the suspects were arrested during a coordinated intelligence operation by police operatives from the command anti-kidnapping squad at Shenegu mountain on the border of the FCT and Niger State.
She said the suspects have provided useful information on the activities of their syndicate.
Yusuf further disclosed that one Nwite Jideofor was arrested for staging his own kidnap along Durumi axis, saying the suspect confessed to conniving with his abductors to defraud his sister of the sum of N5 million which he demanded as ransom.
She said exhibits recovered from all the suspects included three Dane guns, seven cutlasses, one black painted Honda Accord, four mobile phones and other items, adding that effort was on to arrest other members of the syndicates now at large.
She said all the suspects would be arraigned in court upon conclusion of investigation, while she urged residents of the FCT, particularly parents and guardians to prevail upon their wards to desist from engaging in any form of criminality.
Suarez strikes as Atletico win La Liga title
Luis Suarez's goal has secured a 2-1 victory for Atletico Madrid over Real Valladolid on Saturday that clinched his team another remarkable La Liga title.
Suarez began the season crying after being forced out of Barcelona but ended it with his 21st goal of the season earning Atletico a first league triumph since 2014, this one at the expense of Real Madrid.
Atletico knew victory would guarantee them the title regardless of what Real Madrid did at home to Villarreal
but it was never comfortable, with Valladolid taking a shock early lead.
Real Madrid were behind too for most of the afternoon but Karim Benzema equalised in the 87th minute and Luka Modric even scored a late winner for 2-1 at Valdebebas, leaving Atletico hanging on at the end, as they were suddenly one goal away from squandering it all.
When the final whistle blew, the players ran onto the pitch, Suarez underneath a pile of red and white shirts, with Europe's most nerve-wracking and unpredictable title race finally complete.
Suarez Zone
Just over a week ago
, coach Diego Simeone said this was the Suarez Zone
and so it proved, the Uruguayan scoring the winner against Osasuna last week to keep the title in Atletico's hands and then again on the last day to put their name on the trophy.
This is only the second time in 17 years that a team other than Barcelona or Real Madrid have won the title, with Atleti claiming the other one under Simeone in 2014.
Atletico went into the game having been top since December and on the back of beating Osasuna with two goals in the last eight minutes, a victory that was so dramatic it felt like it would prove decisive.
But Atletico have done nothing the easy way this season, with their 10-point lead in February cut to two in May and their position at the top of the table relying on numerous slip-ups from both Real Madrid and Barcelona.
So it was apt that faced with beating Real Valladolid, who were 19th on the table, they still had to scrape over the line.
Several hundred Atletico fans gathered in Valladolid's Plaza Mayor in the hours before kick-off to sing songs and a similar number made it outside the stadium, where they were cordoned off in a cess-pit of nerves and anticipation.
Gulak's assassination sparks outrage
There was outrage and mourning Sunday over the assassination of Barr.
Ahmed Gulak, a former political adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, by gunmen in Imo State.
Gulak was shot dead by assailants who trailed him to Obiangwu village as he made way to Sam Mbakwe Airport, in Owerri, the Imo State Capital, on his way to Abuja.
Funeral prayers for the Adamawa-born politician were conducted yesterday evening at the National Mosque, Abuja, after which his remains were interred at the Gudu Cemetry at around 8 pm.
Police in Imo last night said they had tracked down suspected killers of the of the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, and killed at least six of them, after a fierce encounter.
A statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Bala Elkana, said that On 30th May, 2021 following a distress received by the Command on the gruesome murder of Ahmed Gulak, Police Special Forces made up of Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Police Mobile Force (PMF) and Tactical Units from the command were deployed to the scene at Obiangwu Junction at Ngorokpala LGA of Imo state.
The teams were given a clear instruction to identify and apprehend the perpetrators of the act with a view of bringing them to justice.
Vehicles belonging to the suspected killers of Ahmed Gulak intercepted by Police in Imo yesterday
Eyewitnesses account, especially the account given by the Driver of the vehicle that was conveying Ahmed Gulak to the Airport before the attack, gave a vivid description of the assailants and the vehicles they used in carrying out the attack.
The assailants were said to have used a Toyota Camry 2005 model with silver color; Toyota Sienna 1998 Model with golden color;
Toyota Hilux with white color; and a Lexus RX 330 with golden Color.
(Registration numbers are withheld for security reasons).
Having established the identity of the assailants and the description of the vehicles used in carrying out the attack, the teams further got details of the direction the hoodlums have taken.
With further leads, the team was able to establish the location of suspects.
The suspects were rounded up at Afor Enyiogugu junction in Aboh-Mbaise Local Government Area.
The hoodlums where met distributing onions to locals from a trailer they confiscated.
The trailer was loaded with Onions from the Northern region of Nigeria.
On sighting the Police, the hoodlums providing security coverage to those sharing the onions opened fire on the Police teams.
The Gallant and battle ready
Police Officers swiftly returned the fire.
The six hoodlums who carried out the killings and four other members of their gang were fatally injured.
Three out of the four vehicles used in attacking Gulak were recovered.
Three AK 47 Rifles, one Pistol, five AK 47 magazines with ninety two rounds of live ammunition and criminal charms were recovered.
The assailants were identified as members of the proscribed IPOB and ESN.
The driver who drove late Ahmed Gulak and a co- victim who survived have all identified the dead body of the IPOB/ESN members positively as their attackers and also identified the three vehicles recovered as those used by the attackers.
During the encounter, two of the police armored personnel carriers (APC) were riddled with bullets but survived the gun battle.
A video clip on the aftermath of the attack shows Gulak in a pair of Jean trousers and a blue T-shirt lying in a pool of his own blood, besides the abandoned car.
Gulak was the chairman of the controversial Imo All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary election that produced Hope Uzodinma as the party's flagbearer.
He was also said to have remained close to the governor visiting the state frequently.
Why he was in Owerri
Though Gulak is said to be a regular visitor to Owerri since the ascension of Uzodinma, his last trip was however to attend the public hearing of the constitution review committee held in the city.
After the conclusion of the committee's sitting, Gulak stayed back while other members of the committee departed the city on Friday.
A source close to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, who chaired the public hearing in Owerri said the deceased was offered to fly on Kalu's private jet after the public hearing, but he declined.
According to the source, Kalu's team left Owerri on the day the public hearing ended but Gulak stayed behind saying he had things to do in the city.
The source said: We left Owerri on the day the public hearing ended and we asked him to join us on our private jet and we had enough security with us.
But he said he had things to do in the city.
Nigerians knock FG, political actors over killing
Nigerians on social media berated the federal government and political actors for his killing.
A commentator on the Facebook link of the story published by Daily Trust, Ifeanyi Maduako, while describing Gulak death as distasteful, linked the incident with politics.
This killing is very distasteful to me.
It appears political and those behind it should be unraveled.
The killing will expose those behind the current insecurity in Imo State.
Who invited him and why killing a northerner in Imo State?
I am very afraid what fate awaits innocent Imo State people in the coming days in the hands of northern controlled security agencies, he wrote.
Another commentator on the thread, Oloruntobi Micheal Omo, noted: The police report proves that this killing is political and hence calls for an in-depth investigation.
Police I guess have some questions to answer.
On his part, Comr Umar Hassan Ahmad wrote, The soul of our innocent people is more important than this scam which is called Nigeria unity.
This illiteracy will not be acceptable to us, enough is enough we are peacemakers
but those are pushing us to the wall that this peacemaking can no longer be sustained.
I am warning our retaliation will be worst.
Buhari you failed us woefully, am urging Imo police to confront the culprit
Nasiru Inuwa wrote, A wake up call to the northern elites, they've started with the innocent Fulani herders & now turned to northern govt officials & prominent politicians
The outlawed IPOB, in a statement by its secretary, Emma Powerful, faulted reports linking it to the murder of Gulak, noting that the assassination of politicians is not part of its agenda.
We, therefore, state without equivocations that IPOB knows nothing about the said assassination.
In the first place, what threat did the late Gulak constitute to our cause to warrant his elimination?
We had nothing in common with him and could not have in any way killed him.
Pointing accusing fingers at IPOB for this barbaric act is only meant to divert attention away from the real masterminds.
This is the same way terrorists in security uniform commit various atrocities in South East and turn around to blame IPOB for their crimes just to tarnish our global reputation.
This is purely a smokescreen to justify their long-awaited plan to declare another special military operation in the Eastern region to kill more innocent Biafrans.
Instead of the security agencies to properly investigate the incident and possible factors, they switch to accuse IPOB of a crime we know nothing about.
Did IPOB have the itinerary of the late Gulak to have waylaid him at the airport?
The group said security agencies should first investigate Gulak's host, Hope Uzodinma, as well as his political opponents to establish their possible involvement.
Those behind Gulak's murder won't go unpunished
President Muhammadu Buhari has said that those behind the murder of Gulak and other incidents across the country will not go scot free.
President Buhari, in a statement issued Sunday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed outrage and disgust over the heinous murder.
The president, who expressed sadness over the incident, said: I'm repulsed by such premeditated and gruesome murder of Gulak by evil people who are determined to undermine the peace, unity and territorial integrity of our country.
Let me warn however that nobody or group of people who engages in such despicable acts should expect to go free.
We will deploy all resources at our disposal to ensure that such callous and criminal elements are brought to justice.
Gulak's killing unacceptable Akeredolu
Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu described the news of the assassination as very shocking and disturbing.
In a statement personally signed by the governor, he said this is one murder too many, describing the action as senseless and wicked.
The perpetrators of this heinous act are enemies of this country.
This contrivance is meant to mislead, confuse and destroy.
It bears the unmistakable, despicable imprints of fifth columnists bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration.
These criminals must not be allowed to succeed.
We want to use this medium to express our solidarity with our brother, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma.
We admonish him and other governors in the South Eastern States to brace up, and confront the current security challenge to put an end to the bloodbath in the land.
The enemies of the people always employ the weapon of fear to create disaffection in the polity.
This cowardly act is calculated to instigate Nigerians against each other, particularly Northerners, against the Igbo living outside the South East.
We must confront the enemies of the people with a view to neutralising them.
This is definitely not the time for political correctness.
Banditry should not be allowed to subvert the legitimacy of the current government at all levels.
We call on all security agencies to collaborate with a view to unveiling the criminal elements sponsoring and undertaking terrorist acts.
They must be punished, severely.
Fintiri mourns
The Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri described as shocking the gruesome murder of Gulak who was a former Speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly.
Governor Fintiri said the death was painful and a reflection of the wickedness of the wicked.
Governor Fintiri described the late Gulak as a witty, determined and practical politician whose rise in life was as a result of sheer hard work.
It is unfortunate that death has taken from us
Hon Ahmed Gulak in such a gruesome manner.
He was a lively politician who loved and worked with everyone, and always held the interests of the country at heart.
Recalling his interactions with the late Gulak, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri said, He was a brother and a mentor, and a fighter for human rights as a lawyer.
Madagali community has lost a true son.
In a statement issued yesterday in Yola through his Chief Press Secretary, Hunwashi Wanisoukou, the governor noted that Our country has lost an astute fighter for human rights.
We all remember how passionate he fought for the plight of those displaced by insurgency and the downtrodden.
ACF condemns assassination
The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has condemned Gulak's assassination, describing it as a monumental loss to the nation.
The ACF in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said it was sad to receive news on the assassination of Ahmed Gulak describing him as a dynamic and progressive politician from the north.
You liked or hated him that was your business.
May God bless him and give his family and his state, Adamawa the strength to bear this monumental loss, it stated.
Assassination part of plans to replicate 1966 coup CNG
The Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has described Sunday's assassination of Ahmed Gulak, a prominent northern leader and former Political Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan as coordinated and as well as incessant attacks on police formations in Nigeria's southeast as part of a wider plan to replicate the coup of 1966.
The CNG in a statement signed by its Spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman said it was the reason why the northern part of the country cannot be reasonably expected to live with the south east as a nation alleging that the violent rascality by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and other armed Igbo gangs are funded, fully supported and emboldened by every component of the Igbo society at home and in the diaspora.
West Ham top-four hopes dented by loss to Everton
West Ham United blew their chance to apply real pressure in the race for a Premier League top-four finish as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat by an Everton side who maintained their European qualification hopes on Sunday.
Dominic Calvert-Lewins 24th-minute goal proved decisive against a West Ham side who huffed and puffed but never really hit their stride on a crucial afternoon.
The closest West Ham came to an equaliser was when Vladimir Coufals shot hit the post and Jarrod Bowen could not bundle in the rebound from point-blank range.
Supporters of the Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo have shown support for him by portraying him as a presidential candidate come next election.
Osinbajo has not declared interest in presidential race, says spokesman
Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has described the speculations that he will contest the 2023 presidential election as a distraction.
There have been unconfirmed reports that Osinbajo is eyeing the highest office in the land.
In a statement which Laolu Akande, his spokesman, issued on his behalf on Monday, the vice-president said it is not true that he has declared interest in the race.
The attention of the Office of the Vice President has been drawn to a website:
supportosinbajo.ng that is calling on Nigerians to join a volunteer group mobilizing support for Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, ahead of the 2023 presidential election.
Details of this website and the solicitation of the group are currently trending on WhatsApp with a suggestion that Prof. Osinbajo has quietlydeclared interest in the 2023 election.
The Office of the Vice President is not in any way connected to this website or the group behind it and considers such an enterprise an unnecessary distraction.
Prof. Osinbajo has not declared any interest whatsoever in the 2023 election, but he is rather focused on working in his capacity as Vice President in the current administration to address all the compelling issues in the country and concerns of Nigerians, including finding effective and lasting solutions to the security challenges.
Therefore, we ask that people desist from such unhelpful permutations while we all deal together with the challenges confronting us as Nigerians, and resolve them for the benefit of our people, peace and prosperity in the land,the statement read.
Ndidi and Iheanacho has made Nigeria proud again as the players in Leichester City, the team that won FA Cup this season, showing off the country's flag.
NFF congratulates Ndidi, Iheanacho on FA Cup win with Leicester City
President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)
Mr Amaju Melvin Pinnick, has sent a message of congratulations to Super Eagles midfielder Wilfred Ndidi and forward Kelechi Iheanacho on the duos triumph with Leicester City over much-fancied Chelsea FC in Saturdays
FA Cup final in England.
Both players featured in the encounter at Wembley and at the end celebrated enthusiastically with Nigerias flag as they joined a list of only seven other Nigerian players to have lifted Englands most glamorous diadem.
I am very happy for both Ndidi and Iheanacho.
They worked very hard for Leicester City throughout the campaign and themselves and the Club deserve the honour.
I believe this triumph will serve as a major psychological boost for the two players ahead of our friendly games this summer and FIFA World Cup qualifiers starting in September.
I am also very happy seeing the two players celebrating with the Nigerian flag at the end of it all.
That was awesome.
Ndidi and Iheanacho became only the second pair of Nigerians to have celebrated The FA Cup win in England, after Nwankwo Kanu and John Utaka triumphed with Portsmouth against Cardiff in 2008.
Before then, Daniel Amokachi had won with Everton in 1995; Celestine Babayaro with Chelsea in 2000; Kanu with Arsenal in 2002 and 2003 and John Mikel Obi with Chelsea in 2007.
After the Kanu/Utaka feat in 2008, John Mikel Obi won again with Chelsea in 2009, 2010 and 2012; Alex Iwobi won with Arsenal in 2017 and; Victor Moses won with Chelsea in 2018.

Djokovic warms up for Roland Garros with Belgrade title
Novak Djokovic completed a successful warm-up for Roland Garros when he beat Slovakian Alex Molcan 6-4, 6-3, on Saturday in the final of the ATP clay tournament in Belgrade.
This was the second event in the city in just over a month but where the Serbia Open in April was played in an empty stadium, fans were allowed for this tournament.
Its been a while since I last played here in front of a crowd,said Djokovic, a Belgrade native who lost in the semifinal in the Serbia Open, a tournament he last won in 2011.
Herder-farmer crisis in Nigeria has become an ever dominating topic on all news platforms in Nigeria.
Ending Nigerias herder-farmer crisis: The Livestock Reform Plan
Nigerias federal and state governments are struggling to implement a National Livestock Transformation Plan that seeks to curb the movement of cattle across the country and reduce deadly herder-farmer conflict.
While the Plan has earned the endorsement of many state governments, it faces significant challenges.
Deficient political leadership, popular misperceptions about its purpose, budgetary constraints aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a lack of personnel with the expertise to carry it out and widespread insecurity, are all hindering progress.
If the Plan fails as previous initiatives to modernise livestock management did, herder-farmer violence could escalate.
Approved by the National Economic Council in January 2019, the Plan represents the most comprehensive effort to overhaul Nigerias inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
At the core is a strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing, and thus, lower the risk of conflict between herders and farmers.
It is animated by the hope that over a period of 10 years, predominantly nomadic pastoralists will be persuaded to move their cattle into ranches and public grazing reserves, where breedingg farms and other mechanised livestock management practices are to bolster the sectors productivity.
By the end of 2028, authorities aim to have at least 119 ranches operating in all participating states, creating over two million jobs in the livestock production, processing and marketing chains.
President Muhammadu Buharis administration came up with the Plan following a wave of violence between herders and farmers, particularly a surge in related violence afflicting rural dwellers in 2018.
The federal government, which has committed to funding 80 per cent of the transformation proposals submitted by participating states, has taken preliminary steps toward putting the Plan into practice, including providing technical support to help states prepare for implementation, such as help with field surveys and site mapping.
Several states have reactivated earlier demarcated grazing reserves, opened offices and set up steering committees to administer the Plan.
Authorities have also held workshops and done other works to explain the benefits of livestock reform to a larger audience.
But two years into the 10-year plan, the first new ranch is yet to be built, and the obstacles are many.
Opposition, partly among herders, predominantly from the Fulani ethnic group but also among farmers who resent the Plans benefits to pastoralists, hinders reform efforts.
Distrust is widespread in the Middle Belt, which has been the scene of violent disputes over land between herders and farmers, notwithstanding peacemaking and military efforts that since 2018 have reduced the bloodshed.
Federal and state budgets are pinched, partly due to the pandemics economic fallout, and the country lacks sufficient technical expertise for managing ranches and grazing reserves.
In many states, especially in the North-West, the proliferation of criminal gangs and other armed groups is cutting off access to grazing reserves and scaring away potential investors.
Unless addressed, these and other problems could delay or even scuttle the Plan, leaving the country vulnerable to an escalation of herder-farmer conflict, which could degenerate into wider ethnic, regional and religious violence.
Tackling these challenges requires a concerted effort by federal and state authorities, with help from donors and investors.
First, Abuja and supportive state governments should provide stronger political leadership and improve public communication to dispel misgivings and misperceptions about the Plan.
These are especially prevalent among pastoralists, who will be asked to change a centuries-old nomadic lifestyle, and who legitimately doubt the Plans promises about available pasture.
But many farmers are fearful too, that they may lose land to livestock producers.
Many in the Middle Belt and southern states remain deeply suspicious of the Plans long-term goals, which they see as creating privileges for herders, and more broadly, the Fulani.
With Abuja and other partners support, state governments must build expertise and technical capacity, especially for managing ranches and grazing reserves, dairy production and meat processing.
Federal and state governments should also up budgetary commitments, hasten the release of funds and provide financial transparency to ensure accountability, working with donors and investors as necessary.
Addressing rural insecurity, curbing impunity and rehabilitating communities adversely affected by earlier violence in participating states are also vital.
Plus, authorities will need to consider climate changes likely impact and reach a decision about how the transhumant herders who cross into Nigeria seasonally should or should not benefit from the Plan.
While some of these steps will take time, the Plans proponents should focus on delivering concrete, visible results on a relatively short-term basis.
Less than two years from now, the country will hold general elections.
If the Plan is to survive the change of government that will follow, politicians may need to be able to produce clear proof of its benefits (Having served two terms, President Buhari and many state governors are ineligible to compete, meaning that change is certain.)
Ideally, by the time campaigning heats up in late 2022, the Plans backers should be able to point to at least a handful of newly constructed ranches or rehabilitated reserves, strong donor and investor commitments, and the first of a cadre of newly trained livestock management professionals.
None of this will be easy, but the Plan is worth the effort.
While far from perfect, it offers an important chance to reform Nigerias livestock system with a strategy that addresses the needs of both herders and small-scale farmers.
About 70 per cent of Nigerias workforce earns an income through agriculture.
Modernising the livestock sector could boost the countrys prosperity overall at the same time that it takes a big step toward resolving one of Nigerias most dangerous conflicts.
With the clock ticking down to the 2023 elections, federal and state authorities will need to move quickly to make a visible mark, lest the work they have done to create this moment of opportunity be lost.
This piece is an executive summary of a report on the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) and how to hasten its implementation, published by the International Crisis Group.
The kind of problem I have with the king
Don't you agree?
They are responsible for very high proportions of food and cash crop production.
Subsistence farmers are smallholders who consume the majority of their farm output and who are held back from participating more actively in commercially oriented agriculture by a variety of constraints.
No energy for anyone who isn't happy for me
It is my own/ mine
This brings me to the conclusion that evryone is evil
This systems has been characterised as complex, diverse and risk-prone.
Farms are generally small, often held under traditional or informal tenure, and are in marginal or risk-prone environments.
Yields are low and farmers lack the capacity to increase yields.
we speak life and prosperity to this day
send your account number
The emphasis now is on agricultural productivity, production enhancement and commercialising farming as an enterprise.
i know eveything
Akpos and his friend were discussing
The yields the smallholder farmers are getting are really profitable
Are you coming?
These emerging challenges lead many smallholder farmers to pursue livelihood strategies that involve lower-risk and lower-yielding agricultural activities.
Are you a witch?
I am on my way to sabo market to buy some food stuff
let me call my father
As developing countries populations grow larger, richer, and more urban, the intensification of agricultural production will occur in rapidly changing agri-food value chains.
How far what's up, should i be on my way?
These developments are further shifting the competitive advantage away from small farmers.
It is important that we find solution to the problem
This will require an integrated approach of methodologies.
the loan sharks are on his neck
this kind of thing
i'm on an errand from my place of work
The water has flooded the whole farm
Farmers many battles in 2020
For many farmers and other stakeholders in the agro sector, the year 2020 will remain one of the worst years in the history of Nigeria because it introduced new dynamics that millions of smallholder farmers have to contend with.
The agricultural sector was confronted with many challenges ranging from the climate change-related issues, conflicts and the complications exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which brought pains and heartbreak to farmers and agribusiness players.
First, the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions happened at the time dry season farmers were about to harvest their crops and wet season farmers were about to commence cultivation.
Many farmers could not access their farms while for others getting labourers to harvest their farms since mechanization is a huge challenge and harvest is manual, is the problem.
Movement restrictions introduced to curb the spread of the coronavirus locked-down markets had disrupted the rural economy.
Many farmers could not sell their produce to enable them to buy seeds and fertilizer, pay labourers/tractor services.
Even when the lockdown was lifted for the agricultural sector, the price of fertilizer became so high that many smallholder farmers could not afford it.
In some places, the price went as high as N13,000 for a 50kg bag of Indorama and Notore Urea.
NPK 15-15-15 don rise reach N25,000 when di federal goment NPK20-10-10 wey dey under di presidential fertilizer initiative, wey dem suppose sell for farmers for N5000 no dey available for plenti places and areas where r dey di price don rise reach N7,000 and e high pass dis for some places
For farmers in Zamfara, Katsina, southern Kaduna, some parts of Kebbi and Sokoto states, bandits activities not only denied them access to their farms but left many killed in their farms.
Many farming communities were razed down.
Many people were kidnapped for ransom.
Many paid large sums of money or surrendered large portions of their harvest to the bandits.
Many villages in those states have now become desolate.
The agric sector also witnessed one of the worst disasters when floods wiped out over 450,000 hectares of rice and maize fields estimated at over N3.5 billion across Kebbi, Sokoto and Kano states.
Many of the affected farmers are yet to be compensated as their livelihood was destroyed.
The flood was the worst since the 2012 disaster that wreaked havoc across most of Nigeria's coastal cities and flood-prone areas killing people and washing away farmlands.
Meanwhile, as the flood was putting pains in the hearts of farmers up North, farmers down South were confronted with drought.
For two months, farmers watched helplessly as their investment in crops withered away.
Don't disguise
Another subsector that was badly hit this year was poultry and feeds.
The scarcity of maize from the beginning caused prices to increase
It also forced the Poultry Association of Nigeria to send a save our Soul appeal to the federal government for urgent attention.
The federal government responded to the appeal and released 5,000 metric tons of maize from the nations strategic reserve to the farmers in addition to granting some of the big players licenses to import about 222 metric tons of maize to augment the shortfall for the feed industry.
However, this was just a short-term solution as barely three months later, the scarcity of soyabean struck, making the farmers express fear that by January 2021, the industry would shut down completely.
The scarcity resulted in a serious feed crisis in the industry as prices reached a record high in its history rising from N2,600 in February to about N5,500 now.
The poultry industry lost an estimated N7 million jobs with figures projected to reach 10 million by January 2021 whereas the loss in investments was estimated conservatively at about N1.5 trillion.
While the poultry farmers are still struggling to deal with the challenges that marred the subsector, the crop farmers despite the daunting challenges that confronted the sector throughout the 2020 farming year, had buyers coming right up to their farms even before harvest to make bulk purchase arrangements.
This is also the first time that the prices of grains are refusing to come down at harvest time, sparking fear of looming hunger and the call for the borders to be reopened, which will allow an influx of smuggled products through the country's porous borders.

3,000 youths to benefit from NALDA'sfarm estate in Ebonyi
The National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) has said that the agency would engage at least 3,000 youths in Ebonyi State in its proposed integrated farm estate in the State.
The integrated farm estate will be completed and commissioned by October this year.
The Executive Secretary of the agency, Prince Paul Ikonne, who announced this Tuesday, said the proposed integrated farm estate would be established in 104 hectares of land donated by the state government.
Prince Ikonne, who was also in Ebonyi State on Monday for a courtesy visit to the governor, Engr David Umahi, said that the integrated farm estate would be completed by October 2021.
This is the mandate of Mr President, that we should reactivate abandoned farm estates and develop new ones for food security.
The Governor of Ebonyi State is eager and in a hurry for us to achieve food security.
He is in total support of achieving his dreams
So, Ebonyi State is committed to working with NALDA to engage the teeming youths into full agricultural productivity.
We have seen that the Governor has keyed into Mr Presidents agenda of achieving food security in the country.
We are establishing an integrated farm estate in Ebonyi like we are doing in other States.
The scheme will engage young Nigerians and draw their attention to agriculture

Niger Republic's new president blasts terrorists for war crimes
Niger Republic's newly-elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, hit out at terrorist groups whose barbarity has exceeded every limit after taking the helm Friday of a country struggling with two jihadist insurgencies.
These groups carry out large-scale massacres of innocent civilians, and in doing so, commit real war crimes, Bazoum declared.
The leaders of these groups are from other countries, he said, adding that Niger was being attacked without any cause.
No terrorist leader has ever formulated any grievance against our state, he said.
Bazoum, 61, was elected in a two-round vote in December and February.
He was previously right-hand man to Mahamadou Issoufou, 68, who has voluntarily stepped down after two five-year terms.
His inauguration marks the first handover between elected leaders in Niger's 60-year post-independence history, but jihadist attacks and an alleged attempted coup have overshadowed ceremonies.
Niger is being hit by insurgents linked to Al-Qaeda or the so-called Islamic State (IS), crossing from Mali and Burkina Faso in the west, and by Boko Haram, crossing from Nigeria in the southeast.
More than 300 people have been killed in three attacks in the west since the start of the year.
In the most recent of these, 141 members of the Tuareg community were massacred on March 21 in Tahoua, a vast desert region abutting Mali.
Bazoum said Niger's diplomatic efforts under his presidency will be centred on Mali.
The current situation in Mali has a direct impact on domestic security in our country, he said.
IS-linked insurgents are based in Menaka and Gao, in eastern and central Mali respectively, said Bazoum.
Combatting them will be very difficult so long as the Malian state does not exercise full sovereignty over these regions, he said.
In the early hours of Wednesday, after gunfire broke out near the presidency in the capital Niamey, the government announced an attempted coup had been thwarted.
It described this as a cowardly and regressive act which sought to threaten democracy and the state of law.
The West African nation has suffered four coups in its history, most recently a February 2010 putsch that toppled then-president Mamadou Tandja.
Google threatens to withdraw from Australia
Google has threatened to remove its search engine from Australia over the nation's attempt to make the tech giant share royalties with news publishers.
Australia is introducing a world-first law to make Google, Facebook and potentially other tech companies pay media outlets for their news content.
But the US firms have fought back, warning the law would make them withdraw some of their services.
Australian PM Scott Morrison said lawmakers would not yield to threats.
Though Australia is far from Google's largest market, the proposed news code is seen as a possible global test case for how governments could seek to regulate big tech firms.
Australia's code would tie Google and Facebook to mediated negotiations with publishers over the value of news content, if no agreement could be reached first.
Google Australia managing director Mel Silva told a Senate hearing on Friday that the laws were unworkable.
If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia, she said.
But lawmakers challenged this, accusing Google of blackmail and bullying Australia for raising the reform.
s going to go worldwide.
Are you going to pull out of every market, are you?
Is this about stopping the precedence? asked Senator Rex Patrick.
Silva replied that the code was an untenable risk for our Australian operations.
Morrison said his government remained committed to progressing the laws through parliament this year.
Let me be clear: Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia.
That's done in our parliament, he told reporters on Friday.
Why is Australia pushing this law?
Google is the dominant search engine in Australia and has been described by the government as a near-essential utility with little market competition.
The government has argued that because the tech platforms gain customers from people who want to read the news, the tech giants should pay newsrooms a fair amount for their journalism.
In addition, it has argued that the financial support is needed for its embattled news industry because a strong media is vital to democracy.
Australian print media has seen a 75% decline in advertising revenue since 2005, according to the government.
Google's threat to remove its entire search product is its most severe yet.
News accounts for just 12.5% of Google searches in Australia, according to lawmakers.
Poultry farmers beg for importation of animal grade maize, soya meals
Dr Olalekan Odunsi, the South-West general-secretary, Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), has called on government to facilitate the importation of animal grade maize and soya meals.
Odunsi said the importation would save the poultry industry from collapsing.
He said the urgent importation of animal feed grade of maize would sustain the over 50million layers, 100million broilers, 1million breeders and other classes of poultry until the next harvest season.
He also urged the government, in the interim, to enforce a ban on export of soya, seed and processed soya bean meal.
He enjoined governors in the region to put as much efforts to the cultivation of maize as they had done with rice.
Odunsi stressed the need for a strong collaboration among maize farmers in Nigeria, soya bean farmers and others.
He said acute scarcity and astronomical prices of soya beans and maize would threaten additional five million poultry jobs in the short term if the government does not intervene.
Today, maize is sold at N210, 000/MT in most states of South-West, soya meal N240, 000/MT.
Due to the importance of these two items, the price of poultry feed has continuously been on the increase from N2750 to N3000 in April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now.
In December, most farmers were unable to sell their broilers because the cost of production was higher than what an average Nigerian could afford.
Presently, egg is going out of the reach of an average family with ideal price at N1, 300.
So we really need government's intervention to save the current 10million jobs in the poultry value chain of our economy,
he said
Pro-Buhari rep suspended from APC
The All Progressives Congress (APC) has suspended a member of the House of Representatives representing Kazaure Federal Constituency in Jigawa State, Muhammad Gudaji Danbaffa for six months.
In addition, a seven-member investigative panel has been constituted to probe the allegation of insubordination against the lawmaker and make its recommendations within 10 days.
The committee is headed by Hamza Dand with Sanusi Kazaure as Secretary.
In the letter suspending the lawmaker, the local government chairman of the party, Hassan Lawal, claimed that the decision to suspend Gudaji was initiated by his Kazaure Yamma ward and endorsed by the local government chapter of the party.
Our correspondent reports that the lawmaker was accused of criticising the governor for allegedly subverting the peoples will in the choice of candidates for the chairmanship and councillorship in the recently conducted party primaries in the state.
Serena sails past teenager Pigato in Parma WTA
Serena Williams brushed aside the challenge of local teenager Lisa Pigato in the opening round of the WTA tournament in Parma on Monday.
Williams, ranked eighth in the world, beat the 572nd-ranked Pigato, making her WTA debut, 6-3, 6-2 in the first meeting between the two players.
How North-Central govs can optimize open grazing ban in South APC leader
As open grazing controversy trends in the public domain, with Southern governors slamming a ban on it during their meeting in Asaba, the president, Farmers Empowerment Association in Nigeria (FEAN), and Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum in FCT, Honourable Obaje David, examines how the North-Central governors could respond to the ban.
Recently, the Southern states governors met in Asaba, Delta State, and banned open grazing to stem farmers-herders crisis and other forms of criminalities.
What is your take on the heated controversy generated by this decision?
Every human being has right to actions and opinions.
But the most important thing is that once you take your action, you should be aware of the consequences.
You should be able to consider the advantages and disadvantages.
I am not one of those that say it is good or bad.
As a Nigerian, you have the right and liberty to live anywhere in the country in good faith and enjoy the freedom of association.
On this basis, I will not say that it is a good thing.
But as a leader in the North Central, I will say that it is a good thing, especially for the North Central Zone, due to the potential economic benefits for us and the nation.
The ban is an advantage for us.
We need to tap into it and see how we can make it a real venture and make money from it.
Luckily for us, we have a landmass that is enough to accommodate the herders, no matter the number that may troop from the South into the North Central.
What then is your position on open grazing?
I am not one of the propagators of open grazing.
I believe more in ranching, which I practise as an individual.
I believe that if we take to ranching, it will work out for us.
The North Central governors should accommodate the national programme on ranching.
Such move could make the North Central a cattle hub where people could always have access to cattle and all the allied products
and then it becomes a means of economic empowerment for the North Central people.
We have the land, which the southern states may not have.
Look at Kogi, Niger, Kwara and others.
We can conveniently accommodate the herders and ranching policy to our advantage.
The challenges that the Fulani herders pose are not because they don't want to adopt ranching.
The problem is that they are not being educated on its advantages.
They have a nomadic culture.
As a result, they have to be well educated to embrace ranching.
We can also adopt the Kenya method, where nearly all the families have ranches and you don't see open grazing despite the large number of the cattle they have.
But that is what the southern governors were making case for?
The governors were not categorical in this regard.
They were not calling for ranching and for the federal government to come in.
What they were simply saying was that the herders have become problems to us and should go away.
They said the herders should apply for land with a claim that herding is a private business.
But have they asked their indigenes to apply for land like the herders?
As one of those involved in youth empowerment programmes, especially in the agricultural sector and its value chains, why are some government policies failing to realise their objectives and what is the way out?
Firstly, there is no administration that has been able to touch the lives of individuals like President Muhammadu Buhari's administration whereby you can conveniently sit in your house and apply for facilities and you get them.
There is also the targeted credit facility which is also known as COVID-19 loan.
Many Nigerians have conveniently gotten the loan in hundreds of thousands of naira from the comfort of their homes without even going to offices.
Also, with SMEs being expanded such as the Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and others.
The challenge is that we have two sides of those that would believe in you and those that would criticise you.
So, for those who don't believe in Buhari's administration, there is nothing beneficial.
But for us that believe in Buhari, we are benefiting and we thank God for it.
Kidnappers kill driver, abduct 13 in Nasarawa
Kidnappers have shot dead a driver, Adamu Usman, and abducted 13 passengers near Shafa-Abakpa -Umaisha road in Toto Local Government Council of Nasarawa State.
Daily Trust learnt that the deceased who was shot three times on his abdomen died at about 9pm at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada where he and one other driver, Attahiru Abukwo, who was also shot, were receiving treatment.
A driver who narrowly escaped the attack, Ibrahim Saidu, said the incident happened around 5pm on Tuesday when the kidnappers in their large number, wielding AK-47 rifles, emerged from the bush to lay ambush on four vehicles coming from Ugya village.
According to him, the kidnappers laid ambush and opened fire on the vehicles that were conveying passengers from Ugya to Abaji.
He said the kidnappers immediately surrounded the vehicles after the drivers lost control and skidded to a halt in the bush.
They whisked away 13 passengers including a middle-aged woman into the bush at gunpoint.
In fact, I was driving behind the four vehicles in front of me, but it was God that saved me when I stopped at one of the villages to pick a passenger.
As I was coming, I heard gunshots and immediately made a U-turn, he said.
The Ohimegye of Opanda-Umaisha, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Usman Abdullahi, said some remnants of bandits inside a forest along the axis have been responsible for kidnapping of travellers, residents as well as farmers in the area.
There are some remnants of these bandits that are still terrorising our people along this axis, so I am appealing to the state government to collaborate with the federal government to see how the bandits can be flushed out completely, he said.
When contacted, the spokesman of the Nasarawa State police command, ASP Ramhan Nansel, said he was yet to be briefed on the latest kidnap incident, adding that he would reach out to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Toto Local Government to get details about it and get back to our reporter.

The PDP wishes Governor Ayade well in his new political sojourn as well as in his future endeavours.
Passage of forensic Bill by National Assembly: Its relevance to Buhari's fight against corruption
The National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Wednesday 19th
May 2021 at the House of Representatives and Tuesday 2nd
March 2021 at the Senate made history by passing into law, the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021 (SB.615 and HB.
791), after it was read for the Third Time in both Chambers (SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE).
This act is a clear demonstration of the National Assembly's patriotism and direct response, targeted at strengthening and re-invigorating national frontiers in the fight against fraud, corruption and cybercrimes, which has eaten deep into the fabric of our nation.
With the passage of this Bill, the 9th Assembly under the distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala have shown clearly, its ardent resolve to carry out its legislative functions in line with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended.
And this also attests to the fact that the National Assembly is alive to the performance of its complementary role(s) with other arms of Government in the fight against corruption.
It is with great delight and a deep sense of gratitude that I write this, which has been put together as a platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed the whole world know what the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria is all about and the unique concept we are bringing on board in order to complement national efforts in its quest to ride the country of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and other related crimes.
After the passage of this Bill by the Senate, and in view of the fact that we operate a bi-cameral Legislature, the ever-ready and resilient House of Representatives, under the able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, the Hon.
Speaker, followed suit and passed the Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you may well be aware, the Bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) has been one of the most viciously attacked and antagonised bill in the National Assembly in recent times.
Sadly the attacks came from those who ought to be partners in progress in the fight against endemic corruption in Nigeria, but have rather designated themselves as enemies of the general good.
Good is good it has no substitute so also is bad.
No matter how long it takes, good always prevails over bad just as the superiority of light over darkness remain constant and unquestionable
It is indeed important for us to have a glimpse of how it all happened at the National Assembly.
Interestingly, The Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) was first passed into law by the 9th Senate on the 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone the rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual at its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 the bill was unanimously passed into law by the Nigeria Senate having deeply considered the urgent need for this noble legislation, of course this was not without series of thunder bolts from detractors who would not stop at any length to see that any legislation that would be helpful in assisting the Buhari-led administration to fight corruption does not see the light of the day but the senate stood firm and saw it through.
It is very important for the public to know that (CIFIPN) is not just a noble body but a novel one in Nigeria that is targeted at bridging the gap that has long been existing in the forensics space.
Today, the journey to having a standard body that would regulate the practice of forensics in Nigeria is at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge the few anti-government bodies that would want to sabotage this step.
The passage of this Bill by the National Assembly, no doubt, is a clear demonstration of its patriotic zeal and the need to further strengthen all national efforts geared towards the fight against corruption, which has hindered development in every aspect of our national lives.
This legislative bold step, taken by the two Chambers of the National Assembly, is quite historic and symbolic, coming at a time that Nigeria is in dire need of legislation(s)
that will give more bite to its anti-corruption drive in view of the raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across the globe.
As we all know, crime generally, has assumed a new dimension, due to advancement in science and technology in the 21st Century.
Therefore, the passage of this Bill is apt and timely and it has shown clearly that we have flexible and responsive Legislature that is in tune and in touch with emerging global realities and ever-ready to enact legislations that will meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.
It is apposite to also state that the journey, which culminated into the passage of this Bill, began in the 8th National Assembly whereby, our Bill was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, the current President of Senate when he was a Senate Leader, because of its strategic importance to the anti-corruption drive of this administration.
For the benefit of hindsight, when our Bill was introduced in the two Chambers during the 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings were conducted by the relevant Committees of the respective Chambers.
Thereafter and in spite of opposition from stakeholders who were in the minority, led by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), the National Assembly passed the Bill, in view of its significance and the part it will play in the fight against corruption.
Afterward, the Bill was forwarded to Mr President for Presidential Assent, which was not given before the Dissolution of the 8th National Assembly in June, 2019.
It is on the strength of this, that the Bill was re-introduced in this 9th National Assembly and this time around, it was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, the current Leader of the Senate, in view of the importance attached to it.
We are constrained to make this clarification in order to clear the air on the cheap propaganda being propelled by our detractors that our Bill was rejected by the 8th National Assembly.
Also worthy of mention is the fact that our Bill has being mistaken for similar Bills, which were recently introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives Chambers.
These Bills, upon our close scrutiny, we discovered that they are merely duplications of the intents and purports of our Bill.
It must be stressed that none of these Bills were introduced in the 8th National Assembly, other than our Bill.
As such, we are the first to ever come up with a Bill of this magnitude,(Forensic)
having seen the urgent need to establish such great Institute.
The decision to establish the Institute was taken after a painstaking study of how the Institutes operate in other jurisdictions and how well they have helped in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
It is instructive to note that our Institute has been in existence since 2009.
And over the years, we have trained professionals in the field of forensic science and technology, targeted at inculcating the requisite skills and acumen in the pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.
You will agree with me that in today's world, the conventional ways of investigating crimes, with a view to fighting it has become obsolete.
As such, for us as a nation to do something meaningful in this regard, it is paramount that we align ourselves with the global trend and emerging innovations, targeted at fighting corruption.
It is in line with this reasoning that the idea of establishing this Institute was conceived with a well-structure laudable objectives that are relevant to the anti-corruption drive of this administration.
Time will not permit me to highlight all the objectives of the Bill here.
However, I wish to crave your indulgence to highlight a few of the objectives of the Bill, for the purpose of this address, as follows:
To establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals in this specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification that will enhance the acquisition of the requisite skills in the use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention;
To provide a platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in the usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in the investigation of frauds in both public and private sectors of our economy, in line with international best practices;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners in the field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;
To fill the existing huge vacuum in our archaic and conventional system of investigation with the introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help the country from expending its scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations in Nigeria;
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes that cut across all the strata of our investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists.
This would enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line with global best practices; and
To enhance Nigerias anti-fraud mechanisms, through the provision of a legal framework for the professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals in Nigeria, among others.
From the foregoing, it is apparent that the role of this Institute is quite strategic and important.
It is also pertinent to reiterate that forensic science is a very wide and all-encompassing field, which requires effective and efficient regulation for the attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards.
The broad spectrum of the scope and focal point of the Institute, includes but not limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, you will agree with me that our Institute is bringing on board, a unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity with international best practices.
This concept is far beyond the reasoning of those whose myopic view about the purports of our Bill have beclouded their senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, which is outside their jurisdiction and scope of operations.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw the attention of everyone to the funny scenario that is playing out now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians.
When the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill was introduced in the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), came out vehemently to oppose its passage because according to them, it is an unnecessary duplication of functions already undertaken by their Institute.
However, upon the re-introduction of our Bill in this 9th National Assembly, and having seen the overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, our Bill has received from the two Chambers, ICAN has now realized that forensic science is a unique field of practice, and as we speak, they have introduced a similar Bill that is currently before the House of Representatives, having failed woefully in their attempts to stop the passage of our Bill.
One may ask, what has changed between now and the past, where ICAN holds the view that there shouldn't be any Institute other than theirs to regulate the practice of forensic science?
your answer is as good as mine.
I wish to also inform you that the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), is not left out of this funny theatrical episode.
Just like their ICAN counterpart, they have also introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives with the nomenclature the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN.
I decided to bring out all these facts so that Nigerians and even the international communities will understand the extent to which some people can go in order to achieve their aims.
However, we are not perturbed by these developments because we believe in the credibility and ability of the National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do what is right and not to allow themselves to be manipulated in any way, by these unnecessary distractions, so as not to make a mockery of the entire thing.
The known practical and antagonist of this Bill has remained ICAN for reason that is now becoming obvious.
They engaged several bystanders into writing frivolous petitions some even targeted at the leadership of the Senate with a tone of blackmail.
Having failed woefully at the senate, the antagonists shifted their attention to the House of Representatives with the same bystanders writing all manner of publication.
Yet again, they failed.
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill that has been passed by the Senate would only require concurrence by the House safe for where there are observations.
But in the case of the CIFIPN Bill, the antagonist fought the passage of the bill until truth prevail and on the 19th May, 2021 the Bill for the establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of what Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persons seeking to become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) was passed into law by the House of Representative.
ICAN has now registered its Bill in the House of Representatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
This ICAN new Bill has in it full of provision for practice of forensic, and also that they will establish a Forensic University in Nigeria and without which nobody can practice forensic in Nigeria, and violation of this section will lead such a person to some years imprisonment.
This sounds so strange in a country full of enlightened people.
My joy is that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic
no matter the level of corruption therein.
We are already challenging the passage of the bills by the House of Representatives.
It should be noted that, our challenging the bill is not borne out of malice or ill will, but because we are certain that the purpose of this bill is to halt presidential assent under the guise of existence of similar legislation.
We will not allow ourselves and Nigerians to be deceived by their antics.
You would recall how ICAN vehemently opposed this enactment of CIFIPN and in one of its sponsored publications by the Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on the 24th May, 2019 made frantic efforts to say that ICAN under its enabling laws is empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to be passed it would amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN is presenting its ACT to be repealed and re-enacted with the inclusion of Forensics in the new law.
The question is, what has changed?
The same law that ICAN has always told the public that it has forensics is now seeking for its re-enactment.
As always, while we are not opposed to any group proposing the inclusion of forensics in its laws, we are however concerned that a body should not try to perpetuate itself.
ICAN and its cohorts have realised their inability to stop the passage of CIFIPN
so they want to have a body within itself.
What they are scared of is checks and balances, they would not want another professional body to investigate their activities because they know what they are doing to the economy of this nation.
How can they want to be a judge in their own case?
This sounds so strange.
On this note, we are calling on the National Assembly to beware of the antics of these groups, they cannot be speaking from both sides of their mouth and expect the National Assembly to be cajoled.
We want to yet again appreciate the doggedness of the 9th Assembly in ensuring that the Bill is passed, the Nigerian people are more than ever before convinced of the readiness of this administration to combat corruption through every possible means and would at all times encourage legislation that is aimed at achieving this goal.
We are confident that His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari will not hesitate in assenting to this Bill as soon as it gets to his desk.
We are calling on all Nigerians to come and be part of the Forensics Profession.
The profession is open for all professionals in various field of endeavours.
There is a training arm of the institute that will studiously guide you and equip you.
I wish to thank you all and to also reiterate our resolve and commitment to upholding ethical standards in line with global best practices, in rendering our professional services and trainings that would bring about innovative ways of fighting corruption and financial crimes, generally.
I wish to appeal to all stakeholders and well-meaning Nigerians to support this noble course and to implore us all to make frantic efforts so that collectively, we can surmount the menace of corruption, the plethora of security challenges, across the country and other associated crises.

Air Peace conducts test flights with new E195-E2 Aircraft
Air Peace has commenced test flights for its two brand new Embraer 195-E2 aircraft in preparation for deployment into service.
Daily Trust reports that the two aircraft were the first set of the 13 brand new 195-E2 aircraft acquired by the airline to deepen its route expansion.
A spokesperson for the airline, Stanley Olisa, told newsmen on Friday that one of the aircraft was flown empty from Lagos to Owerri, Abuja, and Port Harcourt for familiarisation on Thursday.
Olisa hinted that test flights to other destinations would continue, adding that in no time, the planes would commence scheduled flights, offering a superior travel experience to customers.
He disclosed that
the third brand new E195-E2 aircraft would be coming in very soon, stating that the airline's fleet expansion is driven by the commitment to satisfy the air travel needs of Nigerians.
The operation of test flights by newly acquired aircraft is a regulatory requirement that must be met before the aircraft is deployed for regular scheduled operations.
It would be recalled that Air Peace took delivery of the two brand new ultramodern 124 seat capacity Embraer 195-E2 aircraft in January and March this year, with 11 more slated for delivery.
Tela Maize harvest shows potential for 8 tons per hectare
Last Tuesday, the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, invited relevant stakeholders, including journalists, to witness third harvest of the Tela Maize variety Confined Field Trials (CFT) under its Tela Maize Research Project funded by the Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF).
The maize variety derived its name TELA from the Latin word TUTELA which means protection.
The maize variety is bred with protection against insect pests and draught.
The Principal Investigator, Professor Rabiu Adamu and other scientists who conducted journalists round the harvest, said the idea of the research work was to produce maize varieties that are resistance or that are highly protected against two major insect pests: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm and additional protection against moderate draught.
This is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; the stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production.
If not controlled, it could cause up to 80 percent yield lost; and draught if you don't manage moisture (rain) deficit very well, you may not get any yield.
We have done this trial for the third time.
We did the first trial under the dry season in March, and during the rainy season, we conducted another one from June to November.
This is the third trial from November to April.
So, in essence, this is what we are trying to showcase,the Principal researcher said.
With the three CFT trials successful, researchers will have to test and validate them from the farmers field to show that what they recorded from their own research station equally performs well in the farmers fields on wide range of locations over wide ecological conditions, beginning from 2021 rainy season.
By the end of 2022, if all things work fine, Nigerian farmers would expect these hybrids to be with them.
Dr. Muhyideen Ayekunle, a maize breeder under the project, said from the last two trials conducted, the transgenic variety recorded yield advantage of 17 percent over non- BT despite heavy infestation.
The varieties under trials were infested three times unlike the previous ones to virtually look at the efficacy of the BT gene in the maize product.
With the outcome, researchers said the yield will definitely increase above 17 per cent.
So after, we're going to analyze the data and then prepare a document to get approval for environmental release.
We're going to submit the dossiers to the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and it will be reviewed.
Once we get approval that these products, we can come out of the confinement
and then we can have a national performing trial.
The Director General/CEO of the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NBDA), Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, at the event, called on the scientists to continue to search for abiotic and biotic solutions to the challenges facing farmers in the country.
We have tested technologies capable of providing solutions to problems that farmers face, let us take advantage of it and move forward, he said.
Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, the Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, said the impact was actually going to be much.
Farmers are going to have yield increase of 17 percent and you know that farming is all about productivity and harvestable yield.
Once you have yield, of cause you're going to have bumper harvest and profit.
She said by the time these maize varieties are ready to get to the farmers, it will increase their livelihood, money and then the price of maize would come down.
Manchester United fight back in win at Aston Villa
Manchester United fought back to beat Aston Villa 3-1 away in the Premier League on Sunday as Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood and Edinson Cavani scored in the second half to put on hold the title celebrations of champions-elect Manchester City.
The result left United second on 70 points from 34 games, 10 behind City who have played a game more and missed a chance to secure the title on Saturday after they suffered a 2-1 home defeat by Chelsea.
Bertrand Traore fired Villa ahead in the 24th minute with a brilliant strike into the top corner from 15 metres after some sloppy defending by the visitors, who gave the ball away several times deep in their own half.
Fernandes equalised with a 52nd-minute penalty, sending Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez the wrong way with a coolly taken spot-kick after a series of clumsy challenges by Douglas Luiz sent Paul Pogba tumbling over.
Greenwood turned the match on its head four minutes later with a neat shot on the turn from inside the penalty area after he shook off Villa centre back Tyrone Mings.
Substitute Edinson Cavani sealed United's victory with a glancing 87th-minute header.
After Daily Trust story, NCC bans sale, use of mobile phone boosters
The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has banned the sale and use of GSM network boosters (for mobile connectivity) especially by banks, residents, government agencies, among others to improve telecommunications services.
The Commission gave the 14-day Pre-Enforcement Notice on Tuesday, signed by the Director Public affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde.
It said the warning is effective from Tuesday and on expiration of the deadline, NCC said it will begin enforcement actions against defaulters.
This is coming less than one month after Daily Trust on April 24, 2021 reported that business owners in the Sabon Gari market in Kano and other business areas said they buy boosters to improve the reception of the poor telecommunication networks in their areas.
Some of the traders said the reception is poor as the telecommunications service providers do not do much to improve services in spite of the gains they make from such places.
According to them, more traders and their customers engage in digital and online financial transactions (data-based cashless services) and other telecommunication-based services while facing poor call/data services.
NCC in the notice said, the sale, installation and usage of GSM boosters are illegal.
In the notice, NCC said it was only exercising its mandate of ensuring the protection of consumers, ensuring good quality of service and maintenance of technical standards of communication equipment, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 131 (1) of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003.
Such acts may lead to monetary sanction and/or imprisonment, or both (fine & imprisonment) as well as the confiscation of any equipment used in the illegal enhancement of network coverage.
LG polls: Protests over imposition of APC candidates
Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State have staged a protest against the party's adoption of consensus candidature in some local government areas ahead of the July 24, local government elections in the state.
The top echelon of the party had announced that the party would adopt consensus candidates in some local government areas while direct or indirect primary polls would be conducted for the emergence of candidates in some.
The protesters who stormed the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ogun State, accused some leaders of the APC in Abeokuta South LGA of imposing a chairmanship candidate on them.
They carried placards with various inscriptions such as We Say No To Money Bags
In Abeokuta South and
Let Party Members Pick Who They Want, and said their preferred aspirant was Farouk Akintunde.
One of the party leaders who led the protest, Balogun Ololade, urged Gov Dapo Abiodun to intervene in the matter to save democracy from jeopardy.
Between DSS and regional separatists
Repeated warnings by the DSS to persons and groups whose utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of the ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of the majority common folks of this country, were beginning to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience forced the prime suspects out of their deceptive demeanour.
Lingering questions about who or which persons and groups the security agency was referring to were promptly vapourized in the heated rhetorical outbursts of the nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
It then dawned on all that indeed these were the persons and groups that have continued to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against one another in order to apparently inflame the embers of tribal and religious discord, as the DSS charged in one of its warnings.
Interestingly, none of these prime suspects in the exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence in some parts of the country could categorically distance itself from the treacherous and subversive activities detected by the security agency.
They chorused a common conviction that the DSS knows those responsible, differing only in the respective directions of their accusing fingers.
While Afenifere retorted these people know those who are responsible for these acts but can't touch them because of their connections, PANDEV rehashed its grouse about many people feeling alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, asking who are the people?
Since the DSS knows them and their satanic mission, they should be proactive in dealing with them.
The NEF sounded unconvinced with if there are people pushing the country into deeper crises and they are known; they should be treated according to the law.
You don't have to be a spook to know what the DSS knows about each and all of these flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics in Nigeria or to understand why they all know that DSS knows them yet they insist on passing the buck outside their cliques.
The truth is that these champions of ethnic politics know of no better solution to Nigeria's myriad problems than for their sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord it over the rest of the country as rulers, not leaders!
So desperate and unscrupulous are they in pursuing their inordinate ambitions that they absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate their geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising the territorial contours of their enclaves with the frenzied ease of cutting their portion of the remaining crumbs of the proverbial national cake.
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, is easier said than done.
These regional groups actually constitute major hindrances to the steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence that Nigeria has been labouring for since flag independence.
For as long as they continue to parade the political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long will they regard Nigeria as an entitlement for their ethnic stake in the population, to be claimed or seized and, if all else fails, deconstructed and disowned as a failed state.
Whenever they meet, the agenda is not for Nigeria's progress and development, unless its leadership is firmly in their grasp, otherwise it is all about heckling and jostling around with barely concealed determination to deploy the notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against the incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether it is ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, their existence and activities will always be antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.
Another undeniable indictment of these regional separatists is that they are all self-styled political pressure groups masquerading as representatives of various ethnic groups.
From their membership, it is plain to see that they consist of ex-this
Ironically, this political deficiency gives them the impetus to come together, desperate to remain relevant in a democratic system run entirely by elected representatives through registered political parties with legislative and executive institutions constitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
The geo-ethnic groups only have a nasty nuisance value in our democratic setting as they persist in acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as they often threaten and attempt, so that, perchance, they can regain political relevance if not control.
That is why their frequent clandestine meetings trigger security alerts!
With such predator-politicians lurking around the perimeters of power with dubious intent of undermining an elected government just because they are not involved, it is beyond reasonable doubt that there must be a convergence of interest linking their overt activities and the covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.
Double jeopardy aptly describes the predicament of the Buhari administration having to contend with such array of formidable foes unleashing incessant assaults on national security in a time of unprecedented economic adversity.
To that extent, there can only be two groups of politicians: those who are positively participating in the democratic dispensation as partners in moving the nation forward against all odds and those who are negatively engaged in sowing seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize the country.
By their utterances and activities, we all know them!
At the end of the day, the majority of Nigerians are ordinary citizens whose conditions of survival were not determined by and not dependent on the geography of their origin.
Their daily struggles to eke a living are sustained by submission to the will of One God irrespective of differences of faith.
Nigeria is their destined fatherland to which they remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing they have no other country to call theirs, collectively showing how citizenship breeds true patriotism.
They too know that Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one another in order to inflame the embers of tribal and religious discord for the political ambitions of their leaders.
Hence the poor man's prayer remains:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER!

10 killed as terrorists attempt to attack army formation
Troops of the Nigerian Army, on Saturday, neutralised not less than 10 members of Boko Haram terrorists who attempted to launch an attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Rann, the headquarters of Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State.
This is coming barely 24 hours after the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Maj.-Gen.
Farouk Yahaya, assumed leadership of the Nigerian Army.
The spokesman of the Nigerian Army, Brig.-Gen.
Mohammed Yerima, in a statement made available, explained that the terrorists, who came in their numbers, mounted on gun trucks and attempted to infiltrate the main entrance to the town.
Yerima said, The highly spirited troops were right on hand to counter the move and inflicted a humiliating defeat on the terrorists who abandoned their evil mission and took to their heels.
The troops chased the retreating terrorist and ensured there was no further threat to the town and its residents.
Troops successfully destroyed one of the gun trucks and recovered multiple weapons including one anti-aircraft gun, two machine guns and eight AK-47 rifles neutralising ten terrorists in the process.
Daily Trust reports that the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, had on Friday charged the new COAS to ensure he built on late Attahiru's legacy by defeating enemies terrorising the Northeast and other regions of the country.
Second U.S. congresswoman tests positive for COVID-19 after Capitol unrest
Pramila Jayapal, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, said she contracted the Coronavirus (COVID-19) after being locked down in the same room with a number of Republican lawmakers who refused to wear masks during the unrest in the Capitol last week.
I just received a positive COVID-19 test result after being locked down in a secured room at the Capitol where several Republicans not only cruelly refused to wear a mask but recklessly mocked colleagues and staff who offered them one, Jayapal said in a post on her official Twitter account.
Earlier on Monday, U.S. Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman said she also contracted COVID-19 following possible exposure during the lockdown in the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Jayapal, who is a member of the Democratic Party, accused the Republican lawmakers of causing a COVID-19 superspreader event and called for punishment against them.
Any member who refuses to wear a mask should be fully held accountable for endangering our lives because of their selfish idiocy.
m calling for every single member who refuses to wear a mask in the Capitol to be fined and removed from the floor by the Sergeant at Arms, she said in a post on Twitter.
It is unclear if the two congresswomen were in the same room during the lockdown in the Capitol.
Jayapal decried U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and vowed to do everything in her power to remove him from office.
Man, 30, arraigned over assault on woman in Edo
The police have arraigned one Gabriel Fidelis, 30, before an Ogbeson chief magistrates court in Benin for allegedly assaulting a woman identified as Rebecca Izevbigie.
The accused was arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, unlawful assault and malicious damage punishable under sections, 516, 355, and 451 of the Criminal Code.
The prosecutor, Sgt. Kehinde Iyare, told the court that the accused conspired with others at large to commit the offence on April 11, at Estate Quarters, along Benin-Agbor Road, Benin City.
She further told the court that the accused, with others now at large, unlawfully assaulted one Rebecca Izevbigie by hitting and biting her.
She added that the accused also used iron rod to break her leg.
She further told the court that on March 31, 2021 the defendant did intentionally and maliciously damage one of the complainants wash hand basins valued at N8,000.
The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge while his counsel, Mrs E. E Idahosa, applied for his bail, saying he would not jump bail.
Thereafter, Chief Magistrate Mutairu Oare, granted the accused bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety.
He said the surety must deposit two recent passport photographs of himself and that of the defendant with the court.
He ordered that the Court registrar should verify the information supplied about the surety's residence and adjourned the case to May 10, for hearing.
Why National Assembly can't impeach Buhari Oyo Senator
The Senator representing Oyo North Senatorial District, Fatai Buhari, has said the National Assembly is yet to see a reason to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari.
The senator who stated this when he paid a Sallah visit to a former governor of Oyo State, Rashidi Ladoja, said there is a process for impeaching a president.
Senator Buhari's submission is coming a day after Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf (APC Taraba) and chairman of senate committee on special duties said impeaching President Buhari would not end insecurity in the country.
There have been calls for President Buhari's resignation or impeachment following the spate of insecurity in the country.
But Senator Buhari has asked those calling for secession in the country not to create a problem that would not be easily solved.
Impeaching the president has a process.
Anybody calling for the impeachment of the president should give a genuine reason that warrants the impeachment.
We are yet to see a reason to impeach the president.
If there is a need, then, we shall table it, discuss it and the two houses must come together.
Impeaching the president is not what someone will just wake up one day and call for.
There is a procedure for it.
Why do you want to cause a problem and create confusion that you cannot solve?
he queried.
Speaking on the security challenges bedevilling the country, the lawmaker said; We have no other country than Nigeria.
Nigeria is our country and our home.
We should try to do internal security.
We should play our own part; we should not leave everything to the government alone.
There should be local police that will be able to know the terrain.
We know ourselves no matter how it can be.
In the early 80s, we used to travel at night.
But the level of insecurity in the country, something fundamental is missing.
He disclosed that the 9th National Assembly had discussed the security issue for over 50 times.
We discussed the security issue over 30 times in the 8th Assembly, and this present 9th Assembly has also discussed it over 50 times.
Let everybody be vigilant, even if we change our service chiefs many times, that cannot solve our security challenges, the senator said.
Ranchers back CBN's forex restriction for dairy imports
The Commercial Ranchers Association of Nigeria (CODARAN) has expressed support for the restriction placed on access to foreign exchange for dairy products.
Recall that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular over a year ago on restricted companies seeking foreign exchange through the official window to import milk and dairy products.
But during a recent visit to the governor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele, the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said the European Union (EU) had filed a complaint against Nigeria over the restriction.
In a statement by Dianabasi Akpainyang, the CODARAN noted that Nigeria had the potential to harvest dairy products that would provide jobs and create investments in local production of milk.
The CBN governor is right.
Nigeria truly has the potential to sustainably meet its dairy requirements.
Akpainyang noted that the milk available for collection and processing may not be anywhere near the figure at the moment, but pointed out that since the likelihood is there, it is necessary for everyone to put their feet on fire due to the urgency required to develop the local dairy sector.
While citing a report by the CBN that Nigeria spends about $1.5billion on importing dairy products annually, he said the figure would increase as the demand for dairy products increased.
He identified issues like poor productivity of local cattle breeds, cattle nutrition, animal disease management systems, lack of organised milk collection processes, limited access to finance, insecurity, poor infrastructure, insufficient extension services, inadequate processing and storage facilities, low investment in research and development and minimal adoption of modern technology as the major problems bedevilling the sector.
He, however, said the problems were tackled by the Advancing Local Dairy Development in Nigeria (ALDDN) programme, which is currently running in four states Adamawa, Kaduna, Kano and Plateau.
PDP kicks as APC claims registering 2.5m in Lagos
There is uproar following the disclosure by the All Progressives Congress (APC) that it registered 2.5 million members in Lagos during the nationwide registration and revalidation exercise.
Chairman of the APC Lagos Registration Supervisory Committee, Dr. Muhammad Bashiru, had said during the closing and presentation of recommendation letters to the supervisors that about 2.5 million members were registered across the 20 local government areas in the state.
But the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which is the leading opposition party, described the figure as false and fake.
PDP said APC was in the habit of concocting figures to give an impression of acceptability.
The PDP spokesman, Taofik Gani, in a chat with Daily Trust described the APC as a party of liars, saying it had become unpopular in the state.
This is not the first time they would be bandying figures around which are false.
Even in the last election, the total number of votes by APC was around 600,000.
The 2.5 million claim is false and fake, he said.
Our correspondent report say APC candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu win di governorship election for 2019 with 739,445 votes while President Muhammadu Buhari get 580,825 vote for di presidential election.
Also speaking, the state chairman of National Conscience Party (NCP), Comrade Bayo Ogunleye, described the claim by the APC as the greatest lie of the century.
But APC spokesman Seye Oladejo told our correspondent that the party would prove its numerical strength in the forthcoming July 24 local government election.
Geographical Indication will promote diversification of economy FG
The Federal Government has stressed that Geographical Indications (GIs) will help in promoting diversification of the economy and also support participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, made this known at the capacity building workshop on GIs for public sector/policymakers in Nigeria in Abuja.
Nanono, who was represented by the Deputy Director of Irrigation and Crop development, Haija Sugra Mahmood, noted that the initiative if properly harnessed, will also support the preservation of the country's biodiversity that is facing an existential threat from the effects of climate change and the attendant destruction of the environment.
According to him, it can assist in commercializing the products of food culture and other aspects of culture thus enabling the value chain actors to benefit from the commercialization, especially women and youth in the rural space who are mainly involved in the production of these products.
Therefore, this workshop comes at a crucial moment when this administration is working tirelessly to diversify the country's economy away from Hydrocarbons, by promoting other sectors such as Agriculture, Manufacturing, Mining, Tourism etc.
Initiatives such as this that promote the GIs will help to fast track the processes in the diversification of the economy and also support our participation in the African Continental Free Trade Area as well as globally.
GIs can be catalytic in reviving the rural economy as we have seen it happen in the case of some products that have been properly branded such as Ofada Rice, Kilishi, Dudu Osun, etc.
It will also enable the documentation of our indigenous knowledge which sadly we are losing as time passes.
The current administration stands ready to partner with all the relevant stakeholders both local and foreign in its bid to preserve the natural and bio-cultural diversity endowment in the country and also exploit it to strengthen the resilience of the economy, so as to provide a decent livelihood for all Nigerians, he stated.
Earlier, the Minister of State Industry, Trade and Investment, Haija Mariam Katagum, in her welcome address, said that the workshop is specifically designed to train Public Sector and Policy Makers in Nigeria, with a view to examining the possibilities of adopting Geographical Indications (GIs) legislation and policy into Nigeria's industrial property and agricultural landscape.
She said that it is imperative to also highlight the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA), which puts a responsibility on decision-makers, to begin the discourse of updating industrial property legislation.
Israeli president holds talks in search for new govt
Israel's President Reuven Rivlin is preparing for talks with top politicians on forming a government after caretaker Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to do so following inconclusive elections in March.
According to Rivlins office, talks with Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party and the former opposition leader Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid (Future) party is scheduled for Wednesday morning.
The head of state also invited representatives of the other parties represented in parliament to present their positions on the progress of the government formation process.
A deadline for right-winger Netanyahu to form a governing coalition expired overnight.
This means that the camp of Netanyahu's opponents is facing a chance to end the 71-year-old era as head of government.
Whether they will succeed, however, is still completely open.
A new election is still not out of the question as Israel remains in a political crisis.
Netanyahu remains at the head of an interim government for the time being.
He has been in office continuously for 12 years and is the longest-serving head of government in Israel's history.
A corruption trial is underway against him,he, however, rejects the accusations made in it.
It was expected that Rivlin might appoint opposition leader Lapid to form the government.
His party belongs to the political centre; at the end of March, it became the second-strongest force in the fourth parliamentary election in two years.
Rivlin could also give the mandate to the Knesset.
In this case, each Member of Parliament can try to find the support of 61 of the 120 members within 21 days.
Ganduje frees 123 prison inmates for eid-el-Fitr
Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano has granted freedom to 123 prison inmates across the state.
Ganduje, who witnessed the release of the inmates from Goron Dutse Prison on Thursday, said the gesture was in the spirit of the Eid-El Fitr celebration.
He said the beneficiaries were selected based on the gravity of offences and signs of reformation while in prison.
The governor said that the decision to visit the prison was to show the inmates that the state government was aware of their existence and that they were also regarded as citizens of the state.
Ganduje said that the gesture was to complement the Federal Government's efforts to further reduce congestion in the nation's prisons.
He advised the ex-inmates to change their attitudes to life and pray for peace and stability in Nigeria.
The governor also gave each of the freed inmates N5,000 as transport fare to their various destination.
Earlier, the Comptroller of Prisons in Kano, Suleiman Suleiman, thanked the governor for freeing thousands of inmates since his coming into office.
Suleiman advised the freed inmates to stay off crime to avoid going back to prison.
Ganduje also visited remand homes and Kano children's home in the metropolis as part Sallah celebration.
Korda breaks through on Parma clay
On the eve of Roland Garros, 20-year-old American Sebastian Korda scored a career breakthrough when he beat Italian Marco Cecchinato, 6-2, 6-4, in Parma for a first title.
Korda, the son of former world
No 2 and Australian Open winner Petr Korda, had never reached a final on the ATP tour and before the Parma event, had never won consecutive matches on clay.
Cecchinato, who won all three of his titles on clay, comes from Brescia, 90 kilometres from Parma.
The fans allowed into the first-time event supported for the local boy.
Today I played a really tough opponent and the crowd wasn't easy, Korda said.
They kept cheering him on, but I'm really proud of myself
and how I handled it.
Although his father is Czech, Sebastian Korda, who was born in Florida, chose to represent the US.
Saturday's victory made him the first American player to win a clay court tournament since Sam Querrey in Belgrade 11 years ago.
This is something that I've dreamed of, Korda said, adding that he had expected to win a title sooner, naming an event in Florida in January.
I really thought I was going to get it done in Delray Beach, and I was a little heartbroken.
What not to wear in public: Negating Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Was it pure coincidence that, as trouble was brewing in Kwara State recently, a solution to its kind was being considered in the lower House of the National Assembly in the capital territory Abuja?
The trouble in Ilorin was over the refusal of some Christian faith schools to allow their Muslim students wear hijab to the schools.
The solution to this impasse was the debate on the Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, derisively tagged Hijab Bill by a section of the Nigerian media.
Both events sparked heated and often emotional debates that, at the bottom of it all, threaten to negate Nigeria's multicultural identity and reality.
The whole idea in Kwara of the proprietors of the schools banning hijab-adorning Muslim students and their sympathisers can be reduced to what not to wear in public.
This is also the major part of the concern of the RDPP Bill before the House of Representatives the humiliation and denial of opportunities
female Nigerians are faced with because of what they wear in public.
The former is clearly in breach of the fundamental human rights of the Muslim students to express their faith without discrimination; even though the school may have their defence for taking such a position.
The latter is trying to assert this right not only for Muslims but also Christians wherever or whenever they are threatened with discrimination based on their professed faith.
Running through the argument of the proprietors of the Christian faith schools in Kwara, one could easily understand the pragmatic appeal of the argument that Muslim children should go to other schools elsewhere if they don't want to conform.
The problems with this argument are many.
First, to say Muslim students should go elsewhere unless they conform to the school's rule on uniform does very little to promote inclusiveness, which is the bedrock of our multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondly, the position begs the moral question: is it justifiable to base a school rule because of Christian majoritarian nature of the school?
Then, thirdly, the go elsewhere argument appears to ignore the difficulties in changing a school for a child.
The inconvenience is huge.
The act of changing schools for a child, educational psychologists will tell you, interferes negatively with not only its emotional but academic development too.
Finally, the Christian faith schools by themselves risk what is called ghettorization by concentrating students with the same religious beliefs in particular schools.
The social cost this exacts on the society is enormous.
The Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argues, when speaking to the press, that the government is convinced that its policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear their hijab in public schools will lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony anchored on mutual respect and understanding.
In a country that guarantees freedom of religion, signed the declaration of International Human Rights, the basic question to ask is: how justifiable is it to deny a Nigerian child access to a school of its choice on the basis of the manifestation of its religion?
It is a great concern because Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
The UDHR insists that all human beings are free and equal, regardless of colour, creed or religion.
It contains 30 articles on rights and freedoms that include, among others, civil and political rights, like the right to life, free speech and privacy.
It also includes economic, social and cultural rights, like the right to health and education.
I find articles 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to the issue under consideration and quote them in full below:
Article 18: Everyone has the freedom to think or believe what they want, including the right to religious belief.
We have the right to change our beliefs or religion at any time, and the right to publicly or privately practise our chosen religion, alone or with others.
Everyone has the right to education.
Primary schooling should be free.
We should all be able to continue our studies as far as we wish.
At school we should be helped to develop our talents, and be taught an understanding and respect for everyone's human rights.
We should also be taught to get on with others whatever their ethnicity, religion, or country they come from.
Our parents have the right to choose what kind of school we go to.
These types of laws were the instruments that gave Muslim ladies like Ilhan Omar the equality to sit in the House of Representatives in the US wearing her Hijab without any form of molestation or discrimination.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omar is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 5th congressional district since 2019.
It is a bill sponsored by the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Finance and member representing Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency of Niger State, Hon.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi.
The bill is seeking to address discriminatory conducts and prohibit religious discrimination concerning hiring or recruitment, terms and conditions of employment.
It will prohibit qualifying/professional bodies, educational institutions, employment agencies, and other sectors from discriminating against persons, students or personnel based on their religious belief or its manifestation.
When passed, the law will bury issues such as what we saw in Kwara for good.
It will also address the bigotry of some employers, or those executives who take their prejudice to public office and allow it to becloud their sense of judgment.
The law should be a welcome development.
After all, it is only to expand and expatiate the provisions of Nigeria's constitution and the UDHR document as explained above.
It is in line with similar laws passed recently in the country seeking to tackle social menace and harmful cultural practice the Disability Law and the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP).
While disability seeks to eradicate all forms of discrimination based on a persons disabilities, VAPP is addressing domestic and other gender-based violence in the country.
One at a time, our representatives in the legislative chambers are tackling the social menaces bedeviling our country through legal instruments.
They are addressing these social ills not because there were no prior generic laws that cover them but because they need to be addressed more comprehensively to leave no room for opacity.
While UDHR may seem like a far, distant document with no instrument of enforcement, the RDPP Law and others like it are provided to allocate punishments for offenders.
Contrary to the view of its critics, as far as the RDPP Bill is concerned, there is nothing to show attempts at seeking the enthronement of a state religion on any state that may domesticate the law eventually.
It does not go against Section 10 of the Nigerian Constitution that says The Government of the Federation or of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion.
To peddle this argument, because the bill calls on the general public to respect the rights of Muslim women that wear Hijab in public spaces smacks of Islamophobia only.
In the final analysis, to deny a Nigerian male or female his or her religious freedom negates our multicultural pretenses.
It negates the concept of equality, and basic human right as enshrined in Nigeria's constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights legal document.
A bill that will criminalize such decimations based on religious grounds, like the RDPP bill, is a welcome development.

Niger's President Issoufou wins N1.905bn African leadership prize
Nigers President Mahamadou Issoufou has been announced the 2020 winner of the $5m (N1.905 billion)
Ibrahim prize for African leadership.
Issoufou has served two five-year terms as president from 2011 to 2020.
He is set to be succeeded by former interior minister, Mohamed Bazoum, who won the presidential election last month.
The prize committee praised the Nigerien president's leadership after inheriting one of the worlds poorest economies.
It said he fostered economic growth, shown unwavering commitment to regional stability and to the constitution, and championed African democracy.
Mr Issoufou is the sixth recipient of the Ibrahim Prize.
He has tweeted that the prize honours all Nigerien people.
I consider this award an encouragement to continue to think and act in such a way that promotes democratic values and good governance, not only in Niger, but in Africa and around the world, he added.
Previous winners of the prize include Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia (2017), President Hifikepunye Pohamba of Namibia (2014), President Pedro Pires of Cabo Verde (2011), President Festus Mogae of Botswana (2008) and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique (2007).
KEDCO gets taskforce to enforce collection, check meter bypass
The Management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has formed a taskforce to enforce payment of electricity bills.
In a statement by Ibrahim Sani Shawai, the Head of Corporate Communications, KEDCO, the taskforce has been empowered to ensure that current and outstanding bills are collected as this would help KEDCO consolidate on the numerous reforms to improve power supply.
The taskforce is also to check issues of meter bypass, illegal connections, energy theft and other forms of sabotage.
In this regard, anyone found engaging in any forms of sabotage would be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land, it stated.
We are appealing to all customers to remain vigilant on all our installations while ensuring that their meters are properly protected against vandals.
We also assure all our customers that our metering initiative which is aimed at ending estimated billing and giving customers the opportunity to pay for what they consume, is still ongoing, the statement stated.
IBEDC warns traders under power lines
The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) has warned against trading under high-tension wire to avoid disasters.
Chief Operating Officer (COO), Engr John Ayodele, gave the charge against the backdrop of the increasing trading activities under high tension wires.
In Osogbo, the Osun State capital, mechanic shops, block industries, car wash shops, POS shops and petty trading are common features sighted under high tension wires along Power Line and Ring roads.
Engr Ayodele, therefore, pleaded with residents to take safety precautions as very important and advised those trading under high tension wires to move away to safe areas.
He also pleaded with residents not to engage quacks to fix power faults and assured that IBEDC technical crew would be available to rectify any fault that might arise.
He cautioned those in the habit of harassing IBEDC staff while going about their lawful duties to desist, saying IBEDC would explore all available legal options to seek redress should any of its staff become a victim of harassment.
He said, It is also important that other safety precautions such as proper supervision of children is ensured to prevent electrical accidents.
10 newborn babies die in Indian hospital fire
Ten newborn babies died on Saturday in a fire at a state-run hospital in western India, officials said.
There were 17 infants in the unit for sick newborn babies when the fire broke out in the early hours of Saturday at the Bhandara District General Hospital in Maharashtra state.
Seven infants died due to smoke suffocation, and three from burn injuries, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.
Seven babies were rescued by the nurses and ward staff.
All the infants were aged between a few days and three months, Bhandara district health official Prashant Uike said.
The government has ordered a probe into the incident and a safety audit of all neo-natal care units in the state.
Initial reports indicated that the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in one of the incubators, Tope said.
The staff said the ward quickly filled with lots of black smoke, the minister added.
Legal requirements for a post-mortem had been waived and the bodies of the children handed to their families, Tope added.
Families of the victims would be given compensation of 500,000 rupees (about 6,814 dollars) each.
Police go after newspaper vendors over reports on IPOB
Newspaper vendors and readers in Aba, the commercial hub of Abia State, are currently being harassed by the police.
Daily Trust gathered since the weekend, policemen from the Aba Area Command have been carrying out arrest of newspaper vendors and readers over reports on the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
Residents said there was tension at Ama-Ogbonna Junction in the commercial city when police raided the place on Sunday.
An eyewitness said residents scampered for safety, as police officers shot sporadically, while trying to arrest a newspaper vendor and readers.
The vendors were accused of distributing newspapers which had stories on the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
Dr. Elendu Ukoh, one of the eyewitness, appealed to the state government and Igbo leaders to call the police authorities rein in on their men so as not to create crisis in the city.
The kind of people we put into police these days make me wonder if we really want anything good out of this country called Nigeria.
How can someone be chasing newspaper vendors around in Aba, in this modern world?
If you stop people from reading hard copies of newspapers, will you also stop them from reading the same stories on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, among others?
What manner of primitive policing is this?
They caused panic on Sunday by their shooting and noisemaking.
The whole neighborhood thought that they were chasing kidnappers.
It was later that we discovered that police came to arrest a vendor and readers, who gathered in his newspaper stand.
How can police be fighting newspaper vendors?
What manner of problem can paper cause that Social Media cannot cause 20 times over.
This people are not normal, he said.
Michael Anorue, another resident, said almost all the vendor stands he visited in Aba
on Tuesday were empty.
He said, We learnt they were saying on Saturday and Sunday that the newspapers had stories on the sit-at-home order in honour of Biafran heroes and my question is what is wrong with it?
The early political leaders in South East, remind these reckless police officers that Biafra is bigger than IPOB the better for them.
Does proscription of IPOB mean that Biafra has been proscribed too?
We're all Biafrans!
On the 30th of May, the World Igbo Congress (WIC) held a zoom conversation, talking about Biafran fallen heroes.
Why can't police go to YouTube, Zoom and other social media that aired it?
All they do is to come to streets and start looking for unnecessary trouble.
I wish the leaders in Igboland will warn those reckless police officers not to allow what's happening in Imo State to enter Aba, because it will be worst for everybody.
SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), denied that the police arrested newspaper vendors and readers in Aba.
NAMA kicks as air traffic controllers lament poor tools
Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) in Nigeria on Sunday cried out over dilapidated navigational equipment at most airports in the country.
The ATCs under the aegis of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), said the situation posed a threat to air safety.
They also claimed that the Kaduna International Airport had no control tower which would aid safe aircraft navigation.
The President of NATCA, Yomi Agoro, in a chat with newsmen at the weekend, said what existed at the Kaduna airport was a watch room used by other aviation personnel and not a control tower exclusive for air traffic controllers.
He also said other airports in the country lacked the necessary equipment for seamless navigation.
He explained that Some airports do not even have functioning equipment.
Even Kaduna does not have a control tower.
What they are using there is a watch room (for firefighters), which is not built for that purpose, and we have been calling on the government to do something.
We go to Sokoto, once it rains today, controllers will go to look for umbrellas to sit at the control tower, and what is it, some of the control towers attached to the terminal buildings were ceded to FAAN, while those standing alone were with NAMA, but we have approached the two organisations.
We are still battling with terrestrial radio frequency, communication here and there.
Calabar is there; there is no airport you will go to today that you would say things are working 80 per cent.
NAMA had recently employed and trained 40 new controllers, but NATCA said the number was too low to meet the shortfall.
However, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Fola Akinkuotu, told Daily Trust that the claims were not true.
He said the federal government had invested hugely in improving navigational aids and aiding safe flight operations.
He said, It is mere politics.
The government has spent so much in the recent past in improving aviation infrastructure.
I am saying this not because I am the MD of NAMA.
If you want to hear the truth, my suggestion has always been, ask the people on the streets, ask the people in NAMA, they would tell you, they have never had it so good under this administration.
It is painful that people would be talking this way.
We never had a Category Three (CAT3), this government put two in place, two others are coming.
Government has just spent N1.7bn on a mobile control tower.
Also there is an ongoing revitalisation of the safe tower.
We are revamping the TRACON (Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria) system.
Other sectors should be jealous of us.
E-commerce in Nigeria: Legal framework, challenges and prospect
E-commerce refers to the use of communications technology particularly the internet to buy, sell and market goods and services to customers.
The internet has brought about a fundamental shift in national economies that are isolated from each other by barriers to cross-border trade and investment, isolated by distance, time zone and languages and isolated by the national differences in government regulations.
E-commerce equally fosters direct access to distant markets and promotes globalisation and commercial activities and blur many of the current distinctions between domestic and foreign companies to an extent that it becomes practically impossible to determine the origin of the products.
E-commerce is not limited to the purchase of a product, it includes e-mail, and other communications platforms, all information or services that a company may offer to customers over the net, from pre-purchase information to aftersale service and support.
The major significance of E-commerce thus lies in the fact that it encourages a single world trading system, which is facilitated by access through electronic means to goods and services from different parts of the world.
Most of the existing statues in Nigeria lag behind towards the development and growth of e-commerce in particular and ICT as a whole.
So many legal researches and studies on e-commerce in Nigeria have been conducted.
Most of these studies are of the opinion that the Nigerian legal system lags behind ICT-based legislation and that the existing statutory laws are quite inadequate to address some of the legal issues affecting e-commerce.
These issues include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, and many more.
There is, therefore, the need to map out appropriate legal and regulatory measures, to govern the emerging regime.
It has been stated severally that in Nigeria, significant efforts at the regulation of e-commerce-related activities are still at the stage of Draft Bills before the National Assembly.
It is important to note that, even where these bills are passed into law, Nigeria may still face new legal issues in this area that will call for legislative intervention.
Given the speed with which the internet is permeating commercial transactions in Nigeria, especially in the banking and telecommunications sectors of the economy, the best that can be suggested is that the legal issues and problems presently confronting e-commerce in the country should be addressed directly and expeditiously, in the interests of the teeming population of Nigerian consumers.
To achieve this, the National Assembly should be pressuriSed into passing bills concerning electronic commerce, a top priority so that they can be enacted into law as quickly as possible.
In the interim, our courts should take a giant stride by interpreting the existing traditional laws liberally so as to bridge the gaps therein in order to make such laws amenable to electronic transactions, particularly in the emerging trend of the present-day information age.
Indeed, it was argued that legislation is not the only means by which electronic transaction and attendant documentation may be facilitated legally.
The courts may also adapt to recognise electronic transactions in the absence of legislation or private contract.
As the then Justice Bingham once put it thus: the common law has in the hands of judges the same facility [as the law merchant] for adapting itself to the changing needs of the general public; principles do not alter, but old rules of applying the change, and new rules spring into existence.
It is hoped that this judicial activism would be adopted by other Nigerian judges, Supreme Court justices inclusive, especially in the areas where our existing legislation are grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to address legal challenges of the emerging technological advancements.
This will certainly set a good precedence to ensure the protection of e-commerce consumers, entice investors and above all bring about economic development and sustainability in the country.
The germane issues with regards to contracts in E-commerce are documentation and signature.
The provision of section 4 of the Statute of Fraud, 1677 or Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and our various statutes on real property and landed instruments, all of which require certain contracts to be in writing and be duly executed .The
question then is would an electronic mark or sign constitute a valid sign-off of a contract by email and be binding?
Many of these issues are still not quite settled even in the UK although some decisions incline favourably towards interpreting electronic signature
so marks in emails as satisfying the traditional requirement of writing and due execution.
E-commerce transactions are paperless transactions made through magnetic materials such as tapes or disks.
These are in contradistinction to the paper-based transactions that are embodied in a permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures usually authenticated by signatures.
Such transactions can therefore not be altered without an alteration on the face of the document.
With respect to signatures, by the provision of section 93(2)(3), evidence act 2011, an electronic signature in relation to a data message conveniently satisfies any requirement for a handwritten signature in so far as it sufficiently identifies an electronic record to the individual.
The provision of article 7 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law on e-commerce 1996 is equally trite on this issue.
Thus, for the purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures.
The use of a password, identification, user names etc may suffice.
Hence one may safely posit that electronic signatures for the purpose of execution are admissible in evidence provided it is certified and incorporated in an electronic communication in the course of an e-transaction.
Also, other legal challenges affecting e-commerce include the formation of contracts.
The element for a valid formation of contract includes an offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter into legal relation.
The question is at what point can an offer be made with regards to an electronic business transaction or how to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer an electronic transaction, at what point can it be said that an intention to enter legal relation is made?
E-commerce requires confidence and trust the satisfaction that transmitted orders or invoices have not been altered and emanate from whoever they appear to be from.
There is a need for a guaranteed level of privacy /confidentiality with respect to information.
Lastly, the alarming rate of cybercrimes in Nigeria, high level of illiteracy.
Electronic commerce is no doubt an aspect of commercial transaction in Nigeria and it has come to stay in this time.
The government should go beyond creating laws, to activate utilisation of the electronic delivery platforms in its commercial interactions and for delivery of government services.

Chad passes new charter naming Deby's son president
Chad has passed a charter declaring Mahamat Idriss Deby president, despite rumours of his death trending on social media.
Mahamat takes over in place of his father, Idriss Deby, who was killed this week.
The charter said the 37-year-old son of the late war veteran, who on Tuesday was swiftly named transitional leader as head of a military council following his father's death, will occupy the functions of the president of the republic and also serve as head of the armed forces.
The charter repeals the preceding constitution and will be implemented as the basic law of the republic, according to its terms.
The younger Deby has also been named supreme head of the armed forces, it said.
Deby's son had overseen his father's security as head of the elite presidential guard and had often appeared alongside him.
Mahamat Deby is best known as a top commander of the Chadian forces assisting a United Nations peacekeeping mission in the restive north of neighbouring Mali.
He signed a decree Tuesday setting out a military council with 15 generals, including himself and 14 others known to have been part of the late president's circle of loyalists.
The council is tasked with an 18-month transition toward free and democratic elections.
Mahamat Idriss Deby also chairs the military transition council, the council of ministers, the councils and superior committees of national defence, according to the charter.
The new head of state will promulgate legislation adopted by the 69 members of the national transition council, who are named directly by Mahamat.
The Transition Charter, which contains 95 articles, also guarantees freedom of opinion, conscience and worship.
A transition government has been set up, whose members are named by the new president.
The members of the army who are called to the transition government are discharged from all military duties, the charter said.
Chadian law
The slain leader, who ruled with an iron fist for nearly 30 years, succumbed to wounds suffered during a visit to the battlefield in the country's north where Chadian soldiers fought against a rebel group, the military announced on Tuesday.
Calling for calm, the army also announced a 6pm curfew and shut the country's borders, while suspending the constitution and dissolving the National Assembly.
However, opposition politicians in Chad have rejected the army's appointment of President Idriss Dby's son to take over in the wake of his death.
Experts say that under Chadian law, the speaker of parliament should have taken power after Deby;s death and not his son.
What the constitution says is that in the absence of the president or in case he dies, then the speaker of the parliament takes charge of the country for 40 days and so a transition is put in place until elections are held, Al Jazeera's Hiba Morgan, reporting from the capital, Ndjamena, said earlier on Tuesday.
[But] the military announced that the legislative assembly has been dissolved and that the constitution also has been dissolved, so what they are doing is that they replaced the constitution with their own set of rules.
Chelsea face possible points deduction after brawl with Leicester
Chelsea are facing possible points deduction by he FA for the team's failure to control their players, Mirror reports.
In seven years, the team have been found pants down in seven hot-tempered rows with opponents.
The recent brawl during a clash on Tuesday night with Leicester marked the seventh encounter Chelsea had with Premier League teams.
Last week match between Chelsea and Leicester was marred by skirmishes between the players of both teams.
Citing similar offenses in the past, the FA decided to punish Chelsea.
Leicester have also been charged for their role in the brawl that involved players and coaching staff following Ricardo Pereira's challenge on Ben Chilwell.
In 2016, Chelsea were also charged for indiscipline that they had to be warned, after appealing against 375,000 dollar levy for their part in a mass bust-up during a match against Tottenham.
If affected, the points deduction will significantly affect their season as they head into a final campaign for a top four spot.
US Africom in Nigeria? Heck No!
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
That was the resentful and contemptuous opinion many British people came to have of the thousands of American GIs stationed in several military bases in Britain during the Second World War.
The gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers frequently got into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights which built up a feeling of disdain for the yanks among the locals.
And this has been the pattern of behaviour among American soldiers everywhere in the hundreds of American military bases overseas from Okinawa in Japan, Stuttgart in Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir in Turkey and Pampanga in the Philippines.
That is why I am perturbed, like many Nigerians, that in a virtual meeting last week with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari was reported to have asked that the United States considers relocating the African Command (Africom) of its military presently based in the southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.
It is presumed that with this call, President Buhari is making a pitch for Nigeria to host Africom.
In the first place, it was a breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold that meeting with the American Secretary of State.
The meeting should have been with Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who would then transmit the details afterwards to the president.
Yes, America is a superpower and all that, but protocol is protocol and should be followed strictly in all circumstances.
Understandably, Nigeria is currently faced with gargantuan internal insecurity issues which seem to defy the best efforts of government and the nation's security establishment in tackling it.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency in the North East, banditry, kidnapping in the North West, farmers/herders clashes all over the country and the targeted killing of security and law enforcement personnel and other Nigerians coupled with the destruction of institutional buildings in the South East, constitute the cocktail of insecurity now ravaging the country.
But even at that, the call for the hosting of the Africom on Nigerian soil when considered against the various issues and implications of this move to Nigeria is hardly justified.
Africom is one of nine such commands by the American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around the world.
By their doctrine and operational modus, these commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, are not set up primarily to concern themselves with the security and law enforcement issues of their area of coverage.
They only do so when such issues directly affect American interests in the area and in such situations, they are not mandated to yield their modus operandi and share intelligence with the local security and law enforcement agencies.
If Africom is set up in Nigeria for instance, it will be an island of its own restricting access to Nigerians of all categories and establishing a jurisdiction within the territorial area of the base that will be virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.
As it always happens with American military bases outside America, Africom will be a forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against the host country.
In the particular case of Africom, part of its original concept was actually to contain the growing strategic influence of Nigeria in West Africa and Africa following our successful peace enforcement efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone and our sterling records of peace keeping around the world.
Africom's precursor was the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) set up by the Clinton administration to counter Nigeria's strategic interests in Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, the dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, made many secret and open visits to a number of African countries to sell the idea.
But because Nigeria was the target, he pointedly left it out from his itinerary.
Senegal, which is not far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, was to be the coordinating base of the ACRI and though it was touted as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, its secret protocols were unmistakably military and strategically targeted at Nigeria.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to the idea from France, which was averse to seeing the Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, the ACRI concept was reviewed.
In the review, which drew the expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by the American congress in secret sessions, the Americans considered and realised the need to set up an African command to add to the other commands already in place covering the various continents of the world.
Thus based on recommendations of these assemblage of experts drawn from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom was set up by the Bush Junior administration with a wider mandate not just to contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on the growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.
Africom will be to Africa what US Central Command (USCENTCOM), based in Florida, is to the Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), based in Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and the Caribbean.
Nigeria is already surrounded by French military presence in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin.
The Americans also have a drone base in Niger.
Adding Africom to the mix in Nigeria will amount to a complete capitulation of our strategic interest to both France and America.
Bearing in mind that our strategic interests and profile in Africa do not always cohere with those of France and America, the hosting of Africom in Nigeria will be the equivalent of letting in the wolf into the chicken coop.
There is nothing in the present insecurity challenges facing the country that our armed forces cannot cope with.
This is after all the military force that eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents in those countries from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; the army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but a few of the many gallant Nigerian soldiers who distinguished themselves in those operations.
It is regrettable that the military of Nigeria, having fallen from the high standards known of it, is struggling now to cope with the activities of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, the Nigerian military retains the capacity and capability to defeat these threats to our national security given the right leadership, doctrine and motivation.
We need all the assistance and cooperation that the Americans can give us if they are so willing.
But despite our circumstances be arm-twisted into hosting the Africom in view of its antecedents and implications to our strategic interests, on our soil.
Despite challenges, Plateau targets 7m metric tons of Irish potato
Plateau State is Nigeria's number one grower of Irish potato with the tuber currently produced in nine of the state's 17 local government areas.
The Potato Value Chain Support Project of the African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative pegs Plateau as accounting for 90 per cent of the potato production in the country with countries like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin among others receiving large supplies of potato from Nigeria.
The large potato production from Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, a leading information source for the global potato industry, has made Nigeria the fourth biggest producer in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, farmers say inadequate dams and road networks, and high cost of fertilizer and other farming inputs continue to pose a major setback in the production of sufficient potatoes for the nation and for export.
Other challenges contributing to low yields and harvest losses to the potato value chain include diseases such as blight and bacterial wilt as well as poor seedlings.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State is among the 10 poorest states in Nigeria with over 70% poverty rate.
The state, however, has a comparative advantage to boost economic activities by improving the competitiveness of the potato commodity value chain.
The Project Coordinator for the Potato Value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, said though the viability of the tuber crop is evident in nine local government areas of Plateau, Bokkos and Mangu LGAs are the state's potato hub.
They produce more potatoes than any LGA in the country.
Muopshin, however, said adaptability research indicates that the state's remaining eight LGAs are equally viable to produce potato; making all of Plateau's 17 LGA potentials to produce the tuber, especially during the dry season.
The Association of Potato Farmers (APF) in the state, however, says unless challenges affecting the value chain are addressed squarely, increased production and export in potato would continue to elude the nation.
Plateau State Chairman of APF, Lazarus Makut, in an interview with Daily Trust, said inadequate smaller dams, especially in remote areas where potato farming is viable as well as poor roads and high cost of farm inputs, continue to affect potato outputs.
He said the cost of mechanised farming which could rapidly increase productivity has become expensive with the majority of farmers who are small scale producers unable to afford mechanization.
Another farmer, Martha Mamgup, who grows potatoes in Ampang town in Mangu LGA, said inadequate water during the dry season affects potato farmers and leads to annual low yield.
Because of this, she said, the majority of farmers search for borehole locations to farm to access irrigation water for their farms.
Martha explained also that the high cost of fertiliser prevents many farmers from improving quantity and quality of yield, adding that insufficient fertiliser affects the crops output.
The cost also prevents many of us from expanding the business.
So, getting fertiliser has not been easy for us.
She said the construction of more dams and boreholes for irrigation would lead to mass production of potatoes.
If the water is not sufficient for the crop, it would dry and eventually die and that is why some farmers who have the resources prefer to dig boreholes in Mangu purposely for irrigation because, without it, dry season farming becomes difficult, she said.

Production to reach 7million metric ton after lab completion
With Plateau State's potato production jumping from 1,656,650 metric tons in 2017 to 2,359,890 metric tons in 2020, the establishment of the Potato Value Chain Support Project and the construction of the tissue culture lab are expected to cause the tripling of production to over seven million metric tons by the end of 2021.
The Monitoring and Evaluating officer of the state's Potato Value Chain Support Project, Baleri Yakubu, told Daily Trust that the state is expected to commence production of six million metric tons of potato annually after the tissue culture lab is completed at the end of 2021 but expressed optimism that production could exceed seven million metric tons annually.
Yakubu, however, said the state government should tackle other challenges faced by farmers especially those of fertiliser as well as more dams and road networks while farmers are expected to properly apply potato farming regulations to achieve the expected target.
Our correspondent gathered that the tissue culture lab, which is intended to improve potato yields in the state by providing clean seed which is resistant to pests and other potato-related diseases, is expected to commence operation fully in a few months.
Yakubu said the advent of the lab would certainly improve income for farmers and revenue for the state government while also aiding food security effort in the country.
Farmers in Plateau State, however, believe that the tissue lab, if fully equipped, would largely reduce the cost of treatment for the crops when they were affected by any disease.
They also hope that better quality seed would be available at an affordable price.
FG yet to return £4.2m Ibori loot to Delta Accountant General
The Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) revealed Wednesday that the Federal Government has not returned the £4.2 million loot recovered from former Governor James Ibori to Delta Government.
The money is still being awaited after which the issues around it will be resolved before further action is taken.
For now, no money has been returned to Delta State, a statement from the Office, signed by the Director of Information, Press and Public Relations, Henshaw Ogubike, revealed.
The statement said that the issue of the £4.2million Ibori loot has not been properly resolved.
On the previous comment of the Accountant General to the National Assembly that the loot had been returned to the Delta government, Henshaw Ogubike said: The AGF was only making general comments about recoveries relating to State Governments.

Super League trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus insisted on Wednesday they œremain committed to modernising football despite UEFA's threats of disciplinary action.
UEFA on Tuesday opened formal disciplinary proceedings against the three clubs which are still refusing to give up the aborted Super League project.
In a joint statement, Italian's Juventus and the two Spanish sides said they remain committed to modernising football through an open dialogue with UEFA.
FC Barcelona, Juventus FC and Real Madrid CF wish to express their absolute rejection of the insistent coercion that UEFA has been maintaining towards three of the most relevant institutions in the history of football, the statement read.
This alarming attitude constitutes a flagrant breach of the decision of the courts of justice, which have already made a clear statement warning UEFA to refrain from taking any action that could penalise the founding clubs of the Super League while the legal proceedings are ongoing.
Therefore, the opening of disciplinary proceedings by UEFA is incomprehensible and is a direct attack against the rule of law that we, the citizens of the European Union, have democratically built up, while constituting a lack of respect toward the authority of the courts of justice themselves.â
China administers nearly 140 million COVID-19 vaccines
China has administered 139.97 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of April 4, 2021, said the country's National Health Commission (NHC).
China is working to ensure its vaccination efforts in major areas and key industries based on the overall plan of the country, inoculating the eligible population as widely as possible and progressing in stages, said Wu Liangyou, deputy director of the NHCs Disease Prevention and Control Bureau.
The country is gathering resources to ensure inoculation in large- and medium-sized cities, port cities, and border areas with high risks of infection, and priorities are given to key groups including public sector employees, students and faculty of colleges and universities, as well as service staff of large supermarkets, Wu said, adding that vaccination for other groups is also in progress.
At present, Beijing, Shanghai and some other places in China have administered COVID-19 vaccines to senior citizens above the age of 60 and patients with chronic diseases who are willing to be vaccinated and in good physical conditions.
He Qinghua, an official with the NHC, noted that the commission will advance the vaccination campaign in an order of priority, following the principle of informed consent, voluntary participation and free inoculation.
The country is coordinating regular prevention and control with its vaccination efforts, ensuring that the regulatory responsibility of local governments and the oversight responsibility are fulfilled, and advancing its vaccination campaign in a more secured, orderly and forceful manner, he said.
Besides, China is also taking steps to include more people in its vaccination campaign to ensure their health, the official added.
So far, China has approved COVID-19 vaccines produced by five enterprises for conditional marketing or emergency use.
Phase III clinical trials of three inactivated vaccines and one adenovirus vaccine showed that their efficacy met the requirements of China's National Medical Products Administration and the World Health Organization.
Phase II trials of the recombinant protein subunit vaccine approved for emergency use showed the vaccine is safe and can induce a strong immune response.
COVID-19 vaccines adopted by China have all gone through clinical studies in accordance with relevant standards, approved by national drug regulatory organisations and put into use after passing a strict examination, said Li Bin, deputy head of the NHC.
All vaccines must be monitored and have their temperatures recorded at regular intervals to ensure that they meet the requirements regarding temperature environment and transportation.
China's health regulators also enhanced efforts on the training of health workers, requiring them to strictly obey operating instructions, so as to guarantee the efficacy and safety of the vaccines, Li added.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, Ramoni Abbas (37 years) popularly known as hushpuppi was arrested in June 2020 in Dubai for alleged money laundering from business email compromise fraud and other scams which targeted firms and an English premier league club.
He made a total sum of $435 million after defrauding 1,926,400 victims.
A year after, Abidemi Rufai (also known as Sandy Tangâ), a Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun was also arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at John F Kennedy Airport, New York over a criminal complaint of defrauding Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
The stolen funds were pandemic relief fund designed by the Washington State for people who might have suffered job losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The fraud incident occurred during the lockdown and the investigation bureau began tracking the alleged fraudster who would have been at Nigeria's Federal House of Representative making laws if he had not lost the Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The fraud was perpetrated by stealing the identities of more than 100 Washington residents by filing falsified claims with the Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
For each identity stolen, a separate e-mail account was created so that the claims would be associated with different persons and it can escape automatic fraud detection systems.
Thereafter, more than $288,000 was paid into his American bank account between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime is a global threat to individuals, organisations and countries.
Nigeria loses more than $128 billion to cybercrimes annually.
By the end of 2021, the world would have lost a total of $6 trillion.
Till date, over 40 Nigerians have been or are being investigated for their complicity in fraudulent scams by the FBI.
Rufai's alleged unemployment benefits fraud falls under what I have called COVID-419 frauds in Nigeria.
These are fraudulent scams leveraging on the loopholes created by the COVID-19 pandemic to scam people, government and organisations.
During the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria, cybercriminals patterned their frauds along the interventions from government and private sectors and scammed many and some of these schemes still exist till date.
There was Domino pizza fraud, federal government cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among others.
While there are those who engage in cyber-criminality in the Diaspora, some youngsters do so within Nigeria.
They are regularly arrested, tried and convicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
Understanding the cultures sustaining cyber-criminality may help a serious government in fighting the crime.
The family is the microcosm of the larger society.
It is the place where a normal human being is expected to be nurtured for the society.
Apart from the fact that many Nigerian families are in the dungeon of poverty and can hardly take care of their children, some of these children have become breadwinners, albeit, illegitimately.
There is a challenge with ethical behaviour training in many homes as parents being arrested alongside their children who are involved in cyber-criminality.
Elsewhere, mothers of yahoo-boys are forming associations to celebrate their sons success and justifying their criminal behaviours.
In the religious setting, depraved pastors, alfas and traditionalists create a home and benefit from yahoo-boyism proceeds.
Moral teachings have given way to materialistic Pentecostalism.
There is a viral video where some boys were shown spraying money while those who appeared to be shepherds in a supposed white garment church enjoyed the moment while the captive members of the church, led by their female youth wing recorded the shameful scene.
A child born in 1999 when Nigeria returned to democracy is now 21 years old.
Sadly, they grew up to appreciate lying as a way of life from the mouth of politicians (and in many cases from home) who deceive people to vote for them and do not fulfil or jettison the campaign promises.
Lying itself is the foundation of the sociology of hushpuppism.
Youths are daily being socialised to corruption and fraud by those holding public offices.
They see how their systems provide a soft landing for fraudulent persons (public or private).
Do they ask how many fraud and corruption allegations have been fully investigated and discharged with punishment when the accused are found guilty?
The majority of the cases ended with off-the-mic like the Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case ended as a family affair.
The youths see flamboyant lifestyles being celebrated amidst the squalor.
They see how once poor political aspirants transform into millionaires within months of inauguration.
They see how traditional institutions have become cash and carry in awarding chieftaincy titles.
Tertiary educational institutions, with few exceptions, award undeserving honours in exchange for money.
All those who mismanaged funds are provided with a soft landing.
Added to this list of cultures nurturing cybercrimes are the lyrical glamorisation of cybercrimes by some popular Nigerian musicians who present cyber-criminality as work and game that everyone is involved in and not a crime.
If we elect fraudsters as legislators, will they make laws against the crime they are involved in?
The process of giving party nomination to the highest bidders by party leaders needs to be reviewed if we are to stop importing problematic tokunbo products into our already morally bankrupt political system.
It is unfortunate that the critical reasoning of party leaders is lowered when money is dangled in their eyes.
They provide a platform for dubious characters to cover up their tracks and our society is worse off through their actions.
Greed also nurtures cyber-criminality.
FBI agent investigating Rufai, Donald Voiret stated that greed is a powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, the greed alleged to this defendant affects all taxpayers.
Moving forward, we cannot live in sin and expect grace to abound.
Nigeria must sanitise her anti-corruption system and emplace an accountability policy that tracks lifestyle with material accumulations.
We must give the youth hope in Nigeria by creating employment opportunities, reduce poverty and review reward systems.
The EFCC needs to invest in technology and expose its detectives to modern cybercrime investigation procedures.
The Commission needs to conclude investigations before arresting suspects as done by the FBI before arresting Ramoni Abbass hushpuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless the cultures sustaining cybercrimes in Nigeria are tackled through social engineering, cyber-criminality will continue to fester.

DRC president Tshisekedi assumes chair of African Union
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Felix Tshisekedi assumes chair of the African Union on Saturday.
His assumption of office is on the first day of the 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Governments in Addis Ababa.
He succeeds South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, as the organization's rotating chairperson.
The AU will be looking to address the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the continent.
The Union's
official theme for 2021 is Arts, Culture, and Heritage: Levers for Building the Africa We Want.
Despite country and continent-wide control measures, the impact of COVID-19 has imposed enormous human, financial and socio-economic costs on the African People, Tshisekedi said.
This crisis, however, also gives us the chance to re-examine our socio-economic priorities and work towards a sustainable and inclusive economic growth which allows African women and girls to contribute to our societies to the fullest.
We must be more self-reliant and find collective solutions to our problems.
The DRC during its term as head of the Union is looking to elevate African voices, Tshisekedi said.
It will also focus on sustainable development by and for Africa.
We will work to ensure their integral well-being, peace and security, health care and a strong response against COVID-19, as well as food security.
Agricultural transformation, education, gender equality, climate justice, the free movement of people and goods, and freedom of speech and religion, as well as the enhancement of our common heritage: languages, and memorial sites of the history of African people, will also be at the centre of our agenda, the president added.
Fresh crisis in Lagos PDP over LG polls
A fresh crisis is brewing in the Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the release of guidelines for the conduct of the forthcoming local government elections by the state Chairman, Engr Deji Doherty.
Engr Doherty who has been in a running battle with most of his colleagues in the State Working Committee (SWC), leading to his suspension recently, released the guidelines on Friday.
It would be recalled that the State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) had released the timetable for the elections scheduled to hold on Saturday, July 24, 2021.
Amid the lingering internal strife in the state PDP, the chairman released the guidelines which, it was learnt, did not go down well with most of the executive members who said they were not carried along.
A member of the state executive said the timetable was unilaterally planned and released by the chairman without the input of other executive members.
It was further learnt that the other factions of the party opposed to Doherty may counter the embattled chairman this week over the release of the guidelines.
The executive member who spoke on condition of anonymity said the position of the aggrieved members would be made public during the week, insisting that key members of the executive were sidelined.
How it feels to give birth during the pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan
When there is news of death everywhere, a new life brings happiness and hope
On January 1, 2020, a new morning, two red lines changed my life.
I was pregnant and happy.
It was an amazing start to a new year.
It was the most remarkable year of my life.
All of a sudden, everything changed.
My daughter Roshomon Tara was born at the end of the first lockdown in Dhaka, Bangladesh; she is now nine months old.
She is the reason I became a mother in the middle of a global crisis.
It was not only her who was born, but it was also a new me, mother of Tara, who spent an entire pregnancy in lockdown at home and gave birth in an emergency condition within the emergency.
Tara has seen the world with masks and isolation.
Her grandmothers were also afraid of holding her or coming closer to her without wearing a mask.
If there were no pandemic, my journey into motherhood would be completely different.
This Mother's Day is very special as my daughter is now in front of me, smiling and staring at me.
Last Mother's Day, she was growing inside me.
The only thing that didn't change, meanwhile, is the pandemic.
I was 16 weeks pregnant when the pandemic struck, and the planet went into lockdown.
I was struggling to survive the pandemic with my hormonal and physical changes.
Those 22 weeks were no less than a war.
My husband Sina Hasan is a musician, and all his concerts were cancelled at that time.
I am a freelance journalist since January 1, 2020.
So, we were depending on what I had saved over the years, and spent all my savings.
Our parents and two journalists associations came forward to help for the time being.
I was afraid of everything.
Most of the time, it was like death
was knocking at the door.
I was adapting to a new online life where we clicked and got our things home-delivered.
I had to wait for a week to get groceries delivered this way.
I was even afraid to send the only family member living with me my husband to go outside and buy food for storage.
Thus, I was eating less.
Besides, I could not go for my scheduled antenatal check-ups.
And I was not sure if my baby was growing healthy or all development was taking place timely.
I was sorry for my unborn child, that I was bringing her into a more different world than ever.
Tele-medication helped me to pass some hard times during the last trimister.
I forgot my gynaecologist's face.
I cannot remember how she looked without the PPE.
I needed information about risks, precautions, and how I could get emergency medical help.
Lots of information was floating around.
Within this chaos of information, experienced mothers, my mother, and mother-in-law could only help me by supporting me and not meeting me in person when I was pregnant.
Traditionally, experienced mothers and mostly older women in the family help new mothers with their experience and observation.
I have had several panic attacks due to a lack of information and understanding.
So, I dug for the experience of new mothers who gave birth during this time.
I found social media as a lifeline.
I read many exciting experiences on social media while following a group of more than 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers who supported each other to survive the pandemic.
Different media groups on this platform have helped more than 100,000 pregnant and lactating mothers by sharing their experience and information during the lockdown.
One of these groups helped me find a health care facility to do an emergency ultrasound after heavy bleeding during the lockdown.
Another group helped me curb my anxiety during pregnancy and post-partum depression.
I was upset that I couldn't meet my parents, relatives, or friends to share the joy of welcoming a new member in the family.
My daughter was born on August 25, 2020, at the same hospital, Azimpur Maternity, where I was born decades ago.
And she met another child in person when she was four months old on December 31, 2020, when Tara and her father went to the rooftop with me to see the fireworks.
Another family with two babies, apparently my next-door neighbour whom I met the first time, also went there to say goodbye to 2020.
Every day was, and is, a gift, considering the recent statistics of increased Covid-19 cases.
When there was news of death everywhere, the new life brought happiness and let hope thrive.
For mothers, it's no less than winning a war by giving birth to a child during a pandemic and taking care of the infant all alone, confirming the highest safety for their child.
Socially, emotionally, and physically, this time can be challenging.
Thanks to the light in the shining eyes of the babies.
Thanks to my baby, my daughter, for whom I am a mother and a successful fighter who survived this pandemic.

The national question, insecurity and the Asaba declaration
By Segun Tomori
Recently, Southern Nigeria Governors met in Asaba and made some far-reaching resolutions on the state of the nation, which is now famously referred to as the Asaba Declaration.
The meeting coming on the heels of worsening insecurity in the country, agitation by some ethnic jingoists and the unending menace of murderous herdsmen generated nationwide attention.
Indeed, the bi-partisan nature of the meeting and the unanimity displayed by the 17 governors showed they meant serious business.
Restructuring within the context of true federalism and the ban on open grazing formed the core of the declaration.
Major highlights include the clamour for state police, devolution of powers, review of revenue formula in favour of federating units and the need for a national dialogue to discuss the national question.
While the foot-dragging of the governors on financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary is condemnable and runs contrary to the spirit of true federalism to which they clamour, the bulk of their resolutions are actually a cardinal tenet of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Gov. El-Rufai- led committee on True Federalism made far-reaching recommendations.
One would have expected the leading lights of APC to take advantage of the bipartisan nature of the Asaba declaration, the overwhelming support of the major opposition party to kick-start the process of addressing the issues.
Instead, we saw attempts at playing to the gallery and in some quarters, subtle censure of the governors.
The El-Rufai Committee had recommended devolution of powers, resource control, state police, local government autonomy and review of revenue formula in favour of federating units among others.
President Buhari had since given support for local government, state legislature and judiciary autonomy through backing amendment of the statutes and issuing Executive Order 010.
Given the state of the nation in which security and the economy have posed grave challenges, these twin sectors should receive the utmost attention, concurrently.
Despite the rating of Nigeria as the country with the highest GDP in Africa, we are yet to make sufficient efforts to translate that to improved standards of living for the majority of our citizens.
Our annual budget of about $35 billion, for instance, is grossly inadequate to cater to the needs of an estimated 220 million Nigerians.
South Africa with about 58 million people had a National budget of almost $75bn in 2019 with her Social Protection Programmes reaching 17m of its population
The efforts of the Buhari administration, though novel and commendable, still represent a drop in an ocean and are not adequate to make the required impact.
This is where devolution of powers and resource control come in.
Solid minerals and natural resources have no business staying a day longer in the Exclusive list.
Almost all states in the country have commercially viable natural resources that can be exploited to create wealth and generate the needed foreign exchange for the country.
The present system where states come cap in hand to Abuja to collect federal allocations in the country breeds indolence, runs contrary to the principle of true federalism.
Just as the El-Rufai committee proposed, the revenue formula should be reviewed in favour of states since more responsibilities will be added to them.
On state police, the fears of abuse and envisaged excesses by governors is understandable, but like Richie Norton said To escape fear, you have to go through it, not around it.
For too long we have gone around fear of abuse of state police, we have tried to turn a blind eye to the obviously overstretched and over-centralised Nigeria Police force that has become not only overly inefficient, but largely a conundrum.
Like Vice-President Osinbajo stated some years ago, State Police is an idea whose time has come.
We have to address our fears and overcome it.
One of the ways that can be done is by enacting a legal instrument for the establishment of the State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), alongside constitutional amendments that will permit State Police.
It would be similar in functions to the Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but have wider powers to exercise appointive and regulatory functions.
The ban on open grazing though restated by the governors is not new and forms the fulcrum of the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) approved by the National Executive Council (NEC).
The International Crisis Group (ICG) touts the NLTP as Nigeria's most comprehensive effort to date to overhaul the inefficient and grossly underperforming livestock system.
At the core is a strategy to curtail migratory or open grazing and thus lower the risk of conflict between herders and farmers It, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic, self-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon the ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing.
The federal and state governments should move swiftly to fully implement this novel plan so that we can put the perennial farmers-herders clashes behind us.
The convocation of a National Dialogue, a major demand of the Asaba declaration might not be necessary since there is a report of the 2014 National Conference and recommendations of the Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on True Federalism.
Both reports made far-reaching recommendations that our elected governors and their legislators in the National Assembly can reach a consensus on, instead of wasting scarce resources on another jamboree.
On the issue of separatist agitations, there should be modalities for convening a referendum spelt out in the constitution.
It is almost certain that a vast majority of Nigerians want to live together, our differences, notwithstanding.
Doing this will take the sail out of the wind of divisive elements, fanning embers of hate and discord.
The Southern Governors have affirmed their commitment to a United Nigeria on the basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must every patriotic Nigerian.
Though we have challenges like every other country, we must listen to ourselves, like US President Joe Biden often says.

Two officers killed as IPOB militants set Anambra police station on fire
Barely 24 hours after the newly appointed Commissioner of Police in Anambra, Christopher Adetokumbo Owolabi, resumed duty, gunmen attacked Obosi Police Station in Idemili North local government area of the state and killed two officers.
The gunmen attacked the police station late Wednesday, freeing all detainees before setting the station on fire.
A source within the affected police station said the gunmen in large numbers stormed and attacked the station around 11pm.
He simply identified the deceased officers as Inspectors James and Awalu.
The source said the victims were killed inside a non-functional filling station close to the police station.
The source also said when other police officers on duty noticed unusual movement of the unknown gunmen, they took to their heels while the attackers had a field time burning down the police station.
Meanwhile, the police in Anambra have confirmed the killing of two of their personnel.
DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, the command's Public Relations Officer (PPRO), who confirmed the attack, said the state Commissioner of Police had dispatched a tactical team for on the spot assessment of the incident.
The tactical team led by an the Assistant Commissioner of Police was directed to have on the spot assessment of the place.
The team was equally told to possibly identify and apprehend the hoodlums that perpetrated the the attack, he said.
Ikenga, who added that the bodies of the two killed policemen have been deposited at a nearby morgue, said investigation into the matter has begun.
NEPC, Commonwealth collaborate on production of professional service export data
The Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and the Commonwealth Secretariat London are collaborating to produce reliable data on export of professional services in Nigeria.
Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the National Consultative Committee on the International Trade-in-Services (NCCITS) held under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat London, the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the NEPC, Mr. Olusegun Awolowo, said Nigeria has no readily accessible and reliable data or statistics on trade-in-services.
Awolowo said there had been previous attempts to create awareness on the Trade-in-Service sector of the economy, including the creation of the National Strategy for Export of Professional Services in 2010.
The Commonwealth in 2016 assisted Nigeria to develop a road-map for the service sector, he said.
The NEPC boss said the current focus of collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat is on data/statistics collection and management.
This is critical to our export effort as this would fill the gaps in collecting or capturing data from relevant institutions in order to generate analyse and use statistical information on Trade-in-Services in line with the global trend, he said.
NITDA, firm to launch tech startup fund July
The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and a United States-based firm Mass Challenge have signed an agreement to financially support between 10 and 15 start-ups from July, to reach their full potential within 12 months.
Director General of NITDA, Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi said this on Tuesday during a virtual media stakeholder engagement with officials of MassChallenge.
The initiative is designed to identify and accelerate top start-ups based in Nigeria and grow their businesses to serve the Nigerian and global market, Abdullahi said.
The NITDA DG who said the initiative would be launched in July added that it would improve tech innovation and entrepreneurship across the country.
A vibrant start up ecosystem is highly critical to the future of our country and it's vital to finding solutions to our various challenges.
Innovation is a prominent way of creating prosperity for all and lifting countries out of poverty.
The CEO of MassChallenge, Siobhan Dullea, said the firm had supported over 2,900 start-ups in 54 countries across the world and that these firms have generated $3.6 billion revenue and created 86,000 jobs.
Kidnapppers abduct 2 women in Abuja council
Kidnappers have abducted two women, Christiana Isa Attah and Favor David, behind Anguwar Kpokpolobi community in Naharati, Abaji Area Council, FCT.
Mother of the two victims, Mrs. Ruth Attah, a retired school teacher, told our reporter at her residence yesterday, that the incident happened around midnight on Saturday.
She said she was asleep and her daughters were in their room when the kidnapppers entered the house after scaling through the low fence.
She said they broke one of the windows and went to the room where her two daughters were asleep and bundled them away at gunpoint.
When the girls noticed that the kidnapppers were breaking down the window, they ran to my room to hide, but the gunmen followed them to my room and took us away, she said.
According to her, the kidnappers spared her some few metres away from the house after noticing that she could not trek for long due to her old age.
It was after we crossed the river and I could no longer trek that the other gang members who were behind me asked me to go back home while they went away with my two daughters, she added.
A resident of the area, who preferred anonymity, said the kidnappers carried out the operation for over an hour while shooting into the air to scare people from engaging them.
No security man came here when the kidnapppers were shooting into the air for over one hour, he said.
Daily Trust learnt that until that fateful day, the woman and her children had always passed the night at neighbours house and returned home in the morning for fear of kidnappers as her house was just few metres away from a river.
It was also gathered that one of the woman's daughters, who is a class teacher in the area, was preparing for her wedding next month.
The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not pick calls or reply to a text message sent to her phone to confirm the latest kidnap incident in the area.
Why I'm in race for Anambra govship Anglican Priest
An Anglican Priest, Rev Godwin Okonkwo, has said he is in the race for the November governorship election in Anambra State because he wants to bring the fear of God and knowledge of prudent use of resources to bear on governance in the state.
Okonkwo who spoke with Daily Trust on Wednesday shortly after addressing his supporters in Awka, the Anambra State capital, said the state was lagging behind in terms of good governance.
The people who are there now have not brought to bear in managing the resources of Anambra State for the good of Anambra people.
I believe we can do better in managing the state resources.
It is high time we moved from a lukewarm attitude of leadership to good leadership.
I am in APC now to change the poor outing of the party in the state over the years, he said.
Barty beats Kvitova to set up last-four clash with Badosa
Ashleigh Barty will take on Paula Badosa in the semifinals of the Madrid Open after beating Petra Kvitova 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 on Wednesday.
World No 1 Barty is chasing her fourth singles title of the year after her triumph in Stuttgart 10 days ago.
In the last four she faces the woman who knocked her out in the quarterfinals in Charleston in early April.
On Wednesday, the Australian came out on top against two-time Wimbledon champion and 2015 and 2018 Madrid winner Kvitova.
Wildcard Badosa became the first Spanish woman in the tournament's 12-year history to make the semis with her 6-4, 7-5 win over eighth seed Belinda Bencic.
22 Pharaoh mummies on parade in Egypt
Twenty-two pharaoh mummies walked the streets of Cairo on Saturday evening in a stunning royal procession from the Egyptian Museum on Tahrir Square to the new National Museum of Egyptian Civilization (NMEC) in Fustat.
The event marked the official launch of NMEC.
Against the backdrop of fireworks, the mummies“ 18 kings and four queens“ travelled in order of age on purpose-built gold-colored pharaonic chariots, equipped with an air ride suspension system to absorb vibrations, and bearing the name of their occupants in Arabic, English, and hieroglyphics.
Seqenenre Tao II, who reigned over Upper Egypt around 1,600 BCE, led the parade, while Ramses IX, who ruled in the 12th century BCE, brought up the rear.
In line with strict international standards for the transport of artifacts, the royal remains were placed in state-of-the-art sterile display cases to guarantee their immaculate preservation.
Accompanying the mummies were 60 motorcycles, 150 horses, and a pharaonic music ensemble conducted by renowned Egyptian maestro Nader Abbassi.
The procession commenced with a 21-gun salute, circled the obelisk at the nearby Tahrir Square, and then proceeded along the Nile to NMEC, where Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi personally welcomed the mummies to their new permanent home in Fustat, the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization.
The 40-minute parade drew participation of 12 Egyptian celebrities, being broadcast by 200+ global TV channels.
The priceless artifacts will spend the next two weeks in NMECs laboratory, where they will be prepared for installation inside the Royal Mummies Hall, modeled on the Valley of the Kings.
The Royal Mummies Hall will open to visitors on April 18, coinciding with World Heritage Day.
To promote its launch, NMEC offers a 50 percent discount on entry ticket prices to the Central Exhibition Hall for all visitors from April 4 to 17.
In addition, representatives of local and international media have the opportunity to photograph and film the artifacts inside the Central Exhibition Hall for free on April 4 and 5.
Overlooking Ain Al Sira in the heart of the historical city of Fustat near the Babylon Fortress, NMEC is one of the largest and most important archeology museums in the world, and the first to span the entirety of the Egyptian civilization.
Uproar in Kano prison over illicit drugs
There was pandemonium in Kano central prison at Kurmawa on Thursday evening over illicit drugs.
The uproar is said to have started when the prison warders detected and seized cannabis, allegedly brought to the inmates Thursday evening.
When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) in Kano state, Musbahu Lawal Kofar Nasarawa, confirmed the issue, adding that they have already set up a committee to find out how the cannabis got into the centre.
He said, Someone brought cannabis to the prisoners and our operatives confiscated it, so they started an uproar, asking for us to give them.
We have already set up a committee to find out how such an illicit drug got into the house; whether it was put in some of the food brought to the prisoners or someone connived with our operatives.
The action has nothing with jailbreak, it is just an uproar we have already reinforced order back to the custodial centre, he added.
There were rumours however that the prisoners wanted to break the jail in their attempt to escape while resisting the food they say they are being served to break their fast, despite collecting huge donations from philanthropists.
The NCoS spokesperson however debunked the rumours, describing them as baseless.
Daily Trust reports that the over 100 years prison situated at Kurmawa area, just behind Emir's Palace in the metropolis is the biggest custodial centre in the state.
FG seeks global action against terrorism, drug trafficking
The federal government has urged world leaders to strengthen international cooperation as part of efforts to successfully combat terrorism and drug trafficking as well as other forms of crimes.
This is even as Nigeria expressed concerns over the incidence of illicit financial flows from developing to developed economies of the world.
These were parts of the positions presented by Nigeria at the ongoing conference by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking place in Vienna, Austria.
Spokesman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Femi Babafemi, quoted the Chairman/Chief Executive of the agency, Brig-Gen.
Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), who presented Nigeria's positions on items 6C and 7 at the meeting as saying that while nations deepen cooperation and strengthen the processes of combating the financing of terrorism and prevention of terrorists from benefitting from ransom payments, it was also important for them not to overlook the trafficking in illicit drugs.
It is also imperative to keep an eye on and control the proliferation of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and other substances of abuse that serve as conflict multipliers leading to escalation of both the scope and intensity of violent activities.
Nigeria is also worried about the existing and growing links between terrorism and other forms of crime such as corruption, illicit financial flows, money laundering, illicit trafficking in drugs, cybercrime, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, Marwa said.
Delivering Nigeria's statement on item 6C on Wednesday, Marwa said that as nations renew their desire to improve international cooperation to address all forms of crimes, Nigeria urges all states, once again, to make sincere efforts, to address the root causes, which include; poverty, economic deprivation, inequality, drug abuse, and other socio-economic factors.
While presenting the country's statement on item 7 on Thursday, Marwa said, Nigeria notes with great concern the incidence of illicit financial flows, which go through the financial systems annually, particularly from developing to developed economies.
To dissuade the perpetrators of this anomaly, including financial institutions who act as enablers, state parties should ensure that illicit financial flows, when tracked, do not remain in the custody of enabling financial institutions but should be transferred into an escrow account, preferably in development banks pending return to countries of origin.
In this regard, we call for the implementation of the recommendations of the FACTI panel in support of asset recovery and the agenda 2030 for sustainable development.
Timipre Sylva, Kurfi celebrate Chelsea's Champions League victory
Two prominent Nigerians, the former Governor of Bayelsa State and present Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Marlin Sylva and the Chairman of Katsina State Football Association, Alhaji Aminu Balele Kurfi were in celebratory mood on Sunday minutes after Chelsea football club won their second UEFA Champions League title.
In an all English finals, former champions Chelsea stunned Manchester City 1-0 at the Estadio
do Dragao in Porto to win their second trophy.
Kai Havertz, one of the expensive additions from last Summer, scored the decisive goal just before half-time to inflict a third consecutive defeat on Pep Guardiola's City.
Moments after the match, the former governor tweeted I supported Chelsea FC for UCL trophy, and it came at no regrets.
Kurfi who watched proceedings in Abuja along with Sylva said he created time to watch the match with the former Bayelsa State governor to support and celebrate with him after the match.
I had to go and support him because he is an avid fan of Chelsea.
I am also happy that in the end, he had cause to celebrate.
Not many people are aware that His Excellency Timipre Sylva is passionate about sports, especially football.
On my part, as the Chairman of Katsina State Football Association, I am a father to all supporters of the different clubs in my state.
I was with Chelsea from where I was loaned to Katsina United.
From United, I was loaned to Kurfi Tigers FC and at the moment, I am for every club, said Kurfi on a lighter mood.
Uganda election: President Museveni in early lead, rival alleges fraud
President Yoweri Museveni took an early lead in Uganda's presidential election, according to preliminary results released on Friday morning by the electoral commission.
This is as his main rival said he had proof that the poll had been marred by fraud.
With 29.4 per cent of votes from Thursday's ballot counted, Museveni had won 1,852,263 votes, or 63.9 per cent while main opposition candidate Bobi Wine had 821,874 or 28.4 per cent, the commission said just after 11.00 a.m. (0800 GMT).
Wine alleges fraud
Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker who has galvanised young Ugandans with calls for political change, told a news conference on Friday he had filmed proof of fraud during voting and that he wanted a peaceful outcome to the vote.
He had said in a tweet early in the day that he was confident of victory despite widespread fraud and violence.
Museveni, who has led the East African country with a population of nearly 46 million for 34 years, had not made any statement by noon.
Internet blackout
On Wednesday, the government ordered an internet blackout until further notice, a day after banning all social media and messaging apps.
Wine and his supporters used Facebook to relay live coverage of his campaigns and news conference after he said many media outlets had declined to host him.
The election campaign was marred by deadly crackdowns by security forces on opposition candidates and their supporters.
Uganda's normally bustling capital Kampala was quiet on Friday, a public holiday after Thursday's poll, with shops mostly closed.
Soldiers patrolled on foot in the rain in a suburb visited by Reuters.
Commission head, Simon Byabakama, assured the nation on live TV on Thursday evening after polls closed that results were arriving at the national tally centre despite the nationwide internet blackout.
We are not using local internet to transmit our results, we are using our own system, he said, without giving details of that system.
Don't worry, results will come, Byabakama added
New wave of pandemic hits more of Japan's prefectures
Japan is set to expand the current state of emergency to three more prefectures, the government said on Friday,
This is as the coronavirus infections continued to hit wider regions of the country ahead of this summer's Tokyo Olympics.
The prefectures of Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima were likely to be under the measure from Sunday to the end of May, Economic Revitalisation Minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told reporters.
A panel of experts endorsed the proposal, said Nishimura, who was in charge of the government's coronavirus response.
The northern island of Hokkaido reported a record 712 new infections on Thursday while the western prefecture of Hiroshima also saw a record 219 new cases on Wednesday.
Surging infections prompted Hiroshima and Okayama to cancel next week's torch relay on their public roads.
International Olympic Committee President, Thomas Bach, was scheduled to participate in a torch relay event in Hiroshima on May 17.
However, Bach's travel to Japan ahead of the Games has been postponed, local organisers said.
The postponement is coming as the government extended the state of emergency in Tokyo and three other prefectures until the end of May and added two more regions Aichi, Fukuoka to the measure.
The government declared the state of emergency in the four prefectures in late April, requesting bars and restaurants refrain from serving alcohol and offering a karaoke service.
Experts warned of the rapid spread of more contagious variants, especially as the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines has been extremely slow in Japan since its launch in mid-February.
Only one per cent of Japan's
125 million populations have been fully vaccinated.
Jigawa's mechanised farm to benefit local farmers
The Malam Alu Agro Allied Company, a farm sitting on a 100-hectare land in Faru village, along Maiduguri road, Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of Jigawa State, is changing the perception of mechanised farming in Nigeria, Mansur Dau Aliyu, the company's Group General Manager (GGM) said.
The establishment of the farm almost five years ago, it was gathered, was a direct response to the call by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for Nigerians to return to agriculture as the mainstay of the nation's economy, rather than relying solely on oil as the only source of revenue for the country.
Each cattle has a number tag attached to its ear
The company's founder, Farouk Adamu Aliyu, a former member of the House of Representatives keyed into this, the GGM added.
We do greenhouse farming.
We have a 10,000 square-metre fully automated soilless greenhouse, where we produce tomatoes.
We also have two 250 square-metre greenhouses where we produce other greenhouse vegetables, and another 500 square-metre greenhouse, which is being used as a nursery.
These greenhouses are all foreign-oriented, which have been installed to produce a variety of vegetables.
We produce only tomatoes from the 10,000 square automated soilless greenhouses; and we produce an average of 10 to 11 tons of tomatoes every week.
We also have another 10,000 square-metre locally fabricated greenhouse.
We also have a livestock section, where we have about 300 herds of cattle, some camels, goats and sheep, he said.
Daily Trust gathered that the farm also has a fishery unit, with about 50,000 fishes inside the pond.
Similarly, a forty-ton per hour fertilizer blending plant installed earlier in the year, it was gathered, now produces close to 300 loads of NPK fertilizer under the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative.
We have also imported equipment for the installation of 120,000 capacity poultry system.
We hope to be producing between 3,000-4,000 crates of eggs daily, Mansur said.
The farm, he said, also has a diary production plant, which is for the production of about 2,000 litres of milk a day, adding that there are also about 150-200 hectares of land elsewhere meant for open field farming for real cultivation of rice and other crops.
Mansur disclosed that the major clientele for the tomato are premium customers, notably big hotels in Abuja, Lagos, and some other locations.
He confirmed, however, that the main market for the products was mainly in the eastern part of the country, such as Enugu, Onitsha, Owerri.
He admitted, however, that besides the few customers they have in Kano, their tomato products are rarely seen in the local markets for some reason.
First is the fact that the tomato produced from the farm is of special species and the second reason is the fact that Jigawa is a major tomato-producing area.
You know that tomato is a common product around here, so our price is a little higher than what is obtained normally in the open market.
So, essentially, people don't actually look at us, they feel apprehensive of what we have because they believe they are expensive.
And when you have a product that is commonly available, people will surely go for the cheaper brand.
A farm hand feeds the fishes
Asked of the average lifespan of their tomato products, he said, If you give the tomato all it requires, I mean nutritional supplements you feed it with while it is growing, if you give it all those things, this tomato could last up to three weeks post-harvest.
But even without that, it lasts for a minimum of a week, not under any refrigeration, but surely not under intense pressure and heat.
You can keep it on the table where you have good ventilation.
It can last an average of 10 days, but with everything provided as required (all nutrients) it could last up to one month.
This we have experimented, but then, you don't get it as you always want it.
The farm is also a source of employment for as many as 200 people in the village where it is located.
He also said the company got some people to train the youth in the area on information technology skills.
He further said most of the equipment used on the farm were imported from Turkey, except the fertilizer-blending machine, which was imported from China.
Even the farming method is modeled after the Turkish style of operation because we have a Turkish partner that is helping in maintaining the standards, he said, but quickly added that the company was conscious of the need to have Nigerians run the technical aspect of its operations.
Reflecting on the effect of COVID-19 on the operations of the company, Mansur said, Malam Alu, just like other corporate entities in the country, suffered from the devastating effects of the virus.
For Mansur, youths in Nigeria have no excuse to remain unemployed with the opportunity provided by agriculture, noting that those hoping to secure a white-collar job should adjust to the reality and go back to agriculture.
He believes Nigeria is now doing what it ought to have done a long time ago, noting that if the country had taken this step, the current economic crisis would have been averted.
2023: Lawmaker seeks better deal for Southern Kaduna
The member representing Jaba Constituency in the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Samson Monday Dikko, has called on people of goodwill to come together and map out strategies that would salvage the Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and its people in 2023.
Speaking after a meeting with stakeholders in Kagoro, Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State at the weekend, Dikko, who is aspiring to be a senator on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said Southern Kaduna people have been abandoned by those who ought to take care of them.
This is the time for the entire Southern Kaduna people to get it right.
We need to transform our region and improve security, education, health, agriculture, economy, employment and empowerment for the teeming youths in conjunction with reputable non-governmental organizations, he added.
The Director-General of the Dikko Campaign Organisation, Timothy Chindo Kwassam, said the destiny of the people of Kaduna South Senatorial District would be in their own hands if Dikko represents them at the Senate in 2023.
For everything under the sun, there is a season.
So, the coming of Dikko at this critical period of time is not a mere coincidence, but a divine plan by God to liberate the region from all that has hindered it from growing and competing with other regions, Kwassam said.
3 Africans, no Nigerian as City, Chelsea contest UEFA Champions League finals
Without doubt, enthusiastic football fans in Nigeria are eagerly awaiting tonights finals of the 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals to be contested between two English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea at the Estadio do Dragao, Porto in Portugal.
In view of the fact that the UEFA Champions League is one of the world's biggest football competitions only next to the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics football event, there is increasing level of expectations as the giants of the English Premier League get set to tussle for the prestigious diadem.
While Manchester City are yet to win the Champions League title, Chelsea won their first and only title so far in 2012.
Therefore, even as football pundits have tipped City who have just won their seventh Premiership title to win tonight, Chelsea will be coming into the contest with better credentials.
They are former champions.
However, while Thomas Tuchel who leads the Chelsea technical crew is yet to taste Champions League victory, his opponent in the Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola is a two time winner.
He won it in 2009 and 2010 with Barcelona.
Therefore, there is so much to expect from the actors who will be out there on the field of Estadio
do Dragao in Porto and the men in charge of the technical areas.
Interestingly, even as both contestants parade only three African players in Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday (
Senegal, Chelsea) Africans interest in the finals has dropped.
Here in Nigerian where Chelsea and Manchester City enjoy a large following from passionate football fans, expectations have reached feverish point, leading to interesting re-alignments.
Fans of those European clubs that were eliminated from the Champions League at different stages have re-aligned themselves with either Chelsea or Manchester City based on divergent interests.
Consequently, the finals is one of the most discussed topics in sporting circles in Nigeria at the moment as fans of the Premiership clubs continue to predict what would be the final result.
However, while almost everyone is waiting to savour the football artistry that is possibly going to be on display, some pundits are worried by the increasing decline in the number of African players in the finals of one of the biggest football competitions on earth.
Going by the history of the UEFA Champions League, only 24 African footballers have contested and won the trophy with their European clubs.
Sadly African football legends like Liberia's George Weah who was voted World Footballer of the year in 1995,
Nigeria's Rashidi Yekini, Egypt's Mohamed Aboutrika, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt failed to win the Champions League despite their football prowess.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) were on the big stage when Liverpool won their 6th UEFA Champions League title in 2019, the first African to have won the trophy was Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
He achieved the feat in 1984 with Liverpool.
He was followed by Algerian legend Rabah Madjer who won it with FC Porto in 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) in 1993 with Olympique Marseille before Nigeria's
duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lifted it with Ajax Amsterdam in 1995.
It is also on record that Geremi Njitap of Cameroon was the first African to win the title twice in 2000 and 2002 with Spanish giants Real Madrid before Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon won it thrice with Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 with Inter Milan.
Other African winners of the highly coveted trophy are Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali
) Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) who won it with Chelsea in 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), with Real Madrid 2018 complete the list of Africans who have won the UEFA Champions League.
Coming closer home, the last time a Nigerian won the trophy was in 2012 when Mikel Obi was among the quartet of Africans who lifted it with Chelsea at the expense of Bayern Munich.
After that achievement by the former captain of the Super Eagles, Nigeria has seen the rise of other immensely talented players like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
but none is yet to feature in the finals of Europe's biggest club competition.
The reason for this is not farfetched.
The competition is dominated by the top five clubs in Europe, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Unfortunately, Nigerian players have over the years failed to get into these highly rated European clubs.
It is, therefore, the hope of Nigerian football stakeholders that in no distant future the new generation of players will break all barriers and begin to play for clubs that have potential to win the UEFA Champions League.
If this fails, then football fans in Nigeria will continue to live with the agony of watching finals of the UEFA Champions League come and go without the presence of any Nigerian player.
As Nigerians wait for the next Super Eagles player who will rise to the pinnacle of European club competition the way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu did with Ajax in 1995 and Chelsea's Mikel Obi in 2012, the 2021 all English clubs finals is a few hours away.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.
Enyimba force FC IfeanyiUbah to 2-2 draw in Oriental derby
Enyimba FC came from behind to secure a well deserved 2-2 draw in their rescheduled Week 14 fixture against Oriental brothers FC IfeanyiUbah at the Aba International Stadium, Aba,
The Oriental Derby saw Enyimba make three changes to the team that lost at Rivers United on Sunday.
Sadiq Abubakar returned after weeks of layoff while Anthony Omaka and Victor Mbaoma were restored to the starting lineup.
The first 28 minutes of the game saw both sides seeking to hit first but the visiting side drew the first blood in the 29th minute through Saidu Adamu who poked home from close range after Uche Onuoha had headed Evans Ogbonda's cross to his path.
With the away side in full control of the game, their confidence grew more leaving the hosts scrambling to get back into the game as the first half ended 1-0 in favour of the visitors.
At the restart of the second half, IfeanyiUbah continued to press for the second goal and were duly rewarded when Saidu Adamu got his brace after getting Awazie's square pass over the line in the 61st minute.
Stung to life by the second goal, Enyimba began to throw in everything in their arsenal to get back into the game.
In the 78th minute, their pressure paid off when Reuben Bala reduced the deficit for Enyimba in a rather fortuitous fashion.
His initial header was kept out by Sharp Uzoigwe but the ball ricocheted back to him and over the line.
The goal gave Enyimba some hope as they continued to press in numbers to at least secure a point
and this they got in the 90th minute through Imoh Obot.
Following this result, Enyimba have moved up to 5th position with 31 points from 17 games with two more outstanding matches.
Meanwhile, FC IfeanyiUbah are still rooted in the relegation zone with 17 points from 19 games.
Farmers apprehensive as planting season begins with erratic rains
As wet season begins in most parts of the country, farmers have commenced, planting, albeit with fear following erratic rains, which may threaten production.
The rains have been unstable in Benue, Nasarawa, Niger, Kaduna and parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and many farmers have planted their crops.
In the 2019/2020 wet season, erratic rains in the North and mid-season draught in the South-West made farmers lose their money due to crop failure.
Musa Yohana and Halima Thomas, farmers in Doma and Lafia, Nasarawa State, said they had planted maize, groundnut and other tuber crops like cassava and yam, but feared they might have another horrible experience like last season when they were forced to plant maize and groundnut two times.
I lost most of my yams last year due to excessive heat as a result of inconsistent rainfall.
This year, we are in the second week of May but we are yet to have stable rains.
And I have planted 15 measures (about 20kg) of groundnut already.
If it continues like this for another week, I may lose the seeds, Mr Yohana said.
Like them, many farmers around the FCT have also planted, but the fear of crop failure is heightened by their experiences of last year.
In Benue State, our correspondent reports that farmers have begun to cultivate their lands and plant crops amid complaints of scanty rainfall.
Some farmers who had prepared their farms earlier in the year said they could not start planting crops until one week ago, while others have just begun to till their lands at the wake of rainfall (thrice) within the past two weeks.
A farmer in Otukpo, Ada Hyacinth, said the ground was still too strong to cultivate because the rains hadn't been frequent.
Another farmer, Felix Tor, in Makurdi, said he had just planted melon and maize on his recently ploughed farm despite the inconsistency of the rains.
Tor, however, expressed fears that the nature of the rainfall might affect the well-being of the crop.
He prayed that the yield would turn out good in the end.
But Vitalis Tarnongu, who is currently ploughing his 1,000 hectares of farmland at the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi (FUAM), posited that the manner of rainfall this year would require him to begin sowing maize towards the end of May.
Tarnongu said a plant breeder in the university had advised him to wait until May 20 to begin planting his maize because the nature of the rainfall since the season set in suggested that there could be a two-week drought.
The state chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Aondongu Saaku, described farming as a business worth taking risk on.
Saaku said farmers who saw it as business had already taken the risk to plant their crops because without such risk, they won't reap at the end of the day.
Meanwhile, Dr Teryima Iorlamen, a seed systems specialist at the FUAM, said farmers could go ahead to plant their root and tuber crops in line with the NIMET's rainfall prediction for this year.
Iorlamen said the period during which the farmers were expected to wait awhile before sowing had gone, stressing that NIMET's prediction for rainfall pattern in Benue State, which they (experts) work with, indicated that the rains would stabilise in the state between April 18 and 30, 2021.
We can assure farmers now that the rains have stabilized, according to NIMET predictions.
Anything otherwise now would be dry spell.
I have advised farmers to check water logging capacity in their fields so that they plant their crops accordingly.
Rice loves much water, so it is not yet time to plant it.
But farmers can go into roots and tubers now, such as yam, cassava, maize and melon.
We believe that the rain have stabilised.
Senate mourns late Army chief, Ahmed Gulak
The Senate, on Tuesday, held a minute silence in honour of the demise of a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, who was gruesomely murdered on Sunday in Owerri, Imo State capital.
This followed a motion by Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Senate Constitution Review Committee, Ovie Omo-Agege, on the floor of the Red Chamber.
Omo-Agege drew the attention of his colleagues to the assassination of Gulak, who, the lawmaker said, was hired to assist his committee to work on the amendments being sought by Nigerians to the constitution.
Gulak served as a consultant to the committee and was in Owerri for the public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution.
Though the programme ended on Thursday, Gulak stayed behind and left on Sunday.
He was murdered on his way to the airport in Owerri en route Abuja.
Omo-Agege described Gulak as a detribalised Nigerian, who gave his best to the service of the country.
Also on Tuesday, the Senate urged the federal government to immortalise the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru.
The red chamber also observed a one minute silence in honour of Lt. Gen. Attahiru, who died in a plane crash near Kaduna International Airport.
This followed a point of order raised by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume.
NIN/profile code: NANS raises alarm over disenfranchisement of students by JAMB
The Kaduna State Chapter of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Tuesday said thousands of candidates would not take part in this year's Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB)
examination due to hitches in their NIN/Profile code.
The state NANS chairman, Axiz Huziafa Bello, in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna, disagreed with the JAMB.
Bello called for an extension of the electronic registration instead of risking students lives to travel to JAMB headquarters in their respective states for manual registration.
He noted that the news bulletin released on Monday, May 31, 2021, titled Issues surrounding the 2021 UTME registration: Option available for genuine candidates who made attempts but could not register, showed that the management had failed to show empathy for the hardship and agony of the candidates.
He appealed to prominent Nigerians to prevail on the management of JAMB to desist from unleashing hardship on Nigerian students in their noble quest for higher education and self-development.
He urged the examination body to extend the registration period and postpone the exam in the interest of justice and fairness.
