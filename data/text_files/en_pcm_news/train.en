Wanted Abia major drug supplier arrested with 100kg cocaine, cannabis
The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested Chibuike Apolos, a notorious major supplier of illicit drugs in Abia State, during an early morning raid on his hideout at Mbawsi in Isialangwa North area of the state.
Spokesman of the agency, Femi Babafemi, said on Wednesday in Abuja that Apolos has been on the wanted list of the Abia State Command of the NDLEA since February following the arrest of one Chima Ukeleonu, the suspect behind the video that went viral in January 2021, showing a young man hawking illicit drugs on the street.
According to him, it was due to the development that the 38-year-old Apolos was put on the wanted list.
Following his arrest in the early hours of Wednesday, the Abia State government has already marked his house which serves as his hideout for demolition, Babafemi said.
He also quoted the Commander Abia State Command of the NDLEA, Bamidele Akingbade, as saying that The command has been on his trail since February this year.
Fortunately, we got a tip-off that he just received some quantities of cannabis from Edo State.
Notwithstanding the tense security situation in the South East, especially Abia State, the command still embarked on the operation which culminated in the arrest of one Chibuike Apolos with 10 bags of cannabis weighing 100kg, 1.6 grammes of cocaine, one gramme of heroin and five grammes of methamphetamine.
In a similar development, the Taraba State Command of the Agency has arrested 61-year-old Lawan Gambo Umar for trafficking 58.50kg of Cannabis Sativa.
According to the state Commander of NDLEA, Suleiman Ajadi, The suspect was taking the skunk concealed inside sacks of beans chaff used to feed animals to Fune in Yobe State when our men intercepted him.
Rep lauds NDLEA over illicit drugs seizures
The member representing Ado/Ogbadibo/Okpokwu Federal Constituency, Dr Francis Ottah Agbo, has commended the chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig-Gen.
Mohammed Buba Marwa (rtd) for his renewed anti-drugs fight which has led to large scale seizures across the country.
The lawmaker, who is also the Chairman of the Narcotic Drugs Committee, particularly praised Marwa for sanitizing the health sector by intercepting large quantities of narcotic and substandard drugs across the country.
The lawmaker, in a statement by his Media Aide, Andrew Agbese, on Wednesday, said the NDLEA boss had in less than six months of assuming office, succeeded in getting the agency back on track by busting many drug rings and syndicates, as well as seizing and destroying large quantities of illicit drugs.
Agbo, who is also the spokesman of the Minority Caucus, said NDLEA, under the leadership of the former Military Administrator of Lagos State, is reminiscent of the days of Prof Dora Akunyili in NAFDAC when fake, expired drugs and substandard food brands were reduced to the admiration of all and sundry.
I have been an advocate of optimum, staffing, equipping and funding the NDLEA to achieve its statutory mandate due to the menace of substance abuse and drug addiction in the country.
I have said several times that the NDLEA needs all the support to carry out its mandate
but Im surprised that even with the little on the ground, the agency, under the able leadership of Gen. Buba Marwa, has been able to achieve a lot by taking the fight to the criminals and this has given me the confidence as chairman of the Narcotic Drugs Committee to further push for the necessary incentives for the agency to function at an optimal level.
It is very clear that Marwa is the new Sheriff in town and he has proved this by clearing the doubt of drug barons, syndicates and traffickers, he said.
Daily Trust reports that the agency had in recent times made large scale seizures and arrested suspects across the country.
Bayelsa vigilantes arrest 4 for buying stolen phones
Bayelsa Vigilante Security Service has nabbed a phone repairer and three others for allegedly buying phones snatched at gunpoint in the state.
The state government-owned security outfit, led by its chairman, Doubiye Alagba, over the weekend, arrested four suspects, including a popular phone repairer, for buying a phone that was allegedly stolen at gunpoint in Yenagoa.
It was gathered that men of the vigilante were acting on a tip-off that one Mr. Lawrence Oworodo was robbed of his phone and other belongings at gunpoint, when they traced the mobile phone to one Audu John in Biogbolo axis of the state capital.
Investigation by the security body also led to the arrest of three other suspects who are said to be involved in buying stolen phones in the state.
Alagba, in a statement made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, gave the names of the arrested suspects as Audu John, Dominic Diezibe, James Believe and David Emmanuel.
We picked interest in this case because the owner of the phone was robbed at gunpoint.
One of the challenges we face in the streets of Yenagoa today is pocket crime like this.
I call it a pocket crime because these criminals go about with these locally made pistols to steal valuables from innocent citizens who go about their normal daily hustles.
These four suspects were arrested through the help of a phone tracking device.
The phone was tracked to one Audu John, who resides at Biogbolo, Yenagoa, who led us to arrest other suspects including a popular phone repairer in Amarata, Mr. David Emmanuel.
Police spokesman in Bayelsa State SP Asinim Butswat confirmed the arrest, saying they are in police custody and investigation was on.
Ministry, CODE to track N6bn Kaduna projects
The Ministry of Budget and National Planning will partner with Follow The Money of the Connected Development (CODE) to track constituency projects in Kaduna valued at N6 billion in the 2020 and 2021 budgets.
The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, who is also co-chair of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), said this while receiving Follow The Money activists in his office recently.
He said The Eye Mark App, a secured web and mobile-based application will be launched by the ministry to enable citizens to update information about community projects and their status.
Programmes Associate, Mr Kingsley Agu, who led the team said CODE in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation was setting the pace to initiate governance and budgeting reforms through a campaign to deepen citizens interest in governments spending and address accompanying corrupt practices.
Agu added that collaboration with the ministry was a strategic move to collectively combat corruption, illicit financial flows and track to completion, development projects in rural areas so people can have access to potable drinking water, standard healthcare and even primary education.
WikiLeaks founder Assange denied bail despite US extradition block
WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange must remain in custody in Britain, while the US appeals a court decision to block his extradition to face charges there for leaking secret documents, a judge in London ruled Wednesday.
Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who on Monday refused to grant his extradition, told Westminster Magistrates Court that if released there were substantial grounds to suspect Assange would fail to surrender for future appeal hearings.
Mr Assange still has an incentive to abscond from these as yet unresolved proceedings, she said.
As a matter of fairness the United States must be able to challenge my decision.
If Mr Assange absconds during this process then they will have lost the opportunity to do so.
Outside court, lawyer Stella Morris, Assanges fiancee and the mother of two of his children, called the decision a huge disappointment and urged the US Justice Department to drop the charges.
A lawyer for the US government earlier urged Baraitser not to release the controversial Australian publisher, and detailed how it planned to challenge her decision to block his extradition on mental health grounds.
We respectfully submit on behalf of the United States that there are insurmountable hurdles to Mr Assange being granted bail, Clair Dobbin said.
She added there were no conditions that could guarantee his surrender in future.
The history of his attempts to evade extradition to the United States demonstrate that he is capable of going to any length to avoid that possibility, Dobbin said.
The court should be under no doubt about his resources to abscond and pointed to offers of political asylum, notably from Mexico, she added.
Motive to abscond
Assange attended court wearing a suit and mask over his mouth, two days after the unexpected decision to deny his removal to the United States on the basis the risk of his suicide there was too great.
Edward Fitzgerald, his lawyer, argued he should be freed after spending 15 months in custody awaiting the extradition proceedings.
Baraitsers decision on Monday certainly changes any motive to abscond, he added.
The court has given a decision and the decision has been that he should be discharged.
Assange is wanted in Washington to face 18 charges relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The US claims he helped intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning steal the 2010 documents before exposing confidential sources around the world.
He faces a possible 175-year sentence if convicted but Assange and his lawyers have long argued the case against him is politically motivated.
He has been held at the high-security Belmarsh prison in southeast London.
A previous request for bail in March on the grounds he was vulnerable to Covid-19 behind bars was rejected.
Assange sought sanctuary in Ecuadors embassy in 2012, after Sweden issued an arrest warrant in connection with sexual assault allegations.
He spent seven years at the South American countrys London mission until the government in Quito revoked his citizenship.
British police dragged him out and arrested him in 2019.
He was then sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail terms in connection with the Swedish case, which was later dropped due to lack of evidence.
The UN called the sentence disproportionate.
Unnecessarily cruel
Assanges long-running legal woes have become a cause celebre for media freedom, even though the judge hearing the case said he did have a case to answer.
Baraitser on Monday said he would have been well aware of the effects of his leaking of secret documents, and his actions went well beyond the role of a journalist.
But she said extradition would be oppressive as his mental health would probably deteriorate in the US penal system, causing him to commit suicide.
She rejected US experts testimony that Assange would be protected from self-harm, noting that others such as disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein had managed to kill themselves in custody despite supervision.
UN rapporteur on torture
Nils Melzer applauded the decision to block his extradition, and said he should be freed and compensated for his ordeal, which amounted to arbitrary detention.
But he said Baraitser had effectively confirmed the rationale behind the US case, which effectively amounts to criminalising national security journalism.
The United States has called the ruling extremely disappointing and has faced calls from WikiLeaks, as well as rights and media freedom groups to drop the appeal.
Media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said Wednesdays denial of bail was unnecessarily cruel.
Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson urged outgoing US President Donald Trump and his successor Joe Biden to pardon Assange, while expressing confidence justice will prevail.
Ahmed Musa set to make NPFL return against Adamawa Utd
Kano Pillars have said their new signing, Ahmed Musa will make his debut against relegation bound Adamawa United on Sunday, May 16.
This was disclosed on Sunday in a statement by Pillars Spokesman, Alhaji Idris Rilwanu Malikawa immediately after their 1-1 draw against Warri Wolves in Ozoro.
Pillars who were reduced to 10-men in the first half of the match took the lead through Auwalu Malam Ali in the 58th minute before Mark Daniel scored the equaliser for the hosts from the spot in the 86th minute to force the former Nigerian champions to a 1-1 draw.
Malikawa said Pillars have since returned to Kano where they would intensify preparations for their next match against Adamawa United.
The Spokesman also quoted the Technical Adviser of Pillars, Ibrahim Musa as saying The next thing for us is to go and concentrate on match day 21 against Adamawa United FC at Ahmadu Bello stadium kaduna next week.
Playing against a relegated team is not easy but we would do our best to win the maximum points in order to consolidate on our position and target for the season.
Varsity workers to FG: Campus security men need guns
The president of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), Mohammed Ibrahim Haruna, says his members are no long safe on campuses.
He called on the Federal Government to license the use of guns for local security men on various campuses to protect the institutions.
He was addressing newsmen in Abuja at the weekend after the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the association.
He said this would help all the established security agencies already overwhelmed with security challenges.
Were here to deliberate on a wide range of issues.
Topmost among those issues is the security of our members who work in the university environment.
Our members cant travel freely, they cant move around with ease, anytime they do so, they get kidnapped.
This is unacceptable!
Were calling on the federal government to license our security men on campuses who are our members, train and re-train them from time to time and monitor them.
By doing this, security challenges in our institutions will reduce, Haruna said.
He cautioned the government against paralyzing academic activities in tertiary institutions again with its lackadaisical attitude towards the implementation of the Memorandum of Action (MoA)
both parties signed.
He explained only three of their eight demands had been addressed partially by the government.
He said the association might resume its suspended strike soon if the issues that had continued to make members poorer than expected were not quickly addressed.
Biden makes history, declares century-old killing of Armenians genocide
President Joe Biden has formally recognized the Ottoman Empires killing and deportation of Armenians over a century ago as a genocide.
The declaration is a break from his predecessors and risking inflaming tensions with Turkey, a NATO ally.
Biden had pledged as a presidential candidate to recognize the Armenians treatment, which took place in modern-day Turkey, as genocide.
Armenian-Americans have long called on U.S. presidents to do so, but Turkey, a key NATO ally, has warned the U.S. against it, long maintaining that the violence was part of bloody clashes during World War I.
The Turkish government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not yet responded to Bidens designation, but its foreign minister warned earlier this week a declaration would make relations worse.
for dia first call for Biden tenure and convey him interest for constructive bilateral relationship wit expanded area of cooporation and effective management and disagreementBidens tenure ” and conveyed his interest in a constructive bilateral relationship with expanded areas of cooperation
Biden used the word genocidein a statement to mark Armenian Remembrance Dayon Saturday ” 106 years after the events that the Armenian diaspora considers the start of the genocide.
Previous presidents had avoided using the label even as they made the traditional, annual proclamation honouring the anniversary.
Each year on this day, we remember the lives of all those who died in the Ottoman-era Armenian genocide and recommit ourselves to preventing such an atrocity from ever again occurring,Biden said in the statement.
Beginning on April 24, 1915, with the arrest of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople by Ottoman authorities,
one and a half million Armenians were deported, massacred, or marched to their deaths in a campaign of extermination.
The statement was expected, especially after then-candidate Biden marked last years remembrance day by saying, Silence is complicity.
If we do not fully acknowledge, commemorate, and teach our children about genocide, the words never again lose their meaning,he wrote, pledging to back a congressional resolution that recognized the Ottoman Empires actions as genocide.
Resolutions to recognize the genocide passed the House and Senate in 2019, but
former President Donald Trump, like his predecessors, never joined them.
On Wednesday, over 100 bipartisan members of Congress sent a letter to Biden calling on him to use his proclamation to officially label what happened a genocide.
The Ottoman Turks deported around 2 million Armenians starting in 1915.
Around 1.5 million Armenians are estimated to have been killed.
The Turkish government has agreed that fighting during the war killed many, but it has long denied that the treatment of the Christian Armenians by the Muslim Ottomans amounted to genocide and says that the death toll was lower.
Over two-dozen countries have recognized the atrocities as genocide, according to the Armenian National Institute, a Washington-based group that advocates for the genocide designation.
Bidens statement carries no legal implication, and even if the State Department were to follow up with a formal declaration, there are no automatic sanctions or other penalties that kick in.
On its final day with former President Donald Trump in office, the Trump administration declared the Chinese governments treatment of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities as genocide, without implementing sanctions.
But the comments will rattle U.S.-Turkish relations, already on ice over a litany of disagreements, and could damage relations between Biden and Erdogan, who had a warm relationship with Trump.
Trump often touted his friendshipwith the strongman president and repeatedly pulled punches against his government until his hand was forced by political pressure, including from congressional Republicans.

Prince Philip interred in royal vault of St Georges Chapel
Prince Philips coffin has been interred in the royal vault of St Georges Chapel.
It was placed on a catafalque on a marble slab and lowered into the vault by an electric motor.
The vault was created between 1804 and 1810 for George III, who died in 1820 and is one of three kings buried there.
The other two are George IV and William IV.
Horns were played as his coffin was lowered down.
A blessing was given by the Archbishop of Canterbury before the choir sang the national anthem, God Save the Queen.
The members of the royal family looked up as the choir sang while the queen bowed her head.
The 94-year-old monarch was then led out of the church by the archbishop and followed by her family members.
Prince William, her grandson, was seen glancing back at the vault as he left his pew.
In the funeral procession which departed Windsor Castle to the chapel was Queen Elizabeth II, who was driven in a car.
It was her first appearance in public since the death of her husband.

How support tools, others can uplift 41.5m MSMEs
Nigerias Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) industry is not being optimised as it should be in spite of its critical role in national development.
Although MSMEs contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has not been clear because of the lack of structure and data, the narrative is fast changing.
According to data by the Small and Medium scale Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), there are about 41.5 million MSMEs in Nigeria.
Collectively they account for about 50 percent of Nigerias GDP.
There is growing consciousness of the critical role MSMEs play in economic development.
Beyond job creation, MSMEs are critical to improving the living standards of citizens as well as important local capital formation.
They also help drive innovation and competition in developing economies.
Towards boosting the growth of MSMEs, there have been several MSMEs-supported programmes by the federal government through the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA), SMEDAN and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which has been the biggest enabler of small businesses.
The CBN intervenes with soft loans disbursed through the deposit money banks and the microfinance banks, especially the NIRSAL Microfinance bank.
Aside from the public sector-sponsored initiatives, there are private sector entities striving to support MSMEs sector.
One of these is the MTN Revv programme which helps small businesses rethink and re-learn their operations to enable them to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This year, 200 MSMEs were selected to be a part of MTNs accelerator programme, Yello 200, from across the country.
The participants had a series of 11 master-classes by seasoned facilitators across various subsectors of the economy.
At the graduation ceremony recently, some beneficiaries and the coordinators spoke about the programme.
Olubukola Ogunmola, CEO of Wanbuk and Device which produces pap, said he has benefited immensely.
Our workforce has also grown to enable us to meet the demands of our growing customers.
Another beneficiary, Daniel Ikwong, CEO of Future IDEAS said: I have been well equipped with best practices and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the Yello 200 onboarding experience; the business has not been the same again.
Also, Raheem Yusuff Olatunji, CEO, Yutex Entertainment said for him, the programme was a rewarding experience.
Im now a better manager of my business.
It couldnt have happened at a better time because the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on my company was enormous.
The Chief Enterprise Business Officer, MTN Nigeria,
Lynda Saint-Nwafor, said, With MSMEs accounting for 94% of all businesses in Nigeria and 84% of employment.
So our goal is to empower MSMEs with the tool to make them thrive in the economy.
Modupe Kadri, Chief Financial Officer, MTN Nigeria, said: We have always believed SMEs are the wheels that drive any economy and that positioning them for growth means empowering and enabling them with the right digital solutions.
Equally, Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited and the Whitefield Foundation recently empowered over 20,000 individuals with business skills across the 36 states of Nigeria through the Special Intervention Programme (SIP).
They said through SIP, they have been able to support the livelihood of young Nigerians following the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which hit in 2020.
By the end of the programme in April, the participants had completed three different stages of courses anchored by seasoned facilitators.
During the graduation ceremony recently, the Director, Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability of the firm, Nwamaka Onyemelukwe said: We recognized that unemployment rates were on the rise with the poverty rates reaching a peak, and as a socially-responsible company focused on refreshing the world, we are also committed to making a difference in the lives of people and communities.
Founder, Whitefield Foundation, Olufunmilola Johnson said, We are excited by the success of SIP and this initiative was born out of the need to help make more successful people who will grow our economy in Nigeria.
A beneficiary, Anu Oshilaja, founder of Annyz Fabric Bags, shared her life-changing story on the impact of the programme and the funding she had received to further her business.
She also gifted hand-crafted bags to the women dignitaries at the event.
Reasons Katsina zobo farmers recorded poor harvest
Hibiscus roselle (zobo) farmers in Katsina State have recorded a decline in production despite fair rainfall this year.
The farmers said the poor harvest was as a result of the absence of affordable fertiliser from the beginning of the rainy season, and the invasion of their farms by herdsmen from Niger Republic.
They also lamented that the continued relocation of some of their markets and lack of government support were part of their major challenges this year.
They observed that the heavy rainfall recorded towards the end of the season did not favour the roselle plant to grow up to its usual height, which would have enabled it to produce good seeds that would eventually produce the blossom red seed coat or cover, popularly known as zobo.
A renowned farmer, Malam Abdullahi Kwangwama
Malam Abdullahi Kwangwama, a zobo farmer in Mani Local Government Area of the state, in an interview with Daily Trust, disclosed that from the beginning of last season there was no manure or fertiliser to apply to the plant, a situation that slowed down its growth.
Malam Kwangwama said, We did not get any fertiliser from the government throughout the season, and that made it difficult for the plant to grow early.
The few bags we were able to buy from the market at N12,000 per bag came late, and it couldnt help it to grow up to the height of my chest, which is its normal height; therefore, it couldnt produce much seeds.
I did not plant much food crops this year.
And I am only able to harvest 60 bags of hibiscus this season, as against 85 bags I got last year.
I have two wives and eight children; six of them are in school, and this is my only hope of feeding them and paying their school fees.
If government wants to support us to produce zobo in commercial quantity for domestic use in Nigeria and export, all they need to do is make adequate plans for the provision of fertiliser at cheaper prices and support farmers to access non-interest loans that can enable us hire and cultivate more farmlands.
This is because buyers are always waiting for the produce, and we are ready to do more as well.
The roselle seed coat or cover is used in producing the popular zobo juice in Nigeria, which is considered useful in the treatment of stomach upset, high blood pressure, weight loss, among others.
In some countries, it is used in tea production, colouring, dyeing, drug production and cosmetics.
Another farmer and merchant of zobo, Ali Makeri, complained that one of the challenges they were facing was the relocation of the market by the authorities of Mashi Local Government Area, which he said was affecting patronage.
According to him, the market has been relocated severally to various places, which are far away from the Mashi main market.
He further said, Even though we pay revenue to the local government and create jobs, for over five times they have been relocating us from one bushy area to another.
Once they discovered that we had settled and developed a particular place, they would come overnight and take us to another isolated area.
The last one was this year when they brought us here, close to the Mashi Ultra-Modern Market.
It is far away from the main market and our customers are scared to come here, for security purposes.
Therefore, we are appealing to the chairman to reason with us and allocate a permanent and convenient place close to the main market because most of our customers come from different parts of the country; and they will be comfortable if we are close to the main market.
On whether zobo farmers in Katsina State have the capacity to produce large quantities for export, Makeri said, Why not?
There are hundreds of men and women hibiscus farmers in Katsina State because it is lucrative.
Last year alone, we sold it at N8,000 per bag from the beginning, and at some point, it reached N20,000 per bag.
All we need is support.
If government can attract investors here and build a factory that can supply us with fertiliser, equipment and loans to hire more lands, I can assure you that we will generate more revenue for Nigeria.
Another farmer, Malam Yusuf Gwani Gobirawa in Kaita Local Government Area complained that herdsmen from neighbouring Niger Republic invaded their farms before they could finish harvesting this year.
He said, Our hibiscus did not ripe very well when we noticed that herdsmen from Niger Republic arrived and started pushing their animals into our farms.
However, the member representing us in the House of Assembly intervened through traditional rulers and we were asked to quickly harvest anything remaining in our farms in order to avoid clashes with the herdsmen.
I got only 45 bags as against the 70 to 80
I expected this year.
Our borders are porous.
Government needs to check the activities of these herdsmen from Niger Republic by closing the border, especially when it comes towards the end of seasons so that we can peacefully harvest our farm produce.
You know we largely depend on local manure from our domestic cattle.
But now, we cannot keep our animals away from home.
Even at home, we are having sleepless nights to protect them from being stolen.
We are really helpless in the hands of the rustlers.
Zobo is sold in Dankama, Mashi and Maiadua markets in the state.
The current market price is between N7,500 and N8,000 per bag.
It is expected to reach N20,000 before the beginning of next season.
The major producers of the crop in Nigeria are Katsina, Kano, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe and Jigawa states.
In 2017 the Nigerian Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS) disclosed that the country generated $35million within nine months in 2017 from zobo export.
Lagos East: Court of Appeal upholds Abirus victory
The Court of Appeal has dismissed the appeal filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the December 5 Lagos East Senatorial by-election, Babatunde Olalere Gbadamosi.
The presiding judge, Justice Daniel Kallio dismissed the prayers of the appellants seeking to upturn the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Senator Mukhail Adetokunbo Abiru, for lacking in merit.
In the ruling delivered virtually, the court said PDP and its candidates appeal was unmeritorious.
It subsequently affirmed the judgment of the Federal High Court, Lagos.
In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the residency of a candidate to an election is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor.

there ye shall be sold unto your enemies ¦.and no man shall buy you.
Now will he (the Lord) remember their (Jews) iniquity, and visit their (Jews) sins: they (Jews) shall return to Egypt.
Reading the three passages from the New and Old Testament of the Bible, one gets the impression that World Jewry has the unenviable task of averting or mitigating what Bible scholars aptly refer to as the Second Bondage!
This reflects in Israeli response to the slightest of provocations, which also goes to remind us of the parable of a dying man who refuses to go down alone.
The stage for the current slaughter in the Middle East was laid when the world commemorated the 75th anniversary of the so-called holocaust last year.
After the semblance of an entente cordiale that followed the event, and even before images from Auschwitz and Jerusalem disappeared from television screens, then cantankerous American President, Donald Trump, rolled out a Middle East Peace Plan that virtually rolled back the modest progress made in the restive region.
If Trumps successor, President Joe Biden has a plan to resolve the crisis in the Middle East, he is yet to unfold it.
So far, Mr Biden appears satisfied to stick to the wrong-headed plan he inherited from Mr Trump.
Whatever the case, it was careless of Mr Biden to play down the ongoing holocaust in occupied Palestine on the epidemic excuse that Israelis have a right to defend themselves!
In one fell swoop, Mr Biden has behaved typically by wittingly shredding the Oslo and Camp David Accords.
Bidens unadvertised plan, which morbidly fits into Trumps final solution, means occupied Palestine will retain its ignoble status as one big prison where eviction of Palestinians and expropriation of their lands will proceed, pari passu, with their unrestrained slaughter.
It is all in the queer belief that the only good Palestinian is the dead one!
Since Israel officially came into being in 1948, the unadvertised goal of stiff-necked Jewish leaders and their clappers has been to shatter the alleged record set by Adolf Hitler.
And, strangely, a complicit world keeps goading Israel!
All these are coming at a time world powers claim they are increasingly united against forces of terror and darkness.
Hypocrisy is winning and, as usual, America and the West are basking in their warped victory.
Basking from a one-directional backing of Trumps unregenerate policies, hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose country has been responsible for most of the violence in the world, has been grinning from ear to ear.
But the culture of silence has never always been infectious.
On the other side of the divide is Iran and a few Muslim and Palestinian organisations that have been consistent in their condemnation of what they consider the annual ritual commemoration of a hollow cause.
But as has always happened, they have had their shrill cry of condemnation drowned in the global display of hypocrisy.
Under normal circumstances, any act of great destruction and loss of life, such as the genocide (in Rwanda), ethnic cleansing (as in Bosnia Herzegovina and Myanmar)
apartheid (in white minority-ruled South Africa) and the senseless Jewish discriminatory practices (in occupied Palestine) qualify to be referred to as holocaust.
Strangely, the word holocaust is rendered hollow in its restricted application as it is exclusively and, hypocritically, employed to refer to the alleged incineration of six Jews in concentration camps.
May be Adolf Hitler was wrong but the way the descendants of his alleged six million victims behave in the Middle East, one is tempted to ask, at the risk of being dubbed anti-Semite: was Hitler right?
This question will continue to excite in view of the unspeakable and despicable atrocities committed by Jews in occupied Palestine.
Little wonder that, despite efforts to criminalise holocaust-denial, Palestinians and their American and European sympathisers desist from criminalising and animalising Adolf Hitler.
No holocaust or Final Solution ever worked!
And the proof of this could be found in successive Israeli offensives in occupied Palestine that laid bare the vulnerability of the overrated Israeli Defence Force, IDF.
For instance, whatever air of invincibility the IDF enjoyed has evaporated in the face of resistance from Hamas and Hezbollah (Hizbullah; Party of God) and other anti-occupation groups!
While world powers continue to turn a blind eye, extremist groups, many of them trained by the United States to contain Soviet expansionism, have grabbed the initiative.
The struggle for the creation of Israel was not a tea party nor was the state birthed by United Nations resolutions.
Rather, it came through the barrel of the gun!
It was the bombing spree of Jewish terrorist organisations that led to the creation of Israel in 1948.
Palestinians have been told they have no option but to fight.
Reason?
American Middle East policies provide the tonic they need to fight.
In fact, for every Hamas and other militant Palestinian groups the world knows today, the Jews had their terrorist Irgun and Zvai terror machines.
They are doing for Palestine what Zvai and Irgun did for Israel in the early part of the 20th Century.
As good students of history, Hamas and allied radical Palestinian groups are aware that no amount of hours spent around tables would give them a home!
If Palestinians fail to emulate their fighting Jewish cousins of the early and mid-20th Century, they should just as well forget about a Palestinian homeland!
Let the world continue to believe that Palestinians are an unformed people and continue to see Jews as a special breed.
Fine!
It does not even matter that some western countries see holocaust denial as a major crime and refuse to apply the word to victims of Israeli discriminatory practices against their Palestinian cousins.
What does matter, at the end of the day, is that it amounts to a hollow cause to glorify one holocaust and turn the blind eye to another!

Why Abia prefers dry port to airport ” Gov. Ikpeazu
The Governor of Abia State, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has said that the state under his administration would prefer to build a dry port instead of an airport.
As governor of this state, I am thinking of a dry port.
I have heard people ask why not an airport
and I want to seize this opportunity to officially respond to the issue of an airport.
For me, the need for a dry port will serve the economic interest of my people better than the need for an airport
I am happy to acknowledge the fact that neighbouring states to Abia have airports.
What that means is that within 100 kilometres radius, Abia will have access to airport, but what you cannot find within a hundred kilometres radius is a dry port,he said.
The Governor said an airport in Abia would likely serve less than 10 per cent of the Abia populace and business interest, considering that such airport would not have an operational international cargo status.
So, I think the way to go is to look at what will serve my people, about 95 per cent of goods you find at the seaport in Apapa and Onne ports including those that are delayed for three months belong to my people here in Abia.
As the governor, the question I ask myself is, can I in any way lift this burden when I bring them to a point of importing or exporting goods to or from Abia?
That is why I think that a dry port will serve the business interest of my people than an airport,he said.
Inflation rate drops to 18.12%, first in 20 months
Inflation rate has dropped to 18.12 percent in April from 18.17 percent recorded in March, the latest report said.
The decline in inflation rate which is slightly at 0.5 percent, is the first in the last 20 months since the country recorded a steady rise.
The rural index also rose by 0.95% in April, down by 0.57% from the 1.52% recorded in March 2021.
Food inflation rate declined to 22.75% in April from 22.95% in March.
The rise in the food index was caused by an increase in prices of coffee, tea, coca, bread and cereals, soft drinks, milk, cheese and eggs, among others, it noted.
On a month-on-month basis, the food sub index increased by 0.99% in April 2021, down by 0.91% points from 1.90% recorded in March 2021.
Analysis of the report showed that food inflation in April was highest in Kogi at (30.52%), Ebonyi (28.07%) and Sokoto (26.09%).
The following states recorded the least food inflation: Abuja (18.63%), Akwa-Ibom (18.51%), and Bauchi (17.64%).
The highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, vehicle spare parts, hairdressing salons, and personal grooming establishments, major household goods, fuel and lubricants among others.
Gov Sule throws weight behind Keffi Polo tourney
The Governor of Nasarawa State, Engineer Abdulahi Sule has thrown his weight behind the 2021 Keffi Polo tournament billed for 21-28 of June in Keffi.
Sule said sports is not only a veritable tool for fostering friendship, national unity and cultural understanding but also a magnet for international diplomacy and global investment.
He said the state is proud to host and support the Keffi Ranch and its choice sport of polo as a way of showcasing to the world that the state welcomes prospective investors.
Sule also commended the founder of Keffi Polo Ranch, Hon.
Ahmed Wadada for his tenacity, zeal and commitment to the promotion of the game in the state.
Ive always believed in giving back to society.
Its a huge pleasure to champion the birth of polo here and use the proceeds to benefit the orphanages and education in Nasarawa State
and Ive been lucky my little efforts are yielding results,he said.
Tournament Manager, Bashir Mohammed told Polo Royals that the 2021 edition would be better as he disclosed that many teams have indicated interest to vie for top laurels during the weeklong fiesta.
Wike, Amaechi bicker over cause of insecurity in Rivers
Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has countered transport minister Rotimi Amaechis claim linking insecurity in Rivers to unemployment.
Amaechi had made the comments during the defection of two former commissioners in Wikes administration to the APC in Port Harcourt.
He had also countered the imposition of a curfew in Rivers arguing that he took the war to the camp of criminals terrorising the state when he was governor.
In a statement issued by Wikes special assistant on media, Kevin Ebiri, the governor called the ministers comments disingenuous.
Is unemployment fuelling insecurity in Kaduna, Plateau, Borno, Yobe, Ondo, Ebony, Imo, Niger States governed by the All Progressives Congress (APC),he queried.
He said if the minister, who is the immediate past governor of the state has any modicum of sincerity, he will attest to the fact that security is the sole responsibility of the federal government.
It is a well-known fact that Amaechi is the one who appoints every Commissioner of Police that has been posted to Rivers State since 2015.
So, if there is any security failure, he is to blame,he pointed out.
Governor Wike described the ministers utterance on the current imposition of curfew in the State, following the recent attacks on police formations, as rather unfortunate.
Perhaps, the minister is happy that members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) are killing innocent policemen, who were protecting lives and property.
Is Amaechi happy that the weapons of this slain security personnel were carted away by the hoodlums?
Amaechi, from all indications, has lost focus and is now frustrated,he stated.
Diet and brain training help Mickelson to major history
Phil Mickelson is not the first middle-aged person to change his diet and engage in brain training in a quest to feel and perform better, but he is the first to win a major golf championship after turning 50.
While Mickelsons performance at the PGA Championship will provide further that it is not too late to pad those career resumes with another major victory.
Theres no reason why golf can't be the game for a lifetime if you take care of your body and do it the right way,the Californian said after beating Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen by two strokes at Kiawah Island on Sunday.
US based group plans to revive baseball in Nigeria
The International Sports Association (ISA), a US-based global sports body, has indicated its readiness to revive baseball and softball games in Nigeria.
To this end, it has concluded plans to build a baseball sports academy in Ilorin in its first phase of the audacious project expected to gulp millions of dollars across the country to develop young talents.
Speaking with journalists in Ilorin, the president of the ISA, Jason Alan Charles, who led other members of the organization to the state said the development programme would train indigenous coaches who are expected to bring out the best in the young lads.
We intend to achieve all these through the construction of academies, training of indigenous coaches through coaching clinic, courses, classes, online video and manuals among others to avail them requisite knowledge and ability to excel and produce world-class talents in baseball, he noted.
According to him, the programme, expected to kick-start in August in Kwara state, would focus on scouting for young talents in baseball across the state from age six to university undergraduates.
Also speaking, the states Director of Sports, Ibrahim Alarape, praised ISA for the choice of Kwara state to pilot the baseball game development programme, saying that the sports academy would also propel enthusiasm among lovers of the game.
Team Nigeria Japan camp opens July 3 for Tokyo Olympics
The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has unveiled a comprehensive plan for Team Nigeria towards winning medals at the Tokyo Olympics.
According to the roadmap released by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Nebeolisa Anako on Thursday, the final stage of local camping will take place from May 15 to July 6 in Bayelsa, Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt.
Track and Field National Olympics Trials will take place between June 17 and July 19, while the African Athletics Championship takes centre stage from June 22 to 26.
The last phase of the camping will be in Kisarazu, Japan, from July 3 to 23, when the first batch of athletes will enter the Games Village for the Olympics proper.
Nigeria will present about 80 athletes in 10 Sports at the Tokyo Olympics.
Wrestling, taekwondo, table tennis, male and female basketball are some of the events Nigeria have qualified.
Others are track and field, weightlifting and rowing, canoeing and sailing.
Nigeria decided to narrow down her participation to sports where she has competitive advantage in winning medals.
Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare has maintained that Team Nigeria will improve on her performance of the last two Olympics, where she won only two bronze in football and Track and Field.
Meanwhile, the Nigeria female Rowing team departed for Lucerne, Switzerland, on Wednesday to participate in the final Qualifiers for the Regatta event of the Tokyo Olympics.
Ahmed Musa may leave Pillars in June
Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, has given a hint that he may leave Kano Pillars in June.
The former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City striker joined Pillars temporarily having been without a club for months.
Although he refused to disclose his next destination, he said by next month, it will be known.
In an interview he granted on Wednesday, Musa also said he is not the one to advise Nigerian players based in Europe to return to the NPFL.
I cant speak for everyone.
I can only speak for myself.
I am very happy to come back to Nigeria to play football.
It is a matter of time.
Maybe in the next one month, I may not be in Nigeria again.
Right now, I am happy coming back home to play.
For now, I dont have any concrete information but by next month, you will know,said Musa about his next destination.
Rabiu Ali, a hero
Musa lauded his teammate, Rabiu Ali, for honouring him with Kano Pillars captains armband.
Few seconds before Kano Pillars week 21 clash with Adamawa United last Sunday, Ali handed over the captains band to Musa who eventually propelled the team to a 1-0 victory.
Musa who described Rabiu as Kano Pillars legend, said he felt honoured by the kind gesture of the player who is popularly called Pele.
He said: I have so much respect for Rabiu Ali.
He is one of my legends.
I played along with him back then in Kano Pillars.
And coming back to play with him, I really respect him a lot
and I want to say a big thank you to him for what he did the other day.
It is not everyone who can do such a thing.
I really want to thank him.
Tsitsipas to meet Norrie in Lyon final
World number five Stefanos Tsitsipas came from a set down to beat Lorenzo Musetti 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 on Saturday and reach the final of the ATP event in Lyon.
In Sundays final, the 22-year-old Greek will face Britains Cameron Norrie who raced past Karen Khachanov 6-1, 6-1 in the other semi-final.
Norrie, 25, had already played on Saturday morning having beaten French hope Arthur Rinderknech 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in a quarter-final suspended overnight with the last set still to play.
Musetti, 19, came into the event as an alternate but made the most of his chance with wins over seventh seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, Sebastian Korda and Aljaz Bedene.
The Italian teenager grabbed the first set but Tsitsipas gradually took charge.
It was important I had a match like this,said Tsitsipas on the court after the match.
It makes me stay humble and focus on some detailed things I can potentially improve and get better at on clay.
I had to stay calm.
It was difficult to be a set down and have to kind of refresh myself and come anew in the second set.
Fans want Osho sacked as Enyimba exit Confed Cup
Fans of Enyimba have called for the sack of the technical adviser, Coach Fatai Osho after the Peoples elephants crashed out of this years CAF Confederation Cup on Sunday.
After suffering a 4-1 loss in the first leg, Enyimba forced Pyramids of Egypt to a 1-1 draw in the return leg in Aba to exit the competition on a 2-5 aggregate.
Immediately after the match, fans of Enyimba expressed their disappointment while calling for the sack of the coach.
An ardent fan, Austin Ihenacho said I think we Enyimba fans are tired of putting up with osho and his local tactics.
How is sun a tactic in football in the 21st century?
It shows he doesnt have any other trick up his sleeves.
He should just bow out honourably.
Ugo Udogu said Enyimba is so bad, below amateur level and with no structure.
With Fatai Osho, Enyimba have fallen from grace to grass.
He should leave.
On his part, Agbai Michael said the management of Enyimba shouldnt take the fans for granted.
If the current coach is not living up to expectations, show him the door.
We cannot continue to endure matches rather than enjoy them,he said.
TAJBank expands, opens 3 branches in Abuja
TAJBank, a non-interest bank, has opened three branches in Abuja as it drives financial inclusion while offering innovative financial services to its customers.
Potential customers were observed at the new technology-powered branches at Wuse, Garki and Gudu markets as they came to open accounts.
During the opening ceremony in Abujas
Wuse market, the banks Chairman, Alhaji Tanko Isiaku Gwamna, said the new branches were part of the banks mission to serve as a catalyst for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
sustainable growth in Nigeria.
He said, By launching these branches in locations that are particular to the ecosystem of the businessman and women, we are fulfilling our mission of making seamless banking solutions accessible to all businesses.
Since the bank opened in December 2019, it has recorded multiple feats including recording profit in its first year operation.
It plans to quickly expand its branch networks and extend its services to the six geopolitical zones.
In his remarks at the event, President of the National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS), Ken Ukaoha lauded TAJBank for bringing interest-free banking services to traders in Abuja.
Indeed, we would meet to strengthen the symbiotic relationship.
NALDA to engage 2,000 fish farmers, 1,040 soil scientists in Borno
The executive secretary of the National Agricultural Land Development Agency (NALDA), Prince Paul Ikonne, said the agency was engaging about 2,000 fish farmers and would commence the training of 1,040 soil doctors in Borno State.
Ikonne told journalists in Abuja after a meeting with the governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana
Umara
Zulum, that the discussion between the NALDA and the Borno State Government was on our fish farming programme, which we are engaging more than 2,000 farmers.
Borno State has submitted their complete list and has provided the locations.
As we speak, contractors are already at the site and in the 10 locations for the project.
So the governor of Borno State has fully keyed into Mr Presidents idea of achieving food security, irrespective of the challenges the state is encountering.
The governor is making it easier for the NALDA to function and for farmers to be at home while farming,he said.
The NALDA (an agency which is directly under the presidency) last month announced the presidents approval to engage 30,000 soil doctors and extension service providers nationwide.
The training will be flagged off in Borno State early next month.
He said the agency was focusing on virtually everything in the entire agric chain in the state because they had good infrastructure in place and a lot of machineries and equipment, as well as processing mills.
Food security: Nigeria on the rise again as CBN heightens interventions
The rice pyramids have returned across the country.
The maize pyramids have returned too.
These pyramids have dotted the skylines in states like Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Jigawa, Ekiti, and a host of others.
For some others like Lagos, Edo, Rivers and more, there are CBN financed industries maximizing the farm produce to make products.
Recall that the pyramids were hitherto lost in Nigeria until the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under the leadership of Mr Godwin Emefiele, initiated a refreshing focus on agriculture, industries, small and medium scale enterprises and other areas of the real sector.
In fact, young adults in Nigeria of about 30 years never witnessed any agriculture produce pyramids until recently when the CBN made that happen.
When the CBN launched the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) over five years ago, it perhaps did not anticipate the scale of success the programme would record and the impact across the country.
But five years down the line, Nigerias agricultural landscape has changed for good and no one single region or state is left behind.
Also, it is significant to note that the benefits have been almost evenly distributed from the north to the south from the about N700 billion released for the targeted crops and animals, and their value chains.
Speaking recently in Ado Ekiti at the public unveiling of the Ekiti rice pyramid project and flag-off of the wet season rice cultivation, the CBN Governor, Mr Emefiele, said over N300bn of the about N700bn already distributed for agriculture, has been disbursed to the southern part of country including Lagos, Edo, Ekiti, and Ondo states.
He said 21 agricultural commodities have been the most targeted, among which included rice, maize, wheat, oil palm, cocoa and several others.
From inception till date, we have financed 3,107,890 farmers for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 States of the Federation and FCT,he said.
Emefiele noted that the positive impact of the Anchor Borrowers Programme can be seen in all our agrarian communities as it has brought hope to the farming population through the timely delivery of agricultural inputs and the provision of a guaranteed market for their outputs at a market determined price.
He said the ABP has been able to support some of our macroeconomic objectives by enabling more employment opportunities, driving financial inclusion and improving access to finance in our rural communities.
Under the 2020 wet season RIFAN-CBN partnership, he said CBN financed 221,450 farmers for the cultivation of 221,450 hectares in 32 States.
The pyramids being unveiled today are part of the harvest from the various fields from the South-West and other neighbouring States to demonstrate the spread of the movement and provide evidence that rice production is viable in all States of the Federation.
He said beyond RIFAN, the CBN supported a number of prime/private anchors.
Omoluabi Farms (Ekiti), Time Sellers (Ogun), Truechem (Ogun), Wems Agro (Ondo) and many more awaiting disbursements for the 2021 wet season.
Thus, CBNs huge support for agriculture is ensuring food sufficiency, empowerment of peasant farmers and helping to save foreign exchange for Nigeria as less food imports happen.
The CBN has continued to rev up investments in the agricultural space.
It has commenced the 2021 wet season farming investments.
Emefiele said: We have a very optimistic outlook for the 2021 wet season.
We will bring to bear our learning experiences over the past years, adoption of hybrids and high yielding varieties, timely supply of inputs to take advantage of the planting seasons, and good market linkages to sustain our effort at increasing production.
We have planned a minimum one million hectares of rice through a combination of RIFAN farmers and prime/private anchors for each planting season in 2021.
Our backward integration drive with rice millers is also gaining momentum as we intend to finance some millers to grow their own paddy during this wet season.
We also have aggressive production plans for maize, wheat, soybeans, cassava, sorghum and cassava,he said.
The governor also indicated that the CBN will be helping states with funds to clear land as land clearing is a huge problem to farming.
Land clearing, access to irrigation, and availability of high yielding seeds have remained the greatest challenge to increased agricultural production in the South and we have provided long term financing options targeted at unlocking more land for agricultural production nationwide.
The Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS) and the Private-Sector Led Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (P-AADS) were established to address this concern for the State Government and Private Sector players respectively.
The provision of other farm related infrastructure like irrigation facilities, rural access road, mechanization services, logistics and post-harvest handling activities can be accommodated under these interventionshe stated.
He also said if farmers pay their loans, the CBN could intervene in more areas thus urging the farmers who benefited from the loans to pay back.
Loan repayment is the hallmark of every credit cycle and the sustainability of the programme is hinged on farmers ability and willingness to repay their loans, and we are constantly engaging with them to enhance their trust in the system.
The pyramids being unveiled today are harvests from the financed fields that have been submitted as part of loan repayment by farmers under the RIFAN-CBN programme.
To further create value and transfer these gains across the value chain, we have mapped rice millers to off-take the paddies, and we will track the release of their outputs to the market, as we strive to manage inflation and grow the rice value chain in Nigeria,he said.
In support of the growth recorded in this drive to attain self-sufficiency in food production and to moderate prices of agricultural commodities, Mr President has approved the resuscitation of the Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX).
A vibrant commodity exchange will significantly enhance post-harvest handling, guarantee effective pricing for farmers, minimize the adverse effect of middlemen and commodity hoarders and ultimately transfer the gains from primary production to other nodes of the value chain.
Considering the huge market and high population of Nigeria with the urgent need to eradicate poverty, it has successfully demonstrated the need to look inwards by taking advantage of the available fertile land, perennial river bodies and human resources for the production of rice.
The first two years of the programme (2015 to 2017) recorded significant increase in rice production with resultant decrease in rice importation.
For instance, rice importation from Thailand fell from 644,131 metric tonnes in September 2015 to 20,000 metric tonnes in September 2017, which accounts for a drop of over 90%.
The success so far recorded was made possible because of the Anchor borrowers program introduced by the Federal government in conjunction with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) that has not only improved rice production but has also enhanced the quality through de-stoning.
It has also seen the increase in the number of local rice mills,he stated.
He said the federal government disbursed money to the Anchor and in conjunction with the participating States, for land clearing, provision of seeds for planting, inputs such as knapsack sprayers, tube wells, pumping machines, ploughs, combined harvesters, rice milling machines and production lines, packaging were also provided.
Furthermore, analysis of the ABP programme indicates that funds provided at low interest made possible: easy access to rice farmers; economies of scale as large clusters of farmers are enlisted into the programme; enhanced the rice value chain in the form of finance to primary producers to processors “ handlers “ wholesalers “ storage “ marketing (branding) “ export; improvement in farmers fortunes; and employment generation.
The others are food sufficiency, thereby banishing poverty and insecurity; generation of revenue as farmers will now pay taxes; and improvement in the economy as naira gains value.
He also noted that this ease of production of rice -the most valued staple in Nigeria- has been successfully practiced and celebrated in some states like Kebbi, Jigawa, Sokoto, Niger, Kwara, Ebonyi etc.
It is gratifying that today, Ekiti State is now joining the train as a participant in the Anchor Borrowers Programme of the CBN, in partnership with the National body of Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria led by Alhaji Goronyo.
Bode George describes Constitution review as a charade
Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has described the ongoing constitutional review by the National Assembly as a charade.
He said the unanimous position of the Nigerian people is the total overhaul of the present constitution, adding, Nothing else will do.
According to him, a genuineremedy would be to revisit the report of the 2014 Constitutional Conference which he noted has been generally applauded for the sweeping breadth of its equity and democratic balance in rectifying the prejudicial and unworkable structures that are on the ground now.
In an open letter to the Senate President, George also faulted the process of the ongoing constitution review, especially the public hearing held last week, noting that many people were deliberately denied the openness of democratic contributions.
He said, The hearing was stage-managed, anchored in prejudice, framed in puppeteering identification.
Alternative views were cast aside, flung into the pits.
This is not right.
This is not just.
It is obvious that the Committee is not interested in true and thorough representation of the will of the Nigerian people.
It appears to be working with a script towards a predetermined end.
The contributions were narrow, overtly partisan, one-sided, lacking in plural contributory logic.
This is not acceptable to the Nigerian people.
The structure of the present constitution is so biased, so flawed and so mangled with inequities that a mere review will not be sufficient to correct all the glaring wrongs afflicting the Nigerian state.
The PDP leader said as a believer in the unity of the Nigerian state, he stated that the nation can emerge stronger and better only when all the component units that make up our nation have a sense of belongingness and general accommodation regardless of tribe or sectarian belief, when everyone is treated equally without ethnic bias, when merit is the sole determinant of public positions.
This can only be achieved with a peoples constitution.
This is indeed what we should work for rather than the charade and the present jamboree that is chaired by Senator Ovie Omo “ Agege.
Enough of this false and misleading engagement.
Lets renew our nation through the pursuit of the truth and the resolve on the fairness doctrine.
Their-in resides the national salvation,he added.
A love letter to Mallam Nasir el-Rufai (I)
I had made up my mind to write to you openly before I saw the viral video by Dr Shadi Sabeh in which he appealed to you passionately to temper your actions with a human facewith regard to the proposed sacking of 20,000 staff of the Kaduna State Government.
I do not quite agree with Dr Sabeh that people should be kept in service just to pay them as a social service.
Nigeria cannot afford that for now.
Our economy is not a 10th as developed as the US economy
was in the 1930s when it went through the Great Depression.
However, Dr Sabeh is right to the extent that Keynesianism is back world over and a government must necessarily think about the impact of its policies on the people it serves.
We know that in Nigeria, governments unfortunately do not believe they are here to serve the people, but it is our duty to work together to change that unfortunate misunderstanding and disconnection.
There are other issues coming up in Kaduna State presently.
Indeed, the state under your governance has again been mentioned as one of the best governed and we hear of your achievements in infrastructural development.
The dangers of travelling to Kaduna has hampered many of us from coming to see those achievements, but most people know that El-Rufai is a man of achievement and a stickler for standards.
The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) cannot forget you in a hurry.
Many people rue your absence as minister.
A lot more remember you in dread.
Unfortunately, many of the villages you cleared and many of the shanties you demolished are back “ this time with a vengeance.
Why?
The governments over time have made no plans for these poor folks, and human beings “ like water “ must find their levels.
If you are flying into Abuja at any point in time, look down from the window of your aeroplane and you will see just how badly shanties have metastasized since youve been gone.
Any minister who will try and correct this anomaly will have millions of refugees on his hands.
In your time, it was 500,000 refugees we had.
As at 2006, Nigeria had the second highest number of displaced people in the world “ after Iraq “ due to your actions.
I recall writing to you then through my Daily Trust column, and appealing for the same thing that Dr Sabeh is now calling for; human face.
I quoted timeless Chinese wisdom by reminding you If your vision is one year, cultivate flowers.
If it is 10, cultivate trees.
But if it is eternity, cultivate humans.
The idea then was that you should go easy on you hard rhetoric that anyone earning less than N50,000 should return to their village, because Abuja is not for the poor.
You said this on national TV and it was most unfortunate and unfeeling.
It was perhaps the most bourgeoisie thing ever said by someone in office.
If anybody was to lay claim to Abuja as their inheritance, it should have been those Gwaris displaced from their ancestral land, many times without compensation.
At what point did Abuja become a playground/inheritance for the nouveau riche?
While we watched on TV in 2006, whole families displaced in the thick of the rainy season, with their mattresses on their heads and their little toddlers in their hands, we heard of stories of people who committed suicide because both their homes and their businesses were demolished same day.
I learnt from one lady, who acted as secretary to some of your meetings back then, how much you took delight in displacing those poor folks and that in one instance, the appeals from Drs Oby Ezekwesili and Okonjo-Iweala could not dissuade you and you were jokingly called a sadist even as you departed the meeting to go and have another demolition.
It sounded much like those folks in the south of the USA who used to take delight in hanging themselves another negro.
Kaduna not only has a bloated civil service (as is), but also a problem with indiscriminate building of all sorts of structures where they shouldnt be “ like everywhere else in Nigeria.
Abuja claims to have a master plan which no one is supposed to see, thus making it a political plan not a geographical one.
Kaduna is NOT Abuja, and the people there may not have the mettle to withstand Hurricane Nasir, as we did here in Abuja up till 2007 under your iron grip.
You know you can easily get crazy once turned on.
You confess to this yourself.
You dont care whose ox is gored and this can be a good attribute to turn around a country such as ours, but it could also be deadly to a great many poor folks, especially in a Kaduna which is basically an agrarian and civil service state.
Is there any compensation for example, for those whose houses and shops you will demolish?
Is anyone listening to their stories of how they came about the land or spaces or have they been told to go to hell and back?
Is it true that we should strive to achieve a glistening city in order to achieve accolades from far and near, not minding the human costs?
Should governance be calibrated solely to appeal to the whims and fancies of the monied class?
Look at Banana Island and Turnbull Street in Ikoyi.
The other day, the well-fed owners of properties there pushed a video wherein they filmed how their pristine space has been encroached by poor invaders.
They almost labeled the poor people as vermin.
The problem is not the invaders but a lack of integrated, inclusive planning.
As educated as we claim to be, we choose not to learn the nuanced lessons from the places we visit abroad.
How can anyone think that the model of Banana Island will work forever when there is no provision for how the servants, drivers, gardeners and other dregs of the earth who serve these Lords of the Manor will get around; how they will eat their lunch, how they will survive and sleep close to where they are supposed to resume at 4am every day?
Style and tech in 2021 Nissan Ariya
More auto firms are investing heavily in electric vehicle production described as the future of automobiles.
One of the recently revealed EV offerings is the Nissan Ariya.
This is a high-tech electric SUV with a 310-mile range.
It comes with styling thats not changed dramatically from the 2019s
concept car of the same name.
Nissan joined the SUVs market segment in 2016 with the launch of the Qashqai.
The company however in its latest statement, said the Ariya is the ultimate expression of style and technology.
Power and Range
Power comes from two electric motors, but their output, range and how many wheels they drive depends on which model you choose.
Even the entry-level two-wheel drive 63 kilowatts hour (kWh) model can take you 223 miles between charges and punts out 215bhp, though.
Theres an 87kWh version of the Ariya above that, with range increased to 310 miles and power boosted to 239bhp, and then versions of both cars with Nissans new e-4orce four-wheel drive system (and lower ranges consequently) too.
Then at the very top of the range sits the Ariya e-4orce 87kWh Performance, which offers up to 389bhp and a range of 248 miles.
In terms of charging, lower-powered versions of the Ariya include a 7.4kW charging cable, while the more powerful versions come with a 22kW three-phase charger.
The Ariya can also support charging up to 130kW.
The Ariya comes with a V-Motion grille which features a 3D pattern with the brands new logo that lightens up thanks to 20 LEDs.
For even more style, Nissan is offering six two-tone paint and four full-body colour combinations, among them the signature Copper paint.
A black roof is included with two-tone paint.
A set of sporty 19-inch aluminium wheels come standard and the 20-inches are optional.
Space and Price
Two-wheel drive versions of the Ariya have 466 litres of space available in their boots enabling the user to pack more holiday luggage but the four-wheel drive versions of the Ariya have less space.
Within the interior, there are two large 12.3-inch displays for the infotainment screen and drivers instrument gauge cluster.
It comes with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Amazon Alexa.
The slim profile Zero Gravity seats help provide additional legroom for both front- and rear-seat passengers.
The Ariyas EV platform made it easy for engineers to free up cabin space in unique ways, such as mounting the climate control system under the hood where a combustion engine would have been.
A transmission tunnel also isnt necessary with EVs and the Ariyas flat floor generates even more passenger and cargo space.
Verily its time to ask for help
In view of their accomplishments over the years, many readers would hardly come to terms with what had befallen the military in the last many years, particularly as it affects the fight against the Boko Haram insurgents, bandits and the insolent kidnappers.
Our military have had a distinguished record in the field starting in regional and international peace keeping.
At independence in 1960 when we joined the United Nations, we immediately started to contribute our armed forces personnel to peace keeping efforts.
Our troops were said to have acquitted themselves creditably in Congo 1960-64, Tanzania 1960-62 and Pakistan 1965-66.
By the time our civil war broke out in 1967 our troops have already had some fighting experience which probably came to help to crush a well-armed and determined secessionist movement in a mere 30 months.
Thereafter, this prowess of our troops made them very much sought-after by the United Nations whenever and wherever there was a conflict, to contribute to a peace keeping force and or international military observatories.
Our troops served everywhere.
In 1978 we were in Lebanon as part of UNFIL, Chad in 1981, along Iran-Iraq border UNIMOG in 1988, Kuwait UNICOM in 1991, Angola 91, Namibia 89, Cambodia 92, Yugoslavia 92, etc.
Of course nearer home in Sierra Leonne and Liberia, our troops and the resources Nigeria committed made the difference in those countries from falling apart or remaining intact.
In 2007 this country was in such a confident position in the ability of our Army as a can-do force that it voiced opposition to AFRICOM, a combatant command that USA created as an outfit to watch over Al Qaeda and other terrorists operations in Africa.
The USA had to back down from establishing the command post on an African soil, because Nigeria, South Africa and Libya voiced their loud opposition to the plan.
In fact, Nigeria was so belligerent in its opposition that the government spokesman said that we did not only reject AFRICOM on Nigerias soil but also would not want to see it in any African country.
The rejection was loud and clear and the US had to accede to let AFRICOM berth in Stuttgart, Germany where it had maintained other combatant commands, since the close of World War 2.
But honestly we must admit that things have turned awry for our armed forces in the last 10 or so years.
The fight against the Boko Haram armed insurgents has run into a quagmire.
Not only that but other forms of insurgencies have cropped up in the form of a wholesale flourishing kidnapping industry and other forms of banditry.
Nobody has been able to accurately pinpoint why the fight against the Boko Haram insurgents, whom many considered as a ragtag assemblage, has confounded our armed forces.
We thought our forces lacked material and the whole nation rose in unison to support the President when he wanted billions direct from the Federation Account to buy arms.
The money was drawn, spent and probably arms were bought but conditions merely deteriorated with the insurgency now precariously spreading across the nation.
That much was said by Governor Sani Bello when he warned that the Boko Haram fighters have raised their infamous flags in his domain and are within walking distance of Abuja the federal capital.
Mohammed Ali Ndume, the Senator representing Borno South has been everywhere in the media lately decrying the deficits in the war effort.
Senator Ndume should know, because he is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Army.
Vibrant and passionate, Ndume has never been short of words advancing the cause of his constituency that is presently besieged by Boko Haram insurgents.
He had put it plainly across that the entire armed forces lack the material to accomplish the myriad of assignments before them.
On top of that they lack the numbers required.
That would probably explain why despite their pedigree our armed forces are bogged down by a number of ragtag brigands.
To worsen matters, the casualties are rising by the day.
The gory statistics given a few days ago by Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna State Commissioner of Internal Affairs and Internal Security, are frightening enough.
He reported that in only three months between January and March 2021, bandits terrorising Kaduna State have killed 323 and abducted 949 citizens.
I guess similar figures might show up from neighbouring Katsina, Niger and Zamfara States if they kept statistics.
It is time for a change of heart to probably do what would have been unthinkable some years ago.
I am glad that the President has lately been won over to this argument.
This became evident when at a televised virtual meeting with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken he specifically asked the US to reconsider relocating the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart to Africa so as to bring it nearer to the theatre of operations and help to strengthen the ongoing efforts to check the security situation.
I watched the exchanges closely and clearly saw the President grimace when he came to the point in his speech where he asked the US to move AFRICOM to Africa.
It is the kind of surrender only Generals understand, as a painful duty to save a territory, fighting men and material.
42nd Kaduna fair: KADCCIMA strategises to develop economy
The Kaduna Chamber of Commerce Industry Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA) Monday organised a seminar to discuss strategies that will aid in the development of the nations economy through domestic production.
Speaking at the seminar on Monday as part of actives lined up for the ongoing 42nd Kaduna International Trade Fair with them, Promoting Domestics Production to Mitigate the Current Economic Challenges, the chairman of the occasion and the Managing Director of the Bank of Industry Lagos branch, Dr Aliyu Dikko, said there is no white-collar job anymore.
He, therefore, urged Nigerians especially the youth to embrace entrepreneurship as there are many opportunities in the private sector.
The Guest Speaker and Executive Chairman, Adhama Textiles and Garment Industries, Kano, Alhaji Saidu Dattijo Adhama assured that there are a lot of jobs in the private sector that will make one earn money.
Alhaji Adhama pointed that textile industries have faced major setbacks due to many challenges such as lack of electricity and advocated that Nigeria needs modern restructuring such as super restructuring to address the lingering challenges.
He there urged the government and the private sectors to look back and figure out where the problem emerged from so as to treat the problems and find a lasting solution.
The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai who was reported led by the Permanent Secretary, Kaduna State Ministry of Business, Innovation and Technology, Dr Haliru Musa Soba said the theme of the 42nd Trade Fair was apt as many businesses are still trying to survive from the setback poised from COVID-19 pandemic.
He said the ministry has established business clinics so as to attend to businesses by regularising businesses.
Akwa Utd reclaim top spot despite barren draw with Rangers
Akwa United yesterday played out a goalless with Enugu Rangers in Uyo in the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL week 22 fixture but reclaimed the top spot with superior goal difference.
On Sunday, Kano Pillars who were forced to 1-1 draw at Katsina United moved to the top of the table with 41 points while Akwa United who were yet to play Rangers came down to second position with 40 points.
Therefore, the draw in yesterdays ill-tempered tie with Rangers returned the Promise keepers to the top of the table with 41 points as Pillars who have inferior goal diference of plus 8 dropped to second position.
Going by the recent performance of Rangers which saw them suffer a 0-1 loss at home against Rivers United last Sunday, Akwa United were favoured to win the maximum points.
After a fruitless first half, Akwa United made triple substitutions in the 65th minute taking off Mfon Udoh, Ubong Friday and Ikechukwu Nwani for Nasiru Jibril, Wisdom Fernando and Ibrahim Abubakar Aliyu.
The introduction of the trio proved impactful as Akwa United turned the heat on Rangers defence as substitute Aliyu forced a save off Mutawakilu Seidu in the 66th minute.
Rangers also had their chance in the 80th minute when they were awarded a free kick at the arc after Dare Ojo fouled Ibrahim Olawoyin but Kelvin Itoya fired it straight at Akwa Uniteds wall.
The visitors then ended the match with 10-men following the marching order to their Ivorian import, Issif Traore who fouled Charles Atshimene at the edge of the box.
The resultant free kick in added time was wasted by Olisa Ndah who shot wide from close range.
As access to fertiliser dims Farmers devise means of generating manure from neem
As the hope of getting governments subsidised fertiliser this farming season dims further, some farmers in Jigawa State have adopted the technique of turning neem leaves into fertiliser.
The farmers, especially those in Maigatari Local Government Area, said they decided to shift attention towards using local methods of enriching their soils for better productivity as a result of the spike in the price of inorganic fertilisers.
NPK fertiliser now costs over N12,000 per 50kg bag in the open market, and the usually subsidised ones by the federal government which usually sold for N5,500 may not be feasible this year.
The Minister of Agriculture, Mohammed Sabo Nanono, had said that the federal government would, from this year, hands off buying and selling of fertiliser but would play a supervisory role.
Many stakeholders have interpreted the minister stand to mean government withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, thereby leaving farmers with no option than to buy from the open market.
With the onset of the rainy season in many parts of the country, farmers are now forced to source for manure by any means.
This seems to be the major reason for the new innovation among the Jigawa farmers.
How farmers use neem leaves for manure
Neem leaves that fall from the tree are heaped by the farmers and put in gutters and drains and left to decompose.
One of the farmers said the decomposed leaves are brought out for drying before they are finally taken to the farm.
Scores of farmers in the town agreed that although the practice caused blockage of their drains, it had appreciable impacts on their soil.
Mallam Imrana Adamu, a farmer in Maigatari, said he had been into the practice for some time now and was satisfied with the way the compost was helping him maintain the fertility of his soil.
But unlike some farmers in the town who use drains in carrying out the process, Mallam Imrana said he used his premises in composting the organic fertiliser.
He said, I mix the dried neem leaves with ash, sprinkle water on the mixture and allow the process to take its course.
I can assure you that this is very effective in enriching the soil.
I have practised it and seen positive result; I am still practising it.
On the efficacy and effectiveness of this practice, Dr Yunusa Muhammad Shuaibu, a lecturer with the Department of Crop Production, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi, said the practice was a form of composting that sped up mineralisation and consequently enriched the soil by supplying nutrients such as phosphorus and calcium to it.
Rilwan, a corps member, contributed this piece from Jigawa State.

Understanding Nigerias democracy, dictatorship and spirit of nationalism in Chad
Khalid Yusuf Tebo
The operation of political parties in democracy is systematic, flexible and elastic when compared with political parties outside democracy.
However, political parties in democratic states are distinctive with those in non-democratic states, especially by their mode of operations.
Sometimes, they share partial similarities and roles.
Yet, the roles of those in democracy are not distinguishable from advocating transparency, accountability, integrity and quality of choosing representatives in favour of national interest.
Nevertheless, in Nigeria, Buhari is the president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
He had to go through a rigorous democratic political partys process before he would emerge victorious in pre-primary, primary and post primary elections.
As a member of a political party, he is like any other member and possesses no legal proceedings to influence the serving governor, serving senator and member house of reps under the impression of the same political party in democracy as far as good governance is the matter of the day.
This has to do with a partys political exercise in ruling over the affairs of its members when the need arises.
Contrastingly, Buharis participation in decision making is minimal compared to the late DÃ©by of Chad because of their political system differences and leadership modus operandi.
Buhari is less sensitive in governance, less powerful over some national affairs and less effective legislatively.
Not like DÃ©by who was more sensitive, very powerful and strong because of his non-democratic identity and political ideology.
Moreover, the edge of governance in Chad is said to have self-centered features without collective effort made by the people who are being ruled.
In fact, the system accommodates a larger portion of corruption and manipulation of single interest, meanwhile silencing the voices of its members during political discourse, public opinions and decision making.
For the sake of democracy and a sense of nationalism in Nigeria, no one can or will personally decide to do anything between executive, legislature and judiciary
no matter how patriotic someone is.
One must act according to the constitutional guidelines as well as passing his ideas to the three tiers of government for critique, suggestions and support.
For instance, If Buhari is eager to die in the battlefield; he must first identify the legality of sacrificing his life constitutionally as a president of Nigeria who wants to fight Boko Haram in favour of national interest.
He must understand his eligibility politically and democratically before he pays the price.
Anyway, Nigeria is not like Chad; here, we operate democracy not militarism and dictatorship.
In Chad, DÃ©by adopted a political party in a unitary system of government that is linked to dictatorship.
By the way, the system he enjoyed deliberately lacked check and balanceif compared with the bicameral legislature.
If you may recall, the DÃ©bys political party is Patriotic Salvation Movement; the party is built on a spirit of nationalism and the aim is to produce patriotic mindsets with sophisticated ideology and spiritual high sense of nationalism.
Astonishingly!
DÃ©by remained one; and he answered the clarion call of his party, MPS.
A true nationalist indeed!

Why we must address food price instability “ CBN
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has warned that its economic and financial policies would amount to nothing if the issues around food prices volatility could not be addressed as a nation.
The governor of the apex bank, Mr Godwin Emefiele, made this remark in a message to the input distribution flag-off and loan recovery drive under the RIFAN-CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP).
Emefiele, whose message was delivered by Mr Edward Adamu, CBNs Deputy Governor, Corporate Services, noted that With a population of about 200 million people, importation of any major food item will continually drain the countrys external reserves, export our jobs to countries where those food items are produced and distort our commodity value chains as we will not be able to guarantee the supply of raw materials for the agro-allied companies.
The CBN governor, who stressed the commitment of the present administration to attain self-sufficiency in rice production by the end of 2020 dry season, noted that the Anchor Borrowers Programme has proven to be a game-changer in the financing of smallholder farmers in Nigeria as it has revolutionised agricultural financing and remained the fulcrum of the countrys agricultural transformation initiatives.
He said the programme, beyond being a tool for economic empowerment, job creation and wealth redistribution, has also galvanised financial inclusion in rural communities.
On loan recovery, Emefiele said despite the devastation caused by numerous flood incidents in the 2018 wet season, farmers have been submitting produce and cash as part of their loan repayment but pleaded with the association to intensify efforts in that regard in the spirit of the partnership and sustainability of the programme.
The CBN governor said beyond rice, the Commodity Association Window has been expanded to cover more commodities like maize, cassava, sorghum, soybean, ginger etc and hoped that the efforts would contribute to the national aggregates and galvanise its drive to economic diversification.
We all can be forces for good in the space of gender equality
Femi Adeyomo
It is an undisputed fact that for the most part of history, women have not enjoyed equal rights.
Only several decades back, the general belief surrounding womens roles were restricted to duties at home, childbearing, and work in the kitchen.
This perception brought a tremendous amount of disregard and prejudice against women, not only at the family and community level, but glaring misrepresentations and stereotypical portrayals in mainstream media.
Above all, women were prohibited from important decision-making, leadership positions; access to higher education and professional aspiration.
Perhaps one of the most notable shifts in the movement for womens rights was the Womens Strike for Equality on August 26, 1970.
The strike took place in the United States to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the passing of the 19th Amendment, which effectively gave women in America the right to vote.
About 50,000 women gathered for the protest, and at that time, it was noted to be the largest gathering on behalf of women in history.
The strike had specific goals, including equal opportunity in the workforce and free child care.
Today, it is viewed as a movement responsible for political rights for women, social equality in relationships and income equality in the United States and all over the world.
In Nigeria, gender inequality has heavily pervaded society.
Women constitute about 49.33 per cent of the Nigerian population, approximately 99.13 million in total.
However, female participation in formal and informal structures, processes and key decision making remains insignificant.
This is largely because of discriminatory social norms, marginalization and economic disparity, which dictates the lives of women in Nigeria.
According to NOI Polls, which sought to identify socio-economic challenges faced by women, the results revealed that 42 per cent lacked financial empowerment, 35 per cent were poor, 33 per cent lacked access to quality education , 19 per cent had experienced domestic and sexual abuse, and 17 per cent faced gender discrimination in employment.
However, recent developments in Nigeria and across the globe, are proof that things are changing.
A few years ago, if you had told people that a woman would hold executive positions in organizations or political institutions, many would have shown disbelief.
On March 1, 2021, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian political figure and economist, became the first woman and first African to serve as the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, a landmark achievement for women and Africans all over the world.
This victory, and many others, have become a clear sign that female empowerment, equality, and leadership are necessary to foster positive change in society.
We need all hands on deck to close gender gaps.
We have made great progress on gender equality and we cant allow it to be eroded.
We need to act now to ensure that while we continue responding to the health and economic crisis, we find ways to progress womens economic empowerment and equality, in education, in the home and in the workplace.
At P&G, we will keep using the voice of our company in forums such as #WeSeeEqual to drive discussion and action on the issues that matter.
Those were the words of Adil Farhat, the Managing Director of Procter & Gamble Nigeria, during the company flagship gender equality summit, #WeSeeEqual Summit, in partnership with the UNWomen.
During the summit, Dr Zainab Bagudu, the First Lady of Kebbi State described the #WeSeeEqual Summit as an inspiring platform to motivate change in Nigeria towards gender inequality, stating the importance of collaboration between private and public institutions in the fight against gender inequality.
It is important for individuals and organizations to recognize that we can all be forces for good in the space of gender equality.
Our combined efforts as citizens, neighbours and humans will ensure that the opportunities and resources needed to secure and preserve gender equality.
We need new, radical collaborations that dont just focus on the financial sources, but bring together all partners at the start.
Looking at the 70s, 80s and even a large part of the 90s, it can be said that there is now a significant improvement in reducing gender inequalities in Nigeria, no denying that we are still well behind it.
When you look at the 17 action points of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is the most comprehensive global roadmap to shared human progress, it is impossible to overlook the centrality of its call for gender equality and reducing inequalities.
Indeed, it is improbable that the world could attain significant success in almost any action area of the SDGs “ from ensuring quality health care, education and sanitation for all to reducing poverty, ending hunger, providing productive employment or enabling strong institutions “ without achieving strongly in gender equality and reducing inequalities.
Private organisations must play their part in facilitating gender equality.
Also, there is the need for everyone to take up space and amplify gender equality, to secure a better future for all women.

EU leaders sign Brexit deal as UK MPs debate ratification
European Union leaders have signed have their post-Brexit trade deal with Britain and dispatched it to London on an RAF jet Wednesday, setting their seal on a drawn-out divorce just hours before the UK brings its half-century European experiment to an end.
EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the heads of the European Commission and European Council, smiled at a brief televised ceremony to put their names to the 1,246-page Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
It has been a long road.
Its time now to put Brexit behind us.
Our future is made in Europe,von der Leyen said.
Britain will leave the European single market and customs union at 11:00pm (2300 GMT) on Thursday, the end of a difficult year and of a post-Brexit transition period marked by intense and tortuous trade negotiations.
But first the hefty document, bound in blue leather, was flown by the Royal Air Force to London for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to add his signature, as the UK parliament began a rushed debate on the deal before the looming deadline.
Introducing the legislation to ratify it, Johnson told lawmakers it heralded a new relationship between Britain and the EU as sovereign equals, joined by friendship, commerce, history, interests and values.
With this bill we are going to be a friendly neighbour, the best friend and ally the EU could have,he said.
London and Brussels would work hand in glove whenever our values and interests coincide, while fulfilling the sovereign wish of the British people to live under their own sovereign laws made by their own sovereign parliament, he added.
Anxious wait
Michel echoed the sentiment in Brussels, vowing the two sides would work shoulder to shoulderon major issues, including climate change and future health pandemics.
Johnsons government only published the accompanying UK legislation on Tuesday afternoon, less than 24 hours before the debate began in parliament and an hour after the EU signing.
The government intends to ram all stages of the 85-page European Union (Future Relationship) Bill through the Commons and the House of Lords in one day, before Queen Elizabeth II formally signs it into law.
The last-ditch deal averted the prospect of a cliff-edge separation which would have seen quotas and tariffs slapped on all cross-Channel trade, exacerbating strains in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit Britain harder than most.
But British fishermen have accused the government of selling them out, while services ” accounting for 80 percent of the UK economy ” were largely omitted.
The City of London faces an anxious wait to learn on what basis it can continue dealing with Europe in the future.
Theresa May, whose three-year Brexit-dominated premiership ended in 2019 after she failed to win support for a closer future relationship with the bloc, voiced her unease at the agreement.
We have a deal in trade which benefits the EU, but not a deal in services which would have benefited the UK,she told MPs.
Thin deal
The legislation is set to pass, however, after an influential faction of arch-Brexiteers in Johnsons
ruling Conservatives gave their blessing to the EU agreement on Tuesday, and the main opposition Labour party signalled its reluctant backing.
Despite misgivings among some of his own MPs, who plan to abstain or vote against the agreement, Labour leader Keir Starmer said neutrality was not an option given the stakes for Britain.
This is a thin deal, its got many flaws, but a thin deal is better than no deal,Starmer told MPs.
Lawmakers from the pro-European Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party (SNP) said they would vote against it ” with the SNP using the issue to push for a fresh referendum on independence for Scotland.
The only way to regain the huge benefits of EU membership is to become an independent state at the heart of Europe once more,its leader in the UK parliament, Ian Blackford, said.
The agreements impact will play out in the coming months, with UK businesses braced for customs red tape they have avoided for decades in cross-Channel trade.
Meanwhile from January 1, there will no longer be free movement of people from Britain to the EU or vice versa.
Under the compressed legislative calendar, the European Parliament will debate the Brexit deal after the New Year, but they are expected to eventually nod it through.
Pending that, EU member states gave their green light on Monday for the accord to take provisional effect before Thursdays deadline.
FG launches new national policy on virtual meeting
The Federal Government on Monday formally launched the national policy on virtual engagements in public institutions.
It also commissioned an Emergency Communications Centre and four more digital economy centres across the country.
The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who launched the new policy and commissioned the projects virtually in Abuja, said the paradigm shift to virtual engagements in official circles globally, occasioned by the COVID 19 pandemic, necessitated the need for a policy to give legal impetus to the practice in public institutions.
The policy which was approved by the Federal Executive Council on the 14th of October, 2020 was developed in collaboration with the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Pantami said.
He said that the policy would institutionalise frameworks and standards within Ministries, Departments and Agencies of governments as well as
government -owned companies using virtual engagement as an administrative procedure in service and significantly reduce the cost of governance.
He said in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy, the facilities commissioned under the auspices of the National Information Technology Development Agency and the Nigerian Communications Commission would enhance security, create digital jobs, promote knowledge-based economic growth, increase productivity and enhance commercial and administrative methods.
He said all digital economy projects are carefully thought out and executed efficiently with a view to ensure the sustainable growth of Nigerias digital economy.
Activists fight dirty over mismanagement of millions meant for Odumakins burial
The controversy over the burial funds of late activist, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, deepened on Thursday as the memorial committee slammed members of the accountability committee over alleged mismanagement of N10 million raised for the burial.
The committee described the accountability committee members as self-seeking infiltrators masquerading as Civil Society Activists.
Daily Trust reports that a few days after the burial of Odumakin in Ife Moro, Osun State, some members of the burial committee questioned the management of the funds.
The burial took place on April 24.
They subsequently set up an accountability committee known as Odumakin Accountability Resolution Committee which indicted the Memorial Planning Committee (MPC) and asked it to refund N7.9m to Odumakin family.
But reacting to the accountability committee report, Comrade Awa Bamiji of the Civil Society and Pro-Democracy Movement Memorial Initiative, 2021, dismissed the allegations.
He warned members of the accountability committee to desist from their divisive reactionary orchestration of disaffection within the movement or be ready to face the wrath of the majority and genuine Leaders and Elders of the Civil Society Movement.
He described one Declan Ihekaire as one of the key actors behind the issue, alleging that Ihekaire specifically requested and collected N20,000 to fuel his personal car to and from Osun State.
Allegation of illegal disbursement of N5m
He also accused others of cornering and sharing N5m, saying this is part of the evidence already compiled with the help of their Legal Associates.
To this end, we have already instructed our legal advisers to approach the Law Court immediately to press charges of willful defamation, Obtaining by Force under duress and Physical Assault against them and their cohorts at large if they continue in their nefarious and malicious ways of unprovoked assault and smear campaign dubbed as resolutions of their dubious accountability gang.
As the conscience of the country, the leadership of the Civil Society and Pro “ Democracy Movement hereby vehemently condemns, disowns and distances itself from the divisive activities of these bunch of pretenders and Infiltrators who are of no significant reputation and scruples.
When contacted yesterday, Comrade Ihekaire said Awa Bamiji who signed the statement should be arrested.
He said he was brought into the committee as a sub-committee member
and he was never part of any meeting held by the Memorial Committee where issues of the disbursement of funds were raised.
Ihekaire noted that many people were shut out of the platform because the committee didnt want to give account of the funds received.
He said some of them opened Odumakin Real Accountability Platformand added Awa Bamiji and Comrade Wale Okunniyi
but they left.
But he stated that the committee did their work and found out they actually embezzled N7m plus.
They have gone begging people to give them soft landing and the committee members are saying, no, we are not backing down.
We are going to address a press conference on this.
He also said he was not moved by the threat of legal action against him even as he dismissed the allegation of cornering N5m.
He had threatened that earlier and now petitions have been written against them to the EFCC, Force CID and people have been begging on their behalf.
We have to call those that have been begging on their behalf that they have not shown any remorse.
I have just told you the truth and nothing but the truth.
We need to sanitize civil society.
They should just feel remorse and come out to say we are sorry.
It was even suggested that they should be ostracized from the activities of civil society,he said.
Attempt to implicate Odumakin family
The accountability committee later issued another statement, saying the claim made by Bamiji was an unsubstantiated story designed to implicate Odumakin family.
It insisted that the sum of N9.3m out of N9.9m raised by the committee was blown on burial jamboree.
On the N5m alleged to have been cornered, it said, The only place where the sum of N5m was mentioned is in the budget itself and was listed as donation by the Lagos State Government towards the burial of late Comrade Yinka Odumakin.
Other South West Governors of Ekiti and Osun States made donations of a staggering N1, 000,000.00k and N2.500.000.00k respectively for the same purpose.
Details of the income and expenditures analysis as submitted by Wale Okunniyi and Awa Bamiji, shall be affixed here under for our perusal.
Meanwhile, the total amount donated by three (3) South West Governors, (N8.5m naira only in total) was all listed as part of the total money lavishly wasted on frivolous expenses, multiple charges for same items, heavily padded relevant and irrelevant materials, overloading and highly overcharged provisions for non existing expenditures
That is, if there was any at all, the statement added.
UPDATED: Bayern win ninth Bundesliga title in a row
Bayern Munich have been confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the ninth straight season Saturday after England winger Jadon Sancho netted twice in Borussia Dortmunds 3-2 win over second-placed RB Leipzig.
The result in Dortmund meant Bayern become champions before their home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening.
England winger Jadon Sancho netted twice in Dortmunds home win which crowned Bayern as champions without kicking a ball before their home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach later on Saturday.
Before they even kick off, Bayern have an unassailable 71 points to Leipzigs 64.
I dont think anyone has ever become champions before while in the team bus on the way to the stadium!
Dortmund head coach Edin Terzic said in congratulating Bayern.
Julian Nagelsmann, the 33-year-old coach who will leave RB Leipzig to take over at Bayern next season, offered a terse congratulations on a deserved titleto his future employers.
The victory lifted Dortmund into the Champions League places, but Eintracht Frankfurt can knock them out of fourth place if they beat Mainz on Sunday.
Even without star striker Erling Braut Haaland, Dortmund were 2-0 up at the start of the second half thanks to goals from Marco Reus and Sancho.
Leipzig fought back with a Lukas Klostermann header before Dani Olmo equalised only for Sancho to grab the winner with superb footwork.
The clubs meet again on Thursday in the German Cup final at Berlins Olympic Stadium.
We showed a lot of morale, the game had absolutely nothing to do with the final in Berlin, but of course we want to win on Thursday too,said goal-scorer Reus.
Dortmund hope to have Haaland back from a thigh injury before the cup final and even with their top-scorer watching in the stands, the hosts still raced into the lead after only seven minutes.
Reus span out of Lukasz Piszczeks pass, sprinted behind the defence and took a beautiful back-heeled ball from Thorgan Hazard before sweeping his shot past Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.
Dortmund goalkeeper Marwin Hitz did not come out for the second half after being injured colliding with his centre-back Manuel Akanji just before the break and was replaced by Roman Buerki.
Dortmund doubled their lead just six minutes after the break with a superb piece of skill from Sancho, who cut back inside after a Raphael Guerreiro pass and fired his shot in off the far post with superb accuracy.
The visitors pulled a goal back on 63 minutes when Emil Forsberg floated in a corner and Lukas Klostermann steered his header past Buerki.
Leipzig drew level when South Korea striker Hwang Hee-chan broke clear of Dortmund defender Mats Hummels and squared for Olmo who tapped home from close range.
However, Sancho grabbed the winner when he flicked the ball to Guerreiro, took a return pass and tapped home to hand Bayern the title.
Ndidi, Iheanchos Leicester City win first FA Cup after Tielemans screamer
Youri Tielemans struck a sensational winner to clinch Leicester City their first FA Cup in a 1-0 victory over Chelsea on Sunday, in front of 21,000 fans at Wembley “ with Ben Chilwells 89th-minute effort ruled out by VAR for offside.
It was the biggest gathering of supporters inside a stadium since the coronavirus pandemic began “ and they were treated to incredible drama in the 140th FA Cup final.
Leicester fans had the perfect view as Tielemans fired a brilliant shot into the top corner of the goal at their end on 63 minutes.
It was a goal worthy of winning any final and capped a superb performance from the Belgian.
It had been a game of few clear chances up until that point but Kasper Schmeichel was then forced into two fantastic saves at the other end, pushing a Chilwell header onto the post and then pulling off another wonderful stop to deny Mason Mount, as Chelsea desperately searched for a response.
Former Leicester defender Chilwell thought hed done just that, when Caglar Soyuncus clearance went in off him, but VAR rightly spotted the Chelsea man had strayed marginally offside in the build-up.
Leicester, who lost key defender Jonny Evans to injury midway through the first half, held on and, 52 years after their last appearance in a FA Cup final, were able to hold the trophy aloft for the first time, adding another remarkable chapter to their story, following their 2015/16 Premier League triumph.
Pakistan blocks social media amid anti-France protests
Pakistan on Friday blocked social media platforms amid fears that activists of a radical Islamist group might use the technology to stoke violent protests against last years depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in France.
Followers of far-right Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a group that supports the countrys controversial blasphemy laws, have blocked roads and chocked streets at deadly protests that started on Monday.
The protesters were demanding that the government fulfill an earlier promise to expel the French ambassador by April 20, over the publication of a cartoon depicting the prophet last year.
At least five people including two police officers have been killed in the protests, which have prompted the France embassy in Islamabad to urge French nationals to leave Pakistan temporarily.
Social media has been blocked for a few hours so that troublemakers cannot use it during Friday prayers congregations,an official told dpa.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and TikTok are inaccessible across the country, including the capital Islamabad.
Political parties, Islamist groups and militant organisations like Pakistani Taliban heavily rely on social media platforms to connect with their followers.
How young farmer grew 350 chickens into N750m farm
Popularly called Farmer in Suit,his story tells how hard work, innovation, passion and determination can make one break away from the loop of poverty.
The story of Usman Ali Lawan, who also suffered from daunting challenges confronting most Nigerian youths, is an inspiration for others.
Last week, our reporter visited Lawans farm on the outskirts of Keffi, Nasarawa State, and his story explained his journey so far.
After his first degree in Business Administration from the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, and a stint in oil and gas, Lawan used his savings to go for a masters degree in Energy Studies in the United Kingdom (UK), with the hope that a job would be waiting for him whenever he returned home; but that did not happen.
I was broke, broken, homeless and indebted.
It was hard to look for a good job, so I started applying for every opening.
Within the first six months after my return from the UK, I applied for 500 jobs in Nigeria.
I asked people for help.
I was looking for any job,he said.
Within the period of joblessness, this grandson of a peasant farmer remembered that he could actually do something in agriculture.
That was when I started making efforts and preparing myself to become a farmer.
And I wanted to be a farmer that would be able to support other smallholder farmers to engage in sustainable and profitable farming.
That was what informed the establishment of my farm, USAIFA Agro-Allied Limited, which started operations on April 3, 2013, with 350 birds,he narrated.
Today, the farms capacity has grown from 350 birds to 28,000.
On fishery, it has the capacity for 100,000 of 1.5kg fish, 45 tonnes of processed fish and 200,000 fingerlings monthly.
Facilities for goat farming, heliciculture (snails) and cuniculture (rabbits) are under construction.
The farm has modern meat and fish processing facilities, with substantial structures for offices, feed mills, meeting rooms, cold room and a warehouse.
The farm has developed a circle where the waste product of one process serves as an input for another.
For instance, when the poultry and fish use feed, all the wastes from them are collected and used to make organic fertiliser.
By this, we ensure that every waste product on the farm is used as input for another process to create an ecosystem where waste is reduced to the barest minimum,Lawan explained.
Lawan also has another plan for the farm: We are now not only a commercial farm but also an agri-business institute so that other young farmers will be able to have access, not only to see how a farm works but also learn and be able to have the knowledge they need.
When asked the worth of the farm, he said, We did evaluation recently and the business as a whole is valued at a little over N700million.
The assets and the facilities are valued at N350m.
Of course when you put the goodwill, our experience, brand, all the validation, and of course, our turnover in the last seven or eight years, plus the projected turnover in the next five years, then the business is valued at N750m.
He further said, Money is important in business, but I never actually saw it as a key driver because I knew from the beginning that if I put that in mind I would not be able to go far.
That you think you need money to do everything
and you dont have
it is a spirit killer.
Entrepreneurship is a lonely journey, so you dont want anything that will discourage you.
You want to be able to keep moving.
So I thought my snag for problem-solving was the most important factor and hinged on that.
I tried to look at alternative means of getting money.
Although he did not get funding from any bank, he was able to use other means like bootstrapping.
He explained, Bootstrapping simply means using the resources you have to create something of value “ whether it is getting invoice sales from suppliers or advance payment from customers.
Those are some of the methods we use to be able to make sure our cash flow stays strong.
And we are able to grow the business, but most importantly, leverage on fellowships and grant opportunities.
In the next 10 years, Lawan wants to have a 10,000-hectare farm estate for growing maize, soybeans and groundnut, to prove to young people that they can actually make a living and decent income from farming.
You can wear a suit in a farm instead of the banking hall,he said.
Nigeria to partner Egypt for youth and sports development
The Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare has said Nigeria will partner with Egypt to explore areas of mutual benefits for youth and sports development.
The Minister who made this known yesterday on the sidelines of the
General Assembly of the Association of National Olympics Committee of Africa, ANOCA, in Cairo reiterated the fact that sports plays key role in international relations as well as unity and youth empowerment.
As two pacesetters on the continent, the youths of Nigeria and Egypt can get a lot of mileage, if we explore areas that are mutually beneficial to us.
This meeting is quite timely because it is coming at a time we are preparing for the Olympics,said Dare.
Responding, Egypts Minister of Youth and sports Development, Professor Ashraf Sobhy said at lot can be achieved, if youths are properly mobilised using sports.
The future lies in our Youths, so they must be properly trained to meet the challenges of a new world order,he said.
Dare also seized the opportunity to introduce the DEEL, which is a digital skills programme, assuring that the two countries could collaborate to benefit from the initiative.
Food security: Expert canvases urban farming
The country coordinator, Open Forum for National Biotechnology in Africa, Nigeria chapter, Dr Rose Gidado, has appealed to the federal government to promote urban agriculture to mitigate food scarcity.
Gidado, a deputy director, National Biotechnology Development Agency, Abuja, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos.
She said urban agriculture would address issues surrounding insecurity in many parts of the country.
Gidado said that hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics were all new urban agriculture techniques that should be promoted.
She said greenhouse farming technology should be promoted to boost food production and self-sufficiency.
According to her, hydroponics is a technology for growing plants in nutrient solutions that supply all nutrient elements needed for optimum plant growth.
It is done with or without the use of an insert medium, such as gravel, vermiculite, rock wool, peat moss, sawdust, coir dust and coconut fiber.
Aeroponics is an innovative technique of misting the roots, which are suspended in the air, with hydroponic solution.
Plants are supported by tailor made holes in Styrofoam panels.
Aquaponics means raising fish and plants in the same water source.
The fish actually provide the fertiliser for the plants and the plant roots filter the water for the fish.
Greenhouse is a type of farming in which crops are cultivated under protected and enclosed environment.
Its advantage is to keep out pests and diseases.
It also has a comparable yield advantage to open filed cultivation of crops.
Urban agriculture will enable people practise farming within their homes and environment, thereby increasing food production.
We have urban agriculture, and it should be promoted by the government.
Urban agriculture will mitigate against issues of herdsmen, Boko Haram, banditry and the likes.
All we need is to promote urban agriculture.
People need to be taught how to farm on top of their rooftops, in containers and polythene bags,she said.
Sallah: Edo traders make brisk business
Despite the economic downturn occasioned by COVID-19, traders at the Benin Eid praying ground along the Benin-Auchi Road made brisk business as Muslims celebrated Sallah.
The traders who sold caps, clothing, mats, beverages and other items said business was good and that they did not regret coming to the area to sell their items.
One of the traders, Muhammed Kabir, said he made good money within a short period.
Kabir, who sells prayer garments (jallabiya), said, Within a short period I sold 10 pieces of them.
This was what I usually battled to sell in a day.
Another trader, Abdullaihi Abubakar, who sells caps, said, If every other day were today, I would never complain of a bad market.
Today is an Eid day and people do come to the prayer ground without caps, so I seized the opportunity to make good business.
Before the commencement of the prayers, I sold 17 caps which ranged from N1,500 to N3,000.
According to him, he barely managed to sell 10 caps any other day, adding that he would have money to celebrate the Sallah.
On an ordinary day, I manage to sell 20 caps or so, he said.
On his part, Musa Koro who sells mats thanked Allah for the Eid el-Fitr, saying, I made good sales today.
Many worshippers didnt come to the prayer ground with mats, so they ended up buying from us.
I made a profit of over N5,000 within a short period.
Many other traders such as ice cream, sachet water and beverages sellers said the market was good and that they were smiling home.
They had also wished the Sallah would be every day for their businesses to thrive with such a high rate of turnover.
CBN tasked on funding road transport devt
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, have been tasked on creating a special intervention fund to develop road transportation infrastructure.
Speaking on Monday at the Nigeria Transportation Commissioners Forum and Federal Ministry of Transportation Annual Retreat 2021, the Minister of State, Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Saraki, said, We understand the difficulties involved in accessing funding, especially given the high-interest rate regime.
We are exploring with the CBN and the Ministry of Finance an intervention fund dedicated to the road transport sector similar to what obtains for Aviation and other sectors of the economy.
She also said the ministry with relevant stakeholders are working to have an environmentally sustainable transport sector.
She also said the ministry is aggressively promoting the use of technology within the road transport sector.
The minister also said the NITT this year embarked on a National Transport Databank project, which will be the beginning of developing our national intelligent transport infrastructure.
The acting Chairperson of Transportation Commissioners Forum, Rahmatu Mohammed Yaradua said the Forum was necessary due to the need to effectively implement various resolutions of the National Council on Transportation, coupled with the desire to coordinate activities of various groups of the Nigerian Transport Sector.
She also said there is a need to adopt technology in road transport operations to reduce accidents.
Why Nigeria must adopt proposed dairy policy “ Agric minister
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Muhammad Sabo Nanono, has said that high dependence on imported dairy products necessitated the urgent need for farmers to adopt the proposed diary policy when implemented.
During a stakeholders meeting organized by Sahel Consulting through the Advancing Local Dairy Development in Nigeria (ALDDN), Nanono noted that with 60 per cent of the dairy products consumed in the country imported, the proposed dairy policy would unlock the sectors potential and induce renewed interest in its development.
A statement by Sahel Consulting stated that the event, which was held late last month, was to ensure a wider stakeholder engagement in the Nigerian dairy sector to critically review and provide recommendations to the draft national dairy policy.
It stated that the ALDDN programme implemented by the group is utilizing a systematic approach to catalyze a vibrant local dairy sector by improving the productivity of local breeds while promoting local sourcing of milk.
Issues highlighted by Mrs Winnie Lai-Solarin, the Acting Director, Department of Animal Husbandry Services (DAHS), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development are the reflection of the strategic areas the ALDDN programme is working on to unlock the potentials in the dairy sector.
During the breakout sessions with various stakeholders, extensive discussions and recommendations were provided to improve the proposed dairy policy.
It was pointed out that commercial feed and fodder production in Nigeria is essential in intensifying and facilitating the development of the value chain through strengthening the demand and supply along the value chain.
The Sahel Consulting statement noted that the programme has engaged 140 commercial fodder producers to cultivate 400 hectares of land through farming of several kinds of cereal, grasses and legumes to produce silage and hay.
This policy, when implemented, will encourage farmers to adopt commercial production of fodder and market it at affordable price to smallholder dairy farmers for the improvement of animal health, productivity and household income.
This dairy production component of the policy also aligns with one of the targets of the ALDDN programme “ to increase the milk yield of at least 75,000 cows from 15,000 dairy households by at least 30 per cent through genetics and breeding improvement, increased access to animal health services and training of smallholder dairy farmers on improved dairy farming practices.
Turaren Wuta: A booming trade for the northern woman
The art of making incense, popularly known as Turaren Wuta, is no new tradition to those who come from the Northern region of Nigeria.
However, turaren wuta has now become a popular household item and is used by people of different tribes across the country.
In this report, Daily Trust Saturday x-rays how profitable the business of selling Turaren Wuta has become.
Although incense is mostly used for freshening homes and neutralising odours, it also serves other different purposes.
Some traditions believe that the smoke from the incense fortifies the home against evil spirits “ like the ones used in the Catholic church, while others believe its scents can be used to attract men or women.
Some women also believe that the consistent use of Dhukkhan (a particular type of incense) serves as an aphrodisiac and can help in sexual exploits.
The popularity of the use of incense has grown to the extent that is it not only appreciated by the northern tribe but by almost all tribes around the country.
Locally made incense or turaren wuta as it is popularly known in the northern region of Nigeria has become a very profitable business in Nigeria, especially for those in the northern region as some of the ingredients needed are naturally grown there.
Turaren wuta is used in aromatherapy and as fragrance for the home, body or clothes.
Aromatherapy is the use of holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being.
They are different types of turaren wuta available and they are made from a variety of different materials.
In Nigeria, the most common scents are sandal oud, grounded Kajiji, Hawee balls, sandal sticks, etc.
The grounded Kajiji is a plant that grows in Maiduguri, while Hawee sticks can be gotten from Kano.
Asides from smelling good, the business side of turaren wuta has been part of human existence for ages.
Fatima Kannike is an indigene of Maiduguri and specialises in the making of turaren wuta.
She tells Daily Trust Saturday how profitable the business is in Nigeria.
In Maiduguri, out of ten houses on the street, its most likely that 6 or 7 families are involved in the turaren wuta business,says Fatima.
When making her turaren wuta, Fatima mentions that some of her ingredients are locally sourced and some come from Senegal, India, Pakistan, etc.
She further explained that the most expensive turaren wuta are the ones which contain sandalwood and firche which is gotten from crocodile skin.
Oftentimes, people believe that Prophet Mohammed (SAW) stepped on the very ground where the sandal wood tree grows, therefore it is considered sacred by many,she said.
When making her turaren wuta, Fatima prefers using exquisite scented oils in order to make the scents from the turaren wuta last for a longer period of time, which could be between 6-8 hours and most of her oils are sourced from Dubai.
After mixing my turaren wuta, I like to seal it and leave it for weeks to allow the ingredients marinate and become more potent.
When asked what the process entails, Fatima narrates: Making turaren wuta is easy for me.
As far as all my ingredients are available, I can do it in the comfort of my home.
It involves making a sugar syrup and frying the incense woods before adding the oils needed for the fragrance.
However, Fatima mentions that when making turaren wuta, its often better to use firewood and the local frying pans in order to perfect the mixture.
She also advises to put on a face mask to avoid catching a cold and hand gloves to avoid your hands from being burnt.
When asked how she gets her customers, she explains that, often times, when burning her incense at home, her neighbours are always interested in knowing where she gets such incense that smells good, same thing also happens when she burns it at her shop.
Fatimas customer base is mostly women from the North as most times they believe that turaren wuta gives off the scent of a wealthy Arabian and also believe that it helps to attract men.
Where I come from, turaren wuta is considered an important gift on your wedding for the women, even more important than getting a fridge or TV,she said.
However, Fatima notes that in recent times, she has also received a lot of female customers from the eastern part of the country.
Although her customer base is mostly women, she also has male customers who buy the body oils and incense for their cars.
Turaren wuta (sandal oud, grounded kajiji and halut)
Fatima has turaren wuta of different price range and sizes, depending on the ingredients used.
Fatima also sells her turaren wuta in litres for those who may like to join the business and not want to go through the stress of making it themselves.
Depending on how big you want to start, getting into the business doesnt need that much capital.
For instance, with 100,000 naira you can get two to three varieties of turaren wuta in litres to resale, with another sum of 400,000
you can purchase three to five varieties of scents.
Asides the turaren
wuta, Fatima also makes humrah which is the body oil and can be used on clothes.
Often times, because of how good the smell is, customers are always indecisive about what scent they want.
When issues like that arise, we like to burn each scent and allow the customer to decide which scent they like the most,Fatima said.
She also advises her customers to use a charcoal burner instead of an electric burner because from experience, the electric burner wastes the turaren wuta and doesnt burn as effectively as the charcoal.
Fatimas most patronised scents are the sandal Oud, grounded kajiji and Halut.
She notes that these particular scents get sold out the minute her customers are aware of its availability.
Fatima also mentioned that her sales peak season is the rainy season, this is because the smoke that comes from the incense burner aides in keeping the house warm so customers are always willing to purchase more.
Mrs Amina Kogi, an ardent lover of turaren
wuta told Daily Trust Saturday that she spends at least N20,000 monthly purchasing different fragrance of turaren wuta for her house.
Whenever I wake up in the morning, I tell the maid to burn incense round the house and doing that makes the house smell good and homely.
Mrs Amina also told Daily Trust Saturday that most of her guests express delight over the pleasant scent in her home and insist on getting the contact of the person she purchased the incense from.
However, another turaren wuta seller Rahanatu Ahmad in Abuja told Daily Trust Saturday that she doesnt believe that turaren wuta has any spiritual benefits asides it
sweet scent and its potency in clearing or diffusing bad/offensive odour.
She noted that the business is more profitable when sold in larger quantities.
Her cheapest turaren wuta goes for N3500 and the most expensive N23,000.
The prices all depends on the size of jars.
She also produces Durot “ a special kind of turaren wuta that is sometimes considered medicinal.
She advises her female customers to purchase this particular turaren wuta to help fight minor infections and leave them feeling fresh and good.
She told our reporter that her most patronised scents are the Desired orbs and Thirteen scents.
Kano farmers trained on seed multiplication
The Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA), in collaboration with the Kano State Government and the Islamic Development Bank, has conducted a pre-dry season training of seed multiplication for farmers.
According to Sasakawas senior crop productivity enhancement officer, Mr Benjamin Adamu Shamaki, the training is aimed at ensuring a healthy circulation of improved seeds to the farmers.
He added that 20 seed multiplication farmers had been supported to breed improved rice and maize seeds.
He also said the project was targeting dry season farming activities in local governments that have access to irrigation facilities.
According to him, the project is for all the 44 local government areas of the state for an enhanced crop production, marketing and farm management techniques.
We have 20 farmers from 20 local government areas with irrigation facilities.
The project is aimed at all the 44 local governments in the state.
We hope to continue with the other local governments when the wet season begins, he said.
A beneficiary of the training from Warawa Local Government, Malam Rabiu Bello, said he had learnt a lot of new innovations he believed would change not only the way he farmed but the whole farmers of Warawa irrigation, especially those dealing in rice production.
LG polls: Our primaries successful despite violence, says Lagos APC
The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has said its primaries on Saturday ahead of the July local government elections, was successful.
It, however, called on the security agencies to probe incidents of violence in some local government areas and fish out the perpetrators.
Daily Trust reports that pockets of violence were recorded in some local government areas including Surulere where two people were feared dead.
The election could not hold in Surulere following the violence even as the local government area was allegedly under siege on Saturday as thugs and cultists loyal to some party leaders took control.
But the APC regretted the violence, calling on the security agencies to go after the perpetrators.
Spokesman of the partys Interim Committee, Hon Seye Oladejo, in a statement, congratulated the party members on the successful conduct of the primaries to elect candidates for the forthcoming Local Government elections to elect Chairmen, Vice-Chairmen and Councilors into the 20 Local Government Councils, 37 Local Council Development Areas and 377 wards.
Oladejo stated that the statewide exercise witnessed a large turnout of members who cast their votes for preferred aspirants through the open secret ballot mode as stipulated by the guidelines.
He said: We acknowledge with regrets the reported few cases of skirmishes in a few wards with the attendant fallouts.
We empathize with the victims of the unfortunate incident.
While we await the formal reports of the electoral officials, we wish to admonish the security agencies to conduct a thorough investigation to bring the culprits to book and maintain law and order.
The party reiterated that hoodlums, cultists and other outlaws were not members of the party.
The untoward intervention of external forces within the progressive fold should be resisted by all and sundry.
In the same vein, the party wants to enjoin aggrieved aspirants to approach the Electoral Appeal Committee headed by Mr Lawal Pedro (SAN) to lodge formal complaints,the statement added.
Police arrest 6 suspected IPOB members, recover arms in Ebonyi
The Police in Ebonyi have arrested six suspected members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and recovered five locally made pistols with 12 live ammunition from them.
Police spokesperson in the state, DSP Loveth Odah, said this in a statement on Tuesday.
Odah said the suspects were arrested during operations on Monday to disperse hoodlums enforcing the sit-at-home order by IPOB.
Odah also said the police neutralised three suspected armed robbers, recovered three expended cartridges, a jackknife, an axe, a cutlass and some charms from them.
She explained that following a distress call that some hoodlums had barricaded Ogbaga road, attacking and setting vehicles ablaze, operatives were swiftly deployed to the scene.
The hoodlums on sighting the police opened fire.
In the exchange of gun battle that ensued two members of the gang were fatally wounded while others escaped with bullet wounds into the nearby bush,said the statement.
Odah said one locally-made shotgun, one locally-made revolver pistol with five live cartridges, one jack knife, one axe and some charms were recovered from them.
A Toyota Picnic was set ablaze by the gang, including five motorcycles of different brands.
Innocent citizens were attacked because they refused to obey the sit-at-home directive of the IPOB.
The traumatised victims are currently responding to treatment at Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital,she said.
Odah explained that two of the IPOB suspects on surveillance mission were intercepted in front of the police headquarters in the state.
One locally-made double barrel short gun with four cartridges were recovered from them,Odah said.
She said one other suspect was killed after the police and sister security agencies engaged his gang in a gun duel on the Ikwo/Abakaliki expressway, Ikwo Local Government Area, while others escaped with bullet wounds.
Frantic effort is ongoing to arrest the fleeing suspects,Odah said.
Lewandowski scores 41st goal, breaks 49-year-old record
Robert Lewandowski, on Saturday, broke Gerd Muellera's 49-year-old record when he bagged a 41st Bundesliga goal of the campaign seconds before the final whistle on the last weekend of the season.
Mueller, 75, is suffering from severe dementia, but The Bomberâ remains an iconic figure in German football as the Bundesliga's all-time top scorer with 365 goals, well ahead of Lewandowski's tally of 277.
Many thought
Mueller's record of 40 goals for Bayern Munich in 1971/72 would never be matched until Lewandowski rounded the goalkeeper to score in the same club
Lewandowski broke the record on Saturday after equalling the record last weekend.
It was tense until the last second, I would have liked to have scored earlier,a relieved Lewandowski told Sky.
Sometimes you also have to stay patient, which was difficult.
I always believed that a chance would come.
That was a special and historic moment.
While Mueller scored his 40 goals over 34 league games in 1971/72, injury and squad rotation meant Lewandowski broke the record in just 29 matches.
Bayern scored 101 goals in the league in 1971/72 and 99 this season.
Physically, the 32-year-old Lewandowski is very different to Mueller, who was 26 in the 1971/72 season.
What is your name?
Robert is an athlete, Gerd was an artist, Mueller's wife Uschi Mueller told magazine Sport Bild.
At 1.84m and 79kgs, Lewandowski is a model athlete, renowned for his strict diet and training programme.
Mueller, at 1.76m and 80kgs in his prime, was nicknamedshort fat Mueller by former Bayern coach Zlatko Cajkovski.
The pair share an insatiable appetite for goals.
Lewandowski has hit the net on average every 60 minutes this season, while The Bomber scored every 77 minutes in 1971/72.
Lewandowski is a star player
Mueller was a copybook penalty box striker, who could transfer the ball from his right to left foot with bewildering speed.
His low centre of gravity helped Mueller steal an edge over defenders in the first few metres.
Given a sniff of goal, he was an ice-cool finisher.
Lewandowski is just as dynamic, but in contrast to Mueller, he is happy to shoot from outside the box or use the space to outsprint defenders.
They share the killer instinct when the ball is near goal, often being alert to a rebound and waiting until the last second to pounce, as Lewandowski demonstrated on Saturday.
How it started
Lewandowski started 2020/21 with a bang, converting a penalty and providing two assists in an 8-0 thrashing of the Schalke, a record result for the opening game of a Bundesliga season.
He failed to score in the next game, a shock 4-1 loss at Hoffenheim, but provided all four goals, including a late match-winning penalty in a nervy 4-3 home win over Hertha Berlin last October.
He was rested for one game in late October after scoring ten goals in his first five games, then hit a purple patch with 25 in 20 league games.
A knee injury playing for Poland in late March left Lewandowski on 35 goals after a hat-trick against Stuttgart.
After three weeks out, he returned with a goal in the shock loss at Mainz before hitting a hat-trick in the 6-0 home win over Moenchengladbach which won Bayern the title.
While Lewandowski has scored consistently, Mueller had sporadic purple patches, netting just three goals in the first nine games of the 1971/72 season.
However, he had scored 18 goals by the halfway point, including four in an 11-1 thrashing of Dortmund in November 1971.
He then hit five goals in a 7-0 thrashing of Oberhausen which sparked a run of 16 goals in just seven games, finishing the season with six goals in three games.
BPE, education ministry among 20 outstanding MDAs
The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Transportation are among the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) named as the 20 Most Outstanding MDAs in Nigeria this year.
This was disclosed by the CEO, Profiles & Biographies, Mr. Kammonke Abam, in a statement in Abuja, as an update on the firm's research and compilation of the accomplishments of MDAs to mark the sixth anniversary of the current administration.
He said the assessment result is relative to the MDAs fulfilling their ministerial mandate in line with the administration's 9-point development agenda, and his firm's evaluation benchmark.
Abam said the firm adopted an evaluation benchmark based on five criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability in assessing all the MDAs in line with best practice.
Preparing for Ramadan requires us to know when to watch out for the crescent of the Islamic lunar month of Ramadan.
With only few days to the commencement of Ramadan fast for the Islamic lunar year of 1442AH, it is no longer news that the holy month is by the corner.
It is in this sacred month that the holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (Salla-llahu Alayhi Wa Sallam, SAW) for the guidance of humanity.
Within the month of Ramadan is a night that is better than a thousand other months.
Because Ramadan is a unique spiritual season, it is important to effectively prepare ourselves for it so that every opportunity availed by Ramadan is optimally utilized; without taking anything for granted.
Ramadan is a month that Muslims happily look up to.
It is a month like no other.
It is a holy month in which Allah (SWT) has promised to forgive every repentant Muslim; grant mercy to every seeker of clemency; and pardon those who ask to be pardoned.
Going by the current count of the month of Shaban on the Timing Chapter calendar, the search for the crescent is expected to begin on Monday April 12, 2021 which is equivalent to 29th day of Shaban.
Abu Hurayrah (RA) reports from the Prophet (SAW) that the gates to hell fire shall remain closed throughout each Ramadan period just as the gates to paradise are left open during the same period so that the wish and prayer of those who desire the latter (paradise) would graciously be granted.
Where the crescent of Ramadan is not sighted on the 29th day of Shaaban, the month would be deemed to have naturally completed its circle on the 30th day in which case Ramadan fast automatically begins the following day, which would be the 1st day of Ramadan.
We are not required to begin the Ramadan fast until we have heard of the sighting of the crescent of Ramadan from credible sources.
In our case in Nigeria, the tradition is for Muslims to wait for the announcement of the sighting of the crescent from His Eminence the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Saad Abubakar.
Allah (SWT) states in Quran 4:59
O ye who believe!
Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you
The more we remain steadfast and patient to wait for and obey Sultan's words, the more united and stronger we remain as a Muslim community.
We advise members of the Muslim community to be wary of unsubstantiated pieces of information that may emerge from social media sources on the commencement of Ramadan.
We also urge the general public to abstain from circulating unconfirmed news about moon sighting.
Misleading information can throw Muslim communities into confusion.
Remember that Allah's wrath awaits rumour mongers.
The teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) discourage the observance of voluntary fast close to the start of Ramadan fast.
This is to avoid a situation where voluntary fast, which is a prophetic injunction, is seen to be part of Ramadan fast; the latter being an obligatory act of worship sanctioned by Allah (SWT).
For those who are used to observing voluntary fast every Monday, they are advised to skip Monday next week because of its proximity to Ramadan; being 29th day of Shaaban.
As part of deliberate preparations for Ramadan and in order to take utmost advantage of the spiritual benefits of Ramadan, it is vital for us to review our daily routines so as to create enough time for engaging in devoutional activities.
This will enable us have more time to recite the Glorious Quran (in the case of those who never had it as a routine) or more time for reciting and understanding the Quran.
Let us also decide on the time for observing Tarawih prayers in consultations with individuals that traditionally make up the prayer congregation at the family level or conventionally at a public mosque.
Let us also define the kind of tasks we engage in during the daytime of the entire period of Ramadan so that we do not miss out from observing Tarawih prayers after breaking the fast or Tahajjud prayers after midnight.
In order to preserve the sanctity of our Ramadan fast, there's need to review our usual interactions with ICT platforms especially the social media.
The Government has banned Twitter
It is important to identify and avoid specific websites, television channels and radio programmes that would impact negatively on our Ramadan fast.
We should be prepared to also avoid certain conversations in our respective places of work to prevent us from expressing or hearing obscene phrases.
Muslim scholars, preachers, prayer leaders, presenters and anchors of radio and television programmes are urged to eschew the use of provocative and discourteous expressions during preaching sessions.
They are expected to exhibit a good sense of maturity in the course of educating their audience on the teachings of Islam.
Wisdom and good speech, not name-calling or insults, are central to effective and popular religious proselytization.
With the country still struggling to overcome several challenges, it is wise for Muslim clerics to abstain from sandwiching their religious preaching with political and ethnic sentiments.
We advise dealers and retailers of consumer goods against taking undue advantage of the Ramadan season to increase prices of essential commodities.
It is wicked for any trader to see Ramadan as an opportunity to hike prices of foodstuffs for the simple reason of the high demand for certain commodities especially sugar and fruits during Ramadan.
Let us be God-fearing in all that we do and say to earn a living.
Philanthropic individuals, groups, and NGOs are encouraged to organize or support public breaking of Ramadan fast , at least for less-privileged Muslims.
It is time in Ramadan for every Muslim to extend hand of friendship, charity, and kindness to fellow Muslims.
May Allah (SWT) guide us to begin and end the Ramadan fast in peace and with ease; amin.
Afenifere, Ohaneze seek emergency national confab
The leadership of some major socio-cultural groups from the Southern and Middle Belt part of the country on Monday adopted a common position and called for an emergency national conference that would lead to the emergence of a new constitution and restructuring of Nigeria.
The groups, comprising the Afenifere, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt and the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) made the call in Abuja at a dialogue session titled The Nigeria's 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue.
According to them, it is possible to reverse the current challenges facing and prevent Nigeria from breaking into pieces if the federal government listens and implements the recommendations they are putting forward.
He said going forward, Nigerians should be allowed to exercise their mandate and sovereignty on how they want to live together under mutually beneficial terms.
He said the problems being witnessed in the country started when the military took over power in 1966 and removed the federal constitution that would have guided the country to a viable economic and political entity.
Also speaking, the leader of the Northern Consensus Initiative, Dr Awal Abdullahi, said: The North before now was saying we don't believe in separation
but as I'm standing, I'm telling you that if there's going to be separation tomorrow, the North is ready for it, we're also ready, let's go our different ways
and I'm telling you this with all sincerity.
Northern Nigeria before now did not want to hear anything separation, but as at today, as I speak to you, the North is equally ready.
What I'm saying might be controversial, but I'm speaking the mind of northerners
and I have no apology to anyone in this hall.
Reacting, the president of the Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus, said the Middle Belt would not pull out of the country with the core north.
He said: So if my brother says the north is going, be sure the middle-belt is not going with you, you're on your own.
We've served and sacrificed for this country.
The war that occurred, the middle-belt was used to fight while the North sat back to enjoy.
Also speaking, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, Umar Ghali Naabah observed that the leadership of the country was not serving the people properly.
We have weak and irresponsible leadership in the country.
We need to talk as one Nigeria and not people from the North or from the South, Naabah, who is also the chairman of the National Consultative Forum(NCF) said.
Smoking kills 29,472 Nigerians annually FG
The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire on Monday said a research finding published in 2021 by the Centre for the Study of the Economies of Africa showed that 29,472 deaths in Nigeria were attributable to smoking.
He said this in Abuja while quoting the 2018 Tobacco Atlas report, during the commemoration of the World No Tobacco Day.
He said the theme for this year's World No Tobacco Day, Commit to Quit came at a good time when the global community was battling the COVID-19 pandemic.
This is especially so, as evidence has shown that tobacco users and those with underlying non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are at higher risk of severe Covid-19 outcomes.
Assisting people to quit tobacco use will therefore improve COVID-19 treatment outcomes,he said.
According to him, Nigeria records over 16, 100 deaths from tobacco-related diseases every year.
He said tobacco use or exposure to second-hand smoke is the leading preventable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like hypertension, stroke, cancers, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
She called on the minster to identify a space within the ministry to set-up a call center office from which the counsellors will respond to caller needs.
France suspends use of AstraZeneca COVID Vaccine
President Emmanuel Macron of France has suspended the use of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the country, pending a review of its safety by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
The decision has been made to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a precaution, hoping that we can resume it quickly if the judgement of the EMA allows it, Macron told a press conference, adding that an announcement by the EMA was expected on Tuesday afternoon.
We have a simple guide, to be informed by science and the competent health authorities and to do it as part of a European strategy, he said.
He said the suspension will be effective until tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon when the EMA will make its position known.
Several European countries, including Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, suspended usage of the shot after reported blood clotting incidents.
At this stage, we must have confidence in this vaccine, Castex said on Sunday.
If not, we'll have delays with our vaccinations and French people will be less protected and the health crisis will last longer.
Macron also said the French government would have decisions to take in the next few days in order to control the spread of COVID-19 cases after an uptick in cases and a rise in hospitalisation.
We will probably have new decisions to take in the coming days, Macron said.
He said the government needed to look at the reality of the epidemic, town by town, region by region: it's what we are doing.
Hospitals in the Paris region are close to capacity, with patients being transferred out of the capital region to other parts of France, while other hotspots of infection are in the north around Calais and the Cote d'Azur.
Macron decided against a third national lockdown at the end of January, saying instead a policy of 6pm nation-wide curfew and a partial shutdown of bars, restaurants and other social and entertainment meeting places should continue.
Fiscal discipline, key to our success Okowa
Delta Governor, Sen. (Dr) Ifeanyi Okowa, said adherence to his fiscal discipline and superior planning accounted for the successes recorded by his administration in the last six years.
Okowa stated this in Asaba on Saturday.
He said that his administration's success during the period was borne out of greater coordination in administration and superior thought-process.
He recalled that prior to his administration, the state's budget hovered around N400 billion mark, with naira exchanging at N180 to a dollar as against current budget of the state being in the N300 billion mark, with exchange rate at N492 to a dollar.
Okowa said that following the devaluation of the naira over the years, there was less value the naira could impact on projects.
He said, In the past we had bigger budgets and greater value for money because the naira was relatively strong at N180 per dollar compared to now we are at N492 to a dollar with a budget of N300 billion per annum.
Unfortunately for us too, the recurrent budget in terms of salaries has also increased remarkably, which has also further deepened the negative effect of the recurrent budget which had made our capital portfolio smaller.
The fact that there have been devaluation of the naira made it have less value on projects and having realised this, we needed to plan critically.
The governor attributed early passage and implementation of the State's budget as part of the drivers for his administration's success story.
We also monitored the seasons and acted by the seasons and that helped us a lot.
We ensured that our budgets are passed on time and implemented on time.
Our budgets are signed by December so that we are able to use the window of January to mid May to do most of the construction jobs.
it means that you will contend with the rains to deliver projects, he said.
He added that the strategy has helped but it requires a lot of prudence, a lot of thinking and time to be able to get all these things done.
On the remaining two years in his tenure, Okowa assured Deltans of his continued drive to work till the last day to provide a stronger Delta .
Okowa also assured that his administration would continue to stay on course in areas of health, agriculture, and education.
Politics tends to be distractive and I know that, but I know that by God's grace, I have the capacity to manage the two.
Let the struggle continue even if they take my life, says Sowore
Omoyele Sowore, human rights activist, has asked his supporters to carry on withthe struggle even if he loses his life.
Reacting to the incident at Unity Fountain in Abuja on Monday morning, Sowore simply identified the officer who shot him as one ACP Etine.
Inibehe Effiong, one of Sowore's lawyers, had said that the officer fired a teargas cannister directly at the right thigh of the activist.
I watched Sowore being shot live on Facebook.
This is what Nigeria has been turned into under Buhari.
They've declared war on the Civic Space.
The FCT Police Commissioner has fenced the Unity Fountain with iron and cables to prevent protests.
This is a criminal offence under the Anti-Torture Act of 2017.
Sowore has reportedly been taken to the hospital.
NIHORT boss gives reasons for tomato seasonal glut
The Executive Director National Horticultural Research Institute, Dr Abayomi Olaniyan, has identified inadequate expertise in tomato processing as the main cause of the seasonal glut and inconsistent supply of the product in the country.
Olaniya spoke at the just concluded empowerment training for youths in the area of tomato and telfaria production.
He revealed that the country produces 2.3 million metric tonnes against 1.8 million tonnes produced two years ago while the national demand is 3 million.
Ossai, who was represented by Ambassador Chibuzor Okereke, urged the beneficiaries to take full advantage of the programme in expanding their existing skills in farming.
Earlier, Chairman, NIHORT Governing Board, Major General Mohammed A. Garba, had described agriculture as a tool for achieving sustainable economic development in Nigeria.
The three reasons Jose Mourinho was sacked
After checking this out thoroughly at Tottenham, I can tell you that is not true.
Mourinho did not take training because he was already aware that his days at Spurs had come to an end.
The training session carried on but he did not attend.
Chief Executive Daniel Levy arrived early and summoned Mourinho into his office situated at the training facility.
There he gave Mourinho the news that he was fired!
Managing Director Daniel Levy was unhappy with Mourinho criticising several of his players following their recent run of poor results.
The players were angry that Mourinho had not supported them and in the dressing room all was not well.
He was sacked at Chelsea, sacked at Manchester United and now sacked by Tottenham because he turned on his players and refused to take the blame personally for poor results.
Once again the point is proven that if the players are not happy the manager has to go.
The players were all sent a text informing them that Mourinho was no longer in charge.
Levy was also upset that Mourinho had spent seventeen months at White Hart Lane and not produced a team superior to that of Mauricio Pochettino.
Levy was upset that players of the quality of Gareth Bale and Dele Alli were left sitting on the bench despite others struggling to get results.
The biggest issue is that Mourinho has failed to deliver European Champions League football for next season.
Those are the three reasons Jose is heading back to Portugal with his family.
Premier League is over.
One thing to bring a smile to his face is that Spurs now have to hand over two years salary which represents the time left on his contract.
That is a cool 20million!
Lingard decides on his future
Despite approaches from Arsenal and Tottenham, Jesse Lingard has decided he wants to sign permanently for West Ham where he has scored a superb 13 goals in 10 matches since joining on loan from Manchester United.
At the Hammers, manager David Moyes has allowed Jesse a free role moving across the pitch as an attacking striker and midfielder.
He has responded with several man of the match performances.
United manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer has indicated that he would like Jesse back but cannot guarantee him a permanent first team place.
I have been told that United have set a fee of £21.5million.
West Ham have paid Â£3million in loan fees this season which means they will end up paying Â£24.5million which is considerably more than many media outlets have reported.
Cavani and Greenwood link up
Uruguan superstar Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood have formed an elite club despite a slight difficulty with the language barrier.
Together they have worked to improve
Mason and manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer says he is now a natural No.9 and the 19-year-old has developed bodily and mentally.
Solskjaer said this week,I can see that Edi really appreciates Masons talent, his hunger and willingness to learn.
And in Edinson Cavani he is learning from one of the very best.
I don't want to see Mason playing with his back to the goal.
Despite all these positive remarks I have learned that Solskjaer will still play Mason out wide for the foreseeable future and believes he will move inside during the next couple of years.
He added, Maybe in the future he can play as a central striker
but I still think thats a few years away.
Being a centre-forward in the Premier League is probably the hardest position to play.
I think Mason is more suited to playing that wide role.
Aguero tops lists of big clubs after Haaland with Sergio Aguero certain to leave Manchester City at the end of season
, several big clubs are lining up to sign him.
Chelsea are the latest to show interest and owner Roman Abramovich has told the Blues that he will endorse any approach by making the money available.
However, he desperately wants the Blues to sign Erling Haaland and he is making it a personal endeavour to sign the Norwegian.
At the same time, Italian giants Juventus have contacted Agueros agents to see if he is interested in linking up with Cristiano Ronaldo in Italy.
Barcelona are also keeping tabs on the Argentine and they are drawing up a mouth-watering contract which is performance based and includes huge win bonuses and appearance money.
Both Chelsea and Barca see Aguero as their fall-back position should either of them fail to sign Norwegian super striker Erling Haaland.
Wijnaldum wants to play alongside Memphis Depay
Liverpool's Gini Wijnaldums quest to play for Barcelona at the end of this season is in some doubt because cash is a problem at the Spanish club.
Manager Ronald Koeman is trying to sign Memphis Depay from French club Lyon and he and Gini have formed a strong partnership playing for Holland.
Ginis ambition is to link up with Depay at Barcelona and play alongside Lionel Messi.
Wijnaldum and Depay are both out of contract this summer and therefore can negotiate their wages directly with the club.
Ginis agent has already worked out a deal which suits both Barca and Gini.
Depays future is still not settled.
Liverpools Jurgen Klopp wants Gini to stay but will only offer a two-year contract whereas Barca have offered three.
How Guardiola taught Tuchel to beat him
When Chelsea beat Manchester City in the FA Cup last weekend most fans did not realise the tremendous influence that Pep Guardiola has been on Thomas Tuchel.
It mainly happened seven years ago in Munich when both managers were working in Germany, The two were having dinner one night and the talk turned to football.
Tactics were discussed and Pep cleared the table.
He then used the pepper and salt pots and other items from their meal to show positions on the field and the best way to use players.
Pep explained how he changed Barcelona, one of his previous clubs, when he bought Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal and then changed Lionel Messi and used him as a false number nine.
He showed Thomas how to create space on the field with a back three and back four.
Until last weekend the two had played each other five times and Pep never lost however last weekend
Kanes unenviable record
A sad fact but true
: Harry Kane has just broken Liverpools unenviable record, held by Robbie Fowler, of having scored the most Premier League goals without ever having won the trophy!
That is one reason Fowler and others have called for Harry to leave Spurs and seek success elsewhere before it is too late.
Judeâ€¦you are best
It is ironic how fast things move along in football.
Twelve months ago several clubs were watching and thinking about bidding for 17-year-old Jude Bellingham.
He was invited and accepted a tour of Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford and the new Carrington Training Centre.
In the end Jude signed for German club Dortmund because they promised him more first team appearances than United.
Bellingham dominated the midfield for Dortmund against Manchester City in the Champions League.
He played with confidence like a seasoned veteran.
He had done the same thing in Dortmunds previous European match against Spanish club Sevilla
so this was no flash in the pan.
Everyone tuned in to watch Erling Haaland but were left talking about Jude.
Our correspondents report that streets were completely deserted in all major cities as residents shelter at home.
IPOB through its spokesperson, , Emma Powerful hailed governors from the South-East in a press statement forsupporting the stay-at-home directive to commemorate the lives of those killed in the area during the Nigerian Civil War.
Daily Trust reports that tension had mounted in the five states of the South-East zone of the country ahead of the sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed self-deamination group, which took effect yesterday.
It is now two years since the commencement of the implementation of the Free, Compulsory Basic and Post Basic Education in Kano State introduced at the dawn of Governor Abdullahi Umar Gandujes second tenure in office.
The 2020 budget, which had to be revised to capture realities that cushion the disruptions caused by the adverse effect of COVID-19 pandemic, the Gandujes administration earmarked to the education sector 30 per cent of the total revised budget.
While in the year 2021, the sum of N37.8 billion representing 25 per cent of the total budget is allocated, less than 5 per cent of last year to education to sustain and improve on the success so far achieved in the implementation of the education policy in the state.
There is no gainsaying the fact that the implementation of free and compulsory basic and secondary education in the last two years for all children in the state has recorded huge success.
Though very expensive, considering the huge amount of money involved, Ganduje believes that there is no better time to lay a strong foundation for the future of Kano children.
This is a promise by the governor and has been fulfilled.
During the period under review, the state governments huge investments into the sector in the area of infrastructure, staff development and the provision of teaching
The state government has distributed instructional materials worth over N1.5 billion to primary and junior secondary schools in the 44 Local Government Areas of the state.
The administration has distributed, in the latest exercise, over N880million to Community Promotion Council (CPC) for renovation of primary schools in the 44 local governments of the state.
The governors commitment was renewed in series of similar exercise when on Tuesday, April 13, 2021, Governor Ganduje launched the disbursement of N148 million in grants to 1,400 public high schools across the state as part of the state Education Day activities.
The grant is also aimed at improving the states
Almajiri free education and integration policy.
In fact, since assumption of office in 2015, the Ganduje administration has never failed to provide its matching funding for the development of education, even as the state has already paid part of the 2021 funding.
The state government has also been strengthening other sources of funding for the policy that include resources from Education Trust Fund (ETF)
Today, in Kano, 98 percent of primary school teachers in the state are qualified.
The feat was achieved through sustainable training and re-training of primary school teachers by his administration.
So far, almost all primary school teachers have obtained the lowest teaching qualification, Nigerian Certificate of Education (NCE).
The free education policy has provided opportunities to all school-age children to gain access to quality education for a full cycle of basic education.
Indeed, the launching of free, compulsory basic and secondary education policy has made serious impact with the reduction of the data of out-of-school children in Kano.
Over 500,000 out-of-school children in the state are now back to school, as the states school enrolment level increases tremendously.
The state witnessed a drastic increase in school enrolment, following numerous intensive interventions in the education sector.

6 years after, Buhari still struggling to fulfill campaign promises
It is exactly six years that the Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration came on board after wresting power from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was on the saddle of power in the country for 16 years.
The feat was achieved because majority of Nigerians believed that a central government led by Buhari would fulfill all its campaign promises.
The incumbent president focused his 2015 election campaigns on three key matters affecting the country corruption, insecurity and the need to revive the economy.
Two of these three campaign promises were well captured among the eight cardinal programmes the APC manifesto pledged to offer Nigerians if voted into power in 2015.
The programmes include war against corruption, food security, accelerated power supply, integrated transport network, free education, devolution of power, accelerated economic growth and affordable health care.
Despite the fact that the three campaign promises deliberately chosen by Mr President have not been fully realized, against the high expectations of Nigerians, Buhari was re-elected for a second term of four years in 2019.
He defeated another PDP candidate and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar in a keenly contested election.
Buhari repeated these promises during the re-election campaign and sued for more understanding from Nigerians based on past mistakes and unforeseen circumstances that affected his first term of four years.
Analysts say the re-election was made possible because of support from his die-hard supporters who believe that he should be given more time, and the quest for power rotation to the southern part of the country.
But six years down the line, the three key electoral promises seem not to have been redeemed.
The Buhari government has underperformed Dr Kari
When contacted, a political analyst, Dr Abubakar Kari, while assessing the current government based on its main campaign promises, said the Buhari administration had underperformed in the three key areas of the economy, fight against corruption and tackling insecurity.
Dr Kari, who said President Buhari had performed below expectation these past six years, added that he hadnot delivered on his promises to the satisfaction of friends and foes alike in those areas he had personally chosen as his signature projects.

Motorists throng fuel stations in Kaduna as NUPENG joins warning strike
The country also got trapped in the cyclical global recession twice.
To cap it all, the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being felt.
But beyond that, the management of the economy has been less than convincing and has been characterised by policy inconsistencies and contradictions.
The consequence, simply put, is that on a scale, Nigerians are worse off today than they were six years ago.
The verdict is really out on what the true situation is in regard to fighting corruption.
In the area of insecurity, even Buharis most diehard supporters are aware that Nigeria is far less secure than in 2015.
The Boko Haram insurgency has become intractable even though bombs no longer go off outside the main theater of war
It is truly frightening and appalling and unbelievable that this could happen under Buhari!
, the director-general (DG) of the Voice of Nigeria (VON) and a chieftain of the ruling APC from Enugu State, Mr Osita Okechukwu, scored the Buhari administration above average.
Okechukwu said the administration had invested and committed more human and material resources in agriculture more than any other regime in the post 1970 Nigeria.
He said the process remained a precursor towards economic growth.
He, however, admitted that security was one of the downsides of the administration as President Buhari was equally disgusted over the general insecurity in the land.
Okechukwu said,In reference to President Buharis regime in the last six years, without being immodest, one scores him above average.
However, one must not shy away from some downsides.
Secondly, he has constructed more roads, railways and other physical infrastructure more than the 16 locust years of the PDP.
These, to me, are veritable foundation for diversification of our economy and signpost to revamping our economy.
The downside is palpable insecurity in the land.
Mr President, like most Nigerians, is disgusted over the general insecurity in our dear country.
We must accept some unforced errors of ours.
However, Mr President neither generated the sharp decline of oil prices
immediately he took office in 2015 nor the COVID-19, which dealt heavy blow to our mono-economy and worsened the security situation in Nigeria.
Dr A. Babalola, a senior lecturer and the head of the Department of Economics, Al-Hikmah University, Ilorin, said,Inflation is one of the KPI.
Every Nigerian does not need the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) or Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) data.
On security, Dr Babalola said,We do not need security threat index to tell us the level of insecurity in the country.
Before 2015, banditry and kidnapping were quite insignificant, but as at today, even the children at homes understand the words and the so-called ransom more than their study in school.
What has caused this?
It is because insecurity has become the talk of the country.
Summarily, the present administration has reduced corruption and improved the economy, but it is still not significant.
When it comes to insecurity, much needs to be done as it is really causing lots of rumple in Nigerias economy.
Motorists in Kaduna on Sunday thronged petrol stations to fuel their vehicles as the five-day warning strike directed by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Kaduna State begins.
The NLC had on May 10 said it would ground all activities in the state from May 16, as it begins a warning strike over the irregular sack of civil servants by the state government.
The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) also directed its members to shut down services in Kaduna State from May 16.
This development has forced motorists into panic buying of fuel in preparation for the five-day warning strike.
A correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) who monitored petrol stations in some parts of the metropolis reports the presence of long queues in most of the stations visited.
Residents were also seen with containers of different sizes at different petrol stations struggling to buy the product.
Some of the petrol stations visited were A. M. Yola Petrol Station, Katsina Road, Mobil Petrol Station, Waff Road, A. Y. M Ashafa Petrol Station, Ahmadu Bello Way, Edi- Jen Petrol Station, Ahmadu Bello Way, among others.
Mr James Audu, one of the motorists at A. M. Yola filling Station, Katsina Road, told NAN that he decided to fill his vehicle tank out of fear that filling stations may not operate from Monday.
You are aware that NLC is commencing a five-day warning strike in Kaduna state from Monday and you know how critical petrol is to our movement and survival.
I am here to fill my vehicle tank and a 25 litre container for my generator at home to ensure power supply during the strike days as electricity supply had already been suspended, he said.
Another motorists, Mr Ibrahim Rasheed, also said that the panic buying of the essential product was necessary to keep businesses going during the strike.
I am a fashion designer and need power to work.
already electricity supply has been suspended, meaning that people like us will have to resort to generator and that cannot happen without fuel, he said.
The Station Manager, Mr Rayyanu Ahmad, told NAN that they are selling the product because he was yet to receive official directive from the union to suspend services.
This is said to have been a major reason Ibrahim Magu was sacked as the acting boss of the EFCC after a presidential probe on alleged diversion of recovered loot and replaced with a substantive chairman, Abdurasheed Bawa.
On the pursuit of economic growth, the target has been hindered by the drop in the price of crude oil, recessions and the COVID-19 pandemic in the midst of skyrocketing increase in the prices of commodities.
There has been a resurgence of insurgency terrorism in the North-East, banditry and cattle rustling in the North-West and North-Central, kidnapping and farmers-herders clashes in the South-West.
The economy has remained in the doldrums.
But to be fair to Buhari, he has been unlucky to encounter great and daunting challenges he clearly never envisaged.
At the beginning of his first term, elements from the Niger Delta embarked on willful blowing and destruction of pipelines and flow stations.
I assure you we will close down as soon as I receive directive to do so, may be later in the day.
It will be painful for everyone but we hope for a positive response from the state government at the end of the warning strike, Ahmad said.
Electricity supply in the state had been suspended since 12 a.m on Sunday.
The management of Kaduna Electric, in a statement, informed its customers that the Transmission Company of Nigeria has knocked off all its 33KV lines in the state in compliance with the NLC directive.
Kogi police nab tricycle operator for robbing passenger
The Kogi State Police Command has arrested a tricycle operator, Abdulmumin Jimoh, for robbing his passenger of two Android phones, some cash and an ATM card in the Lokoja metropolis.
Spokesman for the Kogi State Police Command, DSP Williams Ovye Aya, who disclosed this in a statement Thursday, said the suspect was arrested by operatives of Operation Puff Adder, through synergy with members of the vigilante.
He said the arrest was made following reports that the suspect together with his gang members now at large, robbed a passenger who boarded the suspects tricycle from the Dumanis Church junction, along Ganaja road to Ganaja, Lokoja metropolis.
He said it was immediately after the 200 units junction, one of the gangs who posed as a passenger covered the victims mouth and put a knife on her neck, in which they dispossessed her of two Android phones, voters card, ATM card and a sum of N10,000 cash.
It was thereafter the tricycle operator now pushed her out of the Keke and ran away.
And immediately, the victim stopped another tricycle and narrated her ordeal.
North Korea pull out of World Cup qualifiers
North Korea have pulled out of next months qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the Asian Football Confederation said Sunday.
The Asian Football Confederation has today confirmed the withdrawal of the DPR Korea Football Association from the Asian Qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, the AFC said in a statement.
No reasons were given for the withdrawal but South Korean media reported earlier this month that Pyongyang had said it would skip the qualifiers over coronavirus fears.
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced most of the second round of Asias preliminary tournament for the Qatar World Cup to be postponed until June.
The AFC said last month it would change the format of the tournaments so that each group of five nations would play in one host country.
South Korea was selected as the centralised venue host for Group H, which is led by Turkmenistan and also included the two Koreas, Lebanon and Sri Lanka.
North Korea were fourth in Asian qualifying Group H, but only a point behind Group H leaders Turkmenistan with three games still to be played before their withdrawal.
The AFC said a decision would be made later on the standings in Group H after referring the matter to FIFAs organising committee for competitions.
The tournament doubles up as qualifiers for the 2023 Asian Cup, to be held in China.
Pyongyang's decision to pull out comes nearly a month after the country said it would not go to this year Tokyo Olympics, citing concerns over the pandemic.
North Korea was one of the first countries to close its borders more than a year ago to protect itself from the virus that first emerged in neighbouring China.
How Kano is becoming Nigeria's rice milling hub
With many rice mills springing up in Kano State, coupled with increase in production, the state is gradually becoming the hub of rice, not only in Nigeria but West Africa.
The recent rice farming activities in Kano have been seen as a record-breaking achievement in the history of Nigeria.
The consumption of rice is said to have increased to 4.7 per cent, almost four times the global consumption growth.
This triggered a revolution in the sector; hence the increase in rice milling in Kano.
In places like Kura, Gezawa, Bunkure, Garun Malam and Tudun Wada local government areas of the state, it is common to see a cluster of small-scale rice millers doing business.
It is the first mega rice mill owned by a woman in Kano State.
This resulted in an increase in the number of rice farmers in the state as demand increased.
It was reported that rice milling revolution in Kano started in 2014 when 70,000 farmers were mapped out to benefit from the years dry season farming programme in the states agricultural scheme.
It is also on record that as at 2019, Nigeria ranked as the first in Africa and the 14th largest producer of rice in the world, with China being the top producing country.
According to Iliyasu Nazifi, an engineer and young entrepreneur, in the last five years, rice production received the boost it had never received in the history of agriculture in Nigeria, which gave rise to the many milling factories in Kano State.
Nazifi is the chief executive officer of the Golden Star Rice Mill and a member of the Rice Processors Association of Nigeria (RIPAN).
It was also said that this achievement wouldnt have been possible without the commitment and support of members and leadership of the RIFAN across all the states in Nigeria.
According to the chairman of the RIFAN in Kano State, Alhaji Abubakar Haruna, Nigerians were initially estimated to have been consuming more than five million metric tons of rice each year, with a significant portion coming from imports.
He further revealed that demand, which was growing faster than supply, driven by factors like population growth and urbanisation, actually gave birth to the strategies adopted by the government to ensure increased production, which would lead to self-sufficiency.
The development of rice value chain in Nigeria has immeasurably reduced urban-city migration and youth restiveness as many of the youths are gainfully engaged in agricultural practices, Haruna said.
Also, the treasurer of the RIFAN in the state, Malam Hussaini Shuaibu, revealed that the decision of the Federal Government to close Nigerias land borders against rice importation created a huge demand and created awareness for more domestic b mills.
It was also revealed that the states rice production capacity increased; hence the establishment of mills.
Very soon, Kano State will move from being the centre of commerce to that of farming and processing, Shuaibu said.
However, the Kano State Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (KACCIMA) is worried that the state has only recorded industrial boom in rice milling while other sectors suffer great setback.
According to the first deputy president of the KACCIMA, Ambassador Usman Darma, most industries in Kano are closed down due to electricity issues and financial challenges associated with policies of some commercial banks.
He added that only few of the industries operate in full capacity.
85 per cent of industries in Kano are not working.
The only expansion so far recorded is in rice mills, and that is because government policies have been favourable to the operators.
However, with the recent visit by a combined team of the National Assembly and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, we are hopeful that the issue would be addressed in due course, he said.
Boko Haram kills two Cameroonian soldiers in Nigeria
Two Cameroonian soldiers deployed to Nigeria were killed late Saturday in a Boko Haram attack in northeastern Borno state.
The insurgents, on foot and in several trucks fitted with machine guns, attacked Nigerian soldiers outside the town of Wulgo.
Cameroonian soldiers were then also attacked after deploying from across the border to assist.
Two CDF (Cameroonian Defence Force) soldiers were killed in the 40-minute gunfight with the Boko Haram terrorists, a Nigerian military source said.
Another three CDF soldiers and a Nigerian soldier were injured in the fight, said the military officer.
An armoured vehicle belonging to the Nigerian army and two Boko Haram trucks were destroyed in the fight whileseveral jihadists wereneutralised, the second military officer said.
The jihadists launched the attack from the nearby Wulgo forest, a known Boko Haram hideout.
The jihadist insurgency in northeast Nigeria has killed 36,000 people and displaced around two million from their homes since 2009, according to the United Nations.
The violence associated with Boko Haram and its splinter group ISWAP, the Islamic State West Africa Province, has spread to neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.
In 2015, a regional military coalition, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) was tasked with fighting the insurgents.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari replaced the countrys top military commanders in January in a sudden overhaul after months of pressure over deteriorating security.
How to Avoid Scams If You Are Playing at an Online Casino in Nigeria
Nigeria is a country that offers a lot of activities for people to enjoy.
Many love to visit this country, and they love the opportunities that are available to them.
There are online casinos out there that are not operating with integrity.
Some you should have doubts about, but you may not know exactly which casinos are legitimate and which ones may scam you.
You can check this list for a complete guide to the best Nigerian online casinos and this is a great place to start.
Nigeria is like any other land.
There are criminals out there looking to scam you, especially in the cyber world.
Many claims that they are a legitimate casino or are offering you legitimate investment opportunities, only to steal your money and your identity.
This is why you need to do a little searching and research to ensure that you are not going to be scammed.
If you think about it, there are literally thousands of people who are being scammed online every day.
This is an international problem, and it does not matter where you live.
People in the United States, China, England, Brazil, and even in Nigeria are being cheated by these scammers.
So, it pays to have a plan in mind of how you will protect yourself from getting taken.
With the rapid technology growth, it is important to always be safe and secure when browsing the net.
The first thing to consider when choosing an online casino is to pick an option that is a well-recognized, international option.
There are some online casinos that have earned licenses in several countries across the globe.
They have decades of building up a reputation and have proven themselves to be an operator that you can trust.
This is a great place to start.
You know that if they are operating within the country, that they are doing things the right way.
They have millions of customers who can attest to that, and that is something you want to depend upon.
To operate legally within the country of Nigeria, the online casino operator must get a license from the Nigerian government.
If they do not have that, then they are not legally authorized to operate.
The site should have information that tells you about their license and the process they have gone through to receive it.
They will let you know who licensed online casino operators are, who are legally able to provide the services within the countrys borders.
There is an old adage that says that if something is too good to be true, then it likely is.
If an online operator is providing or promising all kinds of guarantees or promises that sound outrageous, they probably are.
No casino operator is going to offer 10 times in a match to your initial deposit, as an example.
They are not going to guarantee that players win 50% of the time.
None of those things are realistic.
If you are being promised something that sounds really sensational and an offer that seems almost too good to pass up, you should pass it up.
You are saving yourselves a lot of trouble by doing so.
Payment options are one of the biggest indicators to you of the ability to trust an online casino.
If they are able to accept such payment options as Visa or MasterCard, then you have a little bit more confidence that this is a trustworthy site.
These credit card companies vet businesses and organisations that accept payments from these credit card companies.
This is one of the best indicators that you are about to be scammed.
You may not be the most tech-savvy person, but there are things that you know that must be in place for you to be able to safely access the website.
Things such as the HTTPs certificate and quality connections between your computer and the server to the online casino are important.
They should be using technology that protects account information and has sensational cybersecurity.
These are a few things you can pay attention to that will help you to know whether you should trust an online casino or not.
Suspected IPOB members attack FCID in Abia
The Nigeria Police Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) located at Umuagu, Umuahia in Abia State is under attack by gunmen believed to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
The gunmen, numbering over 50, were half-naked.
Some were seen hanging live cock around their neck while many of them are armed with AK47 rifles.
They attacked the security formation and set it ablaze.
A security source told our correspondent that a combined team of the military and Police engaged the hoodlums afterwards.
He added that stray bullets killed some people in the process of a gun battle between them.
Meanwhile, soldiers have taken over Umuahia as of the time of this report.
It could be recalled that Umuahia residents woke up seeing men of the Nigerian Army patrolling major streets in Umuahia and manning areas believed to be flashpoints.
The Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, has faulted the Senate President, Ahmed Lawans, comment over a meeting and resolutions reached by Southern governors.
Seventeen Southern governors met last week in Asaba, Delta State, where they called for the convocation of a national dialogue, demanded bold steps to restructure the country, a total ban on open grazing and also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation.
Lawan in a reaction, accused the governors ofretreating to regionalism to address a national issue that should be collectively decided upon.
The Ogun speaker who spoke in Abeokuta at the weekend, however, said Lawans comments were not healthy.
This is the first time in the history of the country when the governors of the Southern part of Nigeria would come out openly on this matter and align themselves with the request and demand of their people.
It shows that he has a pre-meditated mind
Manchester City will be crowned Premier League champions if they beat Chelsea this afternoon in a game which is now a dress rehearsal for the Champions League final.
Victory at the Etihad Stadium would allow Pep Guardiolas City side to open up an insurmountable 16-point lead over second-placed Manchester United, who have just five matches remaining.
But while the title is now a formality for City, the Chelsea game takes on extra significance after the two clubs earned their places in the May 29th Champions League final in Istanbul.
German coach Thomas Tuchel has had an extraordinary impact on Chelsea since joining the club three months ago and can also look forward to an FA Cup final against Leicester City on 15 May.
The West London club reached that final by beating Manchester City in the semifinal and that result is fresh in Tuchels mind.
This doesnt give us the upper hand but it gives us a good feeling
, it gives us self-confidence, said Tuchel, who has described City as the benchmark for his team.
We wanted to close the gap to Manchester City and in this one match in the semifinal we did in a very impressive performance, and we will need exactly the same level of performance again.
But it gave us belief, he said.
Chelsea also have plenty to play for on Saturday as they look to secure a top-four finish and guarantee a place in next seasons Champions League.
Tuchels side are currently in fourth place but have just a three-point advantage over fifth placed West Ham United.
On Sunday, Manchester United start a run of three games in five days, with a trip to Aston Villa.
The programme was organised by the NDLEA in collaboration with a non-governmental organisation in Ilorin.
Umoru said for the first time in the last 10 years, 22 and 26 grammes of cocaine were recovered from one Sherifat Yusuf and Yusuf Abdullahi respectively.
He noted that over 46 of the suspects arrested during raids who are drug users have been counseled and released.
The Commissioner of Police, Kwara State Command, Muhammed Lawal-Bagega, represented by CSP Fayola Temitope, urged parents to have interest in the activities of their children to prevent them from abusing drugs.
The coordinator of the workshop, Mr Samuel Rotimi, said the essence of the programme is to share ideas on how to reduce the cases of drug abuse to the barest minimum.
OCP Africa and the Nigerian Institute of Soil Science (NISS) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on management of problematic soils in Nigeria.
The OCP Africa Country Manager is Mr Caleb Usoh
This project aligns with other numerous OCP Africa farmer-centric projects, he added.
So, I don't understand what prompted such reaction from the senate president.
We may not be aware that Nigeria is one of the main target markets for universities in the United Kingdom.
There is even some history to demonstrate how events in Nigeria could affect the survival of an institution of higher learning in the United Kingdom.
Mrs. Elizabeth Ivase (1936-2019) was the first female minister in northern Nigeria.
She was minister of education in the Second Republic.
Because of the importance of her position, the University of Wales, where she once studied, invited her to Cardiff.
There, she pledged that every year, the Nigerian government would sponsor a significant number of Nigerians to study at the University College Cardiff (UCC) where a variety of social science and humanities courses were undertaken.
The funds they would receive from Nigerian students within a few years were so enormous that they incurred a huge debt to build and expand their facilities.
They were so sure that funds from Nigeria would service the debt.
But a certain military officer named Muhammadu Buhari was lurking in the shadows, ready to disrupt the Republic that pledged them an enormous amount in tuition fees.
When Buhari disrupted the Republic, it was no news that UCC was on the verge of bankruptcy.
To make matters worse for UCC, Buharis government came with a policy that the idea of government scholarships being utilised overseas was economically imprudent especially for degree programs that can be conducted in Nigeria.
Thus, UCC was a UK university, which operated like a Nigerian university because they were so much accustomed to funds from Nigeria, until they learnt lessons out of experience.
To save what was left of UCC, the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST) merged with UCC so that they would have what was then to be called the University of Wales College of Cardiff (UWCC).
This incident was reported in a paper entitledFinancial management in universities: The lessons from University College, Cardiff, published in Financial Accountability & Management (1988 Jun;4(2):99-112).
The paper describes the circumstances in which UCC reached the verge of bankruptcy, and it does refer to the relationship between UCC and Nigeria concerning international students.
This institution is the present Cardiff University.
It is not in doubt that Western economies are still dependent on developing countries.
The nature of African economies perfectly suits developed countries.
If Africa were to process all its natural resources, many businesses in the developed countries may fail.
Many businesses in the United States and the United Kingdom are failing as China is increasingly becoming the worlds manufacturing hub.
It is also in the Wests economic interest for Africa to rely on imports and as safe haven for looted funds.
These have been the arguments of Kwame Nkrumah, Sekou Toure, Amilcar Cabral, Walter Rodney, etc.
The arguments are as relevant today as they were in the 1950s and 1960s.

Foundation trains 200 Enugu entrepreneurs
At least 200 youths in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State have graduated from a three-month Youth ICT and Skill Acquisition Project (YISAP) of the Baywood Foundation.
The young people were trained on entrepreneurship/vocational skills such as ICT, photography, video-editing, barbing, digital marketing, graphics design, confectionery and other small scale enterprises.
The foundation, in January, 2021, got a $98,925 grant from the Coca-Cola Foundation to empower 600 youths in Enugu State.
The 200 trained youths are from Enugu West Senatorial Zone, while 200 youths will be trained in Igboeze North Council (Enugu North Senatorial Zone) and 200 youths of Enugu East Council (Enugu East Senatorial Zone).
At least 100 exceptional youths will get a seed grant of N45,000 and N60,000 each from the 600 participants selected for the project.
He also said 33 out of the 200 graduating youths with outstanding performance would be given grants.
The Chairman of Udi Council, Chief Ifeanyi Agu, advised the graduating youths to put in their best and take advantage of the opportunity provided by what they had learnt.
A beneficiary, Mrs Anthonia Ugwu, encouraged her fellow youths to utilise the skills they had learnt to double their influence and income in life.
A suspected explosion has hit the popular Mile 3 Park market in Diobu axis of Port Harcourt, causing panic on Monday morning.
The incident took place at about 6:20am when traders were bringing in their goods into the park, witnesses said.
One person was injured in the leg, while few others sustained injuries in a stampede that followed.
Many traders in the market quickly parked their goods and left the park after the explosion.
The personnel of the Nigeria Police Force believed to have come from Nkpolu Police Division, Port Harcourt immediately moved to the scene of the incident.
When contacted the State Police Command, spokesperson, SP Nnamdi Omoni, said that he is yet to get detailed information about the incident.
Armed policemen take over PDP secretariat
Armed policemen have been deployed to the premises of the Peoples Democratic Party state secretariat in Calabar.
Their unusual presence was noticed since Saturday morning.
A bystander said, The security operatives numbering about 50 came in unmarked pickup trucks and have blocked access from the nearby Kia motor shop all the way to the secretariat, located along the Murtala Muhammed Highway in Calabar.
Their presence might be to avert possible backlash as the landlord is said to be out to evict the party which reportedly was heavily indebted to him.
Meanwhile, the immediate past State Chairman of the party who has also been serving as caretaker committee Chairman, Ntufam Inok Edim has given impression that the two-storey building might be converted for other use.
painters have started to change the colour of the building.
The PDP flag has been brought down.
Alhaji Saad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto, has advocated the use of Hijab by Muslim women.
Abubakar wondered why the wearing of the Hijab would be a problem for others who were not using it, stressing that the other religions could also be encouraged to adopt what their religions order them to do.
Almighty God created us to worship Him
and you must protect my rights as a Muslim, in whatever documents you are going to bring and there are no two ways about it.
I must have freedom to worship Allah the way Almighty says I should worship Him.
So, why do people make too much noise about Shariah and its implementation?
It is all about our lives as Muslims from the day of our birth till we die.
So, look at the way to protect the interests of Muslims that constitute over 50 per cent of this nations population.
Whether in the North, East, South or West.
I believe nobody should stop me from practising my religion and I must practice it to the best of my ability, without tampering with other religions or their freedom.
You can pick a stone and keep it in your home; that is the problem between you and your God, not me.
There are so many cases where young girls were denied the right to use their hijabs in schools.
Why is it that the use of the hijab becomes a problem to those people who are not using hijab?
On the other hand, we should even encourage persons of other faiths to do what their religions ordered them to do.
And that is how we will live in peace, he said.
All of you knew that before 1914, there was no Nigeria; but there was Sokoto Caliphate, Kanem Borno Empire, Oyo Empire and Benin Kingdom.
The amalgamation of all these led to Nigeria of today as they took power from the people and put it on a few civilians.
Why are politicians afraid of giving power back to the people they have been living and working with closely?
We have accepted the change and we are ready to help; the earlier we realise we can work together, the better for us.
The political class should know that we are not in any competition with them.
We are here to help and we are ready to help, he said.
The Sultan added that with adequate political will, the insecurity bedeviling the country was surmountable.
He said the constitution review should also stress religious tolerance and freedom through which peace and stability would be promoted.
We believe that the GID will provide room for deeper engagement and inclusion of women, youth, PWDs, IDPs, and other marginalized groups in the electoral process.
This should uphold the fundamental principles of participation, inclusion, and representation on which a healthy representative democracy is based.
While hoping the purpose of the newly established department will also promote and increase the integrity and credibility of our electoral process, we call on INEC to review other recommendations in the advisory.
These include uploading results sheets at ward, local government and state levels to the results viewing portal, uploading electoral data and materials on INECs website, she said.
Hamman-Obels added that ahead of the 2023 elections, the organisation believe that these recommendations will help to further strengthen the integrity and credibility of the nations electoral process.
Fire service gets 20 new ambulances, 7 firefighting trucks
The Federal Fire Service, FFS, has received 20 newly procured Basic Life Support (BLS) modern ambulance buses and seven firefighting trucks.
The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, while speaking at the commissioning ceremony of the equipment in Abuja on Tuesday, said they were part of the N10.4 billion infrastructure upgrade approved by the Federal Executive Council on March 3.
The minister said the arrival of the new ambulance buses and trucks and their deployment to the various zonal and state commands would enhance the service delivery of the FFS during emergencies.
Aregbesola lamented that the year 2020 into 2021 had witnessed frightening fire incidents, ranging from markets to gas and pipelines fires around the country.
Statistics at our disposal show that the FFS in 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 received 4,541 fire calls from which regrettably, 158 lives were lost and property loss is estimated at N41.5 billion, he said.
Aregbesola urged the state governors and the local government chairmen to invest in firefighting as well in order to reduce the loss of lives and property from fire incidents across the country.
Speaking earlier, the Controller-General of the FFS, Dr Liman Ibrahim, said the Services operational scope had spanned all the states of the federation and the FCT.
He said the FFS would commence deployment of itspersonnel and assets to the 72 remaining Senatorial Districts before the end of this year.
two Deputy Controller-Generals (DCG Quintus G. Azogu and DCG Callistus Agu) and an Assistant Controller-General, ACG Thompson Mohammed, were pulled out to mark their retirement from the service.
NDLEA raises alarm over rising drug addiction in Jigawa
The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Jigawa State has expressed concerns over the rising rate of hard drugs consumption, especially among students of tertiary institutions, in the state.
The states Commander of NDLEA, Hajiya Maryam Gambo Sani, while speaking with Daily Trust, decried the increasing rate of drug consumption, which she said had heightened cases of delinquency in the state.
She noted that between February and May, a total of 21.63 kilogrammes of banned substances were seized by the agency in the state, and 108 suspects nabbed: 103 males and five females.
She said,The rate of consumption of drugs among youths in the state, is not decreasing at all.
Anytime my officers go out for arrest they come back with a lot of users.
Before you can get a dealer or a baron, you will get hundreds of users, so we can say the rate of consumption of drugs is on the increase.
She added that while both secondary school and tertiary institution students were involved in the intake of illicit drugs, consumption was more rampant among students of tertiary institutions.
She further said,Anytime we go out for raids, we arrest students.
I hope to meet with the management of the university to discuss the issue of students involving in drug abuse.

How Nigeria can earn $700m yearly from sugar investment
The Dangote Sugar Refinery has urged the federal government to strictly implement the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) in the sugar industry as the nation can earn $700 million yearly from local production.
The Chairman of Dangote Sugar Refinery, Aliko Dangote, disclosed this Thursday at its 15th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Lagos.
Dangote said,If the National Sugar Master Plan is followed strictly and the players all follow the rules, the country will be better for it as Nigeria will save between $600m and $700m annually as forex.

The virtues of open grazing in Nigeria
According to a popular adage when you are in a tunnel, what you need is light, not sound.
However, a light at the end of the tunnel on issues relating to cattle husbandry is long time coming.
It is true that population has increased over the years, also more land has been put into farming and infrastructure, but analysis of data shows that for 20 million cattle and 200 million Nigerians, there is more than enough land.
For a start, Kano State, one of the most densely populated states is home to about one million cattle and there is relative tranquility.
Nigeria has a landmass of 92.3m ha, with 70.8m ha of agricultural area but only between 34 million to 35 million ha was cultivated last year.
For the sake of discussion, lets look at maize production.
Available data shows that in 2020, only about 12m tons were produced.
Research findings have shown that 86 per cent of cereal biomass is made of materials not consumable by humans.
The implication is that over 50 million tons of crop residues will be wasted if not consumed by cattle.
Not to mention sorghum that accounts for 50 per cent of total cereal production and occupies about 45 per cent of the total land area devoted to cereal production.
Add to these, the millions of tons of grasses on fallow land and open range.
To access these fodders, which are mainly available only in situ, cattle must move and openly graze.
In most cases, this is done with the expressed permission of farmers for a fee.
This explains why a kilo of beef sells for 1700 Naira.
Therefore, until the country has a programme to process these quality fodders, banning open grazing will be a dog in the manger policy.
But I accept that rogue elements amongst herders engage in criminalities and the justice system has failed to prosecute them.
These are small-scale livestock producers that settle in communities all over Nigeria.
They negotiate with members of the host community for land to build their homestead, grow crops and keep cattle.
According to FAO, 33 per cent of global land is under cultivation for animal feeds while 30 per cent of the entire earth surface is permanently under pasture to support global intensive livestock production.
Ethiopia has a landmass of 110 million hectares with 60 million cattle, three times that of Nigeria under open grazing.
Ethiopia is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa with livestock production covering 40 per cent of agricultural output and contributing 13-16 per cent of the total GDP.
Without any doubt, cattle production is facing a myriad of challenges associated with husbandry, the misconduct of some herders, climate change and local politics.
In todays world, technology is the weapon of first choice to overcome most challenges associated with livestock production.
The industry is worth about N10 trillion (PAN) and is the biggest in Africa.
Commercial and free-range rural poultry exists in all states thus giving commercial poultry the all-important Federal character.
The poultry revolution did not just happen, it was made to happen by deliberate government policies, public-private sector partnership and the Nigerian spirit of entrepreneurship.
The same technology can transform the cattle industry for the benefit of all.

Biden lifts travel ban on Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, others
President Joe Biden on Wednesday lifted the travel restriction the Trump administration had placed on countries including Nigeria, Sudan, Eritrea, Tanzania, among others.
The order also ended blocked entry to most people from Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and North Korea.
On Wednesday the president signed 15 executive orders including two agency actions.
Biden condemned the ban as an attack on racial and religious minorities.
The president directs theState Department to resume visa processing for those countries and develop a plan to address people affected, such as those who were denied entry to the U.S.
The former president, Donald Trump had placed restrictions on travel and immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries.
Trumps central 2016 campaign promises were to crack down on immigration and limit the number of Muslims coming to the U.S.
The travel ban has been devastating especially to those who have families in the US.
The Managing Director of Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited (LPLEL), promoters of the Lekki Deep Sea Port, Mr Du Ruogang, has said the port would generate about 2000 direct jobs and over 10,000 indirect jobs when it is completed in 2022.
Ruogang disclosed this recently while taking journalists on a tour to assess the level of progress on the construction work at the Lekki Port project site.
He also disclosed that construction work on the project has so far moved at a fast pace, reaching 51% completion, adding that some major milestones such as completion of Eastern breakwater had been achieved.
He stressed that all hands are already on deck to deliver the first of its kind Deep Sea Port in Nigeria as one of the shareholders, the Nigerian Ports Authority, had commenced work to initiate marine services at the site.
He also expressed confidence that the Lekki Deep Sea Port would change the narrative of Nigerias maritime sector and consequently impact Nigerias economic development.
According to him, Lekki Port is estimated to have an aggregate economic impact of $361 billion over 45 years, creating no less than 169,972 jobs and generating revenue for both state and federal government agencies through taxes, royalties and duties in the process.
The MD explained that the project has succeeded in providing employment opportunities for about 1,200 Nigerians with 50 of them from the host community.
Huawei CEO: We wont give up the ideal of globalization
Huaweis CEO Ren Zhengfei has pledged to stick to a globalization strategy despite external pressure.
He has called on the new US administration to come up with more open policies that are in the interests of US companies and the US economy as a whole.
These are the first public remarks the founder of Huawei has made since the change of the US administration.
Ren was speaking during a press briefing in Taiyuan, the capital city of Chinas northern Shanxi province, after launching the Intelligent Mining Innovation Lab.
Trade benefits both sides.
Allowing US companies to supply goods to Chinese customers is conducive to their own financial performance.
If Huaweis production capacity expands, US companies could sell more.
Its a win-win situation.
I believe the new administration will weigh these interests as they consider their policies, said Ren.
Ren stated that Huawei creates value to the whole ecosystem and the wider economy.
He cited the example that Huawei has built 5G networks in many cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
As humanity keeps making progress, no company can develop a globalized industry alone.
It requires concerted efforts around the world, Ren added.
The United States government has been campaigning against Huawei in the past two years alleging Huaweis equipment could be used to spy on Americans, without presenting any evidence.
Huawei has repeatedly denied the claims, and few other countries have given in to US pressure.
Ren said he is now even more confident about Huaweis survival.
We have found new and more ways to overcome our challenges.
Our sales revenue and profits in 2020 were higher than the previous years, Ren told journalists.
Ren said the Intelligent Mining Innovation Lab would result in better services for mines with 5G.
By supporting the mining industry, we can grow our business and support more efficient and safer production in mines.
We can also enable coal mine workers to wear suits and ties at work, Ren said.
In the 5G era, connecting businesses is the main goal.
There are many industries that we are not too familiar with, like airports, ports, coal mining, iron and steel production, automotive manufacturing, and aircraft manufacturing.
Thats why we built joint labs to learn more about the needs of these industries.
Huaweis business results for the first nine months of the year 2020 showed that revenue totalled 671.3 billion yuan ($98.57 billion), up 9.9% from that of the same period in 2019.
We'll continue serving our customers well by creating more value for them.
We want them to have lasting faith in us, and we hope that they wont sway because of political pressure, said Ren.
Farmers, herders in Ekiti to register with government or get expelled
Ekiti State government has given farmers and herders another two-week window to register with the state government or be ready to leave the state.
The two-week grace begins on Sunday, March 22.
In February, the state conducted a two-week registration of farmers and herders, but not all those involved seized the opportunity.
He added that the registration was also aimed at ensuring peace between the two groups and bringing incessant clashes between them to an end.
He noted that the exercise was in consonance with the National Livestock Transformation Programme of the Federal Government.
Dr Adetoyi observed that clashes between farmers and herders posed dangers to human and food security.
Special Adviser to Gov. Kayode Fayemi on security matters and chairman, herders-farmers peace committee, retired Brig.-Gen. Ebenezer Ogundana, warned in the statement that whoever failed to register would be treated as a criminal.
Such persons, he said, would be compelled to leave the state.
Director-General, Office of Transformation and Service Delivery, Prof. Mobolaji Aluko, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that identity cards would be issued to registered farmers and herders free of charge, (NAN).
On October 13, 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari nominated one of his aides, Lauretta Onochie and three others as commissioners in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
Apart from the chairman of the commission, Professor Mahmoud Yakubu, there are 12 national commissioners that run the administration of the electoral umpire.
Yakubu, whose first tenure ended on Monday, November 9, 2020, was re-appointed as the chairman of the commission for a record second term in office.
There was also the voluntary retirement of Abubakar Ahmed Nahuche, an engineer, thus leaving the electoral impire with six vacant seats for national commissioners.
This may have prompted President Buharis nomination of his Special Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, for confirmation by the Senate as a national commissioner representing Delta State.
Others nominated are Professor Mohammed Sani (Katsina), Professor Kunle Ajayi (Ekiti) and Seidu Ahmed (Jigawa).
Senate President Ahmad Lawan, on October 13, 2020, while reading the presidents letter of request at plenary in the Senate, said the nomination was pursuant to paragraph 14 of part 1F of the First Schedule of the 1999 Constitution.
Members of civil society organisations who spoke with Daily Trust were unanimous that President Buhari should respect the provisions of Nigerias constitution and without delay.
Speaking on the development, the executive director, Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education (CHRICED), Dr Ibrahim M. Zikirullahi, told Daily Trust on Sunday that the issue of vacancy at the level of INEC national commissioners is very disturbing.
According to him, if the president is having difficulty in finding the right candidates to fill the vacancies, he could advertise the positions and let qualified people apply.
To allow a vacuum in an institution very critical to our democracy sends a worrisome signal.
On the nomination of his aide, which was roundly condemned, the president appears to imply that he does not know people beyond his narrow circle in government.
the director of programmes, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, told Daily Trust that the INEC was yet to be fully constituted since some seats of some national commissioners are vacant.
The National Assembly has the power to decline to confirm a nominee who does not meet the required criteria to serve as national commissioner.
The lawmakers should have screened other nominees who passed the test of non-partisanship and integrity while waiting for a replacement for those who did not pass the test.
This delay has a severe impact on the operations of the INEC, with just 21 months away from the 2023 elections.
She added that the appointment of the remaining commissioners was crucial for a duly constituted INEC, which will ensure a successful conduct of the 2023 elections.
She said,It is crucial that the president reconsiders his nomination and increases the number of women as national commissioners.
Commenting on the issue, the executive director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said Nigerians had noted Onochies support for President Buhari and other members of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
It is even more important for the president to listen to voices of the civil society and the general Nigerian citizenry to rescind the appointment of Onochie as INEC commissioner.
Failure to do this would have a negative effect on citizens perception of the commission and its composition, Rafsanjani said.
When contacted, the Presidency kept mum on the decision of the Senate not to confirm the nominees.
Senator Babajide Omoworare, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), neither picked his calls not replied a text message sent to him by our correspondent.
A similar message sent to the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, after phone calls, was not replied at the time of going to press.
Secondus accused of N10bn fraud in fresh crisis rocking PDP
A fresh crisis has hit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party has been accused of mismanagement of N10bn generated from the sale of forms for four years.
The countrys anti-corruption agencies, EFCC and ICPC have been petitioned by one of the chieftains of the party over the matter.
The petitioner, Prince Kassim Afegbua, alleged that the leadership has mismanaged close to N10bn which accrued from the sale of nomination forms for the presidential, gubernatorial, house of assembly and senatorial elections from 2017 to date.
Responding to the petitioner, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the claim asspurious andirresponsible.
The PDP did not raise Afegbuas fictitious sum of N10 billion as alleged by him.
For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP generated the sum of N4.6 billion and raised a budget for its expenditure.
In December 2019, I wrote an article about Thomas Cook, arguably the first-ever travel agency and how that firm accidentally established tourism as we know it today.
Last week, news came out that some $601 million of airline funds were stuck in Africa.
In time, Nigerians were given one of the strictest visa regimes to the UAE and we were excluded entirely from certain types of long-stay visas.
The next level perhaps, is for the UAE to start inviting Nigerians for physical interviews before visas are granted.
Europe and the USA remained suspicious and difficult for us to visit.
The police in Ogun State have arrested four suspects for abducting a 13-year-old child at Onipanu in Ado Odo/Ota Local Government Area of the state.
The suspects are John Nelson (21), Adeleke Ayotunde (29), Adekunle Basit (20) and Abey Fagbemi (20).
They were arrested following a complaint lodged at the Onipanu Divisional Headquarters by one Adejuwon Odunowo; the father of the victim.
The complainant told the police that his daughter, Susan Odunowo, was sent on an errand by her mother at about 6.pm on May 6, and that she did not return home.
He said he later got a call from someone who demanded N500,000 ransom to set the victim free.
The spokesman of the police, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen on Tuesday in Abeokuta that following the report, the DPO of Onipanu, CSP Bamidele Job, detailed his detectives to unravel those behind the act.
According to him, on May 8, the detectives traced one of the suspects to Cele area of Ota where he was arrested.
Oyeyemi further said the arrest of the first suspect led to the apprehension of two other members of the gang at a factory in Ota.
He explained the operatives discovered that the victim was being kept in a room owned by Adekunle Basit and that, Detectives swiftly moved in there and rescued the victim unhurt.
The leader of the gang, Abbey Fagbemi, who took to flight immediately he heard of the arrest of his fellow gang members, was later arrested at about 7.am of Monday May 10, 2021.
transfer of the suspects to the anti-kidnapping section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation and prosecution.
Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has charged operators to ensure sound corporate governance practices and improved customer services in their operations.
The ABCON President, Dr. Aminu Gwadabe, gave this charge in Lagos at the opening session of the 2021 Annual ABCON Nationwide Training on BDC Operations.
It is also to enhance the service delivery to forex end users, noting that BDCs occupy a very important position and play critical roles in the national's foreign exchange market.
Gwadabe said these roles informed the decision of ABCON to partner with the CBN, NFIU and other security agencies to organise the annual nationwide training on BDC operations.
He also said the one week training ending on June 30 holds in four locations across the country.
NDLEA seizes N10bn heroin, khat at Lagos, Kano airports
Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos and Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano have seized consignments of heroin and khat with a street value of over N10 billion.
A sample of the substance in the consignment was sent for laboratory analysis and came out positive to khat, weighing 36kg.
This thus bringing the total weight of illicit drugs seized at the two international airports to 61.3kg he added.
Luka Istifanus: FCT won't hire athletes to win National Sports Festival medals
The acting Director of Sports in the FCT, Luka Istifanus has frowned at the reckless poachimg of athletes by the big money spenders as he vowed that the FCT won't go about paying athletes to win National Sports Festival medals.
In this interview with Trust Sports, the acting Director spoke on the performance of Team FCT at Edo 2020 and sports development in the Federal Capital Territory.
How has it been since you assumed office as the acting Director of Sports in the FCT?
I took over as the acting Director of Sports in the FCT on the 8th day of October 2020 and since then my major concern has been how to take sports in the territory beyond where I met it.
It has not been easy because FCT is more or less a civil service settlement.
You cannot compare it with states like Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Edo, Kaduna and others.
However, we are doing everythimg to improve on the achievements we recorded in the past.
Interestingly, the Federal Capital Territory Administration is solidly behimd us.
FCT placed 16th on the medals table at the just concluded 2020 National Sports Festival.
How satisfied are you with the performance of your athletes?
I must start by saying that I was the happiest person when the administration of the FCT approved that we should participate in the 2020 National Sports festival.
Although there is still room for improvement, I will say that I am satisfied with what we were able to achieve.
Looking back, we have always the been 17th, 18th or 19th apart from when we hosted the sports festival in 2004 and 2018.
You know when you are the host, you have so many advantages.
You can patronise as many events as possible.
You can register as many athletes as you want.
However, when you are going out, you have to cut down the number of events and athletes to minimise cost.
So I am happy that this time around, we didn't host but ended up in the 16th position despite the enormous challenges we faced.
Two states, the host Edo and Delta battled for supremacy and that impacted negatively on officiating.
We could have performed even better but questionable officiating denied us so many medals.
We were not the only victims of the supremacy tussle between Edo and Delta.
In all, we are grateful because we performed better than 21 states.
With the support of the government, we would perform better at Delta 2022.
The National Sports Festival is now open.
How did your athletes cope with their more experienced opponents?
It was not an easy task because some states went as far as the USA, France and Germany to hire athletes.
Like in tennis, the player who won the singles event came from France and was paid the sum of N5 million by Delta State.
Some states brought as much as 30 professionals outside the country which was a whole lot of money.
Remember in addition to government money, they have oil companies that are their sponsors.
But here in FCT, we depended solely on government funding.
A state gave as much as N15m to one of its officials to monitor proceedings for it in combat sports.
That is the money that some states struggled to get to attend the festival.
For us, even before we left for Benin City, our minister charged us to be responsible to our behaviours, to be worthy ambassadors.
He advised that we shouldn't try to win by all means.
That was his farewell message to us and we abided by it.
We didn't go outside FCT to look for athletes.
It has been the policy of the FCT to raise athletes from the grassroots and expose them for national and international competitions.
That was exactly what we did.
our father can you hear please give us good chidlren and after giving us good children give us money to take care of them
Do you support calls in some quarters for the National Sports Festival to be returned to when it was strictly for amateurs?
Don't throw this golden opportunity
The biggest disadvantage is that it is making coaches to be lazy.
The Coaches are paid salaries but when it is time for the sports festival, they are given money to go round and poach athletes from other states.
I remember during the 2018 edition, some athletes were forced to refund as much as N1m for failing to deliver medals to states that contracted them.
This is definitely not helping in the development of talents.
That was how he was eliminated
That was how so many other players were denied the opportunity to exhibit their talents.
The sports festival is now for the highest bidder but FCT won't buy medals.
We don't have money to hire athletes to win medals.
We shall continue to raise our own local athletes.
He who has God on his side
Honestly, we must go back to the grassroots.
FCT has 62 wards.
Each area council has 10 words except AMAC that has 12.
Sports development must start from the ward level.
In the past, FCT organised so many competitions from the ward level but mostly in team sports like football, handball, volleyball and athletics.
These are events that are not capital intensive.
We usually start from the wards to the area council headquarters and to the city centre.
This is the platform that has continued to generate athletes for the FCT.
So I am calling on other states to emulate the FCT in developing their own athletes.
As we areTalking of developing athletes, would you say there are enough and standard sporting facilities in the FCT?
We have six sports centres that are under construction in each of the six area councils.
Already, we have made a strong appeal and the Hon.
Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu has already visited some of the facilities.
She has been to Kuje and AMAC and is planning to go to Bwari and others to see the level of development.
With the backing of the Honourable Minister, Alhaji Mohammed Musa Bello, she is doing everythimg to ensure these facilities are completed.
We have also made requests for sporting equipment in sports like karate, judo, boxing, wrestling and a host of others.
We are expecting favourable responses.
What are the plans for the next edition of the sports festival?
We have started training already because the next edition is less than one and half year away.
So we have started preparations and we have since made requests and recommendations to enable us to prepare adequately for Delta 2022.
We need to imbibe the lessons of Ramadan
There is a need to pay more attention to the plight of the poor.
The Muslims holy month of self- purification and self- denial otherwise known as Ramadan has just ended.
While it lasted, the season of fasting and prayer offered all Muslims the opportunity to reflect on their relationship with Allah.
It also enabled those with means to share food with the poor, the needy and the less privileged.
For all Muslims, it was an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the teachimgs of the faith and the cause of mankind as a whole.
Altogether, it was a period of deep reflection on the inter-relationship between man and his neighbour, on the one hand, as well as man and his God.
Even though the month-long fasting has come and gone, its lessons must endure.
As one of the five pillars of Islam, Ramadan has a highly spiritual significance.
To devotees, it was a period of self-emptying without which no spiritual being can have a truly rewarding relationship with his or her maker.
That explains why the exercise was marked in Nigeria (as elsewhere in the world) by private and group prayers, and abstinence from all forms of worldly comforts and pleasures.
The aim was to enhance spiritual growth and foster charity and brotherly love.
As the Muslims therefore mark the end of this annual spiritual exercise, it is hoped that the outcome will be of immense benefit to the nation.
Nigerians can hardly make ends meet due to the prevailing economic situation in the country.
By paying attention to the plight of the poor, as was amply demonstrated in the course of Ramadan, we invariably place the welfare of our neighbour as important as ours.
By allowing others to partake of our wealth or material possessions, we honour the One who made us
This happens to be at the heart of all religions but a virtue hardly imbibed by many in Nigeria today.
That must change.
Since the Ramadan fast, like the other four pillars of Islam, was aimed at promoting both the spiritual and material wellbeing of man, it stands to reason that man is invariably better off doing the will of God
When he is able to rein in the impulse for self- gratification and greedy accumulation of wealth, man is more liable to make his society a better place to live in, not only for himself but also for his neighbour.
That for us was one of the most enduring lessons of Ramadan which we hope many would have imbibed.
It is noteworthy that fasting as a spiritual exercise is advocated by all religions ostensibly with the notion that the man who can make sacrifices in the bid to tame his desires would be a better person both for himself and the larger society.
As one expert puts it, besides abstention from food and drink, fasting helps the faithful from looking at the provocative, from hearing the mischievous, and from uttering the obscene o avoid slander and from thimking about inflicting injury to others
The month of Rahmah (blessing), Barakah (mercy), and Magfirah (forgiving) is upon us.
The blessed month is a precious gift from Allah SWT to Muslims.
But do we know exactly why this month is so special to Muslims?
What exactly is the purpose of this month, and all the blessings associated with it?
What are the lessons we are supposed to take away in observing the sanctity of this month?
Of course, this blessed month exists to train us, to guide us, and to remind us of how we should approach the remaining 11 months of the year.
Ramadan imparts upon us numerous lessons: How to develop our manners and moral fortitude, how to treat our fellow human beings with respect, how to strengthen our brotherhood, how to maintain unity among the Muslim community, and how to be welcoming to all the non-Muslims who share this land with us.
The month also teaches us to be more pious, disciplined, and how to maintain self-control, while shielding our souls from greed and immorality.
But, most importantly, the month teaches us how we can improve our connection with the Almighty.
The month of Ramadan also instills a sense of empathy withim us.
It allows us to understand the situation of the less fortunate, to feel and experience the pain of hunger and the pangs of thirst that our poverty-stricken brothers and sisters who are often forced to go without food and drink feel every waking day.
Ramadan is a month of mercy and bonding â€” Muslims all over the world help one another, and those outside their community, spreading happiness all around.
This month is a shiming example of the unity that can be achieved among all classes of people in any society, as the rich and the poor, the employer as well as the employee; the parents as well as the child, the ruler as well as the subjects, all keep fast.
Regardless of the colour of their skin or their social stature, fasting unites us all.
It reminds us how we should conduct ourselves and our behaviour towards those around us, while also teachimg us the importance of respect.
Not only do we learn to abstain from food and drink, but we also abstain from making any statements and actions that may cause harm to people or violate their rights.
It gives us an opportunity to rectify ourselves through performing numerous good deeds such as providing food or aid to the needy, improving social interaction, giving charity, sadaqah and zakat, and so on.
And all of these deeds will be remembered on Judgment Day by the Almighty.
But what happens to all these lessons after Ramadan?
Unfortunately, we seldom retain any of the lessons we learn on this holiest of months beyond Eid-Eil-Fitr itself.
But the purpose of Ramadan runs deeper than mere celebration.
The lessons we receive are the lodestar for the rest of the 11 months in any given year.
The training we receive is meant to improve us as human beings for the rest of our lives, as that is the true purpose of Ramadan.
After the month is over, and we have all observed our final fast, and the Eid celebrations are dealt with, we will all return to our normal lives.
But, it is important that we keep the spirit of Ramadan alive for the rest of the year, and indeed the rest of our lives.
Because it is only through unity, modesty, and temperance that we can make the world a better place for all of us.
All said, the nations leaders, political and otherwise, have much to take from the lessons of Ramadan.
If they can curtail their materialistic tendencies and pay more attention to the yearnings of the people, the country will certainly become a much happier place for everyone.
We therefore urge our leaders to imbibe the lessons of Ramadan.
To our numerous Muslim readers we say, Eid Mubarak.
May Allah reward your sacrifice.
Ibrahim Adbon writes from Abeokuta, Ogun State.
Column No.6: Who's checking checkpoints in Abuja?
It goes without saying that Abuja, being the capital city of our dear nation Nigeria, is important.
So I will be the last person to complain about security being too much.
In fact, I would even say it needs to be more.
Checkpoints, those incredibly useful security constructs, have helped and continue to help to either thwart criminals, or even proactively tackle crime.
The police, saddled with most of internal security, at least in the ideal situation, man most of the checkpoints in Abuja metropolis, as well as surrounding areas.
Sure, the army picks up the slack in some places, but the boys in blue are supposed to be the main custodians.
They are mad at the kids for doing such a thing
boy do they mess thimgs up in a lot of cases.
For starters, take for instance one of the checkpoints in Wuse II, particularly the one leading from Zone 4 to Wuse II, just before the bridge.
The conduct of the officers there, from my experience, is abysmal.
Anyone who plies that road after 9pm their resumption time will echo what I am saying.
I won't go into details, but what I can say is that it sometimes is extremely unprofessional.
Still in Wuse II, just beside AP plaza, the story is the same.
I would like to suggest to the higher-ups to monitor all the checkpoints in Wuse II to see firsthand what I mean.
But the checkpoint horror stories don't end there.
Probably the worst of them all is the checkpoint after the traffic lights at the popular Banex Junction, which is manned by cops from the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), no less.
Barking at commuters and intimidating innocent citizens every night, they cut a picture of a poorly-trained and badly-behaved set of individuals who seem to miss the point that theyâ€™re supposed to protect and serve citizens.
The same CTU is also responsible for the personnel manning a checkpoint near the Nigerian Army Farms and Ranch Ltd. (NAFARLS), where all kinds of thimgs unfold.
Anyone plying that road can see for themselves.
I'll also request the higher-ups to do the same, with a view to fixing thimgs.
Forget Abuja for a minute
Look around Nigeria, and the many checkpoints roadblocks, really on highways across the country by numerous security agencies, are generally seen as reasons for loss of time, or even increased prices of consumer goods and services.
As is the case with our security organisations, they always push back swiftly, with well-oiled PR machimes denying allegations or issuing veiled threats.
Don't forget the fact that while many checkpoints might be legal, many are not.
That is made clear by the way and manner in which the personnel mounting it carry out their activities.
Now, this isn't a police-bashing piece.
It's also not meant to disparage VIOs and FRSC personnel.
It's a general critique of checkpoints and how we do them in this part of the world.
Which means we will have to look at others, like the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and that of VIOs
Again, I will not say too much, just to suggest closer monitoring of the checkpoints snap checkpoints, really for some really shocking revelations.
This is because this isn't a piece meant to disparage anyone or any organisation.
But can someone do somethimg about the ridiculous lack of quality of our checkpoints, generally?
Checkpoints aren't recent, as far as innovations go.
There are set standards for the various types that exist, and all we need to do is to adhere to them.
They are quite helpful in fighting crime, and so we cannot wish them away.
But we owe it to ourselves to get them right.
They, , like most thimgs, have the capacity for great good, but if handled badly, can be the source of a lot of very bad thimgs.
Maybe focusing on the ones in Abuja will help us, as best practices spread nationwide.
I have no interest in highlighting the bad, but the personnel at checkpoints in Abuja make that inevitable.
But all hope is not lost: I am hoping that somehow, someone, somewhere who can do somethimg about our checkpoints will do somethimg about them.
That someone, somewhere, somehow, is checking our checkpoints, and the people that man them.
It might make all the difference in our safety and public perception about our security personnel, which is something we've been sorely lacking for a long time now.
Glut hits Katsina tomato farmers
Farmers and dealers of tomatoes in Katsina State have, in the last two weeks, experienced acute market glut; some of them resorted to sun-drying the produce.
According to the farmers, they least expected such development, considering the stiff economic condition in the country, high cost and demand of food items, as well as longtime border closure that halted free importation of food items, including tomato paste.
Shehu Bashiru Danja, a tomato farmer, said they were expecting huge revenue in this period, but their hope was dashed with the recent development.
Many of us targeted Christmas and New Year periods, with the hope to make good sales of the produce, but to our surprise, we ended up with market glut.
We are really affected because of the high cost of production that involves fertiliser, seeds, herbicides/pesticides and labour, he said.
Bashiru added that since the closure of land borders and the outbreak of COVID-19, the market price of tomato was not as low as N1,000 per big basket until recently.
A big basket of tomatoes was sold between N3,000 and N10,000 last year, a reason many irrigation farmers this season concentrated on tomato production, with the hope that it would yield huge profits than other crops like wheat, Irish potato or cabbage, he added.
Hamza Dalhatu, a tomato merchant and farmer said the market glut was borne out of protest against the indiscriminate taxes and levies on the produce in southern markets.
Since last year, there has been an increase in taxes and levies on our goods and trucks in the southern part of the country.
The lingering security issue is also a threat to our merchants; hence they suspended business till things are sort out.
We cannot continue like that.
All the cost burdens end up on farmers without considering the cost of production, Dalhatu said.
A check at Danja and Funtua markets revealed that a small basket of tomatoes costs N400 while a big basket was not more than N1,200
as at last week Friday.
Another tomato dealer, Sani Suleiman Hunkuyi, expressed hope that thimgs would soon normalise as dealers from Lagos and Ibadan have visited some of their members in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara to fashion out new terms for the business.
The market glut of the produce is temporary and farmers will soon continue to reap the maximum benefits of their sweat
Suleiman said.
Supreme price: The untold story of policemen killed during #EndSARS protest
Sergeant Adegoke Ajibola and Corporal Rotimi Oladele ran as fast as their legs could carry them, sought a hiding place, pleaded for their lives as the mob closed in on them.
Their pleas fell on deaf ears.
They were dragged, beaten, hit with sticks, knives and any available objects in sight.
While still begging for their lives to be spared, they were set ablaze on a heap of tyres.
The more the fire raged, their voices were lost in the flames, never to be heard again.
The two men burnt to death on Iwo Road in the ancient town of Ibadan, the third largest city in Nigeria, were not criminals.
No, their only crime was that they were crime fighters.
A viral video posted by one of the hoodlums showed the despicable scene as the policemen were set ablaze on a heap of used tyres and their bodies shared.
The two were among the not less than 22 policemen, seven soldiers and 59 civilians killed in October 2020 during the #EndsARS protest, according to the toll announced by President Muhammadu Buhari during an emergency meeting with former Nigerian leaders.
The #EndSARS was a decentralised social movement and a series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria.
The slogan calls for the disbanding of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a notorious unit of the Nigerian police with a long record of abuses.
The #EndSARS protest, which lasted two weeks, was peaceful until it was hijacked by hoodlums, who looted public and private-owned warehouses, burnt police stations and destroyed property.
Ajibola and Oladele were not members of the now disbanded SARS, according to official record and findings by our correspondents.
In fact, they were not the regular policemen seen on the road as findings revealed that they were attached to the Operations Department of the Oyo State police command.
Their area of engagement was usually being on special duty as requested by different companies and organisations, and as approved by the command.
They were on their way to such engagement at a fish depot at the Wema Bank area of Gbagi in Ibadan when they met their untimely death.
Coincidentally, the 42-year-old Ajibola and his colleague, Oladele, had three children each.
Oladele's wife, Feranmi, had just put to bed their third child, 16 days before the unfortunate incident.
Feranmi, who is an orphan, just as her late husband, said the news of his death shattered her world.
Tears welled up her eyes as she recounted the horrifying experience of six months ago.
Sensing danger as the #EndSARS protest had turned violent in some areas, Feranmi had pleaded with Oladele to stay at home.
The plea was ignored by her husband, who had said he couldn't abdicate his responsibilities as a law enforcement agent.
Undeterred, Feranmi called Oladele's elder sister to intervene, but the late police officer refused all treaties to make him stay at home.
After much persuasion, he promised that he would stay in the office.
His sister also asked me to leave him since he said he was not going to the field but the office.
Four hours after he left the house, I felt that somethimg bad had happened to me.
I could not eat.
I wasn't okay because I was expecting him to call me, but there was nothimg of such.
I called him but his phone was not going through.
I then went to meet one of our neighbours to inform her about it, but she said maybe my husband's phone was off because he could not have the time to charge it.
Shortly after that, I was outside my room
and I heard people saying two policemen were killed in town.
Not too long, I saw people moving their properties out of the barracks without telling me anythimg.
They were moving with the fear of possible attack on barracks.
In fact, they were watchimg me because many of them knew my husband had been killed.
When it was around 8pm when people had left the barracks, I was still waiting for my husband to return home.
I just decided to visit the Eleyele headquarters when my sisters came into our house.
She asked me to follow her to her house.
I was hearing people saying my husband had an accident.
That was the last moment I remember.
The following day, the oldest man in my family came to meet me and explained that my husband had died.
For more than five days, I didn't know anythimg again, she said.
Her words were stopped intermittently as she made unsuccessful attempts to control her tears
They told us that we just had to accept our fate and move on.
He has three children.
My last child was 16 days when the incident happened.
He was attacked in Iwo Road.
He was among the two victims who were roasted in Abayomi.
I heard those hoodlums ate the flesh of my husband, she added, with fear and shock written all over her.
you are the boss for this Tarmac
Bolanle-Ajibola, the wife of Sergeant Ajibola, described the gruesome murder of her husband as disheartening and disgusting.
Reluctantly recalling the incident of October 22, Tokede wondered how the standard of humanity had depreciated in the society, warranting human beings to kill and eat the flesh of another.
I was at work on October 22 when one of his colleagues called me to inform me that my husband had been killed.
He was attached to the police headquarters in Eleyele.
According to the news I heard, he was roasted after being lynched by hoodlums.
I felt sad when I heard about it.
I didn't get myself, but I had accepted my fate.
I heard that some hoodlums took part of his flesh away while some were eating it.
So disheartening and disgusting, she lamented.
Many commentators, including the government and police authorities agreed that there were justifiable reasons for the #EndSARS protests owing to the excesses of officers in the unit, but in the heat of it, many â€˜innocentâ€™ and dedicated officers were killed.
He was a good and caring man.
Since his demise, I have missed everythimg about him.
It is very painful because he has parents both of them are here in Ibadan.
My husband was committed to his job.
He was always assigned for special assignments in other states, and he diligently carried out his tasks until he was killed, added Mrs Bolanle-Ajibola.
On her part, Mrs Oladele described her husband as a man who was good to motorists and respected others in the discharge of his duties.
My husband was a good man to me.
He gave me whatever I needed without much stress.
He was nice to motorists.
In fact, many of them used to visit and give me money.
He respected people.
Many people have said so many good thimgs about him.
He loved his children and never joked with their wellbeing.
His death was horrible.
Those who witnessed the incident said he was seriously beaten before he died and they later set him on fire
she said, dropping her head in her hands.
Three other officers were gruesomely murdered during the protest in Oyo State.
They were killed when hoodlums overwhelmed the police at Ojoo, Ibadan.
It was learnt that only the body of a 37-year-old James Akanmu was seen where it was allegedly dumped by the attackers.
The relatives of Alidu Yusuf Wada and Peter Agunbiade are still searchimg for the remains of their breadwinners.
Beauty James Akanmu told our correspondent that she spoke with her husband a few minutes before he was killed.
I called him when I heard that the protesters were in Ojoo.
He told me that it had happened (they were under attack) and I asked him to leave the station immediately.
He said he was looking for how to leave.
As we were talking, his phone went off and that was the last conversation we had.
Since that day till now, I have not heard from him again.
We called his phone number but it was not going through.
Three days later, I was called to check the stream where they were dumped.
We saw it, but they had taken everythimg on his body.
It was only his identity card and uniform that we saw on his body.
They had destroyed almost all the parts of his body.
We were able to recover the remaining part of his body and deposited it in a morgue, she narrated as tears gushed out from her eyes.
It was uncontrollable as she became mute for some minutes before eulogising the late crime detector.
He was the only one caring for the family.
I do not have anythimg to do.
He could do any legitimate business to care for the family, especially his children.
His three children are all boys.
His parents are dead.
The last statement I had with him was to find a way out of the station, which he said he would try.
Before he was killed, nobody knew he was a police officer in the neighbourhood.
He never bragged, she added.
I'm still searchimg for my husband
Alidu Esther is still searchimg for the body of her husband, Alidu Yusuf Wada, more than 205 days after he was killed during the attack on the Ojoo police station.
Mrs Alidu couldn't hide her pain as she recalled the last moment of her late husband, who she described as the only hope in her life.
Mr Wada had left home that fateful day with his usual promise to buy gifts for his four children on his way home.
Sadly, he never returned to that house.
She was informed of her husband's death a day after the sad event.
And since then, the search for his remains has not yielded positive results.
My husband was a good man.
It is very rare to get such kind-hearted husband.
He was a calm person and usually took care of his family.
He was the only family I had.
He was my father and mother.
He cared for me with everythimg he had.
He left four children for me to care for now.
As we speak, we have not been able to recover his body.
I heard he was about to climb the building of the station to escape when they killed him.
When government officials got to the station to evacuate his body, they didn't see it.
His parents are still alive; they are in Kogi State.
I heard he was stripped naked, hit with sharp objects, dragged on the road in front of their office before he died.
I heard he struggled with them
but you know, since it was a mob attack, it was hard to survive
she said, with tearful eyes.
A 42-year-old Inspector Peter Agunbiade, an exhibit keeper at the record department of the station, was also killed.
The father of four was burnt to death, according to his wife; yet nobody has been able to locate his remains.
Mrs Agunbiade said, It was October 20 the incident happened
He told me he was going to work as the DPO asked all of them to report to the office.
So, before 6am, he had left the house.
I and the children prayed for him because we were aware of the situation of thimgs in the country at that time.
He called me around 12pm, saying the station close to the highway at Ojoo had been razed by the EndsARS protesters.
I asked about his wellbeing and he said all of them had moved to the DPO's office for safety.
Despite the palpable fear and tension that hovered around him, the thought of his children and their wellbeing was topmost on the mind of the inspector.
He called his wife back, pleading that she should make all efforts to beat the protest, which had taken over all the major areas in the state and pick the children from school immediately.
The wife did that, but that was their last conversation as she couldn't reach her husband again.
Sensing danger, Mrs Agunbiade ran to the station the following day, but the building was in total ruin.
It had been razed by the protesters.
It was deserted and there was nobody to talk to.
She ran to the police headquarters at Eleyele, but nobody was able to give her a satisfactory answer about the whereabouts of her darling husband as she was asked to contact the DPO of where her husband worked.
Later, when I went to the headquarters at Eleyele, I met the DPO and he explained to me that those mobs were more than them.
He told me that my husband was beaten and burnt alive.
He was a good man.
He was in charge of record keeping.
He was a recorder.
He wasn't a troublesome man.
He was an exhibit keeper.
He was a graduate and hated violence.
He was not always in uniform.
People hardly saw him outside.
His parents are still alive.
â€œHe was a caring husband to me and caring father to his children.
Even if it is the last money in his hand he would drop it for us.
He was very calm.
Many people in our neighbourhood did not know him until he died.
His plan was to ensure that his children become graduates, but now, he is no more to fulfill his dreams.
We have not been able to recover his remains, she narrated.
A 14-year-old twin of the late inspector said they were yet to recover from the shock of losing their father at a tender age.
They have two other younger siblings
Kehimde Agunbiade, who spoke on behalf of the children said, â€œWhen we heard about it we felt broken and shattered.
We believe our dad was innocent, but the Bible says when the wicked are facing justice, the innocent will also be part of it.
My father was gentle, kind and always found a way to help people.
He was supposed to go for the graduation of his master's degree before the incident happened.
Saved by his good deeds
If not for his good deeds, a Kogi State-born Yakubu Enemali would have been killed after hoodlums attacked the Ojoo division of the Nigeria Police Force, Ibadan during the protest, noted the woman who rescued him.
Three policemen were killed in the attack, but Enemali was rescued by a Good Samaritan.
Daily Trust gathered that the father of nine was rescued by a woman whom he had helped in the past.
The Good Samaritan, who refused to mention her name, for security purposes, confirmed to Daily Trust Saturday that Enemali was axed in the head and shot in his leg when she met him in a pool of blood.
Before the arrival of Enemali's wife, the woman had taken the victim to a nearby clinic for first aid.
Seven months after he was rescued, Enemali is yet to utter a word.
He is in pain and can't talk.
He usually misbehaves, having sleepless nights and hardly comprehends issues.
At the moment, though Enemali can recognise people, he cannot talk, which necessitated the need to undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain test at the Chemical Pathology Department of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan to determine the type of surgery to be carried out.
He was diagnosed with seizures at the MOP and SOP Department of the hospital.
According to a medical expert, Dr Mustapha Ajakaiye, seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain.
It can cause changes in behaviour, movements or feelings and levels of consciousness.
Our correspondent who visited his residential apartment at the Idi-Omo area, Akinyele Local Government Area of Ibadan, observed that nothimg was left in their sitting room.
Enemali's wife, Tosin, who spoke with Daily Trust Saturday, said all their properties had been sold to take care of the health of her husband and the children.
I am a fashion designer.
I sold all my sewing machimes to care for him because I never knew it would take this long before he would regain consciousness.
Aside from my machines, I also sold all the chairs, television, home theatre and other valuables in our house.
As you can see, we don't have anythimg again.
I have invited somebody to buy the bed frame in the front of the house for me to be able to buy drugs for him.
I decided to stay with him because my husband is a good man.
I know he is alive today because of his good deeds.
I didn't know the woman who rescued him when hoodlums attacked him, but God saw his heart and made an escape route for him, she said.
He was cheated, forgotten and neglected
Six months after the #EndSARS protest which claimed the lives of many policemen, including six officers attached to the Lagos State command, their widows still await promises made to them by both the government and the Nigeria Police Force.
Since they lost their breadwinners, the plight of these widows can be described as a desperate struggle for survival as they are now left with no other choice but to fend for their children, a task which some of them were not exposed to during the lifetime of their husbands.
A good number of them are presently weighed down by these burdens that were suddenly placed on them by the cold hand of death.
Not able to cope, some of them have relocated to their villages.
The Lagos State Government was said to have given the widows N10million each, but that good gesture had also pitched them against the relatives of their late husbands.
Our correspondent reliably learnt from some of the widows that the money given to them by the state government was taken away from them by the relatives of their husbands.
They alleged that only a fraction of the total amount was later handed over to them by the heads of their respective families.
Those who spoke to our correspondent said they were eagerly expecting the scholarship the Police Force promised their children.
The officers who were killed in Lagos during the protest were Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP)
Edward Yard, attached to Denton station; Inspector Ayodeji Erinfolami, attached to the defunct anti kidnapping unit; Inspector Aderibigbe Adegbenro, attached to Meiran division; Sergeant Bejide Abiodun, attacked to DOPS SHQ; Ehibor Samson and one other attached to Orile division.
Daily Trust Saturday had earlier reported that a total of 16 police stations were set ablaze during the unrest in the state.
They included Orile, Amukoko, Layeni, Old Area J command, Ajah, Elemoro, New Area J command, Elemoro, Igando, Ebute-Ero, Ajah and its barracks and Ilasamaja police stations.
Others were Makinde and its barracks, Ikotun, Isokoko, Pen-Cinema, Onipanu, Alade police stations etc.
About 13 police formations were vandalised, amongst which were Ojo and Ojodu stations.
A total of 38 policemen from various formations/locations withim the state sustained varying degrees of injury.
Back to the village
Hannaty Yard told our correspondent that she and her five children had relocated to their village.
She said she was still trying to put together the bits and pieces of her life after the demise of her husband.
I have relocated to my village in Niger State, along with my children.
This is to afford me the opportunity to take care of my children properly.
I will be in Lagos soon because my son, Jayjay, will be writing the Junior Secondary School (JSS) final examination, after which I will come back to the village to continue with my life.
Life has not been easy for me since the death of my husband.
I am now responsible for thimgs he was doing.
If the government could fulfill the promise of scholarship they made to us, life would be better.
But right now, thimgs have not been easy, she lamented.
The 42-year-old widow, however, declined to say anythimg about the death of her husband, insisting that discussing it would bring back the memories she is still struggling to forget.
For Olamide Erinfolami, life has not been fair to her and her children.
The 39-year-old woman, who was thrown into early widowhood, said she lost the good part of her life to the cold hand of death.
She has also relocated to her village in Ekiti State.
She took their children along.
She said, â€œI am now into petty trading in front of our house in Ado-Ekiti.
Whatever I get I use for my children.
I am still expecting the scholarship the Nigeria Police Force promised us.
It will remove the huge financial burden placed on me by the death of my husband.
The woes of widows of the slain policemen in Oyo State are compounded as there is no support yet from the state government.
They felt abandoned and rejected after their breadwinners paid the supreme price in the course of duties.
Beauty Akanmu urged the government at all levels to offer scholarships to their children.
My husband served the Nigeria police during his lifetime; therefore, somethimg should be done for his children.
As we are here now, we don't have a house, no work and no family to care for us.
How do we survive?
We really need help from the government, she said.
Alidu Esther, who was not working before her husband died, pleaded for the support of the government, noting that it has been difficult to feed and care for the children of the deceased officers.
The oldest was 12 years old while the youngest was one year and six months when the officer was killed
Mrs Agunbiade said the family was faced with many challenges, recalling that during the last festive period in December, there was nobody to support them.
We are appealing to the government to assist our children.
Our children education is more important to us, she said.
Her eldest children, 14-year-old Taiwo and Kehimde Agunbiade, appealed to the government at all levels to give them scholarships.

The only way out is the establishment of local storage and processing facilities in producing zones across the country.
Agric companies and entrepreneurs should take this challenge as soon as possible to solve this long time problem, he said.
They are developing Nigeria's gas industry for the domestic market
The natural gas industry is a cultured industry that drives innovation and touches nearly every field and aspect of life that we care about.
From mobile phones to the makeup we wear, to medical devices, bank cards, and even the football we kick around with friends.
The industry is one of the building blocks of the thimgs we need and love every day.
Natural gas is used for transportation, cooking, electricity generation, and manufacturing.
It is used as a raw material for making fertiliser, antifreeze, plastics, pharmaceuticals and fabrics.
The steel and paper industries also use natural gas to generate process steam for industrial applications.
Existing data shows Africa's largest economy, Nigeria, has the largest natural gas reserves on the continent.
With oil, the industry accounts for about 70 per cent of its revenue, making the sector one of Nigeria's best and most sought-after employment sectors.
Most of Nigeria's electricity generation is from natural gas, while crude oil is primarily used for power backup.
A forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that natural gas will be the largest global electricity generation source.
Natural gas brings with it several quality-of-life environmental benefits because it is a relatively clean-burning fuel.
Globally, the sector is producing millions of jobs, with employment up 40 per cent since the Great Recession of 2008 in the U.S. alone.
Thus, given its existing gas reserves, it will be surprising to see Nigeria not leading the continents gas industry.
On 29th March 2021, President Buhari launched the country's Decade of Gas.
The aim is to transform Nigeria into a gas-powered industrialised economy by 2030.
Developing the gas industry will boost other industries through the provision of electricity and raw materials.
Here, we will shed light on three points: some critical gas development policies, the potential benefits of developing the gas industry for the domestic market, and the employment opportunities in the gas industry.
Since the discovery of gas in Nigeria, there have been subsequent attempts to develop the industry.
For example, the gas commercialisation and utilisation programmes contributed to reducing gas flaring and increased gas utilisation by about 300 per cent between 1995 and 2017.
There were gas pipeline projects which concentrated on the western part of the country and the continent.
The first Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS) was commissioned in 1989 to supply Lagos and neighbouring South-west states.
Following the success of the ELPS, the government agreed to supply Ghana, Benin, and Togo through the Western African Gas Pipeline, which was commissioned in 2006.
However, these projects were not favourable to the country's domestic market, given the persistent issues of power in the country.
Evidently, Nigeria's power sector is challenged with poor electricity facilities, natural gas supply shortages, inefficient distribution network and inadequate transmission system.
According to the International Energy Agencys 2018 estimate, only 60 per cent of Nigeria make use of natural gas
population had access to electricity.
Power shortage has limited the growth of the country's total production across all sectors.
It has caused many businesses to close or move to neighbouring countries completely.
It was challenging for new start-ups and for attracting foreign investment.
The lack of electricity has contributed to the high inflation rate as businesses pay for an expensive alternative electricity source, their production cost increases, which increases the prices of goods and services.
To mitigate these issues, the Buhari administration commissioned gas infrastructure projects to promote gas use in the domestic market.
The projects include the second Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS-2), Obiafu Obrikom
Oben (OB3) gas line and the Ajaokuta to Kaduna to Kano (AKK) gas line.
The AKK gas line project will pass through Abuja from Ajaokuta.
Then we will see another line from Abuja to Kaduna, then from Kaduna to Zaria, and from Zaria to Kano.
With himdsight, these projects should have been done since the turn of the millennium.
Nonetheless, these are notable projects and should be appraised with optimism.
The projects are expected to guarantee net investment return.
The gas lines will provide gas to cement firms, other industrial concerns, and residential customers.
The users of compressed natural gas like buses and trucks will be able to buy the product cheaper as its supply increases.
The government is also planning to build three new gas-fired power plants for power generation plants, located in Abuja, Kaduna, and Kano, to use the pipelines gas to generate 3,600 MW power.
The power plant will provide electricity to households and many industries in the northern part of the country.
The benefit of producing a decent amount of power and raw materials from gas will translate to a success story.
For example, resuscitating the textile industry will mean reviving its largest manufacturing sub-sector, which accounted for 22 per cent of employment and 15 per cent of manufacturing value-added in 1984.
In the long run, the tax revenue from the performing industries and employees will outweigh the cost of pipeline projects.
If government policies are successful, all other thimgs being equal, the natural gas industry will be a major source of job opportunities for Nigerian's rising labour force.
The industry has a high concentration of contractors and sub-contractors, with different work split between specialists.
The gas industry jobs are characterised as semi-skilled and skilled craft trades positions.
The jobs in the sector are not restricted to petroleum engineers alone.
Many roles do not need special education.
The skills can be learned on the job, from attorneys to welders to architects, truck drivers, and accountants.
The industry also pays above minimum wage.
This means that the industry has an enormous opportunity to attract, retain, and develop lifelong careers for individuals as the industry expands.
Finding jobs in the industry is similar to other sophisticated, high-tech industries.
Employees should have a decent education, some certification as an industry specialist would be an advantage, training and a little experience could go a long way.
Therefore, as the government is laying out policies for the Decade of Gas, the opportunity for capacity development is opening.
The education sector can explore the training curriculum for the industry and ways to attract industry experts who can contribute to capacity development.
In conclusion, The Decade of Gas is a desirable policy.
It is an opportunity for Nigeria to develop its gas industry, even though it looks a bit too late for this adminitration.
Thus, the next government and all the relevant stakeholders should consider this ingenuity to transform the country into a gas-powered industrialised economy.

Kidnapping: Abuja suburb requests police division
Residents of Tungan Maje, a suburb of Gwagwalada Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have called on the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to establish a police division to help tackle crime in the area.
The community has suffered series of kidnapping for ransom in the past few months and the people say they now live in fear.
Some residents who spoke with Daily Trust also expressed desire to meet with the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma.
The Chief of Tungan Maje, Alhaji Salisu Isiaku Naannabi, debunked a newspaper publication that quoted unnamed sources claiming that his people decried the withdrawal of police from the community.
He clarified that the claim that the communitys members paid police N20,000 every day for feeding allowance during their assignment in the area was untrue.
He said, The police special squad was not withdrawn from the area but was deployed to Kuje to carry out an assignment
and they would return to the community when they are done.
People are many at the market today because of bonanza
Sunday, a resident and leader of non indigenes in the community, said the FCT Police Command, the traditional ruler and prominent residents of the community had collaborated to ensure security of the area in the past months.
He stressed that the establishment of a police station would go a long way to address kidnapping and armed robbery in the area.
Barr David Aigbefoh, another resident, who said the community had provided land for the building of the police division, called on the IGP for speedy implementation and construction of the station.
Kim Kardashian officially a billionaire, says Forbes
Kim Kardashian West has been named on the World's Billionaires list for the first by Forbes.
Forbes estimates that Kardashian West is now worth $1 billion, up from $780 million in October, thanks to two lucrative businessesâ€”KKW Beauty and Skimsâ€”as well as cash from reality television and endorsement deals, and a number of smaller investments.
The first time she was mentioned in the pages of Forbes in 2011, it was simply a tally of her Twitter followers: 6.6 million, just below Barack Obama and just above Ashton Kutcher.
Five years later, she graced the cover of Forbes thanks to her booming mobile game, which helped her earn $51 million that year.
Kardashian West founded KKW Beauty in 2017, following the success of her half-sister Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics.
She borrowed from Kylies playbook, using a similar direct-to-consumer model that relies heavily on social media marketing.
Her first launch, 300,000 contour kits, sold out withim two hours.
By 2018, the business had expanded into eyeshadows, concealers, lipsticks and fragrances, and was bringing in about $100 million in revenue.
It's the first time I've moved away from having licensing deals and transitioned into being an owner, Kardashian West told Forbes in 2017, when she announced her cosmetics line.
She cashed in on that ownership last year when she sold 20% of KKW Beauty to cosmetics conglomerate Coty for $200 million, a deal that valued the company at $1 billion.
While Forbes estimates that figure is a little bloated Coty, which also bought 51% of Kylie Cosmetics in 2020, is known for overpaying her remaining 72% stake is still worth about $500 million, by Forbes account.
After she slapped him, he became calm
Skims, the shapewear line Kardashian West launched in 2019.
She raised money from fashion insiders like Net-a-Porters Natalie Massane and Theorys Andrew Rosen, and capitalized on her massive social media following to shill the brand.
She now has 69.6 million Twitter followers and 213 million followers on Instagram.
Skims has been quick on its feet:
During the pandemic, when consumers became more interested in comfy clothes for the couch than in smoothimg their stomachs under evening gowns, she swiftly started turning the focus to loungewear.
Kardashian West owns a majority stake in closely-held Skims, which hasn't disclosed its revenues.
A source familiar with Skims told Forbes about a transaction that values the shapewear company north of $500 million.
As a result, Forbes estimates her Skims stake is worth a conservative $225 million, enough to lift her fortune to $1 billion.
The rest of Kardashian Wests fortune sits in cash and investments, including real estate.
Every year since 2012, she has earned at least $10 million pretax, by Forbes count, thanks to paychecks from Keeping Up With the Kardashians, endorsement deals and endeavors like the aforementioned mobile game and her now-defunct Kimoji app.
Sheâ€™s also got three properties in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles, and a portfolio of blue-chip investments, including shares of Disney, Amazon, Netflix and Adidas that her soon-to-be ex-husband Kanye West gifted her for Christmas in 2017.
But its the companies that she has launched herself, and grown with the typical Kardashian flare for self-promotion, that land her on the Worlds Billionaires list.
As she tweeted the day she made the cover of Forbes, mocking the criticism she's received for years: Not bad for a girl with no talent.
As rabbit demand increases, farmer explains how youths can key in to this type of farming
Rabbit farming is not common in Nigeria but the demand for rabbit meat is growing in the country same as it is in Europe and Asia.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), an estimated 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered annually for meat.
The South African National Agricultural Marketing Council, in June 2020, reveal say dem produce 1.48 million tons of rabbit meat for 2017.
China was the leading producer, accounting for 62.9% of the global production, followed by North Korea (10.4%), Spain (3.9%) and Egypt (3.8%), among others.
By the end of 2019, Hungary, Chima, France and Spain were the major contributors to the global trade balance of rabbit meat by value.
Germany, Belgium and Italy are the leading importers commanding 21%, 19.2% and 9.3% share of global imports, respectively, according to statistics.
Here in Nigeria, a farm, Wise Trust Intl Ltd, is changing the narrative amidst huge and rising demand for rabbit meat and breeding stock in the country.
Driven by a passion for white meat, the farmer, Pastor Tayo Ayinla, said his first motivation for the rabbit business was basically the health benefit because people of his age medically have to cut down on consumption of red meat and move towards white meat, adding that the motivation further led to the discovery of its economic benefits.
The pastor has, perhaps, the biggest rabbit farm in the Federal Capital Territory.
He has 17 different species of rabbits on the farm, which he started just a year ago in Karshi, in Abuja Municipal Area Council.
He raises them in cages, locally constructed hutches and in free-range.
This reporter, who was in Karshi, visited the farm where the pastor shared his knowledge of rabbit farming so that others can key into it.
He also has rabbits on another farm in Kwara State.
Some of the free-range rabbitry in the farm
How rabbits multiply
He said if a farmer has about 60 to 70 doe (the female rabbit is called a doe and the male buck) with an average of five births per rabbit, he will have a very good number per year.
For instance, on this farm, we have seen a doe give birth to 10, 11 rabbits
but I want to be more conservative.
So let's say five rabbits as an average; then one rabbit can give a farmer between 25 to 30 rabbits in a year because with good management they can reproduce four to six times a year.
So if he gets five in a year that's 25,
multiplied by the 60 that we are talking about that is 1,600 rabbits in a year.
Of course, you can even get more than that.
people Demand for rabbit meat
The demand for rabbit meat is growing and according to Pastor Ayinla, at no time has the demand been fully met.
He told this reporter that he had received an order for 10 tons of rabbit meat from the Southwest but It is very difficult to get even one ton,â€ he said.
At times, you have a person requesting 2,500 rabbits for breeding but hardly will he get up to 500.
There was a time we got a request for 2,500 rabbits for breeding stock in the whole of the North (the client organisation has a Northern representative in Abuja here), but in the whole of the North, we only supplied a little above 200 out of the order placed for 2,500.
â€œSo rabbitry is an upcoming ATM money dispenser.
Very soon it is going to be a money dispensing business, he said.
The rabbit value chain has boomed
The farmer explained the rabbit value chain thus: Most of us don't know the benefits we have in rabbit rearing.
Number one, there's a lot of value in rabbit farming.
As a farmer you can make money from selling the rabbits breeding stock to another farmer; you can sell rabbit meat to those that want it; You can also get income through the sale of their poo or from the conversion of their poo into gas for cooking, or generation of electricity and what is left of that process can be used as fertiliser.
Most people use the rabbit wastes directly as fertiliser but that is not as effective as when you passed the poo through some processes.
Also, the urine can be used as a pesticide in the production of vegetables.
Cost of starting a rabbit farm isn't expensive
With just N25,000 to N30,000 a farmer can start rabbit farming.
The good thimg is that anybody can do it; an old person can do it because the management is very easy.
You don't need a particular place to do rabbit farming because they're neat animals, they don't smell.
You can actually do it in your house even for a person with a two-bedroom flat.
For instance, you can convert one of the rooms.
They don't smell.
The farmers can always come and buy from us; we will assist them to set up their farms.
And like I just said, in our own little way, we started about a year ago.
Rabbit feeds aren't expensive
The good thimg about rabbits is that their feeding is not demanding; they eat just about anythimg.
For instance, the way we handle ours here, we usually go to people selling cabbage and collect the outer cover of the cabbage; its good for them.
Also at the watermelon sellers, people usually eat the red part only and throw away the cover.
The cover is medicinal for them.
Also, we go to the market where they sell carrots to pick the leaves.
Virtually what rabbits eat is almost free, and it becomes much easier
when the rain starts then we can get plenty of fresh leaves for them.
A word for the youths, they should work hard
My advice to the youth is that they should understand that the government can't meet all our needs.
The reason we are having some of the problems is that so many people want government jobs and if una llook at di budget wey di government get, na situation wey dem dey use 70 to 80 per cent of government for recurrent expenditure, we no fit expect any magic from di government
First and foremost, you need to look inward: what can I do for myself.
Until you're able to do somethimg for yourself you can't do anythimg for the country.
You should also understand that there are a lot of opportunities as far as this country is concerned.
Some people will tell you that they want to do so and so
Egun people speak better than you do
but there's no market
so the question is: how can you be in a country with over 200 million people and say there's no money at hand
you're saying there's no market ?
It is either you don't understand how to market what you're doing
or you don't understand how to do business.
Like in rabbit, if you see how our rabbits are, the business will attract you, they're looking so robust.
So people say I have never seen a rabbit as big as this.
Its the way we have been able to manage them in terms of what we feed them and the environment that we have created for them.
So people should begin to look inwards.
Only e-voting will ensure rancour free polls in Nigeria -Diri
Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, says the hitch-free conduct of the recent Ijaw National Congress (INC) election through electronic voting indicated that Nigeria can hold rancour-free national elections by adopting such measures.
Diri who stated this during the inauguration of the new INC leadership at the Ijaw House in Yenagoa, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adopt electronic voting to avoid conflicts during elections.
He noted that the failure of the countrys electoral body to adopt e-voting has led to politicisation of revered state institutions and disrespect to such institutions.
The governor also explained that the adoption of e-voting would provide an opportunity for Nigerians in the Diaspora to choose their leaders through the ballot.
He said: I am an advocate and supporter of electronic voting system.
Many Nigerians have been denied the right to vote because they are not in Nigeria and cannot participate in choosing their leaders.
It is a challenge to Nigeria.
Let the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) be challenged.
If the Ijaws can do it, the Federal Government can also do it.
If Ijaws can enfranchise Ijaws in Europe and America to be part of deciding who leads them, INEC can equally do it.
It will check violence, criminality and state institutions being politicised, he said.
In his inaugural address, the new INC President, Professor Benjamin Okaba, assured that the body would work for the progress of the Ijaw people.
Prof. Okaba noted that the INC fully supported the recent pronouncement by governors of southern Nigeria prohibiting open grazing in the region, saying the organisation would provide the necessary support to ensure adherence to laws aimed at protecting the people and their land against invasion from external forces.
He stated that INC would collaborate with other ethnic minorities that share the same experiences with the Ijaws to achieve their dreams, said the ethnic group was aware of surreptitious moves by some groups to annex territories in the Niger Delta because of its resources, but that no part of Ijaw would be ceded or conquered.
Maize will be Scarce in 2021, maize farmers raise alarm
Farmers in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State under the banner of Association of Farm Settlers on Sunday said failed flood forecast and lack of government input in agriculture would make maize scarce in the year 2021.
The farmers said its members lost millions of naira in the year 2020 planting season as a result of government failure to support agricultural produce.
Daily Trust reports that Oke-Ogun area of Oyo state is regarded as the food basket of the entire southwest states of Nigeria.
The group made this disclosure in a communique issued after its emergency meeting held in Iseyin area of the state to address the plight of maize farmers in the state.
The farmers claimed many of its members had decided not to deal with maize planting again because of lack of farm implements and manpower.
The rigorous campaign from Oyo State Ministry of Environment and Water Resources said that there would be lot of rain towards the end of October and November, they sought for fund to plant maize.
Many of our members have decided not to plant maize again because of the poor and unstable rainfall, when they heard about the governments forecast through the meteorology department
It is very unfortunate that the failed forecast led to a staggering loss to our members, they lost millions in bank loans and borrowing from family and friends to plant maize, many cannot even pass by their farms to see the withered maize farms, we are so hurt by this occurrence.
The baby has a rash on its body
The communique further said the two layers of government and the Central bank of Nigeria should put in their best measures to avert food scarcity, especially scarcity of maize in 2021 as most maize farmers in Nigeria lost their crops to the drought.
The Association of Government Farm Settlers, Ipapo-Iseyin branch which represented farmers in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State used the occasion of the emergency meeting to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to evolve new measures to assist farmers determine weather forecast and also provide basic supports to genuine farmers.
They also extended their call to the governor of Oyo State to keep his promise of extending the coverage of funding for farm settlements to their association which represented the ten local government areas in Oke-Ogun from the recent loan accessed by the administration to develop the farm settlements.
Our fear for now is what will be the fate of poor Nigerians that depend largely on basic food items that are sourced from maize, it is easy to predict that there will be scarcity of maize next year with what happened this year, unless government quickly evolve a way out to assist farmers to surmount this problem.
Our governor in Oyo State has shown an unparalleled love for farmers in Oyo State and we can all see that he is out to make agriculture the major pillar to promote the States economy
we are calling on him to please extend the funding from the loan for farm settlement to us at Oke-Ogun, Alabi pleaded.
Kobe Bryant inducted posthumously into Basketball Hall of Fame
Los Angeles Lakers icon, Kobe Bryant, has been inducted posthumously into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Saturday as part of a star-studded group that also included Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.
Bryant was inducted as part of the Class of 2020, almost 16 months after he and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, were killed in a helicopter crash along with seven others in southern California.
Bryant's wife, Vanessa Bryant, took the podium Saturday to speak movingly about his love for basketball, his family, his teammates and his fans.
You did it.
You are in the Hall of Fame now.
You are a true champion, not just an MVP.
You are an all-time great, Vanessa said.
I am currently broke
big man Garnett, two-time NBA champion coach Rudy Tomjanovich and WNBA legend Tamika Catchimgs were among those also inducted on Saturday night.
The delayed enshrinement stretched over two days at the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, with Vanessa Bryant and Kobes oldest daughter, Natalia, accepting Bryants Hall of Fame jacket and ring on Friday night.
Bryant and the others were voted into the Hall of Fame as part of the 2020 class, but the formal induction ceremony was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
There will never be anyone like Kobe, Vanessa said.
Kobe was one of a kind.
He was special.
He was humble off the court but bigger than life.
Vanessa was helped to the stage by NBA legend Michael Jordan, who acted as a presenter for Kobe and three-time NCAA champion coach Kim Mulkey.
He and Gigi deserved to be here to witness this.
Gigi would have been so proud of her dad getting into the Hall of Fame, Vanessa said.
Like Kobe, Garnett went straight out of high school to the NBA.
Garnett talked of his respect and admiration for both Duncan and Kobe.
I appreciate you, Garnett said to Duncan from the stage.
It an honour to go into the hall with you, bro.
After the guy struggled for his life he later died
Garnett played 21 seasons for Minnesota, Boston and Brooklyn, averaging 17.8 points and 10.0 rebounds per game.
My only regret with Minnesota is that I didn't get to bring a championship, Garnett said.
But like I said, I look forward to rebuilding Minneapolis.
Duncan had an immediate impact in the NBA, winning the rookie of the year award.
His first NBA title came just one year after that.
Werder Bremen relegated after 40 years in Bundesliga
Werder Bremen were relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in 41 years on Saturday after a 4-2 thrashimg at home by Borussia Moenchengladbach.
At the moment it's hard to say anythimg,â€ caretaker coach Thomas Schaaf, who stepped in after Florian Kohfeldt was sacked last weekend, told Sky.
We didn't manage to do what we wanted to do.
We missed the huge opportunity to equalise, which we needed.
We fought back too late.â€
Colognes 1-0 win over bottom side Schalke, who were already relegated, confirmed Bremens worst fears, sending them down for the first time since 1979-80 when they came back up a season later.
Bremen paid the price for taking one point from their last 10 league games in Germanys top flight, finishimg 17th in the table, two points behimd Cologne who have a two-legged relegation play-off next week.
Bremen made the worst possible start when Gladbach captain Lars Stindl was left alone in the penalty area and fired into the bottom right corner with just three minutes gone.
Gladbach doubled their lead early in the second half when Marcus Thuram got in behind the defence and fired past Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka.
A towering header by Ramy Bensebaini and a Florian Neuhaus goal made it 4-0 before Bremen fought back as forward Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug scored late on, but to no avail.
She became the first female athlete to win three Olympic 100m golds when she takes to the track for another loaded race in Fridays Diamond League meet in Doha.
Fresh from finishimg fourth in the opening elite meeting in a wet, wind-swept Gateshead last week behind world
Ta Lou, Fraser-Pryce insisted that the stronger the field, the better.
The harder the competitions are, the better I am at performing.
I like a challenge
I like it when competition is hard, said the 34-year-old Olympian.
Two killed in cult clash in Edo
Two persons were reportedly killed in a renewed clash between two cult group in Benin City, Edo State capital.
It was gathered that the rivalry between the cult groups began on Saturday following the killing of one Ogbomo, allegedly by a rival group.

SWAN urges Govt to investigate Wikki Tourists poor outings
Bauchi State Chapter of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) has called for an investigation into the recent poor outings of Wikki Tourists FC in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL).
Bala Bawaji, the state SWAN secretary, said this in a statement on Monday in Bauchi.
SWAN is calling on the government to as a matter of urgency set-up a committee to look into the problems facing the club with a view to finding a lasting solution.
The team currently occupies the 15th position on the league table with only 24 points from 21 matches.
This does not reflect the State Government investment in the club, he said.
The SWAN secretary pointed out that investigating the club would allow the government to examine and x-ray its lacklustre performance at the league.
SWAN calls on the management and players of the club to brace up and return the state darling team to its position of eminence, he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the club in its last two matches suffered a devastating 1-5 away defeat in the hands of Katsina United FC in Katsina and a 2-1 home defeat by Nasarawa United FC of Lafia.(NAN)
Dessers scores, Onuachu bags assist as Genk demolish Antwerp
Cyriel Dessers found the back of the net while Paul Onuachu provided an assist as Genk secured a 4-0 victory over Royal Antwerp in the Belgian First Division A Championship Group game on Thursday.
His compatriot Onuachu was handed a starting role and utilized the opportunity to continue his impressive performances.
The game started with both sides aiming to outwit each other but despite their efforts, they failed to get the ball into the back of the net in the opening 40 minutes.
With two minutes left to the half-time break, Kristian Thorstvedt broke the deadlock to hand the Blue and White the lead.
Are you here alone
men doubled their lead in the 49th minute when Thorstvedt scored after benefitting from Onuachu's assist.
Thorstvedt completed his hat-trick moments after the hour mark before Dessers was brought on for Onuachu in the 74th minute.
Banks assets declaration and corruption war
Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdurasheed Bawa, made a declaration that the Bank Employees Assets Declaration Act of 1986 would be resuscitated to block loopholes created by bankers to sanitise the countrys financial system.
According to Bawa, the decision was taken due to the role bankers are expected to play in the fight against corruption, as the EFCC is mandated to ensure compliance with the Act.
Section 1 of the Bank Employees Declaration of Assets Act 1986 makes it mandatory for every employee of the bank to make full disclosure of assets upon employment on an annual basis.
The law under Section 7 Sub-Section 1 stipulates that it shall be an offence for an employee of a bank to own assets in excess of their legitimate and probable income.
After the deadline as stipulated by the EFCC Chairman, there are consequences that will arise as a result of non-declaration of assets by bank employees.
For instance, there is a spelt out penalty of 10 years imprisonment upon conviction as well as forfeiture of assets beyond and above legitimate income and probable earnings of such bank employees.
This piece of legislation has been in existence since 1986 under the military.
For a long time, this part of the constitution was rendered ineffective by those who ordinarily should implement it.
Bankers have always been aware of this legislation but the level of compliance has not been encouraging.
In the 80s, bankers were handed such forms which they completed and submitted.
But as its always the case in the country, the implementation of that provision of the law was more or less abandoned, and it was no longer considered as a fundamental part of the banking profession.
Stakeholders blame the failure of authorities including the CBN, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) and Bankers Committee for certain abnormalities in the industry.
According to them, these regulators rely on the banks they are supposed to supervise, to supply them information.
For instance, they argued that the failed banks episode happened barely some months after the regulators had given those banks clean bills of health.
This suggests that the information supplied by the banks may have been doctored.
Nigeria has been battling with cases of corruption and money laundering, with bankers and bank officials accused of being accomplices.
Some monies have remained redundant in many accounts due to the death of the owners of the accounts, which some bank officials convert to theirs while leaving families of the account owners in penury.
This is in spite of the fact that the banking sector is no stranger to self-regulation, given its tempting, delicate and fragile operating system.
As a matter of fact, the CIBN Act of 2007 has been regulating the banking system.
It has a code of conduct to which bankers agreed with the CBN.
There is a disciplinary tribunal that has the power of the High Court, which ensures that reported infractions, unethical conduct and indiscipline are brought before the tribunal, and sanctions recommended for formal prosecution.
But one of the challenges has been the weak reporting system by bankers, leading to the inability of CIBN to take appropriate actions.
The spirit behimd the Act of 1986 is to make clear, the financial standing of bank employees at the time of employment, and after years of service, in a bid to ascertain that their legitimate earnings are commensurate with their current lifestyles.
This is coming on the heels of allegations that some bankers are direct beneficiaries of fraudulent transactions that are carried out in the bank.
What is common knowledge is the asset declaration by public officers including civil servants, politically exposed persons and those who work in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).
They are required to declare their assets every four years.
For political officeholders, upon their election or appointment, before they assume office, they are supposed to declare their assets at the point of entry and also at the point of exit.
This declaration is done on oath.
In other words, there is execution and attestation before a High Court or some other superior officer of the law.
The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), among others, are already covered by the Code of Conduct Act with regard to the declaration of their assets.
As it stands, financial experts believe that the impression created by the directive to bankers to comply with the pre-existing piece of legislation amounts to stigmatisation and also isolates bank employees, which puts them in the limelight.
In other words, there is the belief that the revisiting of the Act of 1986 encourages the policy of isolation that is causing apprehension in the industry.
There are concerns that the Act may cause enrolment into the banking profession to further go down as a result of stigmatisation.
However, some stakeholders caution against the drama about stigmatisation, arguing that a lot of bankers, from the highest cadre to the lowest level, are living above their means.
According to them, an average banker even from their early point of calling, cuts corners by conniving with customers that want to beat the system.
They insist that for every major corruption, there is a banker that has facilitated the transaction.
It is laudable that the EFCC is trying to use the Act for good reasons.
But the worry is that the banks essentially are not owned by the government per se although the government has shares in them.
Banks are used for saving money
More importantly, there are existing laws that can check illicit enrichment.
Article 20 of the UN Convention Against Corruption is explicit on this.
Section 7 of the EFCC Act empowers EFCC to investigate persons whose lifestyles are not commensurate with their means of income.
It is believed in certain quarters that the assets of this country have been plundered the most by politically exposed persons, many of whom remain untouchable.
As such, EFCC has been accused of not being fair and even-handed in its mandate on tackling public sector corruption including false declaration.
If the banking sector is sanitised, it will have a ripple effect on all other sectors of the economy.
All these measures are taken to strengthen the fight against corruption, and not to stigmatise the banking profession or portray it as the scapegoat withim the system.
Besides, the banking career is not a roguish profession.
Some bankers are at the forefront of exposing some of the mega corruption issues that we have seen the EFCC making headway.
Part of the essence of this law is to ensure that the country is free from financial crimes, and also to block the loopholes being exploited by unscrupulous players
While it is hoped that the Act of 1986 is a sincere attempt at sanitising the system, there should be a platform created to report thresholds of deposits on a daily basis, and the regulators should be able to access it to know the declarations made.
This makes for easy reference to what has been declared as legitimate income to check those living above their means.

Rabbit farming booms in Plateau
The Secretary, Plateau Rabbit Breeders Association, Mr Pam Gyang, says rabbit farming has become popular in the state with many residents engaging in it.
Gyang who said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Jos, said it has become a household business just like poultry farming.
Gyang said that many training outfits involved in the breeding and selling of live rabbits were springing up across the state.
The secretary said that rabbit rearing as a lucrative business could increase an individuals income and impact positively on the economy.
Rabbits are highly fertile and farmers sell according to their weight ranging from N1,800 to N5,000 or even more, he said.
He said that during the lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 families came to the farm to request for rabbits cages and rabbits to startup farms at their backyards.
He said that the high demand for rabbits meat as a result of its numerous health benefits over red meat aroused the interest of many farmers.
Gyang said that rabbit has low mortality rate and required minimal handling, adding that many people invested in rearing them to meet international market standard.
Our rabbit meat had gone as far as London and we still export them whenever they were demanded, â€œhe said.
He also said that farmers could generate resources from the sale of the hide and skin of rabbit for textile industries and its faeces as source of fertilizer.
Aero expands with Abuja-Bauchi flight
Nigeria's oldest airline, Aero Contractors, has concluded an arrangement to commence flights from Abuja to Bauchi four times weekly beginning from Wednesday as part of its route expansion programme.

Farmers raise concerns as CBN suspends Anchor Borrowers loans
Farmers and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector are expressing concern over the suspension of agricultural loans accessed through the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently.
I thought you were running from me
It handles most of the agric loans to farmers by the CBN, especially its popular Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP).
Now, the apex bank has said it suspects fraudulent activities in NIRSAL loans under the ABP and ordered for the suspension of such loans until all previously beneficiaries have paid back.
It is not yet clear if the suspension is on the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme alone or also includes those of Micro finance banks through NIRSAL.
The suspension has grounded loan activities in NIRSAL and farmers are worried that, among others, the timing was wrong, as many of them have already gone far with plans to expand their agricultural production.
A farmer, Remini Femi, who appeared visibly worried said whats happening now is economically threatening and called on the CBN to please step in and save millions of Nigerians to access these loans for agricultural production.
Many farmers waiting for NIRSAL disbursement through their social media handle expressed sadness over the suspension of the loan facility as it threatened to ground their dreams for expansion.
Reacting to the development in a chat with our Agric Editor, the leadership of the All Farmer Association of Nigeria, headed by Architect Kabiru Ibrahim, said though the CBN blames NIRSAL in the non-performance of the ABP, it should do the needful in fishimg out those responsible.
It should continue to provide qualified farmers the much-needed support.
â€œWe urge the CBN to do due diligence in prequalifying farmers who participate in the programme because several cases of briefcase farmers who pose as real farmers abound.
These collude with some NIRSAL officials to defraud the programme.
â€œTimely repayment which is not forthcoming in the ABP is largely due to this fraud.
Anyone who gives bribe to take a loan with an interest component has no desire to repay it.
â€œOur initial understanding of the role of NIRSAL was to primarily incentivize commercial banks to embrace lending for agricultural production but certainly not to prequalify prospective loan seeking companies.
This is how corruption took over and the farmers are now the worse for it.
We call on the CBN to reverse its decision on the disbursement of the ABP support to farmers, he said.
Dr Femi Oke, AFAN chairman, South-west Zone, said the suspension of the NIRSAL loans would greatly impact food production in the country.
Oke, speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Lagos, urged the CBN to investigate the allegations against NIRSAL without undermining the various efforts of farmers toward achieving food security and self-sufficiency.
He called on the CBN to resolve the issues surrounding the suspension of the NIRSAL loans
The AFAN official said many farmers were disappointed by the sudden suspension of the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) and NIRSAL loans, as they provided a lot of support to smallholder farmers.
The CBN recently suspended all loans disbursed by NIRSAL, following widespread allegations of corruption by its officials, NAN also reported.
Whats on your mind
The memo said the decision would only be reversed after all outstanding loans disbursed to farmers through NIRSAL were paid.
According to Oke, â€œwhen we heard about the suspension of NIRSAL loans, we knew immediately that this is not good for the farmers and the sector.
From what we heard, the suspension is based upon the ABP.
We want CBN to lay more emphasis on how it will go about it because some of the farmers have done their interview on NIRSAL loans, while others are awaiting disbursement of the funds.
What will be their fate now?
This is not good and we implore government to look into the issue and address it, he said.
Oke urged the federal government to intervene, in order not to jeopardise the efforts of farmers that have already invested in their farms, and those already waiting for the loans to enable them to prepare for the planting season.
â€œSomethimg needs to be done immediately in order not to jeopardise the effort of the farmers that are still ready to go back to the farm.
Very many farmers, specifically in the South-West, are waiting for the loan and they expect that by now it should have been disbursed.
Very few of our members have been able to access the loan, a very large number have not even gotten access to the interview.
I have also not done the interview myself.
I am still waiting to be selected.
Farmers are not happy about the suspension of the loan,â€ he stressed.
The AFAN chairman said even the NIRSAL selection process had been slow due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that only about 10 per cent of our farmers have benefited from the loan.
We want the federal government to clarify if the suspension is on the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme alone and on the Microfinance bank through NIRSAL,â€ he said.
There is no immediate reaction from the management of NIRSAL over the suspension of the loans as an official, who craved anonymity, said only the CBN can talk on the matter and it has spoken.
Sources at the apex bank said the suspension was to ensure efficiency in the system and assured farmers of the bank's commitment to guarantee food security.
Gunmen break into Italian residence of ex-Manchester star
Armed men in the early hours of Friday held Chris Smalling, a footballer, and his family at gunpoint in their home in Italy.
According to reports, the footballer was inside the house with his model wife and two-year-old son when three masked men barged in and forced him to open the family's safe.
Smalling was forced to hand over his Rolex watch, and other valuables from the safe
The police received a call from Smallings wife , Sam, around 5am,and officers arrived at the familys villa , located 25miles south of Rome.
The police are still investigating the incident and Roma has offered to support the player.
He lives with his wife Sam, a glamour model from Manchester.
The couple have been married since June 2017 and welcomed their first son, Leo, just before they moved to Italian capital
The defender has been playing in Rome since summer in 2019.
Woman stabs 14-year-old boy to death in Bayelsa
A middle-aged woman, said to be mentally deranged has stabbed to death a 14-year-old boy in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state capital.
The victim, identified as Joseph Thomas, was stabbed along Genesis street, off Okaka road of the city at about 7.30am on Tuesday morning.
The incident threw the neighbours into shock which later degenerated into mob action against the suspected woman and nearly beat her to death.
It was gathered that the quick arrival of the Patrol team of the Bayelsa State Police Command rescued the woman from the angry mob who wanted to retaliate the boys death.
Some residents of the community told Daily Trust that the accused woman is believed to be deranged and had attempted to stab another boy few meters away from where she killed the 14-year boy.
Daily Trust leant that the woman had stabbed another boy in the arm along mountain of fire road, Okaka before proceeding to kill her victim.
the Suspectis a gospel preacher
One of the residents of the Genesis streets identified as Panebi said the woman, who is an indigene of Enugu State, is known to preach the gospel of Christ in the early hours of the morning along the Okaka road.
He said: But on this particular day, she was usually carrying a Bible and started displaying strange behaviors by displaying a dagger.
She always chased everyone that come across her.
Until she gets to the victimâ€™s house and broke down the door.
She dragged the boy to the middle of the road and stabbed him three times.
Angry youths on the street started retaliating by attacking her with stones and planks until she fell down.
And police came to her rescue and took her away.â€
The grandmother of the deceased, Madam Modlyn, who narrated the incident said her grandson was in the house when he was accosted and allegedly killed him.
She said: I went to buy somethimg.
I was at the place when someone told me that a mad woman is looking for me and wanted to kill me.
I wondered why a mad woman would be looking for me.
I ran into my neighbors house to seek refuge and avoid the woman.
While at the neighbor's house, I heard noise from neighbours that she had stabbed my grandson to death.
Also speaking, a neighbour to the deceased who preferred anonymity said she was preparing her children for school when the incident occurred.
Rights group doubts plead of insanity
The President of the Do Foundation, a group involved in the civil advocacy against domestic violence and violence against children in the state, Barr.
Dise Sheilla Ogbise, expressed anger against the killing of the 14-year old.
She said: We are interested in this case and it must be further investigated.
A woman just lost her son and relations to the accused woman who had already raised the defence of insanity.
We are not convinced that she is insane.
â€œNo Doctor has confirmed it and there is no evidence backing the claim of insanity.
This is a clear case of murder except proven otherwise.
Let the Bayelsa Police thoroughly investigate the matter
The spokesman of the Bayelsa State Police Command, SP Asinim Butswat, who confirmed the development, said the police authorities have already taken the accused woman to its custody.
Hunger, poverty and the challenge of innovative food storage
If you visit many offices across Nigeria at lunchtime during the months of May, June, July and August, chances are high that you will find a good number of workers munchimg away at mouth
Yes, with corn in season, one of the most popular delicacies at this time is the combination of roasted corn (popularly code-named as mouth organ) and the African pear.
Coconut is an occasional close substitute for pear and this writer has it on good authority that many people find the coconut and mouth-organ combination, just as delicious too.
Outside of those months when both corn and pear are in season, this delicious combination is unavailable.
Interestingly, during those harvest months, enough corn and pear to sustain the country for a substantial period, perhaps even an entire year, may have been harvested.
But with inadequate knowledge and utilisation of modern and cost-effective storage and preservation methods, tonnes of maize and pear end up wasted every year.
The same applies to many other agricultural commodities in Nigeria.
At harvest periods, there is often a surplus, but in the absence of proper storage, a huge proportion of these harvests eventually goes to waste.
These perennial losses pose a huge threat to the economic wellbeing of farmers, the majority of whom operate at the subsistence level.
The challenge, which this problem of poor storage and preservation of food poses to our country, becomes even more haunting when one considers the difficulties with which we are likely to be confronted in the post-COVID era.
It is, therefore, imperative that beyond improving the volumes of our agricultural output, we look critically at how to empower farmers across the country to better manage their harvests.
This will translate to immense economic value not only to the farmers themselves whose livelihoods will be enhanced, but also to the country as a whole, as more food will become more widely available and for extended periods, for consumption and export.
Instructively, a number of research organisations and universities have over the years introduced different solutions to the problem of post-harvest losses.
The innovations that have been developed, being home-grown, are unique because they reflect the realities of our local environment.
Not only are they relatively cheap, as they are also often technically uncomplicated, but farmers can adopt them readily.
In the area of fish farming for instance, there is an innovation known as the iced-fish box with which harvested fish may be stored in order to remain fresh on transportation to the market from the farm or ahead of processing and storage.
In addition, specialised smoking kilns have been developed to replace the labour-intensive, yet inefficient and unhealthy traditional fish smoking methods.
Output from these kilns is good enough for export and is several multiples of what is ordinarily obtainable by traditional fish-smoking methods.
Nigerian researchers have also produced composite packaging material that can be used for packaging such smoked fish or even smoked meat as the case may be, preserving the end-product and boosting its commercial appeal.
Whether it is beans, corn or rice that become discoloured, mouldy, smelly or infested with weevils, grains pose problems of storage for farmers, often leading to considerable financial losses.
In the past, grains exported from Nigeria have also faced rejection because of the unacceptable levels of residual pesticides they contain.
Local researchers have been active in the area of grain preservation, churning out a handful of innovative solutions over the years.
For instance, there are solar dryers that have been developed for different products.
Given the abundance of sunshime in our country and the simplicity of construction of these dryers, they are relatively affordable by the average farmer.
Construction can also be easily replicated in local settings.
Essentially, these solar dryers work to enhance the efficiency of drying of agricultural produce.
They do this by concentrating the rays of the sun on a particular surface, enhancing drying efficiency over the traditional method of spreading grains, cassava and plantain peelings and others, indiscriminately under the sun.
Specially constructed steel drums which when properly shut become airtight (hermetic) and with which farmers can store grains over several months have also been developed by local researchers.
There are specialised storage silos as well, which can help store and preserve grains over many months.
There is in fact, a particular twin silo, which can jointly accommodate up to 100 tonnes of grains at a time.
Local researchers have also developed bio-pesticides as an alternative to chemical pesticides.
Commonly available chemical pesticides though effective against pests are often harmful to man and the environment, too.
Bio-pesticides, on the other hand, are much safer and constitute no environmental hazard.
One of such pesticides (NSPRIDUST), an innovation by the Nigerian Stored Products Research Institute, is made from diatomaceous earth, a powdery form of a naturally occurring rock in Nigeria.
Bio-pesticides will help to make Nigerian grains potentially more acceptable in the export market.
Fruits and vegetables are not left out of the problem of poor preservation and storage in Nigeria.
While we import apples, pears, strawberries and other fruits round-the-clock, there is not much that can be said about Nigerias fruit exports.
Again, Nigeria's researchers have also over time, heralded different solutions to this problem.
There is the specially constructed fruit and vegetable shed for instance, made of simple and locally available raw materials, and which helps farmers to preserve fruits and vegetables for longer.
Then, there is the fruit dryer, which by drying certain fruits helps to preserve them.
Local researchers are working fervently on fruit and vegetable conservation using the principle of evaporative cooling
Evaporative cooling is the cooling that results when water evaporates from a surface.
Incidentally, fruit and vegetable preservation using evaporative cooling is not new, having been practised for decades in traditional settings in Nigeria.
Researchers are now keen to find new ways to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of traditional evaporative cooling systems in order to preserve the shelf life of fruits and vegetables over a longer duration.
For tubers such as yams and potatoes, local researchers have long come up with such products as ventilated yam barns for the storage of yam tubers, diffused-light store for the storage of potatoes, cassava root warehouse for the storage of cassava roots among many others.
There is no doubt that widespread adoption of these technologies by farmers across the country will help to considerably stem the tide of post-harvest losses in Nigeria.
This will, one must repeat, translate to significant economic value not only for the farmers and the wider agricultural value chain but for the entire country as well.
Getting the agricultural value chain to increasingly adopt these innovations will entail patient and systematic engagement.
Farmers cooperatives and associations will be a good medium with which to reach farmers across the country with information and education.
So, is the media and media institutions.
Research institutes and faculties of agriculture in our various universities, being vital hotbeds of innovation, must work more collaboratively in order to jointly share and popularise innovations that are emanating therefrom.
Agricultural chambers of commerce are a potential source of popularising these innovations especially among policymakers and influencers should also be engaged.
The increasing penetration of smartphones across the country also presents an opportunity with which to reach millions of farmers with information and education.

Joblessness forced us into crime Suspects says
A ten-man armed robbery gang arrested for allegedly attacking people in traffic in Lagos have all confessed that they went into crime because of their state of joblessness.
Some of the suspects were arrested along rail-line at Ikeja while others were nabbed from their hideouts based on the confessional statement made by the suspects.
It was learnt that their arrest is a sequel to resolve by the state police command to tackle criminality in the metropolis.
The state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had deployed more men to tackle the increasing cases of traffic robbery in the state.
The Commissioner has rejigged the commands strategies to suppress, raid and arrest hoodlums at the identified areas/hideouts across the state.
One of the suspects, Olamide Johnson, 22, told police interrogators at the command headquarters, Ikeja, that he and members of the gang went into robbery because of their joblessness.
We don't want to wait to die of hunger that was why we embarked on the easy way out, which is robbery.
We never knew that it is not so easy like we thought he said.
Lagos State Police Spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, who spoke on the arrest, said the command regularly arrested traffic robbers for allegedly being involved in acts of terror.
Adejobi said during most of the attacks, the suspects had allegedly dispossessed innocent people of their belongings in the state.
In furtherance of the commands anti-crime measures, the police operatives attached to the Strike Team of the Command, on May 1, 2021, at 2 pm, arrested 11 suspected cultists and traffic robbers who were attacking and dispossessing innocent people of their belongings at Railway Crossing, Ikeja, along, Ikeja-Lagos.
The operatives who responded to a distress call from one of the victims (name withheld), raced to the area and arrested some of the suspects in action while others were arrested at their hideouts.
They have confessed to the crime.
The suspects also revealed that they attack their targets with iron rods, guns, cutlasses and charms during operation.
In the course of the police investigation, the suspects identified one of their receivers as Idris Adamu, 42.
He was immediately arrested at Alade Market, Lagos State.
A gold necklace of one of the victims and many other suspected stolen items like phones, necklaces, watches etc.
, were recovered from him,he said.
He said police operatives were presently interrogating the suspects in order to extract more information on their mode of operations, membership and accomplices so as to apprehend other members of the gang and those who conspired with them in committing the dastardly act in the area and across the state.
The suspects are Sadiq Masaki, 22, Oladimeji Olatunbosun, 24, Adam Hassan, 21, Tunde Afolayan, 24, Michael Ademola, 22, Olamide Johnson, 20, Abiodun Opeyemi, 22, Oluseyi Agbaje, 21, Daniel Ayomide, 20 and Adebayo Tobi, 21.
The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered that the Strike Team should profile the suspects and go after their gang members and conspirators as the command will not spare anyone who engages in any act of criminality, no matter its magnitude,he said.
Adejobi further said that the police boss also directed that the Commander RRS, the Commander Task force and other tactical commanders should sectorise the state for easy operation and get rid of traffic robbers and other criminals in order to accord perfect and excellent service delivery as well as effective security to all and sundry in Lagos State.
Man United-Liverpool game rearranged for 13 May
Manchester Uniteds postponed home Premier League match against Liverpool has been rearranged for 13 May, the league said on Wednesday.
The match was called off on Sunday after United fans protesting against the clubs American owners, the Glazer family, stormed into the stadium which was closed to spectators due to Covid-19 restrictions.
The rescheduling of the game means United must play two games in the space of two days as their home game against Leicester City has been moved forward a day to 11 May.
Liverpools trip to West Bromwich Albion will take place on 16 May as planned.
Leicester blow Champions League chance as Kane signs off with Golden Boot
Leicester blew the chance to qualify for the Champions League for just the second time in the clubs history as the Foxes lost 4-2 to Tottenham on Sunday.
Jamie Vardy twice put Brendan Rodgerss men ahead from the penalty spot.
But Harry Kane, on what could be his final appearance for Spurs, a Kasper Schmeichel own goal and a late double from Gareth Bale secured seventh place in the Premier League for Tottenham and a place in next seasons Europa Conference League.
Leicester spent more days in the Premier League top four than any other club this season, but for the second consecutive year they fell away in the final weeks of the campaign to miss out on the riches and prestige of Champions League football.
Chelseas 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa opened the door for the FA Cup winners to take advantage and move into fourth.
For much of a dramatic afternoon, it looked like Leicester would do just that as Vardy slotted home his first penalty on 18 minutes.
Kane is keen to move on from his boyhood club after Tottenham also missed out on the Champions League for a second straight year.
But the England captain secured the consolation prize of winning the Golden Boot as he slammed home his 23rd Premier League goal of the campaign four minutes before half-time.
Vardy was spot on again seven minutes into the second-half to put Leicester back in pole position to round off a fine season after lifting the FA Cup for the first time in their history last weekend.
Schmeichel was one of the heroes at Wembley eight days ago, but the Danes mistake cost his side dear with a place in the Champions League worth at least a £60 million.
The Leicester captain flapped at a corner to punch the ball into his own net 14 minutes from time.
With the home side then chasing a winner, Bale struck twice in the final 10 minutes to also sign off his loan spell from Real Madrid on a high.
Leicester were furious
Kane was not penalised for handball before he teed up the Welshman to slot into an unguarded goal.
Bale then tapped home his 16th goal of the season after his initial effort came off the post deep into stoppage time.
Gbaja: 1999 Constitution is a product of hurried national consensus
The Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said the recent move to amend the 1999 Constitution is necessary to address its shortcomings.
Gbajabiamila was quoted to have said this in his address at the ongoing zonal public hearing on constitution review in Lagos State.
He said the 1999 Constitution was a product of a hurried national consensus taken to return the country to democracy.
Our constitution falls short of this standard because the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in order to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government,he said.
While noting that it was not the first time the task was taken, he said the present one by the 9th assembly might be the most important constitutional amendment process in the nations recent history because the decisions that would be taken will have far-reaching consequences for the future of Nigeria.
A nations constitution is the foundation of its existence.
It is supposed to set the terms of our nationhood and define who we are in a manner that reflects both our common truths and highest aspirations.
It was always the intention that we will one day as one people and one nation, return to amend this document so that it gives voice to the yearnings of the Nigerian people and sets out in clear details how we intend to achieve the shared ambitions of our nationhood.
Providence has cast upon the 9th National Assembly the responsibility to write such a constitution for the Nigerian people,he said.
2023: Offa backs Kwara gov for second term
Indigenes of Offa LGA of Kwara State on Thursday threw their weight behind the second term bid of Governor Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq.
This is coming a week after the Olofa of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi Esuwoye II, publicly endorsed the governor and months after a similar one by some stakeholders in Kaiama, Kwara North.
According to the indigenes who expressed full support for the monarchs action, the new endorsement was hinged on what they described as the superlative performance of AbdulRazaq in the last two years.
Describing Abdulrazaq as a goal getter, the people said the difference in the development in the state is very clear, compared with what obtained in the past.
Speaking at a town hall meeting, the APC chairman in Offa, Abdullateef Afolayan, said, come 2023, there
s no vacancy in Kwara government house as were determined as a people to return Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for a second term in office.
The meeting had critical stakeholders in the affairs of Offa, including representatives of Olofa, the Chief Imam of Offa, Christian Association of Nigeria
(CAN) and Muslim leaders, youths as well as business community in attendance.
Afolayans declaration was greeted with ecstasy by the Deputy Governor, Kayode Alabi, Special Advisers on Political, Political Communication and Strategy, Gidado Alakawa, Bashir Adigun and Saadu Salau, respectively, who graced the event.
The representative of Olofa, the Asalofa of Offa, Alhaji Isiaka Shittu, said ongoing development efforts in the state by the governor, especially in Offa town should be commended, adding that renovation of the Offa General Hospital, rehabilitation of Offa roads and Offa water works are some of the areas where the governor has impacted on the town.
The women, represented by the market women leader, Alhaja Idiat Yesufu, said the people know the level of development the present administration has achieved since assuming office.
She commended the governor for financial empowerment and support to traders in the state.
She said Offa women supported the endorsement of the governor by the Olofa, because we know how the present administration met Kwara and how it is today.
5 years after: Why Nigeria still cant export beans to Europe
Nigerias hope of importing dry cowpea (beans) to the European Union countries has again been dashed this year.
This is as a result of the extension of an earlier ban on the countrys dry beans by the European Union (EU) subsisting till 2022.
The EU food safety authority had in 2015 banned Nigerian beans because it contained between 0.3mg per kg and 4.6mg per kg of Dichlorvos, a pesticide, when the maximum acceptable residue limit is 0.01 mg per kg.
Dichlorvos is considered to be highly toxic and can cause difficulty in breathing, diarrhoea, vomiting, convulsions and dizziness among others.
Experts say like many organophosphate (OP) insecticides, it also inhibits the enzyme cholinesterase, which results in disruption to the nervous and muscular systems.
Some experts also claimed that some farmers and middlemen use Sniper, another deadly chemical, to preserve their beans.
An independent investigation conducted by this paper last year showed that most of the beans in the country are preserved with chemicals that are dangerous to human health.
A food scientist, Idowu Amusa, listed the consequences of consuming foods preserved with Sniper and other harmful chemicals to include gastro-intestinal health issues, brain and other internal tissue damage, blood poisoning, food poisoning and could also lead to death.
The EU had in 2018 extended the ban on importation of dry beans from Nigeria until June 2019 owing to the continuous presence of the pesticide.
The Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS), the countrys produce regulator, had earlier assured farmers and other stakeholders that the country was working hard to ensure the ban is lifted in 2021.
However, a recent document from the EU has announced an extension of the ban, claiming that Nigeria failed to implement the unions food safety action plan submitted in 2018.
With the extension, beans produced in Nigeria will still not be allowed into any member country of the European Union.
This has been the situation for the past five years.
How it started
In 2015, a consignment of Nigerian beans was rejected under the EU export regulations.
An official of the NAQS told our Agric Editor that upon arrival at Tin Can Island, the NAQS team went to inspect the consignment and it was discovered that some of the containers were already powdery and the rejection was on the premise of chemical residue.
We took our own analysis from there and discovered that aside from the pesticide residue, there was also the presence of pests, which occasioned the powder form of the beans.
He said the agency has been carrying out aggressive campaigns to explain how and the need for farmers, as well as middlemen to preserve their beans with the acceptable chemical level.
The official, who did not want his name in print, said aside from the export problem, consuming such highly preserved beans is dangerous to human and animal health.
Nigeria is losing billions Expert
Mr. Segun Ayeni, an agric economist, yesterday, told Daily Trust that Nigeria is losing billions of naira to the continued ban on the countrys beans since 2015 by the EU.
He said farmers, traders as well as the government could no longer make much money from the beans value chain because of the ban.
All the traders in between, the warehouse people, the transporters and us, who are involved in the inspection and certification, that aspect has been broken down because they cannot generate any revenue along the value chain anymore, he said.
Reactions
The National President of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Kabiru Ibrahim, while reacting to the ban by the EU, said it may not be unconnected with the countrys nonconformity with the Global Good Agricultural Practices protocol.
In the production, we need to deploy good agricultural practices and in the preservation, we should not use large volumes of chemicals that will provide residual contents unacceptable for wholesome foods in Europe.
A general ban by the EU is not very well thought out because there are some farmers already complying with GAP standards.
He added: We are working with some farmers to ensure compliance with GAP.
As the National President of AFAN, I am the chairman of the National Technical Working Group on Global GAP in Nigeria inaugurated in 2017 by then minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.
He said the various exporters, agribusiness groups, Ministry of Trade and Investment, SON, NAFDAC and Quarantine Department have to work together and act in unison to make our produce acceptable globally.
Mr. Idowu Amusa, a food scientist, advised that farmers should grow organic foods only and if they must use pesticides on their farms, they should use only recommended pesticides brands and dosage.
Allow enough time between application of pesticides and use of the food produce and where possible, the food product should be rightly labelled with relevant information on cultivation to consumers, he said.
Tuchel eyes first Chelsea trophy as Leicester chase FA Cup history
Thomas Tuchel plans to ruin Leicesters bid to make history, as the Chelsea manager eyes the first trophy of his reign in Saturdays
FA Cup final at Wembley.
Tuchel has enjoyed a superb run since replacing the sacked Frank Lampard in January.
The German has led Chelsea to the FA Cup and Champions League finals, while taking them back into the Premier Leagues top four.
Winning his maiden silverware in English football would be further evidence of Tuchels impact.
But Leicester, two points above Chelsea in the Premier League, will pose a significant threat to Tuchels ambitions under the astute guidance of boss Brendan Rodgers.
The Foxes are aiming to win the FA Cup for the first time in their first final appearance since 1969.
No club have appeared in more FA Cup finals without lifting the trophy than Leicester, who have lost four times in the showpiece match.
In contrast, Chelsea have won the FA Cup eight times, with their last victory coming against Manchester United in 2018.
The Blues, beaten in last years final against Arsenal, will be making their fourth appearance in the competitions denouement in the last five years.
Having already beaten managerial luminaries Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp, Jose Mourinho, Diego Simeone, Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti since arriving at Chelsea, Tuchel will pit his wits against Rodgers for the first time as Blues boss.
After a frustrating end to his spell at Paris Saint-Germain where he won the French title and reached last seasons
Champions League final before being forced out following a power struggle with sporting director Leonardo Tuchel has quickly erased any doubts about his suitability for Chelsea.
New technologies, researches that may lessen your farming drudgery
For many farmers in Nigeria, the absence of improved technologies to make farming easy and smooth, particularly for the younger generation, has been very challenging.
Despite having 16 agricultural research institutions and four conventional universities of agriculture in the country, research and development has been on the slow pace.
Recently, Daily Trust Spoke with Professor Ishiyaku Mohammed,the Executive Director of the Institute of Agricultural Research(IAR), Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and he
explained some of the newest researches and technologies the institute developed for farmers.
Recent varieties released
In the most recent situation, about 28 different varieties of sorghum were released.
About the same number was released for groundnut varieties.
The institute also released up to 20 varieties of cowpea and 66 different maize varieties, then 13 different varieties of cotton.
They have very important economic attributes that increase the income of farmers and provide a different product for utilisation, either as food, fiber, or for making textile products in the case of cotton, or even for providing oil in the case of groundnut and cotton.
The IAR has also generally awoken the conscience of farmers to the existence of modern agricultural technologies.
Our scientists have, over the years, fabricated machines and tools towards reducing drudgery.
For example, there are hand held planters and tractors.
And we are in the process of perfecting roll weeders because people have been complaining that farmers still use hand held hoes for weeding.
So we have responded by introducing the development of mechanical weeders.
We have threshers for maize, beans, sorghum and groundnut.
Dryers are important when you produce crops when theres still rainfall, so you need to find a place where you would at least dry them.
Drying is also useful in storing products like tomatoes, he stated.
Something new on ginger seed
He continued, The IAR also delved into an emerging area of science called biotechnology.
Our scientists are developing ways of rapidly propagating crops.
For example, right now, we have an order to micro-propagate ginger.
Production of ginger is determined by how much planting material you have, and the planting material is very expensive, so our scientists have developed ways that inside a bottle you can develop from 1 to 2 inches piece of ginger.
You can produce more than 200 plantlets that can be grown in the field.
Right now, we are receiving orders from some farmers who are looking for this.
We do it for sugarcane also.
This technique helps in propagating disease- free crops, sometimes planting materials can be infected by disease.
The more you plant, the more the disease is propagated into others.
But these techniques try to purify the materials to be disease-free.
So it is called tissue cultural techniques, where the crop is planted inside a bottle and made to proliferate.
Each plantlet can now give rise to several plantlets etc.
New technology for bio-fertiliser, irrigation
Technologies as we develop them go through two stages.
The first stage is scientific.
Here, scientists get convinced that these techniques have become a technology or a tool of solving a problem, then it will go to the farmers to test themselves.
Then based on the opinion of the farmers, it can be propagated further.
So in the area of the crop varieties I have counted to you in the last few years, we have released varieties of cowpea that is insect-resistant.
It is called SAMPEA20T for maize; the same year we released six different varieties of maize with yield potentials of 6-8 tonne per hectare and then in 2020.
Three varieties of improved sorghum (sweet sorghum) were released, together with an additional six varieties of maize.
So in the recent times, this is what we have released.
We are about releasing a technology for bio-fertiliser, which is a capsule of some materials that contain some useful microorganisms that can assist in fixing nitrogen, which will benefit the plant in its growth and development as if it had been added with fertiliser.
We have developed improved techniques for irrigation so that it will reduce wastage of water by farmers, he added.
The Guild at 60, inspiring the living, honouring the dead
By Lanre Idowu
Sixty years ago, on Saturday, May 20, 1961, the Nigerian Guild of Editors was born, a child of great hope at the old National Press Club located then at Abibu Oki in the heart of Lagos.
It was named the Guild of Newspaper Editors of Nigeria, designed to serve as an exclusive club of professional news managers where editors as the ultimate gatekeepers on media content could come together seasonally to interrogate issues of professional media practice unfettered by labour matters.
The editors had been effectively sidelined from the Nigeria Union of Journalists, which predated the Guild by six years, on account that as management staff, they could not be trusted to effectively represent the interests of the rank and file journalists.
So in response to the reverse discrimination of the NUJ, the need to instill professional guidance, and protect their interests in light of the unfolding socio-political developments in the early days of independent Nigeria, the Guild emerged to occupy the strategic middle ground of professional managers between owners and the general rank of journalists.
Lateef Jakande (1929-2021) of the Nigerian Tribune was its first founding president.
His cabinet had the likes of Babatunde Jose (1925-2008) of the Daily Times as the vice president, Abiodun Aloba (1921-2001) of the Morning Post as the secretary, and Nelson Ottah of the Drum as the assistant secretary.
The Guild was established to advance the interests of the profession, deepen editors relationships with their various publics ranging from the media itself, to governments, professional and trade associations and other groups that make up civil society.
It was to be a proactive agent of development to anticipate problems and tackle them, and clarify issues before they got out of hand.
The promise of its birth was soon tested by the crisis that erupted in the early life of the First Republic.
A good number of the editors became casualties of the cat-and-mouse politics of the era.
Jakande was tried alongside Chief Obafemi Awolowo for Treasonable Felony and was jailed in 1963.
That same year, Jose was appointed managing director of the Daily Times, and had become, technically, ineligible to continue on the executive of the Guild as only defacto editors could hold executive office.
By that time also, Aloba was fighting for his job as the Post was enmeshed in a probe into its finances.
With the leadership of the Guild challenged on several fronts, the Guild soon lost direction and could not serve as a moral compass.
The Guild was to undergo a name change to accommodate the electronic media, which added to its problems of identity in subsequent years.
The Guild soldiered on under military rule, 1966-1979, playing an active role in the struggle for press freedom and enhanced respectability for journalism and journalists.
In the light of its membership expansion, and the introduction of assorted job titles, the Guild has continued to grapple with the question of who is an editor.
This issue featured in the crisis that attended the Minna convention of 1982.
Along with capitulation to partisan political interests of the day arising from creeping geopolitical and sectional interests into the affairs of the Guild, the Guild slid into the doldrums for six years before it was resuscitated in 1988.
The membership question resurfaced in 2008 and 2017.

Ripples in Ogun over LG polls nomination form charges
Stakeholders Thursday kicked against nomination form charges for aspirants in the July 24 local government election in Ogun State.
The chairman of the state electoral body, Babatunde Osibodu, had on Tuesday announced N200,000 and N100,000 as charges for chairmanship and councillorship aspirants forms respectively.
Osibodu also announced a nomination form fee waiver for female candidates contesting in the election.
Reacting, the State Chairman of New Nigeria Peoples Party, Oginni Olaposi, described the charges as fraud.
The NNPP also accused Governor Dapo Abiodun of downplaying the principle of democracy by changing the free, fair and credible election to another thing.
Also speaking, an Egba-born politician and philanthropist, Olumide Aderinokun, described the nomination form charges as barbaric, and warned the government against turning the election into revenue generation.
The Action Alliance (AA) Chairman, Sanyaolu Abayomi, threatened that the party might sue the commission if it went ahead with the election.
Abayomi who spoke after the stakeholders meeting said the commission erred in not allowing at least four political parties to make their input before and during the stakeholders meeting on the forthcoming election.
He said: We do not agree with the time given that 30 days ultimatum.
Because, I think in the timetable that was released earlier, they gave us 90 days, and thats what we want to challenge today.
It is clear to us now that there is one power somewhere
that is overall power controlling them.
But, if they want to be fair with all the political parties, and want local government elections to be free and fair, they should listen to us, guide the date they gave us, and go along with the constitution that guides OGSIEC.
If they dont do that, we wont mind going to court with them.
Meanwhile, Governor Abiodun has promised that the local government elections slated for July 24, would not be skewed in favour of the ruling party.
Abiodun told the party leaders that he would not share political positions among men and women who are party faithful during the elections, but promote equal participation, noting that leaders of the ruling party in the state must show that they are products of democracy.
We must be consistent; we must show that we have learnt from other peoples lessons and that we are the product of democracy.
We have done primaries when somebody else did not want primaries.
We subjected ourselves to the party process; we evolved through that process which was later confirmed by the general elections despite all odds.
Let us make sure that whatever process we adopt is democratic, we must be seen as true progressive democrats.
When it comes to a process like this, what we need to do is to encourage our women to participate, to come forward and participate, we will vote for them.
But we are not going to share it and say because you are a woman, you take this.
No, that will be undemocratic.
We are not going to do that, there will be fairness,he stated.

The Commissioner of Police Imo, CP Abutu Yaro, has directed a discreet investigation into the matter as tactical and special forces have been deployed to cordon the area and arrest perpetrators,the statement said.
Taming Nigerias oil spillage and gas flaring scourge
By Jerome-Mario Utomi
The recent news report that the Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) discharged some 213 barrels of crude oil into the Ikarama community in Bayelsa, has again brought to our consciousness that though Nigeria prides itself as the giant of Africa and the most populous black nation in the world, yet, it is still riddled with third world challenges.
Essentially, while clarifying that an estimated 1.34 hectares of land was polluted by the leakage, which followed a rupture on the pipeline, SPDC among other things confirmed that probe into the incident had been concluded, noting that out of the 213 barrels of SPDCs bonny light crude stream leak, some 110 barrels are recoverable from the ongoing recovery exercise at the site, leaving an estimated spilled volume at 109.12 barrels.
Admittedly, these claims by the Dutch oil giant are verifiable facts but may not be the only explanation.
Their clarification notwithstanding, there are indeed reasons that qualify such happening in Nigerias oil and gas industry as a reality that demands holistic analysis.
Lets begin with reality.
Aside from the awareness that spillage occurs, communal rights to a clean environment and access to clean water supplies are violated in such cases and the oil industry, by its admission, has abandoned thousands of polluted sites in the region, which needs to be identified and studied in details while communities adversely affected are adequately compensated for their losses, this latest spill is coming weeks after a similar one from a ruptured pipeline facility managed by one of the International Oil Companies operating in the Niger Delta that reportedly ravaged Benikrukru and adjourning communities in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.
And another in the early hours of Sunday, March 14, 2021, at Polobubo/Opuama Communities, Warri North Local Government Area of the state, could settle.
Such litany of spillages also include but not limited to, namely; the historic large scale spillages in places such as the Ogoni Land, Rivers State and the Erovie community in Ozoro, Isoko North Local Government of Delta State 1990s, both in the Nigerias South South geopolitical zones, of which their negative impacts linger.
Are these the only explanations/examples?
The answer is a definite
no, as there exist yet
other critical reasons/concerns why we should view the situation as a crisis.
First and very fundamental is the inability of Nigeria and Nigerians to appreciate and treat crude oil spillage and environmental pollution resulting from exploration/crude oil production related activities as a national calamity.
The second is the stunning consciousness that gas flaring/environmental degradation resulting from crude oil prospecting/production-related activities in the country is under reported.
This second concern stems from a recent comment, which according to media report was credited to the Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who stated that findings by his agency showed that an average of five oil spills was recorded daily in Nigeria.
Musa, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said, In 2018 we had about 600 oil spill incidents and in 2019, we had over 700 oil spill-impacted sites across the country.
This wakeful comment becomes even more relevant to the present discourse when one remembers that Nigeria according to reports is dotted with about 139 gas flare locations spread across the Niger Delta both in onshore and offshore oil fields where gas which constitutes about 11 percent of the total gas produced are flared.
More than anything else, it brings to mind the questions as to; what exactly impedes the development of the petroleum sector and Niger Delta region?
Are there no legislative works?
Why is such a legislative framework not providing a strong source of remedy for individuals and communities negatively affected by oil exploration and production in the coastal communities?
If these frameworks exist, why is it not effective and enforceable?
Is the framework as comprehensive as a legal solution to the issues of oil-related violations?
Why has the nation not learned a valid lesson from the Dutch government where all operators are required to restore their areas of operation back to how nature intended?
Regardless of what others may say, the truth is that if as a nation we are desirous of developing policies that will engineer prosperity in the oil and gas sectors while saving the people of the region, then, we must be ready to locate the strategic triangles that hold the key to success.
Separate from the fact that success requires a careful analysis of the various kinds of knowledge needed to make innovation possible, the need for the nation to straddle the middle ground has become necessary since both the ministry and sector have for a very long time manifested signs of an institution with neither primed nor positioned potentials.
And as we know, any organisation, be it private or public that fails to search for its potentials leaves its survival to chance.
At this instant, looking at both the operational templates of the ministry and how the up, mid and the downstream players of the petroleum industry have become reputed for non-compliance to set rules, it will not be a wrong assertion to conclude that the critical factors fueling crude oil spillage/gas flaring can be divided into the following; the existence of multiple but obsolete regulatory framework, which characterises the oil and gas exploration and production in Nigeria; federal governments failure to get the nations refineries back to full refining capacity; the petroleum ministrys inability to get committed to making International Oil Companies(IOCs) adhere strictly to the international best practices as it relates to their operational environment; And finally, non-existence of clear responsibility/work details and action plans for agencies and parastatals functioning under the ministry.
The above failures have as a direct consequence; cast a long dark shadow on the ministry, the sector and the region.
To explain these points beginning with the first challenge, it is worth commenting that the business of crude oil exploration and issues of oil production in the country is regulated by multiple but very weak laws and Acts of which most of these laws not only complicate enforcement but are curiously too old-fashioned for the changing demands of time thereby, creating loopholes for operators, especially the International Oil Companies (IOC) to exploit both the government and host communities.
Some of these laws/Acts in question that have been in operation since the 1960s but currently not achieving their purpose includes but not limited to; the Petroleum Act of 1969, The Harmful Waste(Special Criminal Positions etc), Act 1988, Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963, Petroleum(Drilling and Production) Regulation 1969
(Subsidiary Legislation to the Petroleum Act) and the off-shore Oil Revenue (Registration of Grants)Act 1971 among others.
Without minding their number, concepts, provisions and definitions, these laws have become obsolete, old-schooled and out-fashioned to the extent that they now provide leeway for the operators in the sector to exploit both the government and host communities.

Cult clashes: Man arrested over killing of cousin in Edo
Operatives of the Edo State Police Command have arrested a man identified as Igboje Victor, for allegedly taking part in the killing of his cousin brother during a rival cult fight.
Igboje was among the 54 suspects paraded by the Edo State Police Commissioner, Philip Aliyu Ogbadu, for involving in various crimes in the state.
According to the commissioner, the suspects were arrested for armed robbery, kidnapping, murder, cultism, rape among others.
The incident, it was learnt, happened in Sabogida-Ora Opuje community Owan West local government of Edo State.
Im innocent
In an interview with Daily Trust, Igboje denied involvement in the killing.
I was not involved in the killing of my brother but was arrested because I am a member of Eiye cult group while my late brother is in Aiye group.
In our community, we used to sell Indian Hemp to make money but the Aiye group used the drug business to arrest Eiye members through the police.
The leader of both group scheduled a meeting at night to resolve the issue,he said.
He however added that, on the day of the meeting, Aiye members laid an ambush and shot at Eiye members while on their way to the venue of the meeting, killing one of them who was later taken to the mortuary.
The brother of the deceased, who is a military officer, said they should go and bury the boy because of his mother
After the burial, I went to the neighbouring community to buy food but when I returned, I learnt that Eiye members had gone to attack an Aiye member who happened to be my cousin and he died as a result of the injury he sustained.
He said he was not among the group that attacked his brother, adding because we belong to rival cult groups, they said I was the one that killed him
and I was arrested by police alongside others.
I was not even there when my brother was attacked.
I didnt kill my brother,he said.
The commissioner of police, however, said the suspects would be charged to court as soon as the investigation is completed.
Economic woes deepen as bakers hike bread, biscuits prices by 30%
Nigeria's economic woe worsens as most food item doubled in price over the weekend and the bikers decided to grace us with their 30% increase too on every item made with flour
The economic hardship in the country has taken a new dimension as the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria (AMBCN) has directed its members to increase the prices of bread, biscuits and other baked items by 30 percent due to the rising cost of production.
Bread and biscuits are common consumable items in many Nigerian households and before the association gave this directive, many had lamented the sharp increase in cost of items across the country.
At the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the association held in Abuja recently, members lamented the cost of production and reached the resolution of raising prices.
The national president of AMBCN, Mansur Umar, said the price adjustment was as a result of the sudden increase in the cost of production as well as prices of sugar, butter, yeast and flour.
While commending the federal government for resuscitating the cassava flour programme, the association bemoaned the skyrocketing price of regular flour in the last six months with one truck of flour which cost less than N6 million is now N9m.
After considering the impact of the skyrocketed prices of baking ingredients/materials for the survival of our noble business, which is presently bleeding, the association came to the conclusion to adjust our prices by 30 percent,he said.
The association also resolved to ask the federal government to reverse the tariff regime imposed by the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and to streamline bakers regulation by NAFDAC only.
Also speaking, the national secretary, Jude Okafor, was hopeful that the federal government will meet their demands to avert the increase.

The 2021 Tokyo Olympics bound team will hope to go a step further than their 2017 achievement where they won the silver medal.
The team who lost to host-Tunisia had since evolved to become number one in Africa and number 22 in the world.
DTigers in 2019 became the first country in the world to qualify for the FIBA World Cup.
Despite narrowly missing out of the quarter finals, the team were able to punch their Olympics ticket as the highest ranked team out of Africa at the tournament.
Illicit drugs: NDLEA uncovers N30bn slush funds
NDLEA hardworks pays off: The depth of illicit drugs trafficking and usage is uncovered in Nigeria as NDLEA has uncovered N30bn slush funds and drugs worth over N90bn
The chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Buba Marwa, says the NDLEA is currently investigating N30bn slush funds believed to be proceeds of drugs.
He disclosed this in Abuja on Monday while giving commendation letters to 45 outstanding officers as well as best performing commands award for the months of March and April, 2021.
He said the agencys offensive action would not stop until the nations streets, communities, towns and cities had been cleaned up of any remnant of illicit drugs.
He said: While we keep up the offensive in the field, the leadership of the agency will daily continue to work out effective strategies and tactics to sustain the momentum.
That is why weve strengthened our Directorate of Assets and Financial Investigations to go after all assets or funds linked to drug trafficking which had led to interim and final forfeiture orders on assets and funds worth billions of naira linked to drug traffickers and barons.
Marwa said the vigour with which the agency was targeting drug cartels had led to the seizure of 2,050,766.33kg of assorted illicit drugs and cash worth over N90bn as well as arrest of 2,175 drug traffickers.
He stressed the need to deny criminal elements all benefits of their proceeds of crime in addition to sending them to jail.
Vigilantes arrest 2 kidnappers in Zaria
The matter of Kidnapping in Zaria and the country as a whole is now turning to a nightmare
Two suspected kidnappers have been arrested by vigilantes at the Low-Cost area of Zaria in Kaduna State, Daily Trust reports.
The incident occurred around 10 pm on Sunday when an unspecified number of kidnappers stormed the low-cost in an attempt to kidnap the residents but were confronted by the local vigilantes.

Kaduna State Police Command spokesman ASP Mohammed Jalige said the two arrested suspects were undergoing interrogation while their fleeing accomplices were being trailed by the police.
Interrogating IPOBs Emma Powerful threat to spill blood
IPOB leader has threatened to turn the country to a zone riddled with bloodbath for people that don't see reason with him
The threat to murder in cold-blood by one Emma Powerful, media and publicity secretary of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) of any Igbo who neglects his warning is certainly going too far and should not be ignored, except we have finally descended into anarchy, where the powerful as the little fascist, Mr. Emma Powerful as he called himself can drag people out for merely disagreeing with him or his organization and have them dispatched to their ancestor as he boasted.
He did not seem to boast empty; as the mayhem that is enveloping the South East region of Nigeria is obviously orchestrated.
Bereft of the understandingg of the simple Igbo leadership etiquette, where a leader is Onye-oje ozi,or servant of his people who builds consensus through extensive consultation, the Emma Powerful who prefer a thuggish title of Onye-ike,whose basic instrument is coercion, intimidation and now threat to murder the same Ndigbo, who he claim to champion their cause.
For a man so intolerant and wired to effortlessly shed blood to advance his cause, the question is who would really want to live in a Cave Republic run by bloody thugs.
The historical Biafra was not a choice made by Ndigbo; it was rather the only available option forced on Ndigbo at the time at a particular time in history, which they braved out with enormous heroism and sacrifice to defend and uphold.
Biafra was not so much rebellion as it was a resistance to affirm the right of a people not only to exist but to live in dignity.
The historical Biafra was a line of safety drawn so that all of the Igbo people then, brutally persecuted who crossed into, can live in relative safety.
The declaration and the struggle of the historical Biafra was not a show piece or a profit-making enterprise for which the current purveyors are curiously engaged in.
Prior to the declaration of Biafra in 1967, the Eastern consultative assembly, a formidable representative and consultative body of all shades of opinions in the eastern region, given the circumstances of the time unanimously agreed and gave their authority to the declaration.
And that was why the war to defend the young republic was a widely shared enterprise of Ndigbo and even other non-Igbo ethnic nationalities in the region, who made unforgettable sacrifices.
Even as the war ended, with the collapse of Biafra, and national reconciliation, Ndigbo returned to project Nigeria without malice and with considerable determination and courage, to enable it work.
The context of contemporary Nigerias crises and deepening fissures is on account of a neo-capitalist state hobbled by the backwardness and fetter of the productive forces, shackled and unable to reproduce the material basis for its existence.
As the contemporary Nigerias state grows hollow and enters a melting point of atrophy and lethargy, the basic units consisting of ethnic nationalities and other civic, cultural and religious entities struggle for a space of self-preservation, expression and recreation.
In the overall, it is easier to brandish a secessionist flag, without an iota of understandingg of the critical socio-economic infrastructure on which a viable state can be constructed.
Africas newest state, South Sudan is still tragically in the intensive care unit, leaving the larger number of her population in worse condition than the earlier condition before a brand new state was created.
There is nothing to indicate that the current loud canvasser of Biafra has any insight into what a state establishment and construction is all about.
Even as the independent state, the yearn for are not in insight, the authoritarian and fascist streak of its purveyors like the threat of the Emma powerful that whoever disagrees with him would be dispatched to meet his ancestors are already evident.
Ndigbo is quite sophisticated to be led by thugs and touts, who lack the simple understandingg that Igbo political culture and framework is basically consultative.
The little dictator Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, who does not know any village in Igboland, besides his own, claims the leadership of Igbo nation as entitlement, a people, whose lives he hardly understood, except for the inflow of donations from its diaspora.
The media and publicity secretary, Mr. Emma, the Powerful through arrogance and petty fascist impunity has done more damage to the Igbo basic framework of consultation and consensus.
Only a thuggish organization issues threats of murder and destruction to those who disagree with it.
But this latest threat issued by Mr. Emma, de powerful to dispatch to ancestors; Ndigbo who refused to fall in line with him, is going too far.
I can only imagine what the men who lowered down the Union Jack to hoist up in its place hope symbolized in Green-White-Green drapery that early morning of October 1st 1960 felt.
It must have been something like the overwhelming dream logic of the marines who planted the American flag on Okinawa in 1945.
Oftentimes, I dream about being one of them.
I would fantasize being one of them and then going home after the ceremony basking in the apotheotic glow of freedom and the blank canvass placed before my very own means.
I would go to bed, to nirvana, and wait for the morning so I can wake up and go to work.
It is now sixty years since then.
Even though I am only 30 years, I have lived in the nightmare of Nigerian history for every single year in this sixty-year journey and I have felt every disillusionment, every anguish that is to be felt over the failure of my country.
It has been sixty years nowâ€¦ and all my dreams have left me some have died, of the ravishing drought that followed in this abundantly watered land.
Others have flown out.
What happened to us?
I remember an artwork I saw on the internet reading something about the so-called Age of Discovery.
In it, a man stood over another man was ostensibly sitting up from a hammock.
This was supposed to be a representation of Amerigo Vespucci rousing the eponymous American continent to join the league of mankindas the last continent.
Growing up, my brothers and I did all the house chores during school holidays.
I also remember pretending to fall back to sleep after Subh to avoid doing my own share of the chores and my brothers would bring fire and fury to my bed until I am on my feet, lest I shortchange them.
Unlike America, Africa has always been known since the dawn of timeâ€¦ indeed, she was the first to awaken, she was the one who woke up the rest yet remains the most unknown member of the family maybe because she went back to sleep, and slept while her siblings worked to discover fire and invent the wheel.
People like Joseph Conrad thus called her the Dark Continent.
Since then, Africa has had no favourable popular culture recognition beside the gory, putrid, wretched-of-the-earth stereotype that was enough to make a couple of American teenage band from the 80s felt compelled by moral duty to bless down the rains to quench her ravishing drought
otherwise she would die.
It did not get any more primeval than that all she needed was rain, nature, the same thing their own Neolithic progenitors needed to survive.
Was that what happened?
Did we sneak back to bed, after rousing the rest of the world?
And did we yet again find our way back to sleep after being roused a second time?
Who knew it would get so bad that Africa, together with Nigeria, would need to rely on charity from a couple of teenagers who probably did not even yet know their left from their right hands?
Not I.
Was Conrad right?
Do I have a duty to moral rectitude to surrender to truth, to his profile of my kind?
Do I fly out like the rest of my dreams?
Maybe I should.
How did we get here?
We boarded a car with an engine, sound and sleek, that revved to life like the Ark of Noah as we set out in 1960.
We should be on a rocket ship today heading to Mars, instead we have sunken into the mud, in a jalopy with a pitiful whimper for an engine.
Before my own gnashing eyes, the heart of darkness did become my home and my home became the other world the antithesis of civilization, a place where mans vaunted intelligence and refinement are finally mocked by triumphant bestiality.
I had resisted Conrad for so long but as the sun has set and I am tired of fighting.
I was ready to surrender; my situation resembled that of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce native American tribe when he was subdued.
I have read somewhere his sermon to this people after he had surrendered and could not help mouthing them to myself:
Our chiefs are killed.
Looking Glass is dead.
Toohoolhoolzote is dead.
The old men are all dead.
It is the young men who say, Yes or No.
He who led the young men [Olikut] is dead.
It is cold and we have no blankets.
The little children are freezing to death.
My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food.
No one knows where they are perhaps freezing to death.
I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find.
Maybe I shall find them among the dead.
Hear me, my chiefs!
I am tired.
My heart is sick and sad.
From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.
I had made up my mind to surrender with terms as dictated by my foes.
I had decided to follow our dreams where they have been exiled to.
I will join the mile-long queue at the American or British or Canadian embassies and fly away.
About three weeks after 1st October 2020 as I drove up from Dape, a ghetto settlement in Gwarimpa, I noticed something.
Green-White-Green.
But in the middle where the two green meadows yielded to the white valley, three words sang a melody that would have meant utterly nothing to me before the breaking of the world:
Now, who the hell put that there?
I was so heavy laden and to think that I would see this here of all places!
This was a place with people who have a lot more face-value reasons than I to despair and this fact threw me off balance.
An epiphany was before my eyes.
I could fly away and mooch off the sweat of others.
I could surrender and fight no more and my life would be that of consummate comfort.
But here I am, and I can see that I will not stand alone
should I choose to stand.
I could fly away, live and then die.
But here, before me, in the land of my ancestors, was the prospect of immortality.
Here I can actually live a life full of event and excitement, of building and breaking; breaking records and barriers that have never been broken elsewhere and defeating despair.
Where else can anyone defeat despair so completely than in the Heart of Darkness?
Maybe I will die trying, but how can a man die better than by facing odds so fearful as the ones before me?
We dont have to build skyscrapers, or nuclear power stations or maglev trains we will build the next best thing, and maybe Conrad will be the one wanting a piece of those.
He has reached saturation, but we are only at ten percent.
We can rise and rise until lambs become lions and by the time the sun sets on my generation, I would be a fulfilled man.
I will endure the long March and then maybe reap from it too.
If not, I will still be a fulfilled man on my deathbed someday.
Nothing beats being fulfilled on your deathbed.
So then, here are my new terms of surrender: none.
We fight on.

Officer who sneaked drugs, phones into prison nabbed in Kano
Operatives of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) have nabbed one of their officers who reportedly sneaked in over 4.8kg of cannabis sativa and eight Android phones into the correctional facility in Kano.
There was an uproar at the correctional centre on Thursday after the prison wardens detected and seized the cannabis allegedly brought to some inmates on death row at Kurmawa prison.
The seizure, according to reports led to resistance and the uproar from the inmates, while authorities promised to investigate how the illicit drugs got into the facility.
The spokesperson of the NCoS in Kano state, Musbahu Lawal Kofar Nassarawa, confirmed to Daily Trust that one of their staff (name withheld) was nabbed for colluding with other dealers outside to sneak the seized items into the prison.
He said, We have arrested one of our staff who connived with these people to bring in 4.8kgs of cannabis and eight android phones to some inmates on death row, and that was why we had uproar on Thursday after our operatives have seized it.
This staff who works in the facility was recruited just two years ago in 2019.
We have already handed him over to National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for further action.
He will be arraigned before court, and if he is found guilty, he can be suspended.
We will find out for how long this has been happening and whether there are other people involved in similar scandal, Kofar Nassarawa said.
He added that the service will continue to work hard to detect similar practices in the facility.
Daily Trust recalled that in 2020, a woman was arrested for sneaking a phone to another prisoner on death row.
Similarly, another woman was apprehended with cannabis concealed in a carton of instant noodles.
Centre lauds INEC for creating gender, inclusivity depts
The Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for its re-organisation that led to the creation of the Gender and Inclusivity Department (GID)
that hitherto was a unit in the commission.
The Executive Director of the centre, Faith Ossai Nwadishi, in a statement, expressed joy that INEC was poised to reposition itself bearing in mind the realities of today and the need to promote inclusiveness in its operations.
She also noted that in this new arrangement, INEC created two departments out of the present Department of Legal Services, Clearance and Complaints (LSC&CC) and that the new departments are Department of Litigation and Prosecution (DL&P) and Department of Legal Drafting and Clearance (LDCD).
She said the centre agrees and supports INEC in the review and realignment of some of its departments for improved effectiveness and efficient management of its human resources and assets.
6 NIPP plants, 22 new substations added to power grid in 6 years Report
Generation Companies (GenCos) and 22 power substations built and operated between 2015 and now, have significantly driven improvement on the national electricity grid to the 5,800 megawatts (MW) highest peak energy recorded in March 2021.
This is according to the latest NIPP report on power projects execution since 2015, obtained from the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) by Daily Trust.
The NIPP is an intervention vehicle warehoused in NDPHC and owned by the federal, state and local governments.
In 2015, the power grid hovered between 4,500 megawatts (MW) enabled by the commissioning and utilisation of the Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunsogo, Alaoji, Calabar and Ihovbor NIPP GenCos
that added nearly 1,000MW to the grid.
However, the grid continued to rise with all-time peak electricity reaching 5,801.60MW as of March 2021, according to the statistics from the Independent System Operations (ISO) arm of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).
NDPHC started the NIPP intervention with the first phase in power generation.
It began to build 10 power GenCos known as the 'The Big Ten' around gas-producing states including Ondo, Ogun, and Kogi states.
However, until 2015, some of them were still ongoing.
The second phase was then launched from 2015 to include intervention projects focusing on transmission, distribution, and renewable energy towards meeting NDPHC mandate of Lighting the Nation.
Currently, there are six power GenCos producing about 3,400MW electricity in the national grid while the four other GenCos are ongoing.
Even among the four, some of its turbines have been commissioned and operational since 2015.
Analysis of the report indicates that the NIPP intervention in the transmission section of the power sector value chain, NDPHC has completed 22 substations comprising 10 units of 330/132 kilovolts (kV) level and 12 units of 132/33kV substations.
It has also completed 2,194 kilometres of 330kV power transmission line and 887km of 132kV transmission lines.
These infrastructures since 2015, have added 5,590MVA energy supply capacity at the 330kV level and 3,793MVA at the 132kV level.
To promote renewable and clean energy, the NIPP in the second phase became a major driver of the federal government's energy mix by 2030 known as Vision 30-30-30) which seeks to make renewable energy to be at least 30 per cent of the energy grid by 2030.
While it has installed 20,000 Solar Home Systems (SHS) in some northern states, the NIPP is delivering a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to households nationwide under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP).
There is also intervention in the gas sector towards solving the major challenges of the power plants which is the availability of gas-to-power.
According to the Managing Director of NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, in an interview with Daily Trust, the company is achieving this through the Fuel & Gas/Public Private Partnership (PPP) model.
It created a department for this to spearhead its gas pipelines and feed stock connecting all the 10 NIPP GenCos.
In terms of power distribution, the report said the NIPP intervention has seen the completion of over 360 NIPP injection substations with a combined capacity of about 3,540MW.
To complement these substations, NDPHC has also built about 2,600km of 11kV power distribution lines and 4600km of 33kV distribution lines which directly supply electricity to transformers in residential areas.
There have also been 296 Appropriated Distribution Projects, which included injection substations, 1924 of 33kV lines, 4600km of 11kV line and other infrastructure.
NDPHC has also increased its distribution capacity with the installation of 25,900 Completely Self-Protected (CSP) transformers across the country, added Mr Ugbo.
In spite of these achievements that have helped to improve the national grid operations, the report highlighted threats to the infrastructure especially at the power distribution level.
Some of the challenges NDPHC has met in distribution include theft of equipment and infrastructure, vandalism, lack of cooperation from Distribution Companies (DisCos).
The others are community issues regarding land and Right of Way (ROIs), vehicular accidents that have damaged some power infrastructure and the rising insecurity across facility areas, it stated
In a comment to evaluate the viability of the NIPP interventions to Nigerian electricity consumers, the President, Nigeria Consumer Protection Network (NCPN), Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo, said the essence of the power sector privatization exercise concluded in November 2013 was to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by private sector drivers.
He however said despite this, the sector has not attained such viability, and so there was the need for the government to deepen the interventions through NIPP.
In spite of all the tremendous milestone achievements by NIPP/NDPHC, there are major areas of impediments on the full realisation of the lofty ideals of NIPP as championed by the management of NDPHC.
Mr Olubiyo said some of these challenges include the delay in taking over projects by the DisCos which should be captured in their Capital Expenditure (CAPEX).
He also said the delay in the implementation of the Eligible Customers regulation by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was a hindrance.
With the huge power assets that NIPP has provided, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and other dedicated power users can decide to connect to the NIPP plants and facilities directly and enjoy uninterrupted power supply, but this is being delayed.
Another challenge for the NDPHC is funding, which according to him, should be raised by the equity stakeholders (federal, state and local governments) for more power sector projects.
The leadership of the power sector will also need to address the low tariff for NIPP Plants and the low load (energy) dispatch of the available units from TCN.
Consumers are looking for more electricity, why should energy from NIPP GenCos be restricted?
Olubiyo queried.
Unlike elsewhere, Ramadan season in Nigeria has unfortunately been turned into a season of unnecessary controversy.
Starting from the recurrent controversy over the advent of the Ramadan crescent that ushers in the month and the exit of its moon that marks its end,
the Ramadan period equally witnesses controversy over ideological, jurisprudential or political stances expressed by some Ulama in the course of their Quranic tafseer sessions.
Yet, over the past couple of years, there has been unnecessary controversy over which charitable deed between sponsoring the broadcast of Quranic tafseer and charitable mass feeding for the needy is more worthwhile in Ramadan.
As in other Muslim societies, Ramadan usually inspires a phenomenal rise in individual and societal spirituality in Nigeria where many wealthy individuals sponsor live or recorded broadcasts of Quranic tafseer by various Ulama.
Many others also spend more on charitable mass feeding for the poor.
However, while almost, if not all, who sponsor the broadcast of tafseer do also spend on charitable feeding, not all who spend on charitable feeding sponsor the broadcast of tafseer.
During Ramadan in a typical northern Nigerian city, television and radio stations make a killing with the sale of airtime for tafseer and other religious lectures sponsored by individuals, firms and groups.
From the sheer number of sponsored broadcasts of tafseer and other religious lectures on the more than 10 radio stations in Kano, for instance, one may wonder whether they do other programmes in Ramadan.
Now, while sponsoring tafseer broadcast is absolutely worthwhile, especially during Ramadan, the amount of resources spent in this regard might be disproportionate considering the desperate need for food that the largely hunger-stricken audiences are languishing in.
After all, given the choice, they would certainly choose food handouts over such sponsored broadcasts as public tafseer sessions are everywhere during Ramadan for one to choose which to attend.
Besides, looking at the underlying dynamics and politics of sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, one cannot rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interests as some of the motives behind sponsoring the broadcast of some tafseer and other religious lectures.
Interestingly, while some sponsors compete in sponsoring the broadcast of tafseer by some prominent Ulama, some Ulama sponsor the broadcast of their own tafseer in the absence of a willing sponsor; others even beg for sponsors to sponsor theirs.
Also, as the contents of some tafseer and other religious lectures feature some serious flaws, sponsoring their broadcast is a gross misplacement of priority.
Equally interesting, others sponsor the broadcast of Adhan (Kiran Sallah) in a city like Kano
where, thanks to the sheer proliferation of mosques, regular Adhan reaches every nook and cranny.
Anyway, while Ikhlas is always the most fundamental yardstick that determines the worthwhileness or otherwise of both charitable feeding and the sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer broadcast, striking an appropriate balance between the two guarantees the perfect outcome.
Because as much as Ramadan is the month of the Quran when Muslims are expected to be particularly committed to it in terms of reading, learning its meanings and living accordingly,
it's equally the month of generous charity when Muslims, particularly the wealthy, are expected to do much more in terms of charitable works especially mass feeding.
However, while that's simply the bottom line, which also explains why the controversy is absolutely unnecessary, the so-called liberal Muslims have blown it out of proportion.
Capitalizing on public frustration amid the unbearable hunger ravaging the largest segment of the society, they question the worthwhileness and relevance of sponsoring the broadcast of Ramadan tafseer under the prevailing circumstances.
Also, feigning empathy and concern, they address the two charitable works as though mutually exclusive and thus people should choose between them.
Unsurprisingly, and under the pressure of the hard conditions, many people, including many otherwise discerning folks, fell for that propaganda not realising its context, which is the raging face-off between the so-called liberal Muslims, on the one hand, who are hell-bent on undermining Islamic and moral values in the society, and the wholehearted Muslims, on the other, especially the Ulama among them who are committed to encouraging people to never neglect their religious commitments in pursuit of their legitimate worldly pursuits.
Also, contrary to their claim, such so-called liberal Muslims aren't actually disturbed by the plight of the vulnerable, which explains why they never urge those spending huge resources on other things, no matter how absolutely worthless, to divert the resources to charitable courses.
Likewise, they never urge that the massive amounts of resources their elite role models spend on maintaining their extravagant lifestyles should be diverted to the feeding of the poor or sheltering them.
Instead, their conscience comes alive only when the resources are meant for, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daawah etc.
Federers conqueror amazed by dream day at the office
After wrecking Roger Federers return to the tennis courts, Pablo Andujar said it was the sweetest moment of a lengthy career.
The Spaniard beat Federer 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 on the Geneva clay on Tuesday to overturn the Swiss tennis greats hopes of stringing a run of matches together ahead of a series of major tournaments the French Open, Wimbledon and the Tokyo Olympics.
At match point on Tuesday, Andujar, the world number 75, held his head in his hands in disbelief after beating the 20-time Grand Slam champion.

Memories of Nigeria's colours in black and white (III)
Sometime after that, and after I had two popular cartoon strips in the now-defunct newspaper called The Democrat, and got my first four rejection letters from Marvel Comics, I somehow remained a young man full of hope.
Nigeria, even with monumental ups and downs, still allowed me to dream, to be an artist or writer at the worlds foremost pop culture company in another country, on another continent.
Fast-forward to 2002, one day as I was setting out to the post office in the city centre to drop off my latest art samples to Marvel's Submissions Editor, I couldn't get a bus.
Loads of people were walking on foot, while some gathered in clusters, with worried looks on their faces.
A bit weirded out, I walked back home, only to hear that riots had broken out.
Again, many lives were lost, and families and friends were torn apart as a move by Christians to Kaduna South, and Muslims to Kaduna North from the South, began.
My Kaduna, my Nigeria, really was falling apart.
A small consolation was that some Christian friends who stayed in certain areas, like my mine, felt safe and didn't move.
So, while the violence raged in other parts, my friends and I would play soccer on the street, and exchange VHS tapes, and bootleg VCDs.
The concept of hating someone because of his ethnicity or religion, frankly, seemed incredulous to us.
But a fellow teen, who had moved to my neighbourhood a couple of years earlier, would provide me with my first, bare-faced encounter with bigotry.
Assuming we somehow were all Muslim, playing soccer, this new guy made a clear call for us to go and attack the infidels who lived down the road.
We all looked at each other most comically, with puzzled expressions, after which we burst into laughter, then sternly told him to get lost.
As if that wasn't bad enough, my heartbreak would worsen with the appearance of labels and slurs from both sides.
My perfect Kaduna was now in smoking ruins, and close-knit families and bosom friends would part ways, not because they stopped loving each other, but because it was the safest thing to do.
After that end of innocence, I faced university with cautious optimism.
Many old friends were there, as Zaria was a stones throw from Kaduna, figuratively speaking.
Many new friendships were begun as well, many of them remaining till today, some even stronger.
The best part of that part, is that none of those friendships, new or old, are coloured by religion or ethnicity.
It seemed to some us who noticed, that the Kaduna we knew, loved, and lost, wasn't really gone.
It couldn't be gone, for the simple reason that it actually resided in our hearts, and so was hard to kill.
The almost two decades I spent as a journalist after all that, showed me things which many cannot even begin to experience in a whole, robust lifetime.
I had front row seats to riots, violent attacks, concerts by superstars, movie premieres, and all kinds of generation-defining moments.
I also got to regularly interview some of the biggest newsmakers in Nigeria, during moments when they had the most chutzpah, or none at all.
It was a Nigeria without social justice warriors, virtue-signalers, outrage-peddlers, or cancel culture-purveyors.
It was a Nigeria that, while flawed, still reminded me of my Kaduna of old, even if it wasn't a mirror image.
But a body can only take so much for such a long time.
On the bed, I looked around my old room once more, everything just as I left it pre-Coronavirus lockdown.
I smiled to myself, as I had at that moment decided on my next steps.
I twirled the rubber band round the stack of photos twice, and put them back into the longbox.
Maybe one day I will look at the other ones, the colour photos, which carry relatively more recent memories.
Maybe I won't.
One thing remains clear: It is my mother, and my father, and the relationships they had or didn't have with me, that made me the kind of kid
I was to the other kids who knew me, as well as the man I grew up to be, to those who know me.
But I find it unsettling, and relieving mostly relieving that in my stack of black and white photos, I have realized that while my head guides the kind of person I have become, it is my heart that has kept me Nigerian all these years.
42 Niger communities under Boko Haram control Senator Musa.
The Senator representing Niger East in the National Assembly, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has said that about 42 communities in Niger State have fallen under Boko Haram control.
Some 5,000 villagers have been displayed in the last three days.
This is coming a day after Niger State governor, Sani Bello, raised the alarm that the insurgents have hoisted their flag in some communities.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday while moving a motion on the killings in Shiroro, Munya and Rafi local government areas of Niger State, Senator Musa said over 475 persons had been killed by bandits and terrorists in Niger East between January 2020 to date.
The lawmaker expressed worry that for almost seven years now Niger East Senatorial District of Niger State have come under constant and sustained multiple deadly attacks by heartless, venomous and hydraheaded Boko Haram terrorists.
The result has been total collapse of the local economies of the affected victims, total collapse of educational system in the affected areas, famine due to collapse of agricultural activities, displacement as a result of desertion of crisis prone areas, depopulation as a result of wanton deaths, among others.
He said the attacks are taking place in the absence of the slightest hindrance, resistance or confrontation from authorities.
They have kidnapped many and their wives seized from them and forcefully attached to Boko Haram members.
Three military camps in Allawa, Bassa and Zagzaga in the two local government areas have been sacked and some security personnel killed by the insurgents in the last one month of renewed attacks.
I can authoritatively confirm that the Boko Haram terrorist have mounted their flags in many of the villages they have captured such as Kaure, Alawa and Magami.
Inhabitants of these war-torn parts of the State have been abandoned and left to their fate thereby compelling them to wallow in perpetual agony and abject misery.
Furthermore at this moment primary schools in Gwada, Kuta, Pandogari and Minna have hurriedly been turned to IDP camps following the sacking of nearly 5600 villagers from their ancestral homes in Shiroro, Rafi and Munya local government areas in the last few weeks by bandits who raided the towns and villages.
And what this means is that if they can launch attacks without hindrance in Niger East Senatorial District
then I don't see how we can be safe in Abuja anymore.
He said between March 2021 to date same terrorists have killed more than 25 gallant soldiers, mobile policemen and other security personnel, while more than 16 civilians were killed, many others unaccounted for.
If this menace is not drastically addressed, the attacks will continue and the danger is that it may escalate further to other communities.
which are mostly farming communities and they are farmers, may desert their farms this season and this will negatively affect the food sufficiency and economic diversification policy of the Federal Government,he added.
My sojourn in Adamawa State
Working with the government at any level offers innovators like me the chance to bring more impact and transformation than we ordinarily would in our fields.
I strongly believe that the government, as an institution, is the greatest vehicle for systemic change and positive transformation one could ever find.
Therefore, whenever I come across opportunities to work with any government body, whether locally or internationally, I am immediately struck with great excitement because it represents a great opportunity for me to learn from and contribute to the civil service in fields that are exciting and transformative to people beyond what my usual entrepreneurial endeavours entail.
One of my recent sojourns of such nature is to Adamawa State, which is fascinating for me because of its diversity, resilience and outstanding potential.
I began actively working in Adamawa State a few years ago, with the international organisation, OXFAM, on a project in line with European Union's support to food security and resilience in northern Nigeria where we deployed a mobile solution to integrating the agricultural value chain.
We worked with field officers representing Fufore, Guyuk, Mubi South and Song Local Government Areas in Adamawa State to enhance their agricultural and agribusiness practices with technology.
However, my return to Adamawa State last year was towards a grander and even more exciting task.
It involved a preposition to work with the state government to transform the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Development and Poverty Alleviation as well as the Wealth Creation Agency (PAWECA) with the general aim of reducing poverty and sustainably improving prosperity especially for the teeming young people in the State.
For some context, I was incredibly delighted to learn that the state government had established the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Development to help lay focus on entrepreneurship and technical skill acquisition.
Having been non-existent until the Government of Ahmadu Umar Fintiri's administration established it, the ministry has become a key pillar of the administration's strategies towards economic development in the state.
The role of these institutions is as salient as it is needed in Adamawa State, with its fair share of youth unemployment, security and other challenges.
It is, however, very evident that the Adamawa State Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Development, as well as the Poverty Alleviation and Wealth Creation Agency (PAWECA), can be adequately utilised in transforming the local economy, boosting youth entrepreneurship and drastically reducing unemployment in the state.
But like most government institutions, this requires disciplined and dedicated efforts to achieve.
Typically, where they exist, complex internal organisational challenges shackle the growth and efficiency of these types of institutions.
To understand this conundrum, I spoke with Adamawa State's Secretary to the State Government, Malam Bashiru Ahmad, who is not only passionate about the issue but remarkably informed about local and global efforts around it and as such uniquely positioned to help chart a way for solving it.
He reiterated Governor Fintiri's commitment to solving youth unemployment and enhancing the local economy by boosting entrepreneurship.
Malam Bashiru also expressed his ideas and understanding around reforming and improving the capacity of ministries and agencies of government, arguing that the desired transformation can only be possible by enhancing the culture of innovation, embracing the use of technology, and improving internal processes and procedures so that effective service and programme delivery can be achieved.
This is because the challenges that most public and even private institutions seek to solve continue to generate demands that can only be met by technologically savvy, innovation-driven, forward-thinking, and efficient institutions.
In the course of the weeks to follow after this encounter, I also met the Commissioner of the Ministry of Entrepreneurship, and Youth Development, Ilya James, and the head of the Poverty Alleviation and Wealth Creation Agency (PAWECA), Hajiya Aisha Bawa Bello, to examine what they have and lay grounds for developing initiatives based on global best practices.
We are to establish an organisational culture that is efficient and result-driven and equip the ministry and agency to become innovation-driven through the use of technology.
In a demonstrable, result-oriented way we would also initiate human-centred design thinking among staff and optimise internal processes to ensure quality service delivery.
Lastly, we will offer tools for the adequate monitoring and measuring of organisational performance of the ministry and agency.
These will go hand in hand with already existing as well as newly-hatched programs and campaigns of the two institutions.
Governor Fintiri's administration, by its sheer resolve and commitment towards capacity development in partnership with various global and indeed local partners like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Nigerian Content Development Board (NCDB), upgrading of vocational and fabrication centres like the Vocational Technical Training Centers (VTTC) after years of utter neglect, strengthening the technical departments of polytechnics and universities in the state and declaring free education in the stateâ€™s public schools including enrolling 38,000 Almajiri children back to school, I think will create a tremendous explosion of buried talent and potential that will certainly be instrumental to the development of the entire Northeastern region with all its peculiar social challenges.
I am also quite inspired by Governor Fintiri's obsession with local content participation policies in all projects and programmes, which is evident in the governor's drive for local content participation in the NEDC Rapid Response projects coupled with being the key galvaniser and pivot of the North East Governor's forum.
As I landed this week in Yola, the state capital of Adamawa, amidst all these aspirations for the great Fombina, as the region is historically referred to, I was beset with a renewed melancholy at the loss of one of the greatest sons of Adamawa, and Nigeria's foremost public servant and academic, Dr. Mahmud Tukur, who in his lifetime had epitomised a brand of active patriotism hinged on developing capacities of people and promoting values at all cost.
May Allah grant him great rewards and enable us to fulfill his dreams and aspiration for Nigeria as a whole.
Sinner sets up Nadal clash in Rome second round
Jannik Sinner booked a second-round showdown with nine-time champion Rafael Nadal at the Italian Open after a 6-2, 6-4 win over Frenchman Ugo Humbert on Monday.
The Italian teenager will face the 20-time Grand Slam winner for the second time, having impressed against Nadal in last years
French Open quarter-finals despite losing in straight sets.
Nadal has a 9-2 record on clay this season but was beaten in the last eight at both previous Masters events, in Monte Carlo and Madrid.
Aslan Karatsev matched Sinner with his 20th win of the season.
The Russian beat Miomir Kecmanovic 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in the opening round.
Nigerians angry as Governors mull N408/litre fuel price
Nigerians have expressed anger over the proposal of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) committee on fuel subsidy, to push for the full deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector that will leave petrol price at N408.5 per litre.
At a virtual meeting on Wednesday, the committee chaired by Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai in a report, recommended a Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise called petrol price of between N408.5 per litre and N380 per litre while calling for the immediate removal of fuel subsidy.
El-Rufai said the current subsidy regime was unsustainable, and only smugglers and illegal marketers benefit from it.
He also said Nigeria could not fully benefit from the recent production cut by Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was meant to keep fuel prices high, because of subsidies.
Between N70 billion and N210bn is estimated to be spent every month to keep gasoline price at N162 per litre, this is below the cost price and the remittance to the federation account will shrink to less than N50bn per month or even zero if threats persist, he said.
The committee recommends PMS pump price increment from the current N162per litre to N408.5 per litre
Reacting to this on Thursday, Nigerians across the states unleashed their anger on the governors.
In Anambra state, a civil servant, Mr. Uzoma Okeke said the proposal was unthinkable given the state of the nationâ€™s economy.
A bus driver, Michael Okafor said he was already struggling to buy petrol at N170/litre in the state.
In Jos, Plateau State, Malam Nura Alhassan, a tailor, expressed dismay over the development.
If the proposal becomes reality, the poor in this country will suffer a lot because whatever figure is increased, the effect will fall on the ordinary Nigerian.
More persons reacted to this in Kaduna, Port Harcourt, Abeokuta, Jos and Kano.
For instance, in Kano, Buhari Abba Rano, 36, said, With this level of insecurity around Nigerian governors are busy commissioning fake projects and loitering around Abuja and overnight agitating for complete deregulation.
This this shows that our crude oil has become useless and they don't care about the lives of the common man.
Fatima Baba Kura said: I believe this proposed price will set back the country to a worse state than it is.
In Lagos, many Nigerians expressed shock over the proposed fuel price increment from the governors who are supposed to defend their people.
A student, Miss Onyekachi Emeka said the price increase would trigger a hike in transportation fare.
Across Akwa Ibom, Abia and Edo states, the residents corroborated the views of other Nigerians as they described the proposal as unfair to the Nigerian populace who have already had enough of the inflation rate, high cost of food and fuel and the deteriorating security situation.
Discard proposal, experts, union tell FG
Experts who reacted to this development have urged the federal government to discard the governors proposal in the best interest of Nigerians.
A petrol industry commentator, Siraju Oyewale said arbitrary fixing of fuel price is antithetical to the principle of deregulation.
I have a problem with people sitting down and fixing prices of petrol.
That is not deregulation.
That is still price regulation.
Politicians, or even government agencies fixing prices is antithetical to the principle of deregulation.
Although he supports deregulation, Oyewale said the price would initially rise above the current price but not up to N380.
Oyewale also said Nigeria must refine its crude oil locally to tackle the rising petrol import cost by NNPC.
An Abuja based economic expert, Samson Simon Galadima said selling petrol at more than twice the current price would further exacerbate inflationary pressure, hence, impoverishing Nigerians even more as purchasing power is diminished.
Galadima said a lasting solution to Nigeria's fuel price instability will be a deeply diversified energy-mix because our overdependence on petrol is quite unhealthy.
President of the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Chinedu Okoronkwo said it was wrong for the NGF to fix fuel price.
He said full deregulation would encourage more local and foreign investors to invest in the sector and grow the economy but that the governor's proposal should not be honoured.
Only FG can tell us how much to sell fuel NNPC
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said it will not go with the proposal by NGF that a litre of petrol should be sold at N380.
NNPC's spokesman Dr Kennie Obateru who disclosed this to Daily Trust on Thursday said fuel price as it is now is a policy issue and only the federal government could direct the corporation to sell at specific price.
We are still waiting for the conclusion of the ongoing meeting between the organised labour and the Federal Government.
It is after the outcome of the meeting that we can say the price can be announced.
NNPC said the NGF only made a proposal which could be accepted or discarded by the federal government.
PDP govs lack moral standing to demand for restructuring APC chieftain
A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman has said governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lack the moral standing to demand for executive bill and restructuring of the country.
PDP governors had a few days ago after their meeting in Ibadan, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the countrys Constitution to devolve more powers to the states among others.
But reacting in a statement yesterday, the PGF Director General said there was nothing new in the resolutions as progressive governors in line with recommendations contained in the APC Committee on True Federalism, have already taken a position on the matter and since communicated it to the top echelon of the National Assembly.
Having mismanaged opportunities to initiate all the recommendations being proposed by the PDP governors between 1999 and 2015, how can anybody in PDP claim any moral standing to demand for any executive bill?
If the issue is as simple as getting the President to transmit executive bill, what stops all the PDP Presidents from initiating it for sixteen years?
Lightning kills 18 elephants in India
A herd of 18 wild Asiatic elephants were found dead in India's eastern state of Assam, possibly because of a massive lightning strike, local officials said on Friday.
Fourteen adult elephants were found dead by villagers on Thursday.
Another four bodies were found scattered on the foothills of the Kundoli reserve forest area of Assam, 160 kilometres from the state capital of Dispur, local wildlife official, M.K Yadava, told Reuters.
The state government ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident on Friday, Assam's Forest and Wildlife Minister, Parimal Suklabaidya, said.
A preliminary report suggests the deaths could be due to lightning although we need to find out through forensic tests if there could be any other reason like poisoning or disease, the minister added.
Locals, who found the elephants, said the animals could have been killed by a lightning strike late on Wednesday, a local forest ranger said, adding that he had seen burnt trees in the area.
The ranger declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
A former deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, faulted the appointment of Major- General Farouk Yahaya as the Chief of Army Staff.
Frank, in a statement in Abuja, noted that President Muhammadu Buhari's penchant to elevate junior officers in the security establishments to superintendent over their seniors was against the much-cherished military tradition of seniority and subordination.
He said the elevation of Yahaya above his seniors was a direct hit against the military, which will see senior, capable officers being purged through compulsory retirement as seen in the past.
The development, he said, was capable of breeding widespread distrust, discontent, disloyalty, low morale and lack of motivation in the military and other security agencies.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed excitement over the recent appointment of Ahmed Mustapha Habib as the new Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
The appointment was announced earlier by the presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu.
In a congratulatory letter signed by the National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, the ruling party thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for considering the new appointee worthy of the position.
I write to convey the felicitation of the National Chairman Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), H.E (Hon)
This particular appointment is a demonstration of reward for party loyalty and recognition of selfless service to the country, attributes which clearly describe your persona.
We trust in your capacity to acquit yourself creditably well in your new assignment.
The party is quite appreciative of this gesture of Mr President and wishes you the very best in this endeavour, APC said.
The new NEMA boss has extensive experience that spanned about 25 years across various sectors, he sits on the Board of various corporate, political and youth organisations, and was the national chairman of Progressive People's Alliance between 2010 and 2011.
An active player in the organisational and policy drives of the APC government, Habib was a member of the Presidential Campaign Council in 2019 and national chairman of the National Committee of Buhari Support Groups since 2015, and also the vice-chairman of the federal government-run State Selection Committee on the Extended Special Public Works Programme in Jigawa State.
Abia gov rejects IPOB's strategy, demands apology over war crimes against Igbos
The Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu has explained why he differed with the strategy of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) secession and violence strategy.
He spoke on Friday when he visited the digital pan-African news network, the TOS TV network, led by Ms. Osasu Igbinedion in Abuja.
The governor who faulted the strategy being deployed by the IPOB led by self-exiled Nnamdi Kanu, however noted that the Ndigbo has not been fairly treated in the country.
According to him, the destructive strategy of IPOB was a recipe for the breakdown of law and order in the South East geopolitical zone.
Listing other reasons for differing with IPOB, the governor said, But some of us do not agree with his (Nnamdi Kanu) style because I do not understand where he is going, when he intends to pull the brakes and when it is going to stop.
If I have a way of conveying my view to the leadership of the group what I will say is they should find the way to enter into conversation and let people know.
I don't understand their strategy and purpose.
I don't understand why they are attacking institutions of civil rule.
A lot of people who are apologetic to some of these strategies don't even know they are riding the tigers tail.
If the police and military withdraw and then brigands become enforcers of the law and order, if you have a quarrel with your brother, how do you resolve it?
While demanding a national apology for the treatment meted to the Igbos during the nation's three-year civil war, Governor Ikpeazu said, Our national orientation should be willing to say sorry.
No person can be right 100 percent all the days of his life.
Even in dealing with our children if we do things that are not right, we should have the courage to stoop low and say sorry but to create a utopian aura that all is well is either nothing is wrong
or I have done it, what can you do?
Who is going to tell us what happened during the civil way, who did what and why?
Why can't some people come and tell us we are very sorry for what we did?
You can't sweep certain things under the carpet.
The tension is palpable and this is the time for us to open up as those who love the country.
I speak this way because I spent seven years in the University of Maiduguri.
I have gone through all part of northern Nigeria
and I understand this country.
I feel sad that the strings that hold us together are gradually giving way.
The NYSC has collapsed.
We have to call a spade a spade no matter whose ox is formed.
Some of the issues raised by Nnamdi were issues of injustice, marginalisation, inequality whether it is gender, generational whatever.
Any particular arm of the society excluded in any way has a right to feel cheated or unwanted.
So, some of those things Nnamdi says are valid.
Some of us can see it.
We cannot continue to run away from the facts.
The Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) has accused the FCT police command of harassment and intimidation.
The group which protested over the continued detention of its leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky at Wuse Market, Abuja, yesterday, alleged that the police threw teargas and shot at the protesters.
A statement signed by Abdullahi Musa, on behalf of the Academic Forum of the IMN, said the police harassed so many innocent people including passers-by, mostly women while attempting to disperse the protesters.
We came out as usual on the streets of Abuja calling on the Nigerian authorities to respect the rule of law and free our leader unconditionally and also remind the general public that in 2015 within 48hrs over 1000 of his followers were mercilessly killed by the officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army as they officially launched attack on him in his own residence, killing almost every soul in the house and setting their corpses ablaze.
Musa added that the protest started around 3:00pm peacefully from Sky Memorial but just as they were to disperse at Wuse Market, the police arrived and started shooting teargas and life ammunition on the peaceful and unarmed protesters.
The police harassed so many innocent people including passeraby mostly women and they removed their hijabs,he further said.
Reacting, the FCT police command spokesperson, ASP Maryam Yusuf, said the group disturbed public peace with their protest.
NAPTIP arraigns suspect, reunites 5 trafficked children with parents
The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has arraigned one Musa Abdulrahman in court over kidnapping of five children.
NAPTIP, at a press briefing at the weekend, said Abdulrahman, a 32-year-old man, allegedly abducted the children aged four to seven and sold them to unsuspecting women in different parts of the country under the guise of adoption.
The Director General, Mrs. Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, while handing over the children to their parents said, the suspect issued the would be parents adoption papers purportedly from the Niger State Government.
He was caught red handed whem he was helping his clients fill adoption application forms, she said.
She warned parents to guard their children to avoid incidences of kidnapping, trafficking and other crimes against humanity, adding that they should not expose them to criminally mind people.
She said the surveillance followed an intelligence report that Abdulrahman kidnapped children from Niger State and sold them to in different parts of the country.
The DG also said the intelligence report revealed that the suspect had been doing that claiming to be a staff of the Ministry of Social Development of Niger State in charge of adoption matters.
She said Abdulrahman confessed that he collected the sum of N100,000 for each of the children.
The parents have lauded the federal government and NAPTIP management for rescuing their children and promised to take adequate care of them.
Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have warned the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) against witch-hunting its party officials.
The governors were responding to the invitation of three officials of the party by the antigraft agency over alleged misappropriation of N10 billion, which the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) had already denied.
The forum, in a statement by its Director-General, Hon CID Maduabum, said the invitation of the officials overa spurious petition by a disgruntled former member of PDP raised questions on the seriousness and impartiality of the anti-graft agency to do its work.
The statement read: While PDP as a political party is accountable to its members and the general public for its actions, we are, however, concerned that the old tactics of using the EFCC to silence political opposition is creeping into our polity once again.
We had expected that the EFCC under new leadership will learn from the mistakes of its predecessors.
It is a misplaced priority for EFCC to abandon revelations of monumental fraud by various officials and agencies of the Federal Government to pursue the PDP which is the main opposition party doing a yeoman's job of preventing the descent into chaos and anarchy in Nigeria.
Perhaps certain interests in government are worried about the increasingly assertive role the PDP is playing in calling out corruption in government and wants to weaken and silence it.
Even the petition in question did not make a single allegation of misuse of government funds, or cheating of any individual or public authority by the PDP.
It is surprising that EFCC wants to use its scarce human and other resources to begin investigation into PDP finances.
If EFCC are even-handed and they are non-partisan, they ought to conduct investigation into other political parties including APC, the ruling party
PDP is up to date in making financial returns as required by the Constitution to INEC
and we are not aware that INEC made any complaints to EFCC on PDP's returns.
We face existential threats as a nation and PDP shouldn't be distracted from its main role as a political watchdog on behalf of Nigerians.
The Senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, has lamented that children are the hardest hit of the countrys recurring economic and security challenges.
In a Children's Day message, Sani noted that children have been subjected to unbelievable deprivations due to the insecurity bedeviling many communities.
Some of them are stuck in Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camps.
Their education has suffered.
Most of them have little or no access to healthcare.
There is no recreation for them.
The girls are sometimes subjected to abuses.
They live in fear of the unknown.
Let us therefore reflect on our childrens loss of innocence and our duties and obligations as leaders and as a people.
Most of them died due to lack of health care.
The economic impact of COVID-19 on their parents affected children in a very negative way.
Quality of their feeding dropped and some of them were withdrawn from schools, he said.
The lawmaker therefore called for effective implementation of policies and programmes aimed at providing quality education and healthcare to children.
Investment in our children is investment in the future of our country.
We must not fail in this regard, he added.
What fuels an insurgency?
If a clump of uninformed people has an ideology they can die for, they will do the illogical for it.
The intercourse of ideology and ignorance does not follow logic.
(murder) is considered the most deadly sin in Igbo land.
Cultists and street lords have assumed control of interest areas in the region.
But what changed?
It is also popularly assumed that the Igbo are natively non-belligerent and that they cannot in any circumstances resort to taking innocent lives violently.
Really, the Igbo are a peaceful people, but recent events in the south-east have cast a doubt on this assumption.
All the regions in the country are marginalised as regards the equitable distribution of resources to the people.
To put it clearly, every region is marginalised.
But a more factual statement will be all Nigerians at the bottom rung of the social ladder are marginalised.
Nigerians are victims of the carnivory of the elite.
It does not matter whether they come from the north or the south.
We are all victims of elite conspiracy regardless of where we come from.
It is agonising that the scions of the south-east are turning their region into Aleppo in Syria.
Who brings violence and war to his own home?
As of 2019, the south-east was reputed to be the safest region in Nigeria.
It was also buoyant and fared well on the development index.
All of that is tumbling down.
The killing of police officers some of them Igbo the targeting of northern residents; the destruction of property and arsoning of police stations are tragedies that should have never been allowed to happen.
This cancer was fed and allowed to metastasise.
The Igbo nourished this beast that is now gnawing at their groin.
When the serial murder of police officers began, some applauded the effort of their killers on the inscrutable assumption that the police are in cahoots with criminals to destroy Igbo land.
Now, the destruction of the region is not by the hands of some herdsmen or bandits, but by the might of the sons of the land.
How is irony defined?
Igbo citizens who hold contrary opinions to the group sentiments are threatened with violence.
The Igbo have never been known to be herded or conscripted into a tyranny of opinions and actions.
The Igbo are known to be republican; open to robust arguments and subjecting every thought to scrutiny.
But what changed?
The killing of police officers in the south-east has been unmitigated and security agencies appear to have left the people to their own fate.
Armed robberies have returned at scale.
There are lamentations everywhere.
A lady shared an experience of how a mechanic she paid upfront to fix her car in Anambra absconded with the money and automobile, and even threatened her while bragging,there is no more police in the south-east.
Cultists and street lords have assumed control of interest areas in the region.
There is fear and chaos everywhere.
Life has become nasty, brutish and short in a once peaceful region.
As a matter of fact, we are on a familiar path albeit a treacherous one.
The signs are ominous.
A Nigerian born in 2000 can tell how Boko Haram started in the north-east.
Security agents and formations are often the first to be targeted by militant groups.
When they are taken out, the people become defenceless and a new order of violence by armed gangs reigns.
Security operatives are being killed and security facilities destroyed in the south-east now.
After the security scaffold is decimated, innocent residents and even those gloating over the revelry of blood may become the next victims.
Already, there are displaced persons living in IDP camps in parts of Ebonyi state displaced as a result of internecine clashes among communities.
And with the prevailing savagery by the secessionist group, there is bound to be more refugee problems in the south-east if the attacks persist.
Where does that leave a people whose preoccupation is buying and selling?
We cannot end this barbarity if we do not agree.
If some choose to keep native sympathies for those taking innocent lives, how then can the bloodletting stop?
It is all in our hands.
Marwa meets IGP, says Buhari demanded mopping up of illicit drugs
President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to mop up all illicit drugs and substances in the country to make Nigeria a drug-safe haven.
Mohammed Buba Marwa (Retd) said on Wednesday in Abuja when he hosted the acting Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman.
This is as he urged the police to hand over confiscated drugs and suspects arrested in connection with drug trafficking to the NDLEA for prosecution as it does not fall within Police jurisdiction.
He also said that within three months, the agency seized over two million kgs of assorted drugs valued at N80bn.
According to him, the agency had arrested 2,100 criminals associated with the illicit trade and have secured over 350 convictions so far.
So far, we know that about 15 million Nigerians use drug, it is a very high number and working on the mandate given to us by the President to mop up all illicit substances and make Nigeria a drug-safe haven, the NDLEA has remained upstanding by radiating up our activities.
Within three months, we have been able to seize over 2 million kilogrammes of assorted drugs.
We have seized these drugs to the value of N80bn, we have arrested 2,100 criminals associated with this illicit trade and have secured over 350 convictions so far.
We are still counting by the grace of God.
Some of our police officers get involved in seizures of drugs which is quite okay.
But they should hand over to NDLEA after that.
A few actually proceed with prosecuting those cases, they ought not since it is NDLEA's charge, Marwa said.
While seeking the collaboration of the police in the next phase of flushing out drug barons, he expressed optimism that more of these barons are going to come into the agency's net.
We believe the NPF will support us with intelligence tracking, these are probabilities that the NPF has.
We will ask for slots in the Police institutes so that we will be beneficiaries.
We should appoint liaison officers between us to ensure definite contact.
We need renewed collaboration between us because the use of drugs is now confirmed as a major precursor to criminal activities in Nigeria.
This is really the time for more collaboration,â€ Marwa said.
Speaking earlier, the acting IGP recalled that he was Borno State Police Public Relations Officer at the time
Marwa was Military Administrator.
Experience is the best teacher, you have been in the business of crime prevention and control.
We are here to declare to you my unalloyed cooperation and collaboration.
We are going to collaborate and synergize with the agency in order to police this country.
Behind every crime, there is always the issue of drugs.
If we synergize, cooperate and collaborate, it would be very beneficial to Nigerians and law enforcement as a whole, Usman said.
My victory ended godfatherism in Edo Obaseki
Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said his victory at the Supreme Court signals an end to godfatherism in the state.
The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the certificate forgery suit filed against Obaseki by the APC, thereby affirming his victory in the September 19, 2020 governorship election in the state.
Addressing party supporters at the Benin airport yesterday, Obaseki said his victory also meant freedom for Edo people.
For us in Edo, this victory means freedom and emancipation; it means that we must rededicate ourselves to our people because democracy is all about the people.
Democracy is not about an individual or godfather.
We have defeated the godfather finally in Edo, in our quest to take Edo to where it should be,he said.
According to him, they have gone through many hurdles in the last two or three years in the effort to reposition the politics of the state.
On the congratulatory messages by the candidate of the APC, Osagie Ize-Iyamu and a former national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole to him, Obaseki said he was yet to receive original copies of the letters signed by the duo.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday said it will convert the 3,148 Voting Points (VPs) in Kano State to full-fledged Polling Units (PUs).
He said the decision was to help decongest PUs and to give voters a healthy environment to exercise their civic responsibilities during elections.
Prof Shehu said, There are over five million registered voters in Kano State, with 8,074 PUs and 3,148 VPs.
If approved, Kano will now have a total of 11,222 PUs.
INEC has created Voting Points, Baby Polling Units and Voting Polling Settlements in PUs with more than 500 voters, but that has still not solved the hardships voters face on election days, he said.
The INEC REC said all the new PUs would be stationed in public places, adding that none will be situated in individual residences, palaces, houses of politicians or places of worship.
Okoye said, The last time INEC created new PUs was in 1996 when we had only 50 million registered voters.
But, as of 2019, the number has exponentially grown to over 84 million.
He, however, clarified that the exercise is not in any way going to add any number to registered voters in each state.
The INEC Commissioner also said, with the Continuous Voter Registration Exercise slated to resume on June 28, the commission had introduced an innovation where voters who are technology-savvy could begin their registration online, then proceed to their respective registration areas to have their biometrics and pictures captured.
This, according to him, is to further decongest the centres as well as make the process easier.
Daily Trust reports that the meeting had in attendance representatives of political parties in the state, heads of all security agencies in the state, traditional and religious leaders and non-governmental organisations.
As part of the processes of nomination of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for the forthcoming Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
Political parties worry over rising insecurity
The United Political Parties for Good Governance (UPPG), an umbrella organisation of some registered political parties in Nigeria has expressed worry over the spate of insecurity across the country as the 2023 elections approach.
According to the group, the worsening insecurity situation raised concerns and doubt in the minds of many about the future unity and survival of a corporate Nigeria.
The National Secretary of UPPG, Ahmed Tijjani Mustapha, who is also the Deputy National Chairman, All Grand Alliance Party (AGAP), stated this in Kaduna.
Mustapha noted a recent statement by Senator Ali Ndume where the lawmaker said Nigerian troops lacked equipment and operational funds to tackle the multifarious security challenges, and called on government to probe money released for the purchase of arms from 2008 to date.
He said the primary essence of government is to ensure security of lives and property of citizens adding that in Nigeria today, no part of the country subsists without one form of security challenge or the other.
Minister of sports, Sunday Dare, has been honoured by the Association of National Olympics Committees of Africa with the Highest Order of Sports Administrator Award.
ANOCA president, Mr. Mustapha Berraf who conferred the award on him yesterday in Abuja said it is for the Ministers immense contributions to the growth of the Olympics Movement and sports in Africa.
He said ANOCA is happy with the role you played in ensuring the completion of our headquarters in Abuja.
We are very proud of all that you have done for sports Development in Nigeria and Africa.
We, hereby, present this award to you for your great work and contributions to sports Development.
We are very proud of you and look forward to an enduring relationship for the future of our sports
Responding, Dare said Thanks for this honour and award which is quite special.
We sincerely thank the IOC President and yourself for the role you played in making Nigeria the Olympics Capital of Africa.
Man United and Villarreal reach Europa League final
Manchester United and Villarreal will face off in the Europa League final after completing respective last-four wins over Roma and Arsenal on Thursday.
Cavani notched his second of the night with a trademark header (68) before 19-year-old Nicola Zalewski settled the game on the night to cap an entertaining second leg but United progress to their eighth European final.
Meanwhile, Villarreal held on to their 2-1 first-leg lead to get past the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium.
The Spanish side protected their first-leg advantage with a disciplined display, riding their luck at times with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang twice hitting the post for the hosts.
Some leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) say the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has recorded more achievements within six years than the previous governments under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) between 1999 and 2015.
This is contained in a statement signed by a former National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, who is the current Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman; the Senior Special Assistant on National Social Investment Programme to President Buhari, Barr.
The APC stalwarts, who announced the commencement of a national campaign to promote initiatives of President Buhari ahead of the 2023 general election, said the aim is to present the achievements with facts and empirical evidences.
As committed members of the APC, we are convinced that since May 29, 2015, when the government of President Muhammadu Buhari was inaugurated, landmark initiatives have been and are being implemented.
In comparative terms, President Buharis government has recorded more achievements within six years than all the previous governments under the PDP between 1999 and 2015.
We intend to present these achievements with facts and empirical evidences.
On weekly basis, we will invite Nigerians to engage the issues based on specific highlights of work being executed.
In particular, we will invite all committed party members to participate in the campaign.
We will also invite opposition parties, especially the PDP to engage the issues by presenting especially what they comparatively were able to achieve when they were in power or in states where they control, they said.
The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, his deputy, Diran Odeyemi and another top party man were not available for comments.
Govts urged on roads, others for housing projects
A land developer and Chief Executive Officer of Perfect Estate Developers Limited, Arch.
Dayo Babatunde, has urged governments to deepen the provision of infrastructure to enable estate developers to deliver more housing projects.
Speaking with pressmen in Abuja, the real estate developer said such infrastructures like road, drainage, electricity and water supply, open up sites where developers can leverage to make houses available and affordable for Nigerians.
He also said it was important for the government to own such infrastructures as politicians often lay claim to them.
Babatunde cited a case of an access road in Kuje town in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) which is being taunted as a political achievement.
He however said his firm built the road for N200 million to connect the 600 unit Perfect Estate in the area.
And the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project was done after a futile effort to get the government to do it.
The housing developer lamented the high cost of providing infrastructure by the private sector to aid urban development.
The financial aspect is a challenge.
Out of what we are using to do the project, we are also taking a large chunk of funds for the road.
Without a good access road, you discover that marketing an estate becomes a big challenge.
So we are also under pressure to make the road a reality while also building the houses, Babatunde said.
Seven issues that will make or mar Nigeria to 2023.
Buffeted by deep-seated existential challenges which the leadership has proved incapable of tackling, many are coming to the belief that Nigerias future survival as a country is not certain.
The signs certainly are there clearly manifested in all facets of life; large swathes of the country are now under the control of non-state actors, a shrinking economy characterised rising inflation and poverty, and social sectors in free falling collapse.
But the most dangerous of all is the growing lack of trust between the leadership and the led as well as among the various ethnic groups and social classes making up the country.
That Nigeria is currently hurtling towards a decisive defining moment in its existence as a country cannot be denied.
To be sure, there is no country that is immune from challenges at whatever period of its existence.
But the difference between success and failure to manage these challenges lies mainly with the leadership and how it copes with the issues of governance that come up from time to time in the life of a nation.
In this regard, looking at the degenerating situation in Nigeria across all facets of our life, the abject failure of leadership at all levels to engender confidence in their ability to come to grips with the deep challenges facing the country is glaring.
Hence the dangerous but understandable doubts among a growing number of Nigerians that the countrys future existence is uncertain.
This feeling is gaining greater traction as we inch towards the next circle of elections in 2023 which many believe might be more problematic than the previous ones.
Proceeding from the principle that a problem identified is a problem almost solved, I have identified seven major issues confronting the country not necessarily by pecking order, which require urgent attention, failing which may finally tip the country into the abyss.
The Fulani question is one of the raging issues in the country which requires a nuanced perspective and approach.
It is not just about the frequently reported cases of clashes between Fulani herders and farmers in the country or the seeming ambivalence and even mutual antagonism between sedentary Fulanis and their nomadic kith and kin.
It is more to do with the place of the Fulani in the historical, political and social evolution of Nigeria.
In many ways, Nigeria can be described as a joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, and Sir Frederick Lugard, the architect of amalgamation and first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria.
Sheikh dan Fodio
it was who first established the Fulani hegemony over an area roughly the size of two-thirds of Northern Nigeria through the Fulani led Jihad of 1804.
It was on the political and social structure of this dan Fodio creation that the Britons built their colonial enterprise in Nigeria, a legacy that subsists to a large extent to this day.
As a group, the Fulani are the single most powerful and influential factor in Nigerian politics.
They control one half of the traditional/spiritual realm through the Islamic religion as well as the temporal turf of Nigerian politics and governance.
That the Fulani have deployed this unique advantage in the struggle for the control of the soul of Nigerian politics opens them to accusation with some reason of wanting to perpetually control political power in the country to the exclusion and detriment of other ethnic groups.
It is pointed out, with some justification too, that because this control and dominance work to their advantage, Fulani political aristocracy always works against the attempts by other ethnic groups for the enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.
Although this accusation against the Fulani has been on for years now, at no time has it become more pronounced than in the present time under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari who happens to be a Fulani man.
Although some will dismiss this as part of the stuff of politics in Nigeria, the claim that Fulani wield and retain a disproportionate slice of political power to the detriment and exclusion of others is not totally unfounded, nor is it untrue that the Fulani political aristocracy has sought to perpetuate this control through a subtle agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment into the strategic areas of the countrys polity and economy.
This fulanisation agenda has predictably turned the other ethnic groups including even the closest, the Hausa, against the Fulani especially as the latter are fingered as being responsible for the banditry, kidnapping and other violent crimes in the North west of the country.
In the current situation that Nigeria finds itself, it is no longer feasible for the Fulani to continue to exercise the skewered and disproportionate control of political power.
This not only creates a dangerous imbalance in the polity; it also fosters a feeling and tendency by politically excluded ethnic groups to seek ways of disrupting the polity as we are having it now.
For Nigeria to get out of the dangerous quagmire of uncertainty currently building up, we must address the issue of a skewered political and economic control of Nigeria exercised by the powerful and influential ethnic groups to the exclusion of others.
Another issue that hangs around Nigerian politics and governance like an albatross has to do with our dangerous attachments to ethnic and religious leanings and seeking to interpret everything in our country along those lines.
We are not Nigerians in the true sense of the word.
Our sense of ourselves as Nigerians is defined to a large extent only by the geographical area covering the country rather than by shared values and identities.
We identify ourselves more from our ethnic and religious perspective at the expense of the Nigeria we all belong.
The proclivity to play the ethnic and religious card has become so pervasively self-perpetuating that where it is not even necessary, we try to invoke it just to assure ourselves that this is the normal thing to do.
If the ethnic card does not apply, we reach for the religious card and where the religious card does not, we apply the ethnic card.
We have come to believe so much in these factors as a yardstick for just about everything we do that, like an addict hooked on the self-deceiving exhilaration of the substance, we just cannot muster the courage to kick the habit even as we know how injurious it is to our body politic.
Swiatek to face ex-champ Pliskova in Rome final
French Open champion Iga Swiatek warned she was ready for anyone as she takes on former winner Karolina Pliskova in the Italian Open final on Sunday.
Ex-world
Pliskova saw off Croatia
Petra Martic 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 to return to the final of a tournament she won in 2019 and finished runner-up last year.
Ninth seed Pliskova is the only top 10 player remaining but faces a battle with 19-year-old Swiatek, who continued her Roland Garros warm-up with back-to-back wins on Saturday.
Swiatek first ousted fifth seed Elina Svitolina, a two-time Rome winner, 6-2, 7-5 in 1hr 36min in their quarterfinal match which had been pushed back from Friday because of rain.
She then saw off 17-year-old American Coco Gauff 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 in the semifinals in 1hr 45min.
I knew it was going to be tough, said the 15th-seed of her marathon day.
I played with no expectations.
I was taking it step by step.
Beating Elina shows that my game is here, Im ready for anyone.
It really gave me a confidence boost.
If my game is going to be there tomorrow, I can do anything.
Politicians with analogue ideas should not rule Nigeria again Sowore
A former presidential aspirant of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, said the inability of President Muhammadu Buhari to meet up with his campaign promises to make Nigeria a better nation is a wake-up call to stop electing leaders with analogue ideas.
Sowore, during the 3rd NEC meeting of AAC in Abuja, said the presidents inaction while the security situation of the country persisted indicated that he lacked novel ideas to confront the situation facing the country.
For the progress of the country, people with absolutely old and analogue ideas cannot continue to run a digital country like Nigeria.
Nigeria is going down in the hands of incompetent leaders that have no compassion for its citizenry and refused to deliver on their duties, he said
No public access to Capitol grounds during Biden inauguration Police
There will be no public access to the Capitol grounds during Joe Bidens inauguration as U.S. president on Jan. 20, acting Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman said.
Pittman took over the leadership from Steven Sund after he stepped down amid criticism of the forces handling of rioters who breached the Capitol building last week.
She said law enforcement from the federal, state and local levels were working together and comprehensive, coordinated plans were in place to ensure safety.
Several police officers have been suspended as investigations into the January 6 riot continue, she said.
Why Zuba fruit market needs urgent intervention
For traders and farmers of fruits and vegetables in the country, the Zuba international market, as it is called, is a major selling hub.
The market serves not only the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) but neighbouring states as well.
No doubt, the market is a source of income for thousands of people, mostly women and young ones trading in fresh produce in and around Abuja, the nations capital.
Hundreds of tonnes of fruits like oranges, pawpaw, banana, plantain, pineapple, coconut, watermelon and others, as well as vegetables, make it to the market daily.
Our reporter who visited the market on Tuesday witnessed increased activities around imported apple and coconut businesses as a major wholesale ground for retailers.
Over 70 percent of the fruits consumed in the FCT and neighbouring states come from this market, where thousands congregate as early as 5am every day to do business.
Tonnes of plantain displayed for sale in the market on Tuesday.
However, despite the huge potentials of the market to strengthen the horticultural business locally and internationally, there are challenges that have remained for many years.
The market is still very much unorganized, and the fruits are mostly placed on dirty grounds, raising serious public health concern, especially as the country joins the rest of the world to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
Also, fresh fruits share common ground with rotten ones and wastages that are already infested with germs and diseases.
Dusts from thousands of legs walking around the filthy environment also expose many people to germs, making them vulnerable to diseases.
Again, the absence of necessary infrastructures like cold rooms, good road network, water, standard shops, clean ground facilities for placing fruits, and a host of other factors heighten major safety concern and place everyone eating fruits in Abuja and its environs at high risk.
But despite these challenges, activities in the market put money in the pockets of many and generate revenue for the government too.
Our reporter spoke to a number of farmers and dealers who have been doing business in the area for many years.
Tarsoo Alex, who has orange orchards in Vandikya, Benue State, said he supplied over 60 bags of oranges to the market on Tuesday.
But he lost about five bags to excessive heat, occasioned by scorching sun.
He was afraid that if buyers did not come early, he could lose more.
According to him, a bag of oranges costs between N6,000 and N7,500, but his income is significantly reduced by huge cost of transportation from his farm in Benue to Zuba.
To address the issue of wastages, he said many of the farmers were embracing jute bags, which allow air to penetrate instead of polythene bags that generate excessive heat for the fruits.
Unlike oranges, plantains are everywhere now because this is its season, a young man who preferred to be simply called Pastor told our reporter.
He said that before noon, all the plantains would have been bought.
He helps farmers to sell their produce.
It is usually sold in dozens (12 bunches), which cost between N5,000 and N8,000, depending on the size of the bunches on each unit of 12.
Watermelons are sorted as grades 1, 2 and 3, with 50 pieces in each dozen.
Their prices also depend on grades, with the least costing as low as N9,000.
Regular customers can get lower prices.
The same selling pattern goes for pawpaw and pineapples, but coconut is sold in bags while apples are graded and sold in cartons.
In 2018, Daily Trust on Sunday uncovered a massive use of carbide to ripen fruits in the market, which health experts said could cause cancer.
The report eventually led to a crackdown on perpetrators by the market union leaders through their task force.
Our reporter observed a significant improvement as the chemical is no longer seen to be used as was the previous practice.
But theres the need to protect the health of consumers who patronise the market.
Sultan asks Nigerians to stop blaming military for Constitutional crisis
Alhaji Saad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto, has asked Nigerians to stop blaming the military for constitutional crisis.
Social commentators, activists, government critics, among many others have at different times identified what they consider as gaps in the constitution, attributing the development to the military.
In his remarks at the North West Zonal Public Hearing on the Constitution Review organised by the House of Representatives for Stakeholders from Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara, the monarch advised Nigerians to face the reality and suggest whether to have a new constitution or amend the current one before the 2023 general elections.
Please, stop flogging the military, forget about what the military did and face the reality on ground.
We have the constitution given to us by the military and the military made the constitution; the military also created 36 states, created Abuja and moved the capital from Lagos State to Abuja.
The military had set up governments in so many states with the appointment of 99 percent civilians in the government and all of you agreed to it.
So, stop flogging the military, look at the constitution, if it is good for us or not; that is all.
If you think we need to change the constitution, this is the time.
If you think we need to just amend it, this is the time; but it is just two years to 2023 elections.
Can we afford a new constitution or should we make just some amendments so that when the new governments come in, they can bring fresh faces, minds to fashion our new constitution?
Those are the questions I want you to think about here, the Sultan told the hearing.
The monarch retired from the Nigerian Army where he rose to the rank of Brigadier General.
2023: PDP, APC bicker over burning of INEC offices
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are bickering over the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in some parts of the country.
The PDP, in a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the APC had been promoting acts of violence including the burning of INEC offices to build up an emergency situation and frustrate the smooth conduct of the 2023 general elections.
It is despicable that having realised that it has no place in the 2023 election, given its abysmal failure in governance, APC leaders are seeking to set our country ablaze and truncate our hard-earned democracy.
The PDP invites Nigerians to note the failure of the APC and its leaders to forcefully condemn this clear assault on our frontline institution of democracy.
This is also as the APC administration has failed to take decisive steps to protect INEC facilities from assailants.
Our party wants the APC to know that May 29, 2023 date is sacrosanct for it to leave office, free our nation from its stranglehold and fizzle out from our political firmament, it stated.
Reacting, APC in a statement by Secretary of the Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe alleged that the PDP had undemocratic plans.
The party said using lies and sponsored media attacks on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government, the PDP has shown its hands as sponsors behind the politically-motivated attacks on some of our public and democratic institutions in the country, all in a clearly desperate bid to destabilise this government.
The APC said, Perhaps, the PDP thinks Nigerians have forgotten its long and documented penchant of eroding and destroying democratic institutions.
To name one, was it not the same PDP that attempted to discredit INEC and the entire 2019 election with a bogus tale of a server that never existed and employed hackers to disrupt the communication network of the electoral body during the 2019 election?
The APC cannot be at home and burn its house.
A winner cannot destroy the process that brought it to success.
From the 2015 to 2019 elections, Nigerians spoke clearly through their votes for the APC by mandating us to rescue the country from the PDPs 16-year misadventure.
The PDP should address itself to the reality that it stands rejected by the electorate.
Its undemocratic plan is ill-fated and will fail woefully.
Hawan Daushe: Police use teargas to foil attack in Kano
Swift intervention by the police operatives saved thousands of spectators of Hawan Daushe, a traditional Sallah Durbar, from what would have been a massive attack by a gang of lawless youths in Kano.
The youths in their numbers blocked the road a few meters from Kofar Kudu, the venue of the durbar to launch an attack on the retreating crowd of unsuspecting spectators before the police swiftly intervened by firing teargas.
Thugs pelted stones at the police but they were overpowered before the people were able to pass.
The incidents had trapped many of the durbar spectators at the emirs palace till about 7 pm.
The incident started immediately after the governors convoy had left the emirs palace after the ceremony.
The gang mobilized and blocked the road to rob the public and cause mayhem in the area.
Hawan Daushe has always been characterized by thugs clashes which usually leave scores injured.
But there was no report of injury from Fridays incident.
This is the first Sallah durbar organised by the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, since his enthronement last year.
The annual event was cancelled last year as a measure to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state.
Fridays event, which started around 5 pm, witnessed a large turnout from various sections of Kano society.
Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and many political elites were also in attendance.
The event as usual started from Kofar Kwaru where the emir rode on a horse alongside his royal guards in traditional regalia to Gidan Mai Babban Daki, where he paid Sallah homage to his stepmothers in the stead of his biological mother who passed on, weeks ago.
After the visit to Gidan Mai Babban Daki, the Emir rode back to the palace through Kofar Kudu where he received homage from his district heads and other titleholders in a traditional display of horsemanship before he retreated to the palace thereby drawing the curtain for the famous Hawan Daushe.
Chadian rebels, government forces clash in area where Deby was shot
Government troops and rebels clashed on Thursday in a region of western Chad where president Idriss Deby Itno was killed earlier this month.
The fight in the desert region of Kanem, near Chads border with Niger, pits Libya-based rebels against forces loyal to a new military junta led by Debys son.
Fiercely criticised for authoritarianism and inequality, Deby was seen as a trusty ally by many Western countries including the former colonial power France.
He was seen as a stabilising force in the fight against jihadism in the wider Sahel region on the southern fringes of the Sahara desert.
Fighting is continuing in Kanem we are going to have continue to fight, otherwise they will destabilise us, junta spokesman General Azem Bermandoa Agouna told AFP.
The Military Transition Council (CMT) is headed by 37-year-old Mahamat Idriss Deby.
For now the fight against the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT), drawn mainly from the Goran ethnic group, is going on about 300 kilometres (180 miles) north of the capital NDjamena.
Security sources, without giving further details, said the Chadian army bombarded FACT positions.
Deby, 68, died on April 19, from wounds he suffered fighting the Libya-based rebels, according to the authorities.
The insurgents had launched an offensive in the northern Tibesti region on April 11 as presidential elections were unfolding.
A career soldier who seized power in 1990 and exercised it ruthlessly for 30 years, Deby died on the day that the electoral commission confirmed that he had won a landslide victory.
Hundreds arrested at protests
FACT is led by Mahamat Mahadi Ali, a veteran insurgent who previously lived in France.
The group vowed to pursue its offensive after a pause for Debys funeral on April 23.
Experts believe FACT has between 1,500 and 2,000 fighters.
The Chadian army claimed on April 19 to have killed 300 rebels and captured 246 others, who were being taken to the capital NDjamena to stand trial but military casualties have not been made public.
The armed forces recently sent reinforcements to Kanem, security forces said.
On Sunday, the CMT announced there would be no mediation or negotiation with FACT and called on Niger to help it capture the groups chief.
The CMT took over on April 20, immediately after Debys death was announced, as parliament and government were dissolved.
It has promised an 18-month transition period before free and transparent elections.
At least six people died on Tuesday in banned protests against the junta, according to the authorities, while a local NGO reported nine fatalities.
Prosecutors said Thursday that they were interviewing over 700 people arrested at demonstrations on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Dozens of arrested protesters were brought in police vehicles to the capitals high court Thursday from different police stations around the city.
A majority of them have already been through and many have been released, NDjamena prosecutor Youssouf Tom told AFP.
On Monday, the military junta appointed Albert Pahimi Padacke as transitional prime minister.
He called for a nationwide effort to speed the return to civilian rule.(AFP)
Politicians urged not to overheat polity over insecurity
A former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Alhaji Salihu Mustapha, has urged top politicians to stop making statements that will overheat the polity, ignite crises and plunge Nigeria into another civil war.
Alhaji Mustapha, who is contesting for the chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the partys national convention, in a statement on Sunday, said a united Nigeria should be the concern of all to enable the country to conduct a successful transition in 2023.
He explained that no country survived civil war twice, and therefore appealed to Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari-led government in proffering solutions to the challenges bedevilling the nation.
He said, I condemn the attempt by some groups and persons to politicise our security challenges.
As Nigerians, we should learn from the ethnic crises in Rwanda and elsewhere.
Violence has never solved any countrys problems.
War or violence does not recognise religion or tribe.
It is a consuming fire.
It is not a respecter of anybody the poor or rich, old or young.
Nigerians who were born after the civil war should learn lessons from Rwanda in 1994.
War is bad, war is evil.
Let us be properly guided.
He that rushes to war or advocates war should know that war brings death and destruction.
Serena suffers shock loss in historic 1 000th match
Serena Williams, playing the 1 000th Tour-level match of her glittering career, suffered a shock 7-6(6)
7-5 defeat by Argentinas
Nadia Podoroska in the the Italian Open second round on Wednesday.
Playing her first competitive match in nearly three months, the 23-times Grand Slam champion twice came back from a break down but struggled on her first serve as Podoroska took the opening set in the tiebreak.
Podoroska, who reached the French Open semifinals last year, produced a string of heavy topspin forehands to take control of the match with an early break in the second set.
Although Podoroska was broken to love on her first attempt to serve out the match, she maintained her composure to break again and secure a place in the round of 16.
Defeat for Williams, who received an opening round bye in Rome, was a major blow to her preparations for the French Open, starting on 30 May.
It was the Americans 149th defeat in her 1 000 career WTA matches.
World number two Naomi Osaka also crashed out of the tournament, losing 7-6(2) 6-2 to American Jessica Pegula.
Osaka, a four-times Grand Slam winner, has often struggled on clay and her defeat in Rome followed a second-round loss at the Madrid Open this month.
Man nabbed over threat to employer
The police in Edo State have arrested a 25-year-old man, identified as Mike Ashien, for allegedly threatening to kidnap and murder his employer.
It was gathered that the suspect is an employee of a domestic oil company located in Ugbogui community, Ovia South-West LG of the state.
It was further gathered that the suspect hid his phone number and called his employer demanding N10 million from him or have him kidnapped and killed.
It was also gathered that after the threat, his employer reported the matter to the state police Commissioner, Philip Ogbadu, who ordered an investigation in the matter.
Speaking with journalists, the suspect said pressing family problem forced him into the act.
My boss pays me N20,000 monthly but it is not enough for me and l
just threatened him to get more money from him, but I have learnt my lesson and I am now regretting, he said.
IAR researches on Tela maize to tackle pests, drought
In 2019, Nigeria joined six other African countries Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa and Ethiopia to enter into a Tela maize project.
The Tela maize project is a public-private partnership to develop and commercialise the transgenic insect-protected and drought-tolerant maize varieties to boost the farmers productivity.
Tela maize is double-dose (moderate drought and insect resistance) maize varieties designed to help farmers have better yields.
At the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, a team of scientists are working on the maize varieties to ensure that by 2022, farmers across the country would have access to it after it has gone through all the necessary regulations.
Professor Mohammed Faguji, a seed breeder and the executive director of the IAR, said global warming brought two adverse conditions (drought and flooding), in addition to pests that made farming difficult for many smallholder farmers.
The Tela maize, he said, was to solve those problems.
Daily Trust on Sunday visited the field where the varieties are undergoing confined field trials to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the drought and pest-resistant attributes before seeking the approval of the necessary authorities for environmental release and subsequently, commercialisation, with 2022 as the target year.
Professor Rabiu Adamu is the principal investigator (lead researcher) of the genetically modified Tela maize project.
He told Daily Trust on Sunday at the trial fields in Zaria that the research had two strong aims: to produce transgenic hybrid varieties of maize for the first time in Nigeria
that are resistant to most maize pests, particularly the major pests of maize, stem borers and the fall army worms, and to produce maize hybrid
that are also tolerant to drought.
These hybrids are genetically modified, using biotechnology to make them resistant.
So they have a gene from soil-dwelling bacterial that is inserted into the maize gene that compasses resistance to insect pests, especially those that damage maize, that is the fall army worm and the complex of stem borers, which are three: the pink stem borer and the other species the maize stalk-borer -Busseolafusca and Sesamiacalamistis.
These are the two key stem borers of maize in this part of the country.
These hybrids we are testing are genetically modified to resist damage by insect pests, especially stem borers and fall army worms as you have seen in the field, he explained.
He said the current crop in the field was the third Confined Field Trials (CFT).
We are hoping to environmentally realise these hybrid in Nigerian fields in other research institutes and some out stations to test them to confirm and validate the implicating of the gene, not only here.
Thereafter, we will write a memo to the regulator to allow us conduct more trails outside the conferment in other farmers fields and other research institutes, he added.
Speaking on when the farmers are likely to get the seeds, he said that after one year when the results are ready, they would submit the dossier to the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) for permission to take it to the farmers to do national multiplication trails.
Out of the 16 entries, the best performing hybrids selected by the famers will be evaluated and reports submitted to the National Varietal Release Committee in Ibadan.
Once they accept that the varieties have met the minimum requirement for them to be released as hybrid, they can be released to farmers, he said.
The scientists are tentatively looking at December 2022 for its release so that in about three years, farmers everywhere will have access to the seed.
Dr Muhyideen Oyekunle, the lead, Trials and Pipeline Testing, who took our reporter around, explained the biotic and abiotic attributes of the ongoing progress of the Tela maize research planted in three plots to evaluate the efficacy of the resistance to drought, fall army worm and stem borers.
In the field, there are very clear differences, the non-GM maize, which infected pests almost completely ravaged by the fall army worm, stem borers, whereas the GM varieties were completely untouched even though the two varieties (Tela Maize and the traditional seeds that do not have biotech protection are planted in close proximity) side-by-side.
The ongoing field results as seen by our reporter shows great prospect although the yield remains to be seen and evaluated.
Until then, there is solution to pests and drought problems on sight.
Some of the varieties are yellow but most of them are white, however, in the trials, more than 90 percent are white maize because it is preferred by industry players.
But the scientists major challenges are COVID-19 pandemic and the issue of misperception and misinformation about the technology.
People who dont know how the technology works like to use the social media and other non-scientific avenues to confuse and mislead the public and other scientists, the lead researcher, Professor Adamu said.
The Tela maize scheme is a collaboration between the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and the IAR under the Tela maize project implemented in seven African countries.
It builds on the success on breeding work under the Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) project designed to develop drought-tolerant and insect-protected maize varieties.
2023: Middle Belt, southern leaders ask APC, PDP to zone presidential ticket to South
The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has asked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone their 2023 presidential tickets to the South.
The forum also urged the federal government to heed the genuine and reasonable nationwide calls for a transparent national dialogue and take urgent steps towards restructuring and birthing a new constitution to bring back equitable harmony to the country.
The resolutions were contained in a communique signed by National Leader of the Forum and former minister of Information, Chief Edwin Clark;
Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President General of Ohaneze.
Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor; National President, Middle Belt Forum, Dr Pogu Bitrus; and National Chairman, PANDEF, Senator Emmanuel Ebok Essien, among others.
According to the communique, the leaders demanded restructuring of the country before 2023, and asked the federal government to declare a national emergency on security.
We insist that it is imperative to immediately restructure the country considering the precarious prevailing atmosphere before any further elections.
Reminds all leading political parties, especially the APC, PDP and other political parties, that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, rests in fair and even sharing of power
That the Northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the Office of the Presidency, for the full statutory period of right years by 2023, hence, should yield to the South.
Enjoins political stakeholders from the South not to be lured into the unpatriotic step of seeking such other positions as national chairmen and vice president of the main political parties, but join forces to demand and ensure that the presidency moves to the South in 2023.
Emphasises that, if the security situation is not dealt with and banditry stopped or reduced to the barest minimum, it would not be feasible to have proper elections in 2023.
Insists that cattle rearing is a generally, private business enterprise, as such, the federal government should avoid committing state resources to promote any particular business, beyond providing the enabling environment, in the performance of its regulatory roles.
The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the unity of Nigeria, adding that it can only be sustained on the principles of equity, fairness and justice.
But, the Ambassador Aminu Wali-led faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State has said the North-East should produce the next president.
Chairman of the faction, Mamina Bako Lamido, who spoke on behalf of other executive members said Bala Mohammed was fit for the job.
The PDP faction gave its backing when it received executive members of a group canvassing support for the governor, known as Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed Vanguard (BAM-V), at the partys secretariat in Kano at the weekend.
Lamido said for fairness and equity, the party should zone its presidential ticket to both North-East and South-East, adding that if the ticket goes to the North-East, Bala Mohammed should be given the mandate.
Speaking earlier, BAM-V Director-General, Mohammed Abubakar Jibo, said the group was at the partys secretariat to canvass support for Mohammed ahead 2023.
Lagos-Ibadan rail tentatively for commissioning June 10 FG
The Federal Government has fixed June 10 as tentative date for the commissioning of the flagship Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail.
Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced this during an inspection of the project with the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, on Sunday.
Mohammed, who spoke briefly with newsmen at the Wole Soyinka Station in Abeokuta, said the inspection on Sunday was to ensure that all the Ts are crossed
and Is dotted ahead of the commissioning.
Daily Trust had earlier reported how the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC), the contractor handling the project, has been pressured to deliver all the 10 stations ahead of the commissioning.
The stations are Ebute-Metta, Apapa, Agege, Agbado, Kajola, Papalanto, Abeokuta, Omi Adio, Olodo and Moniya.
Most of the stations have reached are between 90 and 100 percent completion stage.
The Ministers as well as the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Transport, Dr. Magdalene Ajani, Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Engr.
Fidet Okhiria and other officials of the Ministry started the inspection from the Mobolaji Johnson Station (Ebute-Metta) before heading to the Bola Tinubu Station (Apapa).
The Ebute-Metta Station is the biggest station in the train corridor.
It is reputed to be the most magnificent government building in Nigeria.
According to the Transportation Minister, all the equipment and facilities have been installed ahead of the takeoff of operation.
The Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail is the lot 2 of the 2,700km Lagos-Kano standard gauge which construction started in 2017 with extension to Nigerias
Premier Ports in Apapa to aid massive cargo movement and decongest the ports.
Mohammed said, Tentatively, the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge would be commissioned on June 10.
What the Honourable Minister is doing is to ensure that all the Is are dotted and the Ts are crossed before June 10.
You can see right from Apapa to Agege, Papalanto to this place, you have seen us go down to engage the contractor to ensure that everything is in order.
Because this is one of the flagships of this administration, one of the landmark achievements of this administration.
Not only this is the first time we are having a dual standard gauge but you can see the passion by which the Minister supervises the project.
Gunmen shoot herbalist, abduct two women
Gunmen believed to be kidnappers have shot a popular alternative medicine producer, Alhaji Laminu Jibrin, after attacking his home located in Tafa town along Abuja-Kaduna highway, in Kaduna State.
The attackers, said to be about 20 in number, stormed into the mans residence around 1:00 am on Monday, after forcing its gate open.
A resident, who sought anonymity, said the attackers met the herbalist packaging some herbal products and mistook him for a worker of the company.
Some of them beat his wife up just as they were asking her of his whereabouts, the source said.
It was further learnt that the man had retaliated with a stick in his possession against the gunmen, who responded with the shooting that injured him on his shoulder.
The mans wife, and another woman among his neighbours, were abducted later by the gunmen, just as he was taken to an undisclosed hospital along with his little child, who was hit on his abdomen by a bullet, where they were receiving medical attention.
Efforts to speak to the police area commander in Jere,
ACP Faruk Umar, were not successful, as he did not respond to the phone calls from our reporter.
Poultry feed crisis: Why more interventions are needed
The crisis in the feed industry hit its peak late last year when many poultry farmers started shutting down their farms due to a jump in operation cost, mainly caused by the high cost of feeds.
The leadership of the Poultry Association of Nigeria, an umbrella body of poultry farmers in the country, held an emergency meeting in Abuja, warning that if something urgent was not done, the poultry industry might fold up.
The director-general of the association, Onallo S. Akpa, while calling for immediate intervention by the federal government, raised an alarm that maize that cost N80,000 per ton and soybeans N120,000 per ton in January 2020, cost N200,000 per ton (maize) and N250 per ton
(soybeans) as of January 2021.
Apparently, in a move to avert a crisis in the feed value chain, the Central Bank of Nigeria quickly moved in by agreeing to release, in tranches, about 300,000 metric tons of maize to the industry.
The gesture, which the stakeholders believe was timely, seems to have reduced tension in the sector.
The target, according to the bank, is to ensure the poultry industrys sustainability, job retention, circular flow of income, cheaper nutrition and poverty alleviation.
Last month, about 50,000MT was said to have been allocated to stakeholders in the feed milling industry, with others set to be released in due course.
Stakeholders believe the quick release of the remaining tonnages will further redress the feed challenges in the sector ahead of the forthcoming Easter celebration.
The ongoing intervention is being executed in collaboration with players like AFEX Commodities Exchange Ltd, which are facilitating the release of the grains.
The shortfall in maize production has been one of the major challenges in the agricultural sector as according to the PAN DG, the produce is the most highly consumed in northern Nigeria.
This is why many feed producers and other stakeholders are advocating for more interventions by the apex bank in the area of maize and soybeans production.
The General Manager of Premier Feeds Ltd, Austin Daylop, a beneficiary of the intervention, noted that as the new farming season for maize and soybean approaches, decisive actions needed to be taken to meet the demands of the growing population and prevent Nigeria from getting into a cycle of shortfalls.
The Anchor Borrowers Programme by CBN in partnership with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) is one such solution.
A similar scheme should also be introduced for maize and soybean production.
It will definitely help to mitigate rural-urban migration by the farmers brought on by the insecurity challenges, especially in the Northern states where maize and soybeans are cultivated.
Continuing the collaborative partnerships between the relevant government authorities and industry stakeholders such as the Maize Growers Association of Nigeria (MAGPAMAN) and Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) will help to provide critical field data so that policymakers can understand the input required to expand the yield capacity of local farmers, he said.
Ayodeji Balogun, CEO, AFEX, said: By facilitating the release of the 300,000MT maize, leveraging support from credible players in the ecosystem, including our team at AFEX, the CBN will offer over 35,000 farmers and agro-processors a channel through which they can trade maize at a subsidized rate, and thereby reduce the adverse effect of the maize price hike, increase local demand and also improve farmers livelihoods.
Oil prices fall on demand, COVID-19 concerns
Oil prices edged lower on Monday as climbing Coronavirus cases and tighter restrictions in Europe and China fueled worries over a slower recovery in fuel demand.
Encouraging gross domestic product (GDP) and industrial production data from China helped to limit the downside to some extent.
Brent crude for March delivery eased 0.2 percent to 54.98 dollars a barrel, after falling 2.3 percent on Friday.

Ratels Sports Foundation partners MGGN to empower the girl-child
Ratels Sports Foundation has partnered organisers of the Most Gorgeous Girl Nigeria, MGGN, to host a Women mini football tournament in Abuja to celebrate the first edition of the beauty pageant which will hold in the city of Abuja.
Grace Ene, who is the Chief Executive Officer of MGGN, organisers of the beauty pageant , said Barrister Paul Edehs Ratel Sports Foundation, has agreed to partner with the initiative through the mini tourney which is aimed at creating more awareness, empowerment and hope for the girl-child.
She said We are glad about this initiative and partnering with one of the leading Sports Foundations in the country, Ratels Sports Development Foundation.
Through this event, we have been able to share the belief that the girl-child deserves more in our community and with Ratels support, we are hopeful that it will create more love and awareness across all quarters.
On his part, the founder of Ratels Sports Foundation, Barrister Edeh, said, Todays event is unique because we are doing it in partnership with a new brand that is in town, the Most Gorgeous Girl Nigeria, which is a beauty pageant.
They were able to identify areas that we are inclined to support.
These are areas that we are happy to invest in.
Today we have four teams all based in Abuja playing in this tournament and as you can see, they played good football even in the rain.
Edeh also spoke on the financial implication as he said the four teams were supported to participate in the epoch making event.
It may interest you to know that this mini tournament cost us some money because the girls had to play like eight matches within the space of four hours.
We paid match indemnities, fed and transported the teams and of course we gave quality footballs to them, he said.
15 arrested for killing 706 cows, 75 sheep in Kaduna community
Fifteen suspects have been arrested by police in Kaduna State for allegedly killing 706 cows and 75 sheep in Atyap chiefdom of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area (LGA), Kaduna State.
The suspects are said to have dumped the animals in a ditch.
The Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Muhammad Jalige, in a statement, expressed concern about the nature of crime which he said was perpetrated by agents of doom in their quest to set the state ablaze.
He noted that the command cannot hold back and watch criminals take laws into their hands, noting that the command is not leaving anything to chance in ensuring that thorough investigation is carried out to prevent future occurrence of such dastardly act.
He added, On 24th March, 2021 at about 10:00am
some herdsmen reported at Divisional Police Headquarters Zonkwa, Kaduna, that some uncertain number of persons had attacked some of their herds killing 706 cows and 75 sheep and dumped them in a ditch.
On getting the complaint, operatives immediately swung into action, visited the scene of the incident, took necessary photographs and expanded their investigation which led to the arrest of 15 within the following villages; Mate, Unguwan Tabo, Unguwan Rohogu, Runji, Mashan, Mashan Daji and Wawan Rafi all of Atyap chiefdom in Zangon Kataf LGA Kaduna state.
Enugu Police arrest suspected rail track vandal, recover firearm, others
The Enugu Police Command has announced the arrest of one Ejike Okeke, who specialises in rail track vandalism, and recovered one locally-made pistol with one live cartridge from him.
Okeke, 18, of Nkwubor-Nike Village, Enugu East Local Government Area of the state, identified as a member of a syndicate of rail track vandals, was arrested on May 9 at about 11am, according to a statement yesterday by the Commands spokesperson, ASP Daniel Ndukwe.
Ndukwe said that the arrest was achieved by police operatives attached to the Enugu Metro Area Command, in conjunction with operatives of the Vigilance group of Nchatancha-Nike in Enugu.
He said that Okeke and others, who ran on sighting the operatives, were found attempting to vandalise railway tracks at Nkwubor rail-line, adding that investigation was ongoing to apprehend his other gang members that fled.
In another development, operatives attached to Awkunanaw Police Division on May 11 at about 7:30am, recovered one custom-coloured Toyota Camry Car with registration number:
ENU 556 MH, along Amagugwu Road, Awkunanaw, Enugu.
Preliminary investigation shows that the car was stolen from where it was parked at Abakaliki Road, Enugu, by the criminal gang, who abandoned the vehicle and fled due to intense pressure mounted by operatives.
In the meantime, discreet investigation to fish out the fleeing suspects had commenced, the police said.
Wave of insecurity a threat to 2023 polls Okorie
A former presidential candidate, Chekwas Okorie, has said the current wave of insecurity and spate of killings in the country are threats to the 2023 general elections.
Okorie told Daily Trust in a telephone interview last night that if the situation is not nipped in the bud, future elections would be threatened.
He said the National Assembly in collaboration with the executive arm of government should adopt measures that would save the nation and deepen democracy in the country.
Danger signs are all over the place and that is why some of us are very worried.
I pray very hard that it should be addressed.
The president has a big role to play in this regard.
The National Assembly also has its own role to play in collaboration with the executive arm of government so that Nigeria can move ahead.
The danger signs are all over the place; even a blind man can see it.
If nothing is done, we are in a big trouble, he said.
Asked to state the consequences in the event the situation is not addressed, the APC chieftain said, In the event it is not addressed, my fear is that we may not even get to 2023, in one peace and this means that Nigeria will disintegrate.
There will be warlords; Nigerian Army will not be able to even deal with the situation.
There will be what is called lost command because there are some soldiers with weapons which when put together will not even be up to 50 percent of what is in private hands.
The way I have seen Nigeria in recent times, we are now more divided along ethnic lines than religious lines.
Even when we belong to the same religion, we are getting more ethnic conscious.

Explosions: Senate urges clampdown on illegal gas retailers
The Senate on Tuesday urged the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to clamp down on illegal roadside retailers of liquefied petroleum gas, those operating within residential areas and licensed plants who lack basic and standard minimum requirements.
It also mandated its committees on Gas and Industries to investigate the causes of the recent cases of gas explosions across the country with a view to finding permanent and sustainable solutions that would save the lives of the people.
These followed the adoption of a motion by Senator Ibikunle Amosun, who expressed sadness over the loss of at least eight lives in gas-related explosions and fire incidences in Abeokuta metropolis, Ogun State, in quick successions within two weeks last month.
The Senate, accordingly, called on the Federal and State Fire Services to enforce the mandatory use of fire safety equipment in homes and places of work.
It also urged the Standards Organization of Nigeria, the DPR, the National Orientation Agency and marketers of gas and highly inflammable products to embark on aggressive, consistent sensitization and awareness campaigns on safe ways of using gas cylinders and other inflammable materials to save lives.
Members of the Muslim community in Ebonyi State on Thursday urged Governor David Umahi to contest for president in 2023.
Leader of the group, Alhaji Abass Egwu, made the appeal at the state government house in Abakiliki, when he led the group members to pay this years
Eid-el-Fitr homage to the governor.
We plead with you, Your Excellency, that you should make yourself available for national service in 2023, Insha Allah.
If you have a good son, there is no need to canvass for him.
A good market sells itself.
Your Excellency, you are a good market and we will not let you down, the group said.
Iheanacho, Ndidi win FA Cup as Leicester City beat Chelsea in final
Nigerian duo, Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi are FA Cup winners after helping Leicester City to beat Chelsea 1-0 in the FA Cup final played on Saturday.
It is Leicester Citys
first FA Cup in the clubs 137-year history.
Youri Tielemanss sensational strike in front of 22,000 fans at Wembley was the difference between the two teams.
The largest crowd for a sports event in England since the coronavirus pandemic hit 14 months ago were treated to a goal worthy to win any trophy as the Belgian midfielder blasted into the top corner on 63 minutes.
Kasper Schmeichel produced a stunning save to deny Mason Mount late on and Chelsea also had a goal ruled out by a VAR review for offside.
Five years after the Foxes stunned the Premier Leagues giants to become champions, Leicester have now claimed English footballs other prestigious trophy at the fifth time of asking.
Four times they had previously lost the final, but the last of those was 52 years ago.
A historic week for Brendan Rodgerss men could get even better as they are on the verge of sealing a place in next seasons Champions League.
The sides meet again in three days time at Stamford Bridge in a pivotal clash to decide who secures a top-four finish in the Premier League.
Chelsea need a quick response after losing for just the fourth time in 27 games since Thomas Tuchel replaced the sacked Frank Lampard in January.
The Blues also have a Champions League final to look forward to against Manchester City in two weeks time but could end the campaign without silverware or a place in Europes premier club competition next season.
Chelseas success under Tuchel has come thanks to an excellent defensive record, but their struggles at the other end were again exposed.
Tuchels men dominated before half-time but laboured to create clear-cut chances despite Leicester losing defensive lynchpin Jonny Evans to injury midway through the first half.
Wayward Werner Timo Werners
wayward finishing has characterised his first season in England since joining from RB Leipzig for Â£47 million ($66 million) and the German international had another day to forget in front of goal.
Tuchel turned away in disgust after Werner blazed high and wide from the edge of the box with the Leicester defence stretched midway through the first half.
Werner then came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time as his header drifted just wide and evaded Cesar Azpilicueta as the Chelsea captain launched himself in at the far post.
The welcome return of noise echoing down from 6,000 fans of each side from both ends of the ground helped mask a general lack of quality on the field.
Another 10,000 local supporters, key workers and Football Association stakeholders were also in attendance as Wembley gears up for hosting matches at Euro 2020 next month at 25 percent capacity.
One moment of magic proved decisive as Tielemans collected possession midway inside the Chelsea half and strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable strike into the top corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Tuchel flexed the strength in depth of his squad in an attempt to find an equaliser as Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz, Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic were all introduced off the bench.
But they were denied by the brilliance of Schmeichel in the Leicester goal.
Chilwell, whose every touch was booed by the Leicester supporters, nearly came back to haunt his old club as his header was turned onto the post by the Dane.
Mount then could not believe his luck as his sweetly struck shot was turned behind by a brilliant stop from Schmeichel.
Even when the Leicester keeper was beaten, Chelsea were denied by a VAR review.
A Wes Morgan own goal looked set to send the game to extra-time, but Chilwell had strayed offside in the build-up.
Leicester players and fans celebrated the decision like a goal and were in raptures again moments later after seeing out a nervy finale.
Tinubu, govs, other S/West leaders reject secession
Amidst agitation for the Oduduwa Republic in the South-West, leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the geo-political zone Sunday met in Lagos where they expressed strong opposition to the agitation.
The meeting held in Lagos House, Marina, was at the instance of the former interim National Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande.
At the meeting was a national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, governors of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Adegboyega Oyetola (Osun) and Chief Bisi Akande.
Others were General Alani Akinrinade (rtd), former governor of Ogun State, Aremo Segun Osoba, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Chief Pius Akinyelure among others.
Daily Trust learnt that the meeting was in response to the raging agitation for Yoruba nation by a section of the region with several rallies held in South-West states to agitate for Oduduwa Republic.
In a communiquÃ© read by Chief Akande, the South West leaders asked security agencies and the federal government to reduce tension in the country following the worsening security challenges bedeviling the nation.
The communique reads in part; We note with significant concern the security situation in the country.
Terrorism and violent criminality threaten many areas, adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of too many innocent and peace-loving Nigerians.
We urge the federal government to continue to make the necessary expenditures and allocate sufficient resources to enable the military and security agencies to tackle the difficult security challenges confronting us.
For Nigeria to overcome these challenges, we must do so with unity of purpose and action.
The desire for peace and the chance for a prosperous and just society is universal and transcends all regional, religious or ethnic divisions.
Sadly, many public figures have made statements that spark division and undermine the needed unity of purpose.
We restate our abhorrence of violence as a means to achieve either political or economic power and influence.
We strongly condemn violence of any form in any part of the country, regardless of ethnic or regional identity of the perpetrators of the violence or of the victims.
Government must do all it can to protect potential victims and to assist those who have previously been victimized by terrorism or widespread banditry.
We endorse the position of the Southern Governors taken at their May 11, 2021 summit in Asaba, Delta State, regarding ranching.
We do so because such a decision will lessen tensions between farmers and herders while also helping the long-term economic viability of both the farming and herding communities.
2023: INEC verifies voting points for conversion to polling units
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday commenced a nationwide verification exercise of the voting points (VPs) proposed to be converted to polling units (PUs) across the country.
INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on Tuesday in Abuja, when he visited some of the proposed centres and existing PUs in the FCT and Nasarawa State.
Speaking with newsmen at the commissions Local Government office in Karu, Nasarawa State, Yakubu said the purpose of the verification exercise was to ensure the right thing was done in the conversion of the VPs to PUs.
All the national commissioners are out, visiting the states of the federation to verify the work of converting the voting points to polling units, he said.
Meanwhile, the commission yesterday said it has upgraded 956 voting points to polling units in Sokoto State.
A guide to soya bean farming as planting begins June
Soya is a plant grown mostly for its edible bean which can be used for different purposes.
It is a legume known for its high nutritious value.
Our agric editor who has been monitoring the soya bean value-chain reports that despite the fact that Nigeria is said to be the largest producer of the crop in Africa, its production level has not attained its full capacity.
This is because soya bean farming in the country is still largely done by small farmers who grow the crop as a minor crop alongside major crops like maize, cowpea (beans) and cassava.
Some soya bean farmers that spoke with Daily Trust believe that the crop can be grown in many states in Nigeria using low agricultural input.
Why more farmers should go into soya bean farming
Mallam Yinusa Jimoh, an Ilorin-based retired agric extension officer, told Daily Trust on phone that aside from its domestic and economical values, soya bean improved soil fertility and could be used to control striga.
He said the market for soya bean in Nigeria was growing fast, with opportunities for improving the income of farmers.
A handbook on soya bean produced by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) shows that the rapid growth in the poultry sector in the past five years has also increased demand for soya bean meal in Nigeria.
The IITA handbook reads in part: It is also a prime source of vegetable oil in the international market.
Soya bean has an average protein content of 40 percent and is more protein-rich than any of the common vegetable or animal food sources found in Nigeria.
According to IITA, SALMA Oil Mills in Kano, Grand Cereals in Jos, ECWA Feeds in Jos, AFCOT Oil Seed Processors in Adamawa and PS Mandrides in Kano all process soya bean.
This means that there is a ready market for interested farmers in the country.
Presently at the local market, a measure of soya bean costs around N600; depending on the area, while a 50kg bag costs around N17,000.
The global demand for the crop nears about 11 million tonnes, while Africas annual expenditure of soya bean is about 619 thousand tonnes.
Best ways to farm soya bean
According to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, planting of soya bean usually starts in June, and that it grows well on all kinds of soil, except deep soils with poor water retention.
Dr Joseph informed farmers that an important factor to consider when embarking on soya bean farming in Nigeria was rainfall.
He said Nigeria had a very favourable climatic condition that was ideal for soya bean to flourish.
According to him, good harvest depends mostly on adequate irrigation as the crop can also be grown in areas with lesser amounts of rainfall through irrigation.
According to IITA, soya bean should not be planted in sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to avoid drought stress, advising that it should not be grown in waterlogged soils or soils with surfaces that can crust, as this will lead to poor seedling emergence
Clear all vegetation before land preparation.
The seedbed may be prepared manually with a hoe or an animal-drawn implement or tractor, IITA advised.
Well-prepared land ensures good germination and reduces weed infestation.
You can plant on ridges or on a flat seedbed, the IITA added.
Experts warn that soya bean variety selection should be based on maturity, yield potential, lodging, drought tolerance and resistance to pests and diseases.
John Stephen, a soya bean farmer in Garam, a Niger State community neighbouring the FCT, insisted that the maturity period should be the first consideration when choosing a variety suited to your geographical zone.
Stephen advised that, Consider varieties that are earlier maturing rather than late maturing in areas with low rainfall.
Although later maturity increases the yield potential, it is risky to grow late maturing varieties in drier environments because of late season drought.
IITA advised farmers to use high quality seeds of the selected variety as soya bean seeds easily lose their viability.
According to the institute, it is common for soya bean, even when stored properly, not to germinate after 12 to 15 months in storage.
Therefore, use seeds that are not more than 12 months old to ensure good germination.
Sort out the good seeds for planting to ensure that they are free from insects, disease infestation and weed seeds.
Do not purchase seeds from the open market as the germination potential is not guaranteed.
Planting poor quality seeds will not produce a good yield,
the institute advised in the handbook.
Conducting germination test
If possible, IITA recommends seed test before planting.
The institute recommends that the germination rate should be 85 percent or more to obtain a good stand.
According to IITA, to conduct a quick seed germination test, select 400 seeds randomly and sow 100 seeds each in four wooden or plastic boxes or a prepared seedbed.
Sow one seed per hole at a distance of 10cm between the seeds.
Soak cloth or paper-lined germination boxes or the seedbed well with water before sowing and provide water every morning and evening.
Start counting the seedlings five days after sowing and complete the counting within 10 days.
A total count of 320 germinated seeds or more indicates a germination rate of 80 percent and above.
When the percentage of germination is 80 percent or less, the seed rate has to be increased accordingly to achieve 100 percent.
Fertiliser application
IITA advises that a good fertiliser recommendation for soya bean production depends on a good soil test.
Under normal conditions, soya bean as a legume should provide itself with nitrogen through biological nitrogen fixation.
Until nodulation occurs, the soya bean plant depends on soil nitrogen for growth.
Phosphorus is often the most deficient nutrient, therefore, apply optimum phosphorous fertiliser for good yield.
The institute further advises farmers to incorporate the fertiliser into the soil during harrowing and levelling of the field.
Pests, diseases and weeds
Perennial and most annual weeds are a problem to soya bean in its early growth stages.
A properly timed weed control programme can minimise the effects of weeds.
Weed control in soya bean could be manual or chemical, or both.
Manual weed control
: Carry out the first weeding at two weeks after planting and the second at five to six weeks after planting.
Avoid weeding immediately after a rainfall as this will lead to transplanting the weeds.
Poor hoe weeding or delay in weeding can cause significant reduction in yield.
Chemical weed control:
Herbicides, if used properly, are safe and effective in controlling weeds in soya bean cultivation.
The choice of herbicide, however, depends on the predominant weed species and the availability of the herbicide.
Herbicides are available for pre-emergence or post-emergence weed control in soya bean.
If herbicide is applied at planting, one weeding may be required at five to six weeks after planting.
Several different insects infest soya bean fields, but few are normally of any economic importance, and the species that cause damage are usually not abundant enough to warrant control measures.
In the vegetative stage, the crop is very tolerant of caterpillars but very susceptible to silverleaf whitefly attack.
Harvest
Soya bean for shelling and fresh use are ready for harvest from 65 days after sowing.
However, dry soya beans require 100 or more days to reach harvest.
Soya bean farmers advise that for green shell beans, soya bean could be harvested when pods are green, full and plump.
FIFA, UEFA licensed agents storm Kano in search of talented players
A team of European scouts under the umbrella of 60 Goals Soccer Star Project has arrived the city of Kano to conduct an U-16 football talent hunt beginning from June 1.
Addressing a press conference Wednesday, the licensed agents said their decision to conduct the scouting programme in Kano was informed by the high number of young and talented players available for selection.
The Chief Executive Officer, 60 Goals Soccer Star Project who is also a FIFA intermediary agent, Jane Ndubuisi added that the project is introduced to empower Kano youths through football.
We are here, therefore, to pick talents and to help them achieve their dreams.
She urged parents to encourage their wards to combine football with education.
On his part, Miroslav Marjanovic expressed hope that as many players as possible would be given the opportunity to showcase their skills during the exercise.
He said Youths from rural areas will be given the opportunity to showcase their talent and the best among them would be selected for trials abroad.
My hope is that many of the players here in Kano are going to succeed for themselves and their immediate society.
In a similar vein, Milan Martinovic noted that the screening is packaged to give youthful players the avenue to express themselves for opportunities to become professional footballers.
For the president of 60 Goals Soccer Star Project and Ex Nigerian U-23 player Francis Ikechukwu, a level playing field will be provided for all the participants.
What we need is talent and
its only your ability that will give you the chance no matter what, because we dont know corruption, he said.
How to use SEEDCODEX to check fake seeds
If you are planning to buy genuine seed, then look for the ones that have SEEDCODEX tag by the National Agricultural Seed Council (NASC).
The SEEDCODEX tag is an electronic seed verification and authentication system attached to every seed pack.
Farmers can scratch it and text the code to a dedicated number for verification.
The Director General of the council, Dr Phillips Ojo, stated this in Abuja at a press briefing to highlight the readiness of the agency to provide quality, certified seeds for the 2020/2021 planting season.
Our call to farmers is that only seeds affixed with the NASC SEEDCODEX tags fall under this category and it should be what they should buy from the shelves of their seed suppliers.
The SEEDCODEX tag, as you are aware, is the output of the NASC electronic seed verification and authentication system that enhances the efficiency of our seed certification and quality assurance scheme which we put in place to prevent seed adulteration by unscrupulous seed merchants.
Farmers should know that all certified seeds packs in Nigeria must carry this authentication tags with code affixed on them for farmers to send to a dedicated number to instantly verify the authenticity of seeds they purchased and report any unscrupulous seed dealers in the national seed space to NASC, Dr Ojo said.

Grisham gave no reasons for her unexpected move.
It remained unclear whether her departure was related to the storming of the Capitol by supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump.
Traffickers conceal drugs inside statue of Blessed Virgin Mary
Drug traffickers looking for a fail-proof way to smuggle illicit drugs decided on the religious route by stuffing their stash in a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus.
NDLEA operatives embedded in two courier companies intercepted the drugs concealed in the statue and some in auto spare parts to be dispatched to Canada and the United Arab Emirates.
A stash of 140 grammes of methamphetamine stuffed inside a statue of Mary headed for the Philippines was intercepted in one of the courier companies.
Another 500 grammes of heroin concealed in auto spare parts headed for Canada was intercepted in a second courier company.
A separate package of 3.1kg of Indian hemp concealed inside spices and another one kilogramme of Indian hemp concealed in local herbs head for the UAE were also seized, according to Femi Babafemi, director of media and advocacy at the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.
In a related development, the NDLEA in sting operations arrested 31 suspects in Ondo State for being in possession of 276 kg of assorted illicit drugs.
Those arrested included seven females.
They were arrested during a two-week raid which began on April 6.
Babafemi said that the sting operations were carried out to curb the increasing rate of drug abuse among youths and even the elderly in Ondo State.
He added that the illicit drugs seized were 74.285kgs of Indian hemp, 267grammes of other psychotropic substances;
201kgs of skuchies (a combination of Indian hemp, tramadol, ethanol, and Zobo).
NDLEA dismantled or destroyed most of the vending spots where the drugs were being dispensed, he said.
In Akwa Ibom, the NDLEA also seized 62.150kg of illicit drugs in Oron and Uyo.
Babafemi quoted the NDLEA commander in the state, Obot Bassey, as saying that four suspects were arrested in two sting operations conducted on April 22 and April 23.
He stated that NDLEA chairman, retired Brig.-Gen.
Buba Marwa, had commended operatives in the two states and those of Operations and General Investigations Directorate in Lagos for their steadfastness.
Pastor Adefarasin, if Nigeria is a scam; then were all scammers
It is the bounden duty of every citizen to hold the government to account.
In fact, citizenship is a call to duty for the state.
And there is no compelling duty which supersedes citizens subjecting their employees the government to scrutiny and constant vigilance.
Criticising the government is within the rights of every citizen, and active citizenship demands taking the government through its paces.
No government is without criticism, and none is too special for criticism.
However, we must distinguish between any government and Nigeria as a country.
Governments will come and go, but Nigeria remains.
We must understand Nigeria is its people.
So, when we cast pejoratives at the country we are only slinging shots at ourselves.
If we say, Nigeria is a scam, inadvertently we are implying, Nigerians are scammers.
Nigeria did not become a scam, as some of those reviling the nation say, by accident; it became whatever it is by the machination of all of us.
Nigeria is not a mere geographical expression.
Nigeria is its people.
The good, the bad and the ugly we made it so.
Whatever is ailing the country we are a vector of the causative factors.
If Nigeria is a scam as alleged by Pastor Paul Adefarasin then we are all scammers.
Though I concede that Adefarasins outburst might have come from a place of patriotism, his cataloguing of Nigeria as a scam and fraud falls short of tact and critical reasoning.
If Nigeria is a fraud; then we are all fraudsters leaders and followers alike.
We all have contributed in no small measure to the discomfiture of the entity.
We live in a country where pastors run their ministries like conglomerates.
They run them like business enterprises but evading tax in the process.
CAMA; a law to regulate the business undertakings of the religious industry and to bring some transparency and accountability into the spiritual business was introduced by the government.
However, the staunchest antagonists of this law have been pastors.
Yet, these same people who do not want to live by the law are the loudest voices when passing capital sentences on Nigeria.
Interestingly, these pastors run their churches in conformity with the law in other countries.
They submit their finances for regular checks by the authorities in the UK, the US and other places.
But in Nigeria they live in triumph of the law.
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has been spreading injurious falsehood regarding COVID vaccine.
He claims it is the concoction of the anti-Christ.
He was fined 125,000 pounds for making potentially harmful and unsubstantiated claims about the vaccine by the UK.
But in Nigeria where he continues to traffic in COVID conspiracies, he has not been made to account for his transgressions because he is a man of god.
Perhaps, this is why Nigeria is a scam.
If Nigeria is a scam, then it is because of pastors who sit on high and trample on the laws governing the land.
If Nigeria is a fraud, then it is because of pastors who go into concordats with politicians every election season; campaigning for them on the pulpit and commanding the bloodhounds of hell against those who do not accept their anointed candidates.
The clergy is as tainted as the political class.
Also, a civil servant, who earns N150,000 monthly but has kids in UK schools and with real estate dotting major cities in the country, will revile Nigeria submerging his own hypocrisy in lamentations and jibes at the state.
He ignores conveniently his complicity in the corruption ravaging the country.
In addition, some citizens spurn laws, rules and regulations.
Where there are traffic lights, they ignore them; where there are procedures, they bypass them, and where there are standards put in place for effective service delivery and operations, they abandon them.
Yet, they all blame â€˜Nigeria for the jeopardous status quo as if the country exists without its people.
The problem with Nigeria is a people problem.
But the tragedy is that no one wants to accept liability for the appalling state of things.
We cast the blame at the feet of abstract Nigeria.
We are all complicit in the degenerative emasculation of Nigeria.
Instead of abiding in wilful fatalism about Nigeria, we should project goodness and positivity into the system while working at making our country what we want it to be.
Nigeria is what we make of it.
The political class is flawed.
But that is the reason a new generation of leaders must emerge and take the reins.
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Citizenship is a call to duty.
NIGERIA IS NOT A SCAM.
Why secession is not the Silver Bullet to Nigerias challenges
The principle of self-determination as enshrined in the UN charter and which our secessionists latch on to was enacted at a time many peoples of the world were under colonial yoke or other forms of domination by outside powers.
The principle was to give fillip to independence and liberation movements in order for them to gain their freedom and determine their path of future development.
In our world today, this principle applies only to a handful of peoples as an overwhelming majority of the world are now free from colonial subjugation and self-governing.
Thus the principle of self-determination, which was enacted under the UN charter, will have to be amended to accommodate the demands of our secessionists because going by its intendment and wordings they hardly qualify.
First of all, they have to prove constructively and convincingly that the areas they purport to represent are under some form of subjugation and that they lack the basic freedoms that all peoples should enjoy as required under the UN charter.
And in the unlikely case of proving that, they will also have to convince the UN of the steps they have taken from the national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to press their case.
And the UN will not just take their word for it.
There will be fact finding committees to determine whether indeed Nigeria as a country practises the basic requirements of democracy or not.
The case is even made trickier by the fact that those areas are neither disputed territories nor under any trusteeship requiring a UN referendum to either confer direct independence to them or ask them which of the competing powers they wished to join.
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.
It does not lend its very elaborate and transparent processes to be abused by movements that hardly know what they are about.
The case of marginalisation, which is also cited as one of the reasons for secession, is too trivial to even waste our time on.
Every democratic system provides for winners and losers in elections.
And as imperfect as our political system is, the constitution compels mandatory representation in government and its institutions for as many ethnic nationalities and geo-political zones as possible.
The secessionist would have a tough time convincing the outside world that their case for marginalisation is more compelling than those of the over 300 other ethnic nationalities inhabiting Nigeria.
In other words, why would the international community, to which the secessionists address their grievances and from which they seek support for their cause, single out just two out of the hundreds of such cases ringing in the Nigerian media for action?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?
On all the three premises that our secessionists base their agitations, none is convincing or compelling enough to justify their actions.
On the amalgamation argument, Nigeria is not a unique case in Africa or indeed the world.
If Nigeria has to be broken up because it was wrongly amalgamated by Britain, then this applies to virtually all but a few countries in Africa.
In essence if this principle were to be applied it will set the course for the commencement of a new scramble for Africa by the old and emerging powers of the world in which Africans as before will be the victims.
Let us not deceive ourselves for the disintegration of Nigeria if it happens (God forbid) will result in the emergence of entities
too weak such that they will find themselves at the mercy of foreign powers.
Some arguments have been made of a break up of Nigeria along the lines of Eastern European states and in the Balkans.
In this regard, it will serve us well to discern that what works for Europe may not necessarily work for Africa.
In the case of the aforementioned countries, it was part of great geo-strategic games of the major world powers who had direct cultural, economic and political links and interests in the emerging scenarios.
And these countries had defined borders before they agreed to come together for mutual defence in the uncertain situation of the Second World War.
Once the Soviet order, which held them together, began to unravel the need arose for the peripheral countries to revert to the status quo ante.
And, more importantly, these developments had the backing and guarantees of the principal powers in Europe and the world in the quest for a balance of power.
Do Nigerian secessionists have such reckoning and profile in the calculations of the principal powers of the world to warrant their time?
The answer obviously is zilch.
This is, however, not dismissing that the agitations for secession in the country do not have some justifiable basis.
Anybody living in this country with the rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainties amidst the unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of the government to these challenges will conclude that indeed we have a state that is failing in its basic constitutional duties and responsibilities.
And in a fragile country like ours with gaping fault lines, tendencies or preferences for dissolution of the union are bound to emerge and grow exponentially along with the clear dysfunctionality of the government of the day.
And these feelings are all round.
But daunting as the outlook is and tempting as the prospect appears, secession cannot be the solution to our existential challenges as a nation.
Indeed it is a prospect fraught with lurking uncertain dangers not least for its proponents but for the country as a whole.
Nigeria is not imperfect.
Even some of the advanced countries have shown that despite years of existence and well defined systems, they are not immune from crises arising from internal contradictions.
We should not delude ourselves that in trying to break up our country, some countries will benevolently assist us.
What they will do is provide us with the means to destroy and weaken ourselves in the process and then proceed to profit from that at our own expense.
That is the reality of the international system.
As the distinguished German beamter at the beginning of my article said and advised; we are at once our own problems and our own solutions.
We must put our thoughts, talents and efforts collectively to developing Nigeria rather than breaking it up.
Fidelity marks Childrens Day with N9.3m cash gift to customers
To mark this years Childrens Day, Fidelity Bank paid N150,000 to 62 Sweet Account (SWEETA) holders across the country amounting to a total of N9.3 million through its ongoing savings loyalty programme.
The bank presented cheques to the beneficiaries at various childrens events in Katsina, Niger, Abuja and Lagos.
Commenting on the initiative, Fidelity Bank CEO, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, said, All-round quality education remains a strong anchor in raising tomorrows children and breeding exceptional children who can compete globally.
This is why we have decided to contribute our quota as a bank by offering school fees support to select Nigerian children.
The bank has given out N4.1bn to 10,280 customers from the inception of the loyalty scheme to date.
Investing in young people: The Ahmed Bobboi example
In July, 2017, I had the singular honour of spending an evening inside a British bank called Coutts as part of the many activities lined up for us as the 2017 Queens Young Leaders.
You may wonder why I would be writing about attending an event in a place as boring as a bank.
However, Coutts is no ordinary bank.
Apart from being one of the eight oldest banks in the world (founded some 329 years ago in 1692), Coutts is a private bank known for its high ranking clientele like Her Majesty the Queen.
Walking inside the vast hall, we were welcomed by two men under a great dome in the centre of the building.
I immediately recognised one of the two men who stood with a familiar wide smile.
It was Sir John Major, a former British Prime Minister and Chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.
We had met earlier at a dinner in our honor in the Australian High Commission in London where he congratulated us for our recognition by Her Majesty.
The other man was introduced to us as Lord William Waldegrave of North Hill, Chairman of the Board of Coutts Bank and Chairman of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee.
We had a splendid evening full of entertainment; eating and drinking.
But beyond the pomp and glamour were the speeches and interactions with Lord Waldegarve and Sir Major, two outstanding leaders in the United Kingdom (UK).
They expressed delight at celebrating our achievements and described us as extraordinary individuals, charging us to develop our skills even further and create lasting legacies for our countries and the Commonwealth at large.
Subsequently, I spoke privately to both Sir Major and Lord Wadegrave, asking them specific questions ranging from public service to banking and finance to innovation and young people.
I learned immensely from them
and I left Coutts
that night tremendously inspired and motivated to be an even more active change agent, innovator and young leader back in Nigeria.
Whether you are in government or in business, and especially as an innovator or entrepreneur, I cannot overemphasise how crucial these types of inspirations can be for the work you do.
Some may write off these validations as irrelevant, forgetting how instances like such provide a great deal of mentorship, motivation, as well as create examples for aspiring leaders to see champions among people like themselves.
The feeling of validation and motivation coupled with guidance and support is an absolutely necessary ingredient for all leaders and especially young people.
The earlier our older generation in Nigeria realises it and wholeheartedly embraces this culture of support, mentorship and indeed celebration of our achievements, the better for the future of this country and its burgeoning population of young people.
Forgive my digression.
The reason I am narrating this encounter is that for a long time since it happened, I did not quite experience anything like it until recently when I sat with another public servant in Nigeria, the Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Equalisation Fund
(Management) Board (PEF-M-B), Alhaji Ahmed A Bobboi.
Whereas oil and gas is not my main industry of discipline or practice, I am of the firm opinion that not being knowledgeable about it is very reckless since the sectors revenue contribution
far outweighs any non-oil revenue source to the country.
So I have kept myself abreast of the industry even as I advocate for a transition and dedication to non-oil sources of income.
I was delighted by the opportunity to engage with a crucial stakeholder in the person of the executive, especially because the organisation is a pacesetter in deploying cutting edge technology to improve efficiency and performance in the sector.
However, what I got from this encounter was even more valuable than just further understanding of the industry.
We discussed on topics ranging from history to governance and from job creation to innovation and entrepreneurship.
It was so exhilarating and refreshing and it transported me directly to Coutts once again.
I had met Mr Bobboi for the first time when I joined a team which he co-champions, working on a regional entrepreneurship acceleration programme under the auspices of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where communities around the world engage with MIT in an evidence-based practical approach to strengthening innovation-driven entrepreneurial ecosystems.
I was immediately struck by the vision and dedication that this spells for PEF-M-B to be involved in this project as it is certainly visionary and more beneficial to help build a formidable entrepreneurial ecosystem with a partner like MIT than the usually mundane and often barely impactful Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes most institutions engage in.
During that particular encounter with him, we discussed about our two-year programme with MIT and the huge burden of truly accelerating entrepreneurial development as a remedy to lack of jobs and a catalyst for prosperity.
The He spoke about various pain points for him as a leader and the approach to solve them.
One of my most brilliant takeaways was his idea on the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and how it could be hacked to serve young graduates and the nation better.
Noticing the idleness of some of the corps members serving at PEF-M-B, the executive secretary said he had been devising ways of not only ensuring that they were engaged, but that they left with lasting skills and knowledge that would inform career paths for them beyond government jobs.
This includes an elaborate programme to turn them into innovation-driven entrepreneurs through a dedicated and well curated innovation and enterprise training during their service year at PEF-MB.
The ingenuity and candid disposition of Mr. Bobboi was apparent and permeated throughout our discussion and I was left with an equally firm will to do my best in not only continually innovating across sectors but also ensuring continuity in cascading the inspiration and support for younger leaders and innovators, which could make all the difference for our dear country Nigeria.
Lagos LG polls: Aspirants to face direct primary as consensus option fails
Ahead of the July local government election in Lagos State, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will conduct an open primary for aspirants in the 20 local government areas (LGs) and 37 local council development areas (LCDAs), Daily Trust can report.
It was, however, learnt that there are some local governments where consensus option had been agreed upon.
Our correspondent gathered yesterday that the resort to the open primary followed the inability of aspirants to step down for one another amidst tension and disquiet among the LG chapters.
It would be recalled that 1050 aspirants comprising 250 chairmanship and 800 councillorship aspirants are vying for the 434 positions in the 57 LGs.
The party had been in a fix over a large number of aspirants while setting up a screening committee headed by the Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Hamza.
As of the time of filing this report, aspirants were anxiously awaiting the result of the screening.
A local government chairman who is contesting for a second term in a chat with our correspondent said an open primary would take place on Saturday, May 29, 2021, saying he is ready to face two other aspirants challenging him to the ticket.
Daily Trust reports that the party had already issued guidelines to the aspirants ahead of the open primary in a local government where consensus could not be agreed upon.
According to the guidelines sighted by Daily Trust, Accredited members shall vote by open ballot at the designated venue by queuing up in front of the poster of their preferred candidate and
the aspirant with the highest number of votes shall be announced as the winner accordingly.
Following the widespread report about the endorsement of some candidates by the APC National Leader and strongman of Lagos politics, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the former governor had come out to debunk the claim, saying he has no preferred candidate.
In a chat with Daily Trust, the Publicity Secretary of the state Caretaker Committee, Seye Oladejo said, The guidelines are explicit that open direct primaries should be conducted.
The party is irrevocably committed to internal democracy and provide a level playing ground for all aspirants.
UK MPS Demand Boycott of 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics
Calls to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics have been intensifying steadily due to Chinas alleged human rights abuses, particularly in the Xinjiang region against the Uyghur Muslims.
The evidence that a genocide is now occurring in western China is so clear, that the UK and the whole world must now stand up to Beijing and use every available tool to stop it, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Labour MP Chris Bryant, a member of the foreign affairs select committee and a former junior foreign minister wrote on the Liberal Democrats website this month.
We must remember when we failed to stand up against human rights abuses in the past, and recall the images from British sporting history like the England football teams
Nazi salutes in the 1930s and the rebel cricket tours to South Africa in the 1980s, Davey said while calling upon the government and the British Olympic Association to act.
Team GB (Great Brittain), ParalympicsGB and the Government have a moral responsibility to consider if sending a team to these Games
is really the right thing to do.
The 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games will be used as a propaganda tool for a regime committing genocide, he added.
Recently, Canadas main opposition party, the Conservative Party, urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau-led government to pressure the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Beijing, arguing China is committing genocide against more than one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
This comes after a coalition of 180 human rights groups urged governments around the world to boycott the Beijing Winter Olympic Games slated for next year due to Chinas reported human rights abuses towards minorities.
The letter calls on countries to refuse participation in the games and to ensure they are not used to embolden the Chinese governments appalling rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent.
The IOC said in a statement that the committees policy for its organising committees is to hear all concerns directly related to the Olympic Games.
For the Beijing Winter Olympics specifically, the IOC said its Evaluation Committee listened to the views of several NGOs, including concerns about human rights.
The committee cited its position that it shared with groups that IOC must remain neutral on all global political issues although it may not agree with the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in its country.
Chinas Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, on the other hand labelled the calls for boycott as highly irresponsible.
The calls for boycotting next years winter Olympics came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he agrees with the former President Donald Trump administrations characterization of the abuse of Uyghurs in China as genocide.
We are working on post-harvest techs Provost, Kano Agric College
Dr Halima Alimi, the Acting Provost, Federal College of Agricultural Produce Technology (FCAPT), Kano, says the institute would develop quality post-harvest technologies for the country.
Alimi told newsmen in Kano that the new management of the institution had adopted proactive programmes to encourage research as well as create enabling teaching and learning environment for growth of post-harvest processing.
She said the management was geared to change the narrative through the introduction of new preservation technologies, reduce wastes and boost agricultural processing.
We will ensure sanity among the staff and students, we shall improve on staff development geared to ensure conducive working and learning environment, she said.
According to her, the college offers Ordinary National Diploma (OND) and Higher
National Diploma (HND) programmes in various fields of agriculture.
Our mandate is on post-harvest science; how to handle agricultural produce after harvest and this includes storage, preservation as well as processing.
This is the only school in the country that has this mandate, she said.
The provost therefore urged farmers to utilise innovations and other studies being executed by the college to improve their productivity.
Tuition hike: Police prevent students protest at Kaduna Government House
Police and State Vigilantes Service personnel on Tuesday prevented the protesting students of Kaduna State University from marching towards the Government House.
The students were protesting against the tuition fees increase by the state government.
Daily Trust observed that the angry-looking students were singing solidarity songs as they marched towards the government house before they were blocked by the police.
Heavily armed police personnel in vehicles and vigilantes operating under KADVIS were seen on the main road keeping vigil while the students sat on the floor in the middle of the road.
It could be recalled that the state government and management of the university had refused to reverse the fees despite pleas by students and their parents in the state.
One of the students representatives, Comrade Auba Mohammed, said they were marching towards the government house to just submit a letter of complaint to Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
He said the majority of them are orphans and that their parents cannot afford to pay for them.
Zimbabwes VP resigns amid sexual misconduct allegations
Zimbabwes Vice President, Kembo Mohadi, resigned on Monday in the face of sexual misconduct allegations, apologising for tasks he failed to do well.
Local news outlets have since late last month been awash with audio recordings of phone conversations allegedly of Mohadi soliciting sex from several women, including a subordinate in his office.
First published by online publication ZimLive, the clips included one where a man can be heard scheduling to meet for sex at his office.
I am stepping down as the Vice President of the Republic of Zimbabwe â€¦with immediate effect, the 71-year-old leader said in a letter posted on the information ministrys
He had decided to leave office not as a matter of cowardice but out of respect for the office of the presidency so that it is not compromised or caricatured by actions that are linked to my challenges as an individual.
I have been going through a soul searching pilgrimage and realised that I need the space to deal with my problems outside the governance chair, he said.
He repeated his denial of any wrongdoing, saying he was a victim of information distortion, voice cloning, and sponsored spooking and political sabotage.
Mohadi, a retired soldier and veteran of the countrys liberation war, was one of Zimbabwes two vice presidents.
He served in several ministerial positions under former president Robert Mugabe and was appointed vice president in 2017 following Mugabes ouster.
Technologies arm professional farmers in China
Human resources are of huge importance for Chinas rural vitalization.
At present, there are over 17 million high-calibre farmers working in the countryside to prosper the rural regions.
The improved scientific literacy of Chinese farmers has laid a solid foundation for their overall development and is offering stronger support for the countrys rural economy.
Bao Yuan is a young man running an aquatic product company in Qujing, southwest Chinas Yunnan province that he established in 2014 after graduating from Yunnan Normal University in 2014.
Artificial breeding not only diversifies peoples choices, but also helps protect endangered local fish species, he said.
Song Xueqin is a Gen Y female who has made her name in the Lvliang Mountains, north Chinas
Shanxi province by flat peach grafting techniques.
After graduation from college, Song was successively engaged in catering business, gypsum processing and sheep husbandry, but didnt succeed in any of those.
In 2009, she heard that Chinese wild peaches can be turned into flat peaches through grafting techniques, so she asked one of her friends to bring her scions of flat peaches from northwest Chinas Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and invited an expert to impart relevant skills to her.
A year later, Song and her husband grafted flat peach scions onto over 4,000 wild peaches on a hillside near Hetaozhang village, Fenxi County, Shanxi province, but the fruiting wasnt good.
After consulting relevant materials and experts, we finally realized what cross-pollination was.
The yield goes high only when varieties grafted match, she said.
Last year, the woman received her first certification of her life â€“ a certificate for new professional farmers.
The countryside is never short of resources.
In recent years, as peoples living standards have been raised, they are developing a larger demand for green and high-quality agricultural products.
This trend is mobilizing more and more well-educated entrepreneurs who are technically skilled and know how to operate and manage businesses to go back to the countryside, said Zuo Chenming, a senior researcher with AliResearch, a research arm of Alibaba Group.
Early in the morning, Mi Xiaohong from Yuzhong County, Lanzhou, northwest Chinas Gansu province started working in a cowshed, serving the cattle with new fodder and water and cleaning the cowshed.
The making of cattle fodder is complicated, as we must calculate how much grass and other materials we add in it and fairly decide the ratios of bran, glacial flour and salt, she told Peoples Daily, adding that the ingredients have to be adjusted according to different growth periods of the cattle.
Mi, always attending training programs held by the county government, has become a specialist in cattle husbandry.
I made many detours as a layman, but now Im often consulted by fellow villagers, she said, adding that only by continuous learning can she solve more problems.
Today, local authorities across China are issuing new policies and measures to encourage farmers to study technologies.
Shandong province has launched a professional title evaluation system for professional farmers, and Jiangsu provinces Kunshan is offering free college education for professional farmers.
In Gansu Province, training sessions are launched for heads of professional cooperatives and animal epidemic prevention coordinators, in an effort to bring technologies to the farmland and find solutions to agricultural problems.
2023: Group launches #BringBackGEJ project, pledges to fund campaigns
A group under the aegis of Youths Earnestly Demand For
Goodluck E.Jonathan (YED4GEJ 2023) has asked former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest the 2023 presidential election.
Jonathan lost power to the candidate of the then opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) in the 2015 general election, thus, putting an end to the 16 years of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) reign in the country.
National Chairman of the group, Prince Teddy Omiloli and National Director Operations, Comrade Douye Daniel in a statement on Sunday expressed optimism that Jonathan would tackle the challenges bedeviling the country if given the mandate.
The group explained that Jonathan saw the need to restructure Nigeria while in power and called for a national confab in 2014, but was not allowed to implement it, as he was voted out of office, hence the need to give him another chance.
At this point in time, after a vivid look into the ideologies and activities of our present political players which includes the youths and elders, we saw in Goodluck Jonathan, a true democrat, a nation builder, a divine inspired goal oriented leader of integrity that has the solution to the present Nigeria problems.
He (Jonathan) has proven that he can sacrifice anything to ensure the unity, peace and development of our great nation Nigeria.
We, as youths of this great nation after discovering the Nigeria problems and found the solution in Goodluck Jonathan, we are calling on all Nigerians including our political elites, present administration and religious leaders to join the call for the return of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and also join our #BringbackGEJ project.
We the youths are ready to purchase President Jonathans form in any party he chooses to flag from and we will fund his electioneering campaign from the beginning to end the moment he accepts this divine call, the group said.
Rice sufficiency: Nigeria has a long way to go Expert
Dr Philip Idinoba, a rice commodity specialist with AfricaRice, has raised concerns over increasing population that is eroding Federal Governments effort toward boosting rice production.
Idinoba expressed the concern in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gombe on Tuesday.
He said that there is need for more government investment on rice to boost Nigerias food security.
According to him, the government is doing a lot to boost rice production, being a staple food, but the growing population of the country is eroding such gains.
He said that the rate of urbanisation, which is one of the key drivers of rice consumption in Nigeria, was far higher than the rate at which rice cultivation was being improved.
Nigeria still has a long way to go in terms of rice sufficiency.
We are making efforts every year through the Anchor Borrowers Programme, special intervention programme and other donor funded projects.
These are to bring certain things that will help farmers increase yields and productivity.
But in spite of these Federal Government efforts, the number of new mouths we are adding yearly writes off all these improvements, Idinoba said.
A lot to be done
The agronomist added that a lot needed to be done through increased investments, especially in dry season farming.
Dry season farming, according to him, can be leveraged on to boost rice productivity.
We will have better result in rice production if we will be able to close the gaps that dry season often writes off in rice cultivation.
According to him, if you have eight million farmers cultivating rice in the wet season and only two million of them cultivate rice in the dry season, then the efforts are not enough yet.
Idinoba, who is also a water management specialist, advised farmers in flood-prone areas in the country to plant flood-tolerant varieties that could survive in water between three and four weeks.
These varieties, which were released three years ago and being multiplied by the National Seeds Council of Nigeria and other seeds companies, he said, were available and could be accessed by farmers.
This year, the kind of stories we heard from farmers in Kebbi, Jigawa and Adamawa, with this kind of varieties, you may not have total failure like that.
Hence, integrating such technologies will help in a way.
The rice specialist added that in such areas, there should be improvement in the cropping environment through the construction of water structures to control, retain or evacuate water.
Volleyball: JVC Bauchi eye Premier League ticket
The Coach JVC volleyball club of Bauchi, Monday Dada has said his team is eager to gain promotion to the Nigerian Premier League.
The coach made this known Wednesday after his side defeated Oyo State 3-1 (25-23, 25-21, 28-30, 25-22) at the ongoing 2021 National Division 1 Volleyball League in Kaduna.
He said based on the calibre of players in the team, JVC of Bauchi belongs to the Premier League class.
JVC of Bauchi is in the Division 1 league to gain promotion to next seasons premier league because that is where the big guns are and that is what we are aiming for.
We do not expect anything apart from getting the ticket, he said.
Dada also took responsibility for the failure of his team to beat Kwara State on Tuesday as he said it was due to his technical mistakes.
In other matches played yesterday, Spartans Spikers of Yola lost 2-3 (21-25, 22-25, 25-17, 25-21, 12-15) to Kwara United, Katsina United spanked Caliphate Spikers of Sokoto 3-1 (25-23, 25-19, 22-25, 25-12) while Kada Kings thrashed Equity Spikers of Kebbi 3-0 (25-14, 25-15, 25-14).
What Kano needs in 2023
Kano needs to chart a new path to development in 2023.
This is because the state is sliding into the pit of poverty.
Our rich pre-colonial history indicates that Kano was the richest of all Hausa states because of state involvement in the economy.
Although, the colonialists destroyed the economic foundation of Kano and other colonised societies the policies of those who led the Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contributed to maintaining Kano as the leading economic centre of Northern Nigeria.
For example, they established the first modern water treatment plant in the region in 1931, the first independent power plant in Northern Nigeria of 15mw and for over 80 years, no similar one has been established in Northern Nigeria.
They established the first industrial estate in the Northern Region, they inherited one primary school in 1926 and by 1963 every village had a primary school (hundreds), they established secondary schools, they inherited no hospital (but one dispensary) and by 1963 there were two general hospitals and hundreds of dispensaries in every village headed by Dagachi had one.
They laid the foundation of modern Kano.
Politically, they made the NPC to become the ruling party of Nigeria.
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintained its position as second to Lagos.
Kano does not have control over macro-economic policies but its leaders can provide the enabling environment for economic growth.
For example, the Dawanau Market, which is the largest grains market in West Africa bringing people from all parts of the continent from as far as Gabon and Congo.
This was all as a result of the foresight of Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless his soul), who established the market.
The three administrations that governed Kano from 1999 to date, could all claim that each one of them was the best thing that has happened to Kano but why has Kano degenerated to number nine in Nigeria?
There is no single project that has brought any significant economic change in Kano despite several efforts by concerned individuals.
If there is elite focus and determination, with state leadership as it was in the pre-colonial period, Kano would not have gone down to number nine in Nigeria with a GDP of $13.30b after Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).
The catastrophe in the next 10 years if not averted now, will be beyond our imagination.
This is because of many reasons, one of which is we have over four million pupils in public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 they would have completed secondary education.
Assuming only 10 percent of them (400,000) will proceed to higher-level can the government fund their education?
After completing higher education, can the economy absorb them with gainful employment?
At the current state of development, it cannot.
This is because, there are over 250 medical doctors and over 1000 nurses sponsored by the state government, who could not be absorbed despite the need.
We keep deceiving ourselves with so-called skills acquisition programmes that train artisans who will not get any job after acquiring the skills because the local economy cannot absorb them.
Every day we hear billions allocated by the federal government for one economic programme or the other and yet our ideas are never beyond training plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.
Our ideas, so far, are not about harnessing resources for the employment of a larger population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) did when he started the city walls.
We have to think out of the box.
Kano does not need a superhuman being with the best qualifications and experience or a saint as the next governor.
This is because the governors in the last 20 years possessed some of the best qualities and might have even done their best but as we can all see, the outcome has not been the best for the state.
Therefore, we must think out of the box.
The two parties APC and PDP cannot provide the desired leadership because they are controlled by godfathers, not ideologically driven, but mainly concerned with sharing of state resources.
The best they can offer is to negotiate for a governor who will serve the interest of a godfather or a clique.
Therefore, the two parties are not the best options.
A very good person could emerge using his resources or with the help of other well-meaning patriotic people.
He could win through any efforts including negotiating with even any of the two parties or another party.
This is a possibility.
It has happened before.
An example, in the neighbouring Kaduna State, is Nasir Elrufai.
He is one of the best in his generation but security in the state is beyond him because he depends on his personal intelligence and capacity.
A better person than him in Kano will not make it the desired place unless certain fundamentals are changed.
I do not claim to have all the answers or even to be exclusively original in the ideas below.
Some of them are even modifications of Aminu Kanos ideas.
There are many better ideas in the minds of more intelligent people.
The ideas I am suggesting are based on my little experience as a labourer of politicians and some training outside this country.
Kano is on the crossroad, therefore, these ideas could be useful.
Some people need to come together and organise a political movement not owned by any individual but people willing to sacrifice.
It should kindly consider the suggestions below:
There is a need to initiate political organisation at the lowest level and making the members own it.
No material reward but sacrifice.
This is possible with mobilisation and the right messages.
Before the election, the movement or party must take a comprehensive inventory of the state and design a comprehensive action plan with specific measurable targets.
There should be operational guidelines for all appointees including the governor, which must be popularised for every citizen to know and challenge if breeched.
No one who seeks any position should be given such a position in the movement or party from the lowest level to the highest.
Some will argue this kills ambition.
What is needed now is not ambition but a sustainable system owned by the people.
Similarly, no one should be given any position until he fulfils certain basic conditions of competence and honesty as well as bringing references and guarantors.
All public officials must publicly declare their assets and those of their family members on the assumption of office, which must be verified by forensic experts.
Their salaries, expenses (including travels, entertainment etc) must be made public periodically.
No one who becomes a governor or attains any position should ever be allowed to act unilaterally.
The governor must never be allowed
To make appointments unilaterally.
There must be criteria, expectations or set targets for such appointments for periodic assessments and evaluations;
All contracts must be transparently awarded after evaluation by experts from within and outside the bureaucracy.
Allocations of plots must also be transparent.
No governor should be allowed to have absolute control of the treasury and it should be administered by competent staff.
The governor should only be seen as the leader who guides institutions to develop and end one-man rule.
If the governor is liberated from this prison of power, he will lead the state to greatness.
He will lead by example and corruption will be minimised because the avenues of abuse of power have been blocked.
A governor should be seen to supervise public servants and ensure everyone performs his duties diligently.
He should inspire his people with exemplary lifestyles, commitment to service and transparency.

Niger republic, 6 other countries lose right to vote in UNGA -Guterres
Niger and six other nations lost their right to vote in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) because they have not paid their dues, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.
The other countries losing their UNGA voting rights are Iran, Libya, the Central African Republic, Congo Brazzaville, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, the Jerusalem Post reported on Tuesday.
Three more countries Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe and Somalia will be allowed to continue to vote despite missing dues payments, because they sufficiently demonstrated that they are incapable of paying.
Guterres wrote a letter to General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir of Turkey that the countries in arrears to the UN will have their UNGA voting rights suspended in accordance with the UN Charter.
The Charter stipulates the suspension of voting rights if a member state fails to pay its fees for more than two years, the report said.
Under the article, a member-state in arrears in the payment of its dues in an amount that equals or exceeds the contributions of two preceding years can lose its vote in the General Assembly.
Iran owes 16.2 million dollars, more than any other country.
Meanwhile, Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for blocking the Islamic Republic from paying its required contribution to the UN, the newspaper reported.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said the funds designated for UN payments are frozen in two South Korean banks, due to the U.S. sanctions.
He said the Islamic Republic has a total of USD 7 billion in those banks, the report said.
Khatibzadeh demanded that the UN guarantee the payments are safely transferred without using U.S. banks.
Given that the United States has encroached upon Irans international assets before, the Islamic Republic of Iran insists that the UN not use an American intermediary bank to receive our countrys membership fee.
Alternatively, this organization guarantee the financial transfer channel, Iran International News quoted Khatibzadeh as saying.
BREAKING: Paris Saint-Germain win French Cup
Paris Saint-Germain have won the French Cup by beating Monaco 2-0 in Wednesdays
final at the Stade de France.
Goals from Mauro Icardi and Kylian Mbappe won a largely uninspiring final for PSG who now go into the weekends final round of Ligue 1 fixtures with a record-equalling 10th league title still a possibility.
The French champions have now won the French Cup six times in the last seven seasons having reached the final every year since 2015.
It was also the second trophy of coach Mauricio Pochettinos managerial career after he won the Champions Trophy for PSG in January, although this will for many count as his first major honour.
We work every day to experience this kind of feeling, reward and recognition, said Mbappe.
Its the work of a whole group, staff, all the people who work every day for us, the club and of course the supporters who couldnt be there.
We think a lot about the fans and this title is for them as well.
Monaco meanwhile continue their wait to win the French Cup for the first time since 1991, in their first final since 2010 when they were also beaten by PSG.
Niko Kovacs side have however had a positive season and can finish it on a happier note at the weekend by qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2018.
Maiden Davnotch Tennis Championship attracts 300 players
No fewer than 300 players are expected to participate in the maiden Davnotch National Open Tennis Championship coming up between May 14 and 22 at tennis courts of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.
Ifedayo Akindoju, Chairman Caretaker Committee of the Nigeria Tennis Federation (NTF) said this in Abuja on Monday while briefing newsmen on preparations for the championship.
He said about a N3.5million would be raked at the end of the championship as prize by the winners of the various categories.
Akindoju also said that the championship would serve as the federations hunting ground for talents for the national team ahead of several international competitions lined up for the federation this year.
I can tell you the winner of the mens singles and the ladies singles will go home with N500,000 and for the Wheelchair event (male and female), it is N150, 000 each.
Wheelchair event is not actually an open event, and as such it is for the top 16 athletes in the ladder.
Recently in Lagos, we had a ladder tournament on wheelchair alone, so we have the latest rankings of all wheelchair players in Nigeria, and because it is closed, we have top 16 in men and top 16 in women to compete in this event.
We equally have the doubles event for the men; the winner will take home N100,000 and this will be the same for the ladies, Akindoju said.
According to him, the championship is open for athletes who are 14 years and above.
Also speaking, Emmanuel Ochei, a representative of Davnotch Nigeria Ltd, said the company was sponsoring the championship as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and that it would not relent in lending support for sports development.
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has revealed that it is currently considering equity participation in a number of private refineries in the country.
The NNPC in a statement Monday night said the move is in line with a Federal Governments policy directive, which stipulates the mandatory participation of the Corporation in any privately-owned refinery that exceeds 50,000 barrels per day capacity in keeping with its statutory role of safeguarding national energy security.
In this regard, the Corporation has identified at least six refinery projects in which it intends to seek equity participation, five of them are at the development stage with the Dangote Refinery being the largest of them, the statement said.
The statement by the Corporations spokesperson, Dr Kennie Obateru, explained that NNPCs National Oil Company of Nigeria primarily has a dual role of providing stewardship for the nations hydrocarbon resources and adding value to the resources for the benefit of all Nigerians and other stakeholders.
These roles enable it to achieve the twin objectives of providing energy security for the country and stimulating the nations economic development and growth, Obateru said.
He said that NNPCs strategic objective to ensure energy security and stimulate economic growth with limited resources requires it to consider strategic partnerships with competent investors in sectors of the oil and gas value chain especially where it currently operates on a sole risk basis.
The oil refining sector is one of such segments where NNPC is revisiting its strategy in order to strengthen domestic refining capacity and guarantee National Energy Security, he added.
He said the new vision is to grow domestic refining capacity, improve petroleum products supply from our local refineries and become a net exporter of petroleum products.
The Corporation assured that the move to seek equity participation in the private refineries would not undercut its commitment to the rehabilitation of its own refineries and strengthen the domestic refining sector.
Obateru stressed that the overall goal is to boost the nations refining capacity with a view to becoming a net exporter of petroleum products in the soonest possible time and boosting the nations economy.
Amaechi, Lai Mohammed inspect Lagos-Ibadan rail project ahead of commissioning
Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi and his Information and Culture counterpart,
Alhaji Lai Mohammed are inspecting the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge project ahead of the commissioning by President Muhammadu Buhari.
Daily Trust reports that though no specific date has been fixed for the commissioning, it has been slated for June.
Our correspondent gathered that the $1.7bn project with extension to the Lagos Ports in Apapa might be commissioned on or before June 12 to commemorate Democracy Day.
This was why the Ministers are conducting another inspection to ensure that all the finishing touches on the project were fully carried out.
Daily Trust had earlier reported how the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC), the contractor handling the project, has been pressured to deliver all the 10 stations ahead of the commissioning.
The stations are Ebute-Metta, Apapa, Agege, Agbado, Kajola, Papalanto, Abeokuta, Omi Adio, Olodo and Moniya.
Most of the stations have reached almost 90 to 100 percent completion stage while only finishing touches were being done.
The Ministers, as well as the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Transport, Dr Magdalene Ajani, Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Engr Fidet Okhiria and other officials of the Ministry, started the inspection from the Mobolaji Johnson Station (Ebute-Metta) before heading to the Bola Tinubu Station (Apapa).
The Ebute-Metta Station is the biggest station in the train corridor.
The Ministerial team inspected all the convenience facilities, the operational rooms, the nursing room, the waiting areas, among others.
Zimbabwe loses 2 more ministers to COVID-19
Two ministers serving in the Zimbabwean government died of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) within a matter of days, prompting the country to announce on Saturday plans to further tighten lockdown measures.
Late on Friday, the government announced that Transport Minister, Joel Matiza, had died after falling ill with COVID-19, less than two days after the country lost Foreign minister Sibusiso Moyo to the same disease.
Four government ministers have succumbed to the coronavirus in Zimbabwe so far.
According to unconfirmed media reports, several other cabinet ministers are fighting for their lives in a private hospital.
We are in a dark cloud that we have to clear very soon, deputy health minister John Mangwiro told dpa.
Mangwiro revealed plans to intensify the current lockdown, which has been in place since early January and includes a strict nightly curfew.
Restaurants, bars and gyms have also been forced to close.
We have seen people not adhering to the lockdown regulations announced early this month, he added.
Zimbabwe has registered 30,523 cases of infection since the start of the pandemic, including 962 deaths.
The numbers may seem relatively low compared to other countries.
However, the outbreak is putting the nations health system under considerable pressure.
Zimbabweans have taken to the social media to blame President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his predecessor, the late Robert Mugabe, for the countrys dilapidated health infrastructure.
Health workers recently went on strike over a lack of protective equipment and poor salaries.
How Kadunas N2tr economy struggles with shutdown
Kaduna state, especially its metropolis witnessed what was described as a major shutdown on Monday as the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) protested the mass sack of workers by the state government.
There are fears that the shutdown which affected the transport, finance and power sectors could affect the robust economy of the state believed to be among the top performers in Nigeria.
According to a statistics report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released in 2019, as of 2017, Kaduna has a nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of N2.69 trillion and ranked as the 10th largest economy in Nigeria.
Services and agriculture dominated the GDP by N1.37tr.
However, these services were worst affected by the mass shutdown yesterday which became widespread since Sunday.
According to a 2020 report by the Oxford Business Group, since 2015, the state has attracted investments in excess of $800 million.
At the moment, companies have committed to investing about $2.1 billion over the next two years.
In terms of IGR, the Oxford Business Group report quoted Governor Nasir el-Rufai as saying the state doubled its IGR from N13bn in 2015 to N26bn in 2017.
It further rose to N44bn in taxes in 2019 after the tax process became simplified through legislation.
Daily Trust further learnt that some of the industries outside the city centre were not affected.
Olam Farms located on the outskirt of the Kaduna Abuja road was not affected as its staff members were in the office yesterday after the Sallah break
We are aware of the situation
but you know we are not really in the city centre
, so I dont think we need to bother ourselves at least for now, said a senior official.
Billions lost already
Meanwhile, experts said billions of naira would have been lost to the grounding of businesses in the state.
An ex banker and economist said the strike would have been avoided if the state governor had negotiated with the unions.
Goods are transported to the north through Kaduna and from the north through Kaduna to other parts of Nigeria.
Imagine the losses because of the power outage, the logistics, transportation and others.
It runs into billions imagine the hospitals, hotels, transportation, micro businesses that have shut down.
The economy is crippled.
It will further increase the very bad security situation.
John Okon, another analyst said over N50 million may have been lost in the two days so far especially as power outages persisted and fuel stations were shutting down.

Arteta must deliver next season
As I have already mentioned, Arsenal do not intend to sack Mikel Arteta and the club management will back him to turn the Gunners around next season.
No one can say for certain if Arsenal have made the right decision but the club intends to bring in more talented players this summer.
Serious questions are being asked about the managers ability and even in his own dressing room players are looking at him and wondering if he is the right man for the job.
At 39 years-of-age Arteta has a reputation, built alongside Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.
However, after seventeen months in charge the fortunes of Arsenal have not progressed and many would argue that the team performances are inferior to those of Unai Emery, the man he replaced and who knocked him out of the Europa League.
Arteta captained Arsenal and was welcomed by the fans as their new champion but they are getting restless and agitated as they watch Chelsea and Tottenham move further ahead.
The Super League disaster will not be forgotten for a long time
but I can tell you that the Kroenke owners are going nowhere
so it is up to Arteta to mend bridges, build a strong team and get his tactics right next season otherwise the proud Gunners could well crash and burn.
De Gea wont accept being No2
Despite Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea having a contract until 2023 his agents are testing the waters to see which clubs would be interested in signing him.
I am hearing from inside Old Trafford that despite being on good terms with current No1 Dean Henderson, De Gea will not sit back and accept a role on the bench for much longer.
I am picking up interest from Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid.
The 30-year-old is arguably at the peak of his career although some inside the club believe he has declined slightly over the past two years.
Manager Solskjaer said, Goalkeeper departments are a very tight knit group.
They work in preparation, they have different gym sessions, individual sessions to the rest of the squad and they stay together more.
Naturally they create a bond and the spirit in the goalkeeping department has been top.
Its a healthy competition.
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesnt regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion.
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire-fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay.
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him.
Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira, Callum Robinson, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league.
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad?
No, it isnt Raheem Sterling.
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards.
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest.
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham.
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen, things have not gone well for the German.
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid-19 and had to battle back to fitness.
The upcoming Champions League final and the next pre-season, Tuchel believes, will show the best of the attacking midfielder and forward.
Solskjaer is turning United into winners again
Manchester United might have big problems with the fans actively showing aggression towards the owners but inside the club there is a new belief, a new harmony and renewed confidence that they can achieve.
The man responsible is Ole Gunner Solskjaer and after speaking with many United staff and supporters this week, everyone recognises that it is time to praise the manager for achieving so much in the last eighteen months.
Solskjaer paved the way to sign Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani and both have proven to be excellent additions to Uniteds line-up.
Cavani has confirmed that he is staying for another season and it is mainly his belief in Solskjaer which has persuaded him.
Paul Pogba looks settled and happy and his relationship with the manager is at an all-time high.
When United fall behind in a matches these days, they get back up, fight and more often than not they win.
There is one thing to thank out-going Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward for and that is allowing Solskjaer time to succeed in the job, survive the rough patches and turn his players into winners.
Solskjaer is now the most important and the strongest foundation brick of the revitalised United and critics, staff and fans believe this is the beginning of a golden era for the Reds.
Tell-tale sign
Kane thinking about leaving
I noticed a significant silence during the match against Leeds at the weekend.
Harry Kane usually runs as much, if not more, than any other player and constantly barks out orders and instructions to other players to play more effectively.
Against Leeds he was very quiet and more so than I think I have ever seen him.
I suspect this is a tell-tale sign that Harry is seriously doubting his tenure at Spurs and is already looking for a way out.
Wolves desperate for a striker
Nuno Espirito Santos has at last recognised that during the transfer window he must prioritise signing a new striker.
Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Ruben Neves are the leading scorers which pinpoints the weakness in Wolves strike force.
Fabio Silva and Raul Jimenez are next on the list however Jimenez has been out of action since November after fracturing his skull.
Wolves have 13 goals less this season than last year.
The Wolves board have promised Nuno money to sign a proven goalscorer.
Jimenez by the way will be told on May 18th if he is medically safe to play in the final two games of this season.
He has been training for two months but was banned from heading the ball and having physical contact with his teammates.
Sir Alex praises McTominay
When the great Sir Alex Ferguson speaks about Manchester United he is always worth listening to.
His admiration for Scott McTominay is immense and the master says the midfielder should automatically play in every United game.
Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of Uniteds big players,Sir Alex said.
When you watch United pick their team for an important game, McTominays name is in it.
Hes a good character and a great trainer.
I signed him when he was just a kid of seven or eight years of age
and he was actually a centre-forward.
What higher praise can a player receive.
Three astonishing football facts¦
*Manchester United have not lost an away game in the PL for a year and four months!
If they do not win their next game, Sheffield United will become the first team since the 1904-05 season to have gone without winning two consecutive games.
A political scientist and public affairs commentator, Prof Jibrin Ibrahim said there appears to be aunity of purpose between the secessionist agitators and political leaders from the region.
He however predicted the relationship to be short-lived.
Prof Ibrahim said the proscribed group has, by now,engaged in a total attack against the Nigerian state through years ofeffective pursuance of its agenda.
According to him,The major problem is that their elite have kept quiet for too long, and that is very disappointing because the people of the South-East are spread all over Nigeria.
They have fruitful investments all over the country which they are going to lose by going to war.
The feeling I have is that they dont seem to care, he said.
The people are questioning the imposed model of political leadership in the region.
All over the region, you have politicians who were manufactured into office.
In Imo State, for instance, you have a governor who came fourth in the elections but became first through the Supreme Courts verdict.
There is also the case of Okigwe North Central zone where a man who was disqualified succeeded in being manufactured into office.
part of the narrative is about the functionality or legitimacy of political leadership in the region, Odinkalu said.
Unfortunately it points to the failing nature of the Nigerian state; the more non-state actors like the proscribed IPOB issue such directivesand these directives are successful-the more we see this kind of failure by the state.
It does not in any way portend well for our national security.
What we know for a fact is that unfortunately and consistently when IPOB attacked and even force people to do things against their will and the security agencies have not been able to prevent that.
So, it is our understanding that people just chose to comply mainly because of safety reasons, Adamu said.
With regards to the governors, he said they are playing the political card, saying:I think they are being politically correct mainly to help themselves and to avoid issues that may come.
The governors are sitting on the fence but what I would like to remind them is that this is a phase in an insurgency.
It appears this phase is to target security infrastructure.
Phase two would be to target individuals and it is very likely that phase three would be to target government offices and all that.
South-East shut down
Streets in the five states making the southeast of Nigeria were deserted on Monday as residents complied with the sit-at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).
Our correspondents report that government offices, schools, hotels, shopping malls, and banks were under lock and key as markets and roads were empty in the major cities of Aba, Owerri, Awka, Ebonyi and Enugu among others.
IPOB praised the people for compliance, boasting that very soon the stage will be set for our referendum to decide our fate.

People who were on essential duties, such as doctors, nurses, journalists were periodically checked by security operatives before allowed to proceed on their journey.
Similarly, the streets of Owerri, the Imo State capital and its environs were empty as residents observed the sit-at-home order.

Our reporter who monitored the situation around three major axes in the city.
There was heavy shooting at Nnodo in Ebonyi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State between suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the police.
Daily Trust also gathered that the shooting erupted between the police and members of the IPOB when they were enforcing the sit-at-home order on residents in the area.
A reliable source who doesnt want his name in print told our correspondent that motorbikes and cars were set ablaze during the attack.
Our reporter learnt that Igbo residents of Oyigbo did not go to market in compliance with the sit-at-home directives.
It was also observed that the entrance gate of the popular Eke Oyigbo Market, mainly dominated by the Igbo traders, was open for business but many of the traders did not open their shops.
Also in Port Harcourt, the popular Diobu Market where most of the traders are Igbos did not also open their stores in compliance with the order.
A trader at Oyigbo Market, Ikechukwu Ibe said that they decided to close their businesses on Monday in honour of the fallen Igbo heroes who died during the Biafran war.
Elsewhere in Jos, the Plateau State capital, our correspondent reports that shop owners especially Igbos closed their business premises for fear of reprisal attacks over what is happening in the South-East.
Security agents, including police and SSS, were seen in their numbers around the popular Ahmadu Bello Way, trying to avert the eruption of violence in the area and other strategic locations of the state capital.
Our correspondent who went round Ahmadu Bello Way, Katako Market and other areas within the city reports that apart from the Igbos, other business owners equally closed their business for fear of unforeseen violence that may erupt in the city.
It was observed that many Igbos especially those having their businesses within the heart of the city didnt open their business in the morning, while those who opened later closed in the afternoon.

The term ranching is not clearly defined in this country, so all intensive or enclosed livestock production systems are categorised as ranching.
However, a ranch is a very large area of rangeland that is enclosed where animals roam and openly graze.
It is in view of that, the Land Use Act recommends allocation of up to 5,000 ha for livestock farming.
So, if state governors genuinely believe in ranching, they should put their money where their mouth is and allocate the recommended hectares to ranchers.
The statement that states go into ranching because there is no land is incongruent.
