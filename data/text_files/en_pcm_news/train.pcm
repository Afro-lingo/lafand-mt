holocaust wey we no fit forget
derfore, I tok ( Jesus) to una (Jew), di kingdom of God na hin dem go collect from you, and dem go give am to nation wey dey bring forth di fruit
And di lord go bring una ( Jews) inside Egypt again wit ship and
for der, dem go sell una give una enemies and no man go buy una
Now will him ( di Lord) remember dia (Jews) iniquity, kom visit dia (Jews) sin dey (Jews) go return go Egypt
To dey read di three passage for New and Old Testament wey dey Bible, person go get di impression say World Jewry get di difficult task wey turn away wetin Bible scholars aptly tok say na second bondage
Di reflect for Israeli response to di slightest of provocations, weyalso go to remind us from di parable of wan man wey dey kpeme wey refuse to godown alone
Di stage for di current slaughter for di Middle East dey lay wen di world to show respect for di 75th anniversary of di so call holocaust last year
Afta di wetin resemble entente cordiale wey follow di event, and even before pictures from Auschwitz and Jerusalem disappear from television screens, den American President wey wicked, Donald Trump, release one Middle East Peace Plan that virtually wey carry di modest progress wey dey don make for restive region for square one back.
If Trump successor, President Biden get plan to resolve di crisis wey dey Middle East, him neva wan show am
so far, Mr Biden dey satisfy to stick to di wrong head plan him inherit from Trump
whateva wey di case be, e dey careless for Mr Biden to play down di holocaust wey dey go on to occupy Palestine for di epidemic excuse wey Israelis don fight to defend dia sef
for one all swoop, Mr Biden don behave typically by wittin shreddin di Oslo Camp David Accords
Biden plan wey him no advertise, which morbidly fits into Trump final solutionâ, means say Palestine wey occupy go still get hin ignoble status as one big prison wer eviction of Palestine pipo and dia land dem wey dey turn dia own go continus , pari passu, as dem dey kil dem witout control.
E dey di queer belief say di only good palestinian na di dead one
since Israel officially kom inside 1948, di unadvertise gaol for stiff neck Jewish leader and dia clappers don go shatter di alleged record wey be record wey Adolf Hitler set
And , strangely, complicit world kip Israel goadin
All dis dey kom for time wey world power claim say dem dey increase kom unite against forces of terror and darkness
Hypocrisy dey increase and as usual, America and di West dey bask for dia warp victory
bakin from wan direction, backin Trump unregenerate policy, hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who kontri don dey responsible for most of di violence for di World
But di culture of silence don neva always infectious
for di order of di divide na Iran and Few Muslim and Palestinian Organisation wey don dey consistent for dia condemnation of wetin dey consider di annual ritual commemoration of hollow kos
As e dey always apun, dey don get dia shrill cry of condemnation drown for global display of hypocrisy
for under normal mata, any act of great destruction and loss of life, like genocide ( for Rwanda), ethnic clean(for Bosnia Herzegovina and for Myanmar)
Apathy(for white monority rule South Africa) and di senseless Jewish dicriminatory practice (for occupy Palestine) qualify for wetin dem dey call holocaust
Strangely, di word holocaust render hollow for hin restrict application as e dey exclusive and hypocritically, employ to refer to di alleged incineration of six Jew for concentration camp
e fi be Adolf Hitler dey wrong but di way di decendant of hin alleged six million victim behave for di middle east, e dey tempt pesin to ask, for di risk to dey dub anti-Semite; shey Hitler dey right
Dis question go continue to dey excite for view of di unspeakable and despicable atrocities wey Jews commit for Palestine wey dem occupy.
small wonder wey even wit effort to criminalise holocaust, Palestinians and dia American and European sympathimer desist from criminalisin and aimalisin Adolf Hitler
No holocaust or final solution go eva work
and di proof of dis fit find successive Israeli offensive for occupied Palestine wey lay bare di vunerability for di overrated Israeli Defence Force IDF
If to say, whateva air of invincibility di IDF enjoy don evaporate for di face of resistence from Hamas and Hezbollah(Hizbullah parti of God) and oda anti-occupation groups
As world power continue to turn blind eyes, extremist group, many of dem wey di United State train to contain Soviet expansion don grab di initiative
di struggle for di creation of Israel no be tea parti or na e dey born di state by United Nations resolutions
instead, e kom from di barrel of di gun
na di bombin spree of dem Jewish jaguda pipo organisation na e led to di creation of Israel for 1948
Dey don tell Palestine say dem no get beta option dan to fight
wetin be di reason
America Middle East policy provide d tonic dey need to fight
in fact, for Evri Hamas and order milliant Palestine group di world wey we know today, di Jews get dia jaguda pipo Irgun and Zvai terror machine
dem dey do wetin dem do for Palestine wetin Zvai and Irun do for Israel for di early part of di 20th century
as good student of history, Hamas and ally radical Palestinian group dey aware say no amount of hour wey dem spend around table go give dem house
if palestine fail to copy dia fightin Jew cousin of di early and mid 20th century, dey suppose just forget Palestine homeland
make di world continue to dey believe say Palestine dey unform pipo and continue to see Jew as special breed
e dey fine
No be even di mata of say some wastern kontri see holocaust denial as major crime and dey kom refuse to dey apply di word to victim of Israel disciminatory practice against dia Palestine cousin
wetin mata for di end of di day na di amount to hollow kos to glorify one holocaust and kom turn di blind eyes to anoda

Di maize pyramid don return too
Dis dem pyramid don dot di skylines for state like Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Jigawa, Ekiti, and di rest
for oda like Lagos, Edo, River and di rest, CBN finance industry dey wey dey maximize di farm produce to make somethin
Remember say di pyramid dem dey dat time lose for Nigeria until di Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wey Mr Godwin Emefiele dey lead, initiate new focus on top agriculture, industries, small and medium scale enterprise dem and oda area of di real sector.
Adults for Nigeria wey still young wey dey for dat kind 30years neva see any agriculture produce pyramids until wey e no tay wey CBN make ham apun
Wen CBN launch di Anchor Borrower programme ABP for five year wey we don use comot, e no for true anticipate di scale of success di programme go record and di impact across di kontri
Five years wey we don use pass, Nigeria agricultue landscape don change from good and e no get region or state wey dey behind
E dey significant to note say di benefit don almost distribute from di north to di south pass N700 billion wey dey don release for di target crop and animal, and dia value chain
As he dey tok recently for Ado Ekiti for di public unveilin of the Ekiti rice pyramid project and flag-off of di wet season rice cultivation, di CBN Governor, Mr Emefiele, tok say ova N300bn of di moni wey almost reach N700bn wey dey don already distribute on top agriculture, dey don share am for di southern part of country includin Lagos, Edo, Ekiti, and Ondo state dem.
Hin tok say 21 agriculture commodity na e dey target pass di rest wey be Rice, maize, wheat, oil palm, cocoa and di rest
He tok say;From di beginnin till date, we don give 3,107,890 farmers moni for di cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodity through 23 Participatin Financial Institutions for di 36 State of the Federation and FCT.
Emefiele tok say dem fit see di positive impact of di Anchor Borrower Programme or all ourr agrarian community as e don bring hope kom di farmin population through di timely delivery of agricultural inputs and di provision of market wey get guarantee for dia outputs for price wey di market go determine.
Hin tok say ABP don fit support some of awa macro economic objective as to dey allow employment opportunity wey dey drive financial inclusion and to dey provide access to finance for awa rural community
For under 2020 wet season RIFAN CBN partnership, hin tok say CBN finance 221, 450 farmer for di cultivation of 221,450 hactare for 32 state
Di pyramidswey dem open today dey part of di harvest from di different field from di South-West and oda neighbourin States to demonstrate di spread of di movement and provide evidence say rice production dey viable for all di State wey dey di Federation.
hin tok say pass RIFAN, CBN support number of prime/private anchor
Omoluabi farm( Ekiti), time seller(Ogun), Wems Agro(Ondo) and di rest dey wait disbursement for 2021 season
CBN big support for agriculture na to ensure say food dey sufficient, empowerment for dem small farmer and to dey help save foriegn exchange for Nigeria as small food import dey apun
CBN don continue to carry up investment for di agriculture space
E don start di 2021 wet season farm investment
Emefiele tok say we get optimistic outlook for di 2021 wet season
We go bring to bear our learnin experience ova di past years, adoption of hybrids dem and high yieldin varieties dem, supply of inputs wey go dey on time to take advantage of di plantin seasons dem, and good market linkage use sustain our effort to dey increase production.
We don plant minimum one million hactares of rice through combination of RIFAN farmer and prime/private anchors for each plantin seeason for 2021
awa backward integration dey drive wit rice millers e dey also gain momentum as we intend to finance some millers to grow dia own paddy for dis wet season
He tok say; We get aggressive production plans for maize, wheat, soybeans, cassava, sorghum and cassava,
Di governor sef indicate say di CBN go dey hep states wit moni to clear land as land clearin na big problem for farmin.
Land clearin, access for irrigation, and availability of high yieldin seeds don remain di greatest challenge to increase agricultural production for di South and we don provide long term finance option dem wey go dey give more land for agricultural production nationwide.
Dem create di Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS) and di Private-Sector Led Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (P-AADS) say make dem solve dis issue for di State Goment and Private Sector players respectively.
He tok say; Di provision of oda farm wey relate to di infrastructure like irrigation facilities, rural access road, mechanization services, logistics and post-harvest handlin activities fit dey under dis intervention.
He tok sef say if farmers pay dia loans, CBN fit put hand for more areas thus urgin di farmers wey benefit from the loans make dem pay back.
Loan repayment na di hallmark of every credit wey pipo collect and the sustainability of di programme dey on top farmers ability and willingness to repay dia loan, and we dey engage dem wella wit dem to increase dia trust for di system.
The pyramid dem wey dey unveil today na harvests from di financed fields dem wey dem been submit as part of loan repayment by farmers dem under di RIFAN-CBN programme.
He tok say;To further create value and transfer dis gain across di value chain, we don map rice millers wey go dey off-take di paddies, and we go track di release of dia outputs to di market, as we dey strive to manage inflation and grow di rice value chain in Nigeria.
To support di growth wey dem record for dis drive to attain self-sufficiency for food production and to moderate price dem of agricultural commodities, Mr President don approve di resuscitation of di Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX).
A vibrant commodity exchange enhance post-harvest handlin, guarantee effective pricin for farmers dem, minimize di adverse effect of middlemen and commodity hoarders and ultimately transfer to gains from primary production oda nodes of di value chain.
Considerin di kind huge market and high population of Nigeria wit di urgent nid to end poverty, it don successfully demonstrate di nid to luk inside by takin advantage of di available fertile land, perennial river bodies and human resource dem for di production of rice.
Di first two year of di programme(2015 reach 2017) record significant increase for rice production wit decrease for rice importation
For example to dey carri rice kom kontri from Thailand fall 644,131 metric tone for September 2015 to 20,000 matric tone for September 2017, wish account for drop pass 90%
Di success so far record dey possible bikos of di Anchor borrowers program wey Federal goment introduce for conjunction wit di Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) dat one no not only improve rice production but don also enhance di quality through de-stoning.
hin tok say; E don see di increase for di number of local rice mills
He tok say federal goment share di moni to di Anchor and in conjunction wit di participatin States, for land clearin, provision of seeds for plantin, inputs like knapsack sprayers, tube wells, pumpin machines, ploughs, combined harvesters, rice millin machines and production lines, packagin na hin dey provide.
Furthermore, analysis of di ABP programme show say funds wey dem provide for low interest make am possible: easy access to rice farmers dem; economies of scale as plenti of farmers na hin dem enlist into di programme; enhance di rice value chain in form of finance for primary producers go processors “ handlers “ wholesalers “ storage “ marketin (branding) “ export; improvement of farmers dem fortunes; and employment generation.
Di remainin na food sufficient, so tey poverty banish and insecurity, generation of revenue as farmer go pay tax and improvement for economy as naira gain value
Hin kom note say di ease of production of rice wey be di staple wey get value pass for Nigeria don successful practice and celebrate for some state like Kebbi, Jigawa, Sokoto, Niger, Kwara, Ebonyi
E dey grate say today , Ekiti State don now join di train as participant for di Anchor Borrowers Programme of di CBN, wey dey partnership wit National bodi Rice farmer Association of Nigeria wey Anchor Borrower lead

We fit only achieve am wit dem pipo and constitution

I too agree wit Dr Sabeh say pipo say make dem kip pipo for service just to play dem as social service
Nigeria no fit afford am now
awa Economy no dey develop 10th as US economy take be
Na 1930s wen e go through di Great Depression
Howeva, Dr Sabeh dey right to extend say Keynesianism don back world ova and goment must necessary think about di impact of hin policy on di pipo wey hin dey service
We know say for Nigeria, goment unfortunately no believe say dey kom here kom serve di pipo, but na awa duty to work togeda to change dat unfortunate misunderstandin and disconnection
E get oda issue wey dey kom from Kaduna state presently
For true di state under your goment dey don again mention am as one of di best governed and we hear of your achievement for infrastructural development
Di danger to dey travel to Kaduna don hamper many of us to kom see dem achievement, but most pipo know say El-Rufai na man of achievement and stickler for standards
Di Federal Capital Territory(FCT) no fit forget you in hurry
plenti pesin rue your absence as minister
plenti go remember you for dread
Unfortunately, plenti of di village wey you clear and plenti of di shanties wey you demolish don kom back dis time wit vengeance
wetin?
Di goment over time don make no plan for dis poor folks, and human being like water and must find dia level
If u dey fly go Abuja for any point for time, make you look down from di window of your aeroplane and u go see how bad shanties don metastasize since you don comot
Any minister wey go try and correct dis anomaly go get millions of dem refugees for hin hand
for your time, na 500,000 refugees we don get
For 2006, Nigeria get di second highest number of displace pipo for di world afta wey Iraq due to hin action
I remember say I write give you den through my Daily Trust column, dey appeal for di same thin wey Dr Sabeh dey call for human face
I quote timeless Chinese wisdom as dey remind you your vision na one year, kom cultivate flowers
If na 10, cultivate trees
But if na eternity, cultivate human
Di idea den na say make e go easy on you hard rhetoric say anyone wey dey earn less dan N50,000 make e return to village, bikos Abuja no dey for di poor
You tok say dis na national TV and e dey unfortunate and unfeelin
Na for sure say most bourgeoisie thin wey pesin don eva tok for office
If anybodi wan lay claim say Abuja be dia inheritance, e for be dose Gwaris wey dem displace from dia ancestral land, plenti time witout compensation
For what point Abuja bikom playground/inheritance for di nouveau riche
As we dey watch TV for 2006, families wey no get place to stay inside rainy season, wit dia mattress on dia head and dia little pikin for dia hand, we hear di storie of pipo wey kil diasef bikos both dia house and dia business na hin dey destroy di same day.
I learn from one lady, who dey act as secretary to some of your meetin dem dat time , how you take enjoy displacin dose poor pipo at once, how Drs Oby Ezekwesili and Okonjo-Iweala dey beg you no change your mind and dem use style call you sadist as you comot for di meetin go demolish anoda place.
E sound much like di folks dem for di south of di USA wey dey take joy to dey hang demsef anoda negroa
Kaduna no only get bloat civil service but also problem wit indiscriminate buildin of all kind structure wia dey suppose be like Evri wia for Nigeria
Abuja claim to get master plan which no one suppose see, derfore making am political plan no be geographical one
Kaduna no be Abuja, and di pipo wey dey der fi no get di mettle to sand Hurricane Nasir, as we take do here for Abuja till 2007 under your Iron grip
You know say u fit easily craze wen dey turn you on
You confess am yoursef
You no care which pesin ox dem kill and dis fit be good attribute to turn like our kontri around , but e fit dey deadly for plenti plenti poor folks, especially for Kaduna wey be simply agrarian and civil service state.
Compensation go dey for example dose one wey u go demolish dia house and shop
Anyone dey hear dia tor iof how dey kom about di land or space or dey don tell dem to go back hell?
Na True say make we strive to achieve glistenin city in in oda to achieve accolades from far and near, no to mind di human coasts
Make goment calibate solely to appeal to di whim and fancies of di moni class
look Banana Island and Turnbull Street for Ikoyi
Di oda day, di well feed owners of property der push one video wia dey fiilm how dia pristine space don encroach by poor invader
E remain small make dem call di poor pipo as vermin
Di pipo no be di invader but lack of integrated, inclusive plannin
As educated wey we claim be, we no choose to learn di nuance lessons from di place wey we visit for abroad
How anybodi fit think say di model of Banana Island go work foreva wen provision no dey on how servants, drivers, gardeners and oda low pipo weey dey dis oga for mansion dem go survive; how dem go eat dia lunch, how them go live and sleep close to wer dey suppose resume for 4am evri day?

Di Ariya EV platform make am easy for dem engineer to free up cabin space for unique ways, as to dey mount di climate control system under di hood wia combustion engine go don be

Verily na time to ask for help
Sake of dia accomplishments ova di years, many readers not fit really understand wetin apun to di military for di last many years, particularly as e dey affect di fight against di Boko Haram insurgents, bandits and di insolent kidnappers dem.
awa military don get distinguish record for di field startin for regional and international peace kipin
For independence for 1960 wen we join di United Nations, we don immediately start to contribute awa armed force personnel to peace kipin efforts
Dem tok say awa troop don acquit dimsef creditable for Congo 1960-64, Tanzania 1960-62 and Pakistan 1965-66
By di time wey awa civil war break out for 1967, awa troop don already get fightin experience wey fi don kom to help crush well armed and determin secessionist movement for mere 30 month
afta, dis prowess of awa troop make dem dey very sought afta by di United Nation weneva and wiaeva conflict dey, to contribute to peace kipin force and international military contribution
awa troops don serve Evriwia
For 1978 we dey Lebanon as part of UNFIL, Chadfor 1981, wit Iraq border UNIMOG for 1988, Kuwait UNICOM for 1991, Angola 91, Namibia 89, Cambodia 92, Yugoslavia 92
Na true near home for Sierra Leonne and Liberia, awa troop and di resource Nigeria commit make di difference for those kontris to fall apart or to remain intact
For 2007 dis kontri dey position wet we fit get confidence for di ability of our Army as force wey strong, say hin be voiced opposition to AFRICOM, one combatant command wey USA create to dey watch ova Al Qaeda and oda terrorists operations for Africa.
Di USA back down to dey establish di command post for Africa soil, bikos Nigeria, South Africa and Libya voice dey loud opposition to di plan
In fact, Nigeria too dey belligerent for hin opposition say di goment tok tok pesin tok say we no only reject AFRICOM for Nigeria soil but also e no go wan see am for Africa kontri dem
Di rejection dey loud and clear and di US gats accede, make dem allow AFRICOM berth for Stuttgart, Germany wia e go maintain oda combatant command, since dey don close world war II
But honestly we must admit say thins don turn away for awa armed force for di last 10 years
Di fight against Boko Haram armed insurgent don run inside quagmire
no be only dat one but oda form of insurgency don crop up for di form of wholesale to dey flourish kidnappin industry and oda form of bandit
nobodi fi don dey able to accurately pinpoint why di fight against di Boko Haram insurgents wey plenti consider as ragtag assemblage, don confound awa armed force
we think say awa force don lack material and di whole nation raise for unison to support di President wen dey want billions direct from Federation Account to buy arms
dey draw moni, dey spend am and maybe dey buy arm but condition merely deteriorate wit insurgency kom precarious kom dey spread across di nation
Governor Sani Bello tok plenti wen hin warn Boko Haram fighter don raise dia infamous flag for hin domain and dey walkin distance of Abuja. di Federal Capital
Mohammed Ali Ndume, wey be di senator wey dey represent Borno South don dey Evriwia for di media lately, dey decry say di deficits for di war effort
Senator Ndume suppose know, bikos hin be di chairman of di Senate Committee for di Army
Vibrant and Passionate, Ndume neva don dey dey short of word advancin di kos of hin constituency wey dey presently besieged by Boko Haram insurgent
Hin gah put am plainly across say di entire arm force lack di of material to accomplish di myriad of assigment before dem
on top dat dey lack di number wey dey need
dat go maybe explain why despite dia pedigree, awa arm force dey bogged down by number of ragtag brigands
To kom worse mata, di casualties dey raise by di day
Di glory statistics wey Samuel Aruwan, give few days ago, Kaduna state commissioner of internal Affairs and International Security, dem dey fear reach
Hin report say for three month between January and March 2021, bandit wey dey terrorise Kaduna State don kill 323 and don con abduct 949 citizen
I think say similar figure fit show up from neighbour wey dey Katsina, Niger and Zamfara State if dey kip statistics
Time don kom for change of heart, maybe do wetin fit don dey unthinkable some year ago
I dey hapi say dey don win di President for di argument
Dis one sho wella wen for one televised virtual meetin wit di US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken he specifically ask di US make dem reconsider relocatin the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart go Africa so e go dey close to di theatre of operations and e go hep strengthen di ongoin efforts to check di security situation.
I see di exchange close and clear I see di President grimace wen hin kom to di point for hin speech wia hin ask di US to move AFRICOM kom Africa
Na di kind surrender wey only Generals understand, as painful duty to save territory, fightin men and material

As access to fertiliser dimsa farmer devise means to dey generate manure from neem
As di hope to dey get goment subsidise fertiliser dis farmin season dim further, some farmer for Jigawa State don adopt di technique to dey turn neem leaves inside fertiliser
di farmers especially those for Maigatari Local goment Area say dem decide to shift attention towards usin local methods of enrichin dia soils for beta productivity as a result of di spike in di price of inorganic fertilizers
NPK fertiliser now bi costs over N12,000 per 50kg in di open markert, and di usually subsidised one by di federal goment which usually sold for N5,000 may not be feasible dis year
Di Minister of Agriculture, Mohammed Sabo Nanono, don tok say di federal, goment go, from dis year, hands off for buying and selling of fertiliser but go play a supervisory role
Plenti stakeholder don interprete di minister stand to mean goment witdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, so tey farmers no get option dan to buy from di open market
as di rainy season don be for plenti part of di kontri, farmers dey forced to find manure by any means
Dis na di major reason wey make new innovertion dey among di Jigawa farmers
how farmers take use neem leaves for manure
neem leaves wey fall from di tree dey heep by di farmers dem kom put for inside gutters and drains kom leave am to decompose
One of di farmers tok say dem dey dry di decomposed leaves before dem finally take am go farm
Many farmers wey dey for town agree as although di practice kos blockage of dia drains, e get beta impact for dia soil
Mallam Imrana Adamu, one farmer for Maigatari tok say him don dey into di practice for some time now and him dey satisfied wit di way di compost dey help am maintain di fertility for him soil
But unlike some farmers for di town wey use drains dey carryout di process, Mallam Imrana tok say him use him side dey decompose di organic fertiliser
Him tok say, mix di dry neem leaves wit ash, con sprinkle water put for di mixture con allow di process take hin course
I fit assure you say e dey veri effective for di enrichin of di soil
I don dey practice am dey see positive result, I still dey pracrtice am
On top di efficacy and effectiveness of dis practice, Dr Yunusa Muhammed Shuaibu, lecturer for di Department of Crop Production, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi, tok say di practice na form of decompostin wey speed up mineralisation con enrich di soil as e dey supply nutrients like phosporus wit calcium to am

Understand Nigeria democracy, dictatorship and spirit of nationalism for chad
Kalid Yusuf Tebo
Di operation of political parties for democracy na systematic, flexible and elastic wen dem compare am wit political parties outside democracy
Howeva, political parties for democratic state dey distinctive wit dose for non-democartic states, especially for dia mode of operations
Sometimes, dem share partial similarities and roles
Yet, di roles for dose wey dey democracy no dey distinguishable from to advocate transparency, accountability, integrity wit quality of choosing representatives for favour of national interest
Nevadiless, for Nigeria, Buhari na di president and commander-in-chief for di army forces.
Him been go through rigorous democratic political parti process before him go emerge victorious for pre-primary, primary and post primary elections
As member of political parti, him be like any oda member and possess no legal proceedin use influence di servin governor, servin senator and member house of reps for under di impression of di same political parti for democracy as far as say good governance na di mata of di day
Dis gats do wit parti political exercise for rulin ova di affairs of hin members wen di need kom
Contrastingly, Buhari participation for decision to make hin minimal compare to di late by Chad bikos of dia policital system differences and leadership modus operandi
Buhari dey less sensitive for governance, hin dey less powerful over some national affairs and hin dey effective legislatively
No be like by pesin wey dey sensitive, wey dey powerful and wey dey strong bikos of hin non democratic identity and policitical ideology
make we say, di edge of governance for Chad na e dey say e get sef center feature witout collective effort wey di pipo make wey dem dey rule
In fact, di system allow larger portion of corruption and manipulation of single interest, meanwhile silencin di voice of dia member durin policital tok, public opinion and to dey make decision
for di sake of democracy, and sense of nationalism for Nigeria, no one fi or go personally decide to do wetin anythin between executive, legislature and judiciary
no mata how patriotic di persin fit be
one most act accordin to di constitutional guideline as well as to dey pass hin idea to di three tiers of goment for critique, suggestion and support
for example, if Buhari dey eager to kpeme for di battlefield, hin must first identify di legality of sacrificin hin life constitutionally as President of Nigeria wey wan fight Boko Haram in favor of national interest
Hin must understand say hin ability politically and democratically before hin go pay di price
Anyway, Nigeria no be Chad, for here we dey operate democracy no be military and dictatorship
for Chad, by say dem adopt political parti for unitary system of goment wey dey link to dictatorship
By di way, di system wey hin enjoy delibrately lack check and balance if dey compare wit di bicameral legislature
If you fit remember, di Dbys political party na Patriotic Salvation Movement; di party dey built on spirit of nationalism and di aim na to produce patriotic mindsets wit sophisticated ideology and spiritual high sense of nationalism.
wetin dey surprise
by di one wan remain and hin answer di clarion call of hin parti MPS
True nationalist for tru tru

Na undisputed fact say for di history part wey plenti pass, women neva enjoy equal right
Na only sevaal decades wey don pass, di general belief wey dey surround women role dey restricted to duties for house, to dey born pikin and to dey work for kitchen
Dis perception bring plenti amount of disregard and prejudice against women, no be only for di family and community level, but glarin misrepresentation and stereotypical portrayals for mainstreal media
Pass all, dey no allow women to dey make important decision makin, leadership position, access to high education and professional aspiration
Make we say one of di notable shifts for di movement for woman right na di Women Strike for Equality for August 26, 1970
Di strike wey take place for di United State to celebrate di 50th anniversary of di passin of di 19th Amendment, wey effectively give women for America di right to vote

For Nigeria, gender inequality don heavily pervaded society

Howeva, female participation for formal and informal structure, get and kom carry key decision makin remain insignificant
Dis dey largely bikos of discriminatory social norms, marginalization and economic disparity, wey dictate di live of women for Nigeria

Di victory,and plenti oda, don bikom clear sign say female empowerment, eqality, and leadership dey necessary to foster positive change for society
we need all hand for deck to close gender gap
We don make great progress for gender equality and we no fit allow ham make e erod
we need act now to ensure say wen we continue to dey respond to di health and economic crisis, we go kom find way to progress women economic empowerment and equality, for education, for house and for workplace

We need new, radical collaboration wey fi focus on di financial source, but make dem bring all awa partners for di start
make we look 70s, 80s and even large part of di 90s, we fit tok am as say na significant improvement to dey reduce gender inequality for Nigeria, no delay we still dey for back
Wen you luk di 17 action points of di Development Goals wey dey fit sustain, wey be di global roadmap wey you fit understand pass to shared human progress,e dey impossible to overlook di centrality of hin call for gender equality and to dey reduce inequalities.
Indeed,E no dey probable say di world fit reach significant success for almost any action area of SDGs “ as dem dey ensure quality health care, education and sanitation for evribodi to reduce poverty, end hunger, provide productive employment or enable strong institutions “ witout say dem achieve wella for gender equality and dey reduce inequalities.

Na for dis sacred month wey di holy Quran get revealed to Prophet Muhammad (Salla-llahu Alayhi Wa Sallam, SAW) for di guidance of humanity.
For inside di month of Ramadan be one night wey dey better than thousands of month.
Bikos say Ramadan be one unique spiritual season, e dey important to effectively prepare hawasef for am so dat evri opportunity wey dey Ramadan dey optimally utilized; make we no take anything wit sipini hand.
Ramadan be di month wey Musllims always dey hapi to look up to.
Im be month wey no get contender.
Im be holy month wey Allah (SWT) promise say hin go forgive evri Muslim wey don repent; give mercy to evri seeker of clemency; and hin go forgive dos wey ask for forgiveness.
By di current count of di month of Shaban on di Timing Chapter calendar, to dey look for di cresent is expected to start for Monday April 12, 2021 wey dey equivalent to 29th day of Shaban.
Abu Hurayrah (RA) report say di Prophet (SAW) di gates to hell fire go dey close for evri Ramadan period just like how di gates to paradise go dey open durin the same period make di wish and prayer of dos wey like paradise get answerd.
For place wey di cresent of Ramadan no dey sighted on the 29th day of Shaaban, di month go count say im don complete im circle of 30th day where Ramadan fast automatically start di next day, wey go be 1st of Ramadan.
We no suppose begin Ramadan fast until we hear say dem don see di cresent from correct sources.
For Naija, di tradition be say Muslims go wait for di announcement say dem don see cresent from His Eminence di Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Saad Abubakar.
Allah (SWT) tok for Quran 4:59 say
All of una wey believe!
Obey Allah, obey di Messenger, and dos wey dey places of authority among una.
Di more we dey kampe and we dey patient and wait and obey Sultan tok, di more united and strong we go dey as Muslim community.
We advise pipu wey dey part of di Muslim community to dey wary of unsubstantiated pieces of information wey fit show face for social media on wen Ramadan go start.
We advise di general public make dem stay away from news wey dem no sabi who tok am wy dey tok about seeing di moon.
Information wey no correct fit throw Muslim communities inside confusion.
Remember say Allah wrath dey wait for rumour mongers.
Di teaching of di Prophet Muhammed (SAW) discourage di observance of voluntary fast wey dey close to di start of Ramadan fast.
Dis na to avoid situation where voluntary fast, wey be prophetic injunction, is seen to dey part of Ramadan fast; di latter wey be obligatory act of worship sanctioned by Allah (SWT)
For dos wey dey observe di voluntary fast evri Monday, e dey advise make dem skip Monday next week bikos of di closeness to Ramadan; bikos e be 29th day of Shaaban.
As part of delibrate preparation for Ramadan and make we see chance take advantage of the spiritual benefits of Ramadan, e dey important make we review awa daily routines to create plenty time for engaging in devolutional activities.
Dis go allow us have more time to take recite di Glorious Quran (for dos wey no get am as routine) or more time to dey recite and understand the Quran.
Make we decide quick quick to observe Tarawih prayers in consultations wit individuals wey traditionally make up di prayer congregation for di family level or conventionally for public mosque.
Make we also define di kain task wey we dey engage during the day for Ramadan period, make we no miss out from observing Tarawih prayers afta we break fast or Tahajjud prayers afta midnight.
For us to preserve di sancuary of awa Ramadan fast, need dey to review awa usual interaction wit ICT platforms especially di social media.
The goment don ban Twitter
Im dey important to indentify and avoid some kain websites, television channels and radio programmes wey fit bring negative impact on awa Ramadan fast
Make we dey prepare to also avoid some kain toks for awa respective work place, make e prevent us for toking and hearing some bad toks.
Dem advise Muslim scholars, preachers, prayer leaders, presenters and anchors of radio and television programmes to avoid di use of provocative and discourteous expressions durin preaching sessions.
Dem suppose exhibit good sense of maturity as dem dey educate dia audience on how dem dey teach Islam
Wisdom and good tok, do yeye or insult, be central to effective and popular religious proselyzation.
Di kontri still dey struggle to overkom plenty wahala, e dey wise for Muslim clerics to abstain from sandwiching dia religion preaching wit politica and ethnic sentiment.
We advise dealers and retailers of consumer goods make dem no do yeye inflation of market price bikos of Ramadan season.
E dey wicked for any trader to dey see Ramadan as opportunity to dey skyrocket food price bikos demand of food plenty, especially sugar and fruits durin Ramadan
Make we dey fear God for evrithing wey we dey do and say to make moni.
We encourage philanthropic individuals, groups and NGOs to dey organise or support public breaking of Ramadan fast, at least for less priviledge Muslims.
Na time be dis for Ramadan for evri Muslim to extend hand of friendship, charity, and kindness to dia fellow muslims.
May Allah guide us to start and end di Ramadan fast in peace and wit ease. Amin.

Afta we don look dis well well for Tottenham, I fit tell you say e no dey true.
Mourinho no take training bikos say e don sabi say hin time for Spurs don kom to an end
Di training session apun but hin no attend
Daniel Levy wey be Chief Executive arrive eaarly and e summon Mourinho to hin office wey dey training facility
Na dia he give Mourinho di news say dey don sack am
Daniel Levy wey be Managing Director no dey hapi wit Mourinho criticising plenty players afta dem no too do well for pitch
Di players dey angry ay Mourinho no dey support dem and for dressing room, things no dey go well.
Dem sack am for Chealsea, sack am for Manchester United and now Tottnham don sack am bikos say e turn on hin players and e no wan take blame for di bad results wey dem get.
Again, dey don prove di point say id players no dey hapi, managers must go.
Dem send di players text message say Mourunho no dey in charge again
Levy sef dey vex say mourinho don spend seventeen months for White Hart Lane and hin no produce team wey better pass wetin Mauricio Pochettino build.
Levy dey vex say players wey get quality like Gareth Bale and Dele Alli dey sit for bench as odas sef dey stuggle to get good result.
Di big kasala be say Mourinho don fail to deliver European Champions League football for next season.
Na di three reasons why Jose dey go back to Portugal wit hin family.

Solskjaer tok dis week say, e see say Edi dey appreciate Mason talent, e hunger and willingness to learn.
And in Edinson Cavani e dey learn from one of di best.
I no wan see Mount play wit hin back to di goal
Despite all diz good tok, I don learn say Solskjaer go play Mason out wide for di foreseeable future and believe e go move inside during di next couple of years.
e tok say maybe for futore e go fit play central striker

To be contre-forward for Premier League be probably di hardest position to play
I think say Mason dey more suitable to play dat wide role

For dis interview wey dem get wit Trust sports, di acting director don yarn on top di performance of team FCT for Edo 2020 and sports development for di Federal Capital Territory
How e dey go as you don resume office as di acting Director of Sports in di FCT?
Na me take over as di acting director of sports in di FCT on di 8th day of october 2020 and so tey dat time my major concern na how I go take sports for di Territory beyond wia I meet am
E no dey easy unto say FCT dey more or less civil service settlement
Una no fit compare am wit states like Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Edo, Kaduna and odas
Howeva, we dey do Evrithing wey go help improve di achievements wey we record for past
Interestingly, di Federal Capital Territory Administration don stand gidigba for awa back
FCT don placed 16th place on di medals table wey dem just conclude for di 2020 national sports festival
How satisfied you dey wit di performance of athletes
I suppose start my yarn to say na me be di happiest pesin wen di administration of di FCT approve say make we participate for di 2020 national sports festival
Although room still dey for improvement, I go say I dey satisfied wit wetin we achieve
As we dey look back, na we dey always be di 17th, 18th or 19th apart from wen we host sport festival for 2004 and 2018
una know say if una be di host you get advantage wey plenti
una fit patronise as many events as e possible
you fit register as many athletes wey you want
however, wen una dey go out una go cut down di number of events and athletes to minimise cost
I dey happy say dis time around, we no host but e end up for 16th position despite di enormous challenge wey we face
two states, di host Edo and Delta dey battle for supremacy and na dat dey impact negatively for officiating
we suppose perfom better but na officiating wey dey questionable deny us for plenti medals
no be only us be di victims of di supremacy tussle wey dey between Edo and Delta
in all, we dey grateful bikos we do better dan 21 states
wit di support of di goment, we go do better at Delta 2022
di national sports festival don dey open
how una athletes take cope wit dia opponents wey get more experience
the task no dey easy unto say some states don go far as di USA, France and Germany to hire athletes
as e dey for tennis, di player wey win di singles event na from France and dem pay am a sum of N5 million by Delta state
some states don buy so tey 30 proffessional for outside Kontri which be a whole lot money
Remember in adition to goment money, dem get oil companies wey be dem sponsors
For FCT here, na goment funding we depend on solely
one state don give official money wey reach N15m make e go use am monitor proceedings for combat sports
na di money wey some states struggled get to attend the festival
for us, even before we go Benin city, minister don charge us make we dey responsible to ur behaviors and be worthy ambassadors
hin advised say make we no try win by all means
na hin farewell message to us and we abided by it
we no go outside FCT go look for athletes
e don become di policy of di FCT to raise athletes and expose dem for national and international competitions
na dat exact thing we do
Pale una dey hear, abeg give us good pikin afta una don give us good pikin give us money wey we go use take care of dem
se una support calls in some quarters for di National Sports Festival make dem return am wen e suppose dey for amateurs strictly
no throw-way dis golden opportunity
di advantage wey big pass be say e dey make coach lazy
dem dey give coach salary but wen e reach sports festival time dem go give dem money wey dem go use go oda states go poach other athletes
i remember di 2018 edition , dem force some athletes make dem refund as much as N1m on top say dem fail to deliver medal for di states wey give dem contract
true true dis no help in di development of talents
Na so dem eliminate am
Na so dem deny oda players di opportunity wey go exhibit dia talent
Di sports festival don dey for di highest bidder but FCT no go buy medals
We no get money wey we go use take hire athlethes wey go win medals
We go kontinu dey raise local athletes wey be awa own
Pesin wey get God for hin side
True, true we suppose go back to di grassroots
Na 62 wards FCT get
Na evri council area get 10 words except AMAC wey get 12
Sports development suppose start from di ward level
For di past, FCT don organised so many competitions from di ward level but mostly dey team sports like football, handball, volleyball and athletics
Na events wey no dey capital intensive be dis
We dey always start from di wards to di area council headquarters and to di city centre
Na dis be di platform wey dey kontinue to dey generate athletes for di FCT
So i dey call oda states make dem emulate di FCT wen dem wan develop dia own athletes
As we dey tok of developing athletes, you fit tok say enough standard sporting facilities dey FCT?
We get six sports centres wey dey under construction for each of di six area councils
Already, we don make one strong appeal and di hon
Minister of state, Dr Ramatu Tijani Aliyu don already go some of di facilities
She don go Kuje and AMAC and she dey dey plan to go to Bwari an odas go see di level of development

Na dey expect favourable responses
Na wetin be di plan for di next edition for di sports festival
We don already start training bikos di next edition no reach one year
We don start preparations and we make requests and recommendations wey go enable us prepare adequately for Delta 2022
We need to dey imbibe di lessons of Ramadan
Need dey make dem pay more attention to di plights of di poor
Di Muslim month of self-purification and self-denial wey dem also know as Ramadan just end
As e dey last, di season wey dem dey use fast don offer all Muslims opportunity wey dem go use reflect on dia relationship wit Allah
E don also enable those wey get means to share food wit pipo wey poor, wey dey in need and pipo wey be less priviledged
For all Muslims, e be opportunity wey dem go use rededicate demsef to di teachings of di faith and di kos of mankind as a whole
Although e be period of deep reflection on di inter-relationship wey dey between man and hin neighbour, for di oda hand, as well as man and hin God
Even though di long-fasting don go, di lessons must endure
Ramadan get high spritual significance , na one of si five pillars of Islam be dat
To devotees, e be period of self-emptying witout which no spiritual being go get a truly rewarding relationship wit hin maker
Na dat explain why dem mark di exercise for Nigeria (as elsewia in di world) by private and group players, and abstinence from all forms of wordly comforts and pleasures
di aim Na to enhance spiritual growth and foster charity and brodaly love
As di Muslims don mark di end of dis annual spiritual exercise, dem dey hope say make di outkom go be of immense benefit di nation
Naija pipo can hardly make ends meet due to di economic situation wey dey prevail for di Kontri
As we dey pay attention to di plights of di poor, as dem amply demonstate am for di course of Ramadan we dey invariably place di welfare for awa neighbours say e dey important as awa own
As we dey allow odas partake for awa wealth or material possessions, we honour di one wey make us
Na dis be di heart of all religions but a virtue wey dey hard to imbibe by plenti pipo for Naija
E gast change
So tey di Ramadan fast, like di fawa pillars wey dey Islam, dem aim am at promoting both di spiritual and material well-being of man, e stand to reason say man dey invariable beta off s e dey do di will of God
Wen he dey able to rein in di impulse for self-gratification and greedy accumulation of wealth, man dey more liable to make hin society a better place wey pesin go live in, no be only hin but for hin neighbor also
Dat na one of di most enduring lessons of Ramadan wey we hope plenti pipo go imbibe
E dey noteworthy dat fasting as e be spiritual exercise dey advocated by all religions obstenibly wit di notion say di man wey fit make sacrifices for di bid to tame hin desires go be beta person for hinself and di society wey large
As one expert don put am say, besides abstention for food and drinks, fasting dey help di pesin wey dey faithful make e no dey look di provocative, make e no dey hear di mischievous, and make e no dey utter di obscene and make e dey avoid slander and make e no dey think about inflicting injury for odas
Di month of Rahmah (blessing), barakah(mercy)and Magfirah dey upon us
Di blessed month na precious gift from Allah to muslims
But do we know why dis moth dey so special to muslims
Na wetin be di main koko for dis month, and all di blessings wey dey wit it
Na wetin be di lessons wey we suppose take away in observing, di sanctity wey dey dis month
Of course, dis month dey to train us, guide us, and to remind us of how we suppose approach di 11 months of di year wey remain
Ramadan dey teach us plenti lessons: how we go develop awa manners and moral fortitude, how we go treat awa fellow beings wit respect, how we go strenghten awa brodahood , how we go maintain unity wey dey di Muslim community, and how we go dey welkom di non-Muslims wey we dey share land togedir
Di month dey also tech us make we dey more pious, disciplined, and how we go maintain self-control, wen we dey shield awa souls from greed and immorality
But di main koko be say di month dey teach us how we fit improve awa connection wit di Almighty
Di month of Ramadan dey also instill sense of empathy wey dey inside us
E dey allow us to understand di situation of di less fortunate, make we feel and experience di pain of hunger and di pangs of thirst wey awa poverty-stricken brodas and sisters wey no get choice but to go witout food and drinks dey feel everi day wen dem wake
Ramadan na month of mercy and bonding Muslims wey dey all over di world dey help one anoda, and those wey dey dia community, make dem dey spread happiness all around
Dis month na shinny example for di unity wey we fit achieve among all classes of pipo wey dey any society as di rich and di poor, di employer as well as di employee; di parents as well as di subjects, all dey fast
Regardless of di colour wey dem get for skin or dia social stature, na fasting dey unite all
E dey remind us how we suppose conduct awaselves and awa behaviour towards those wey dey around us while e dey also teach us di impotance of respect
No be to dey abstain from foods and drinks we learn, but we also abstain make we no go make statements and actions wey fit kos harm to pipo or violate rights wey dem get
E dey give us opportunity wey we go use rectify awaselves through performing plenti good deeds wey be like providing food or aid to di needy, improving social interaction, giving charity, sadaqah and zakat, and so on
Di Almighty go remember all di deeds wey do for judgement day
But wetin go apun to all di lesson wey we don learn afta Ramadan
Unfortuntely, we no too dey retain any of di lessons wey we learn for dis holy month pass Eid-Il-Fitr itself
But di koko for Ramadan run deep pass mere celebration
Di lessons wey we receive be di lodestar for di rest of di 11 months for any year wey dem give
Di training wey we receive suppose improve us as human beings fo di rest of awa lives, as dat na di main koko of Ramadan
Afta di month don end, and we don observe awa final fast, and dem don deal wit di Eid celebrations, we go go back to awa normal lives
But e dey important make we kip di spirit of Ramadan alive for di rest of di year, and indeed for awa live wey remain
bikos, na only through unity, modesty, and temperance we fit make di world a place wey beta for all of us
As we don tok evri evri, di nation leadres, political and odawise, get plenti wey dem go take from di lessons of Ramadan
If dem fit curtail deir materialistic tendencies and pay more attention to di yearnings fo di pipo , di Kontri go bikom a place much happier for Evribodi
We direfore dey urge awa leaders make dem imbibe lessons for Ramadan
To awa plenti Muslim readers we tok say , Eid Mubarak
Make Allah reward una sacrifice

Column no 6: who dey check checkpoint for Abuja
E dey go as dem dey tok am say Abuja, wey be di capital for awa dear Naija, dey important
So na me go be di last person wey go complain say security too much
In fact, I go even tok am say e need am more
Checkpoints, wey be di incredibly useful security constructs, don help and e still dey kontinue to help make e either thwart criminal, or even proactively tackle crime
Di police, wey dem saddle wit plenti of di internal security, at least for di ideal situation, man most of di checkpoints for Abuja Metropolis, as well as areas wey dey di surrounding
Sure, di army don pick up di slack for some places, but di boys supose be di main custodians
Dem vex for di pikin say dem do dat kain thing
Boy, dem dey mess things up for plenti cases
For starters, take for instance one of di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II, particularly di one wey dey lead from zone 4 treach Wuse II , just before e reach di bridge
di conduct of di officers for dere, for my experience, dey abysmal
anyone wey ply dat road afta 9pm
I no go enta details, but wetin I fit tok be say e dey extremely unprofessional sometimes
still for Wuse II, just beside di AP Plaza, di Tori na di same
I go lyk suggest to di higher-ups make dem monitor all di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II make dem see wetin I dey tok firsthand
but di checkpoints horror Tori no end for there
probably di one wey worst pass na di checkpoint wey dey afta di popular Banex junction wey dem dey man by cops wey dey from di Counter Terrorismm Unit (CTU) no less
barking at commuters and intimidating innocent citizens evri night, dem cut a picture of a poorly-trained and badly-behaved set of individuals wey seem to miss di point say dem suppose protect and serve citizens
na di same CTU dey responsible for di presonnel manning for one checkpoint wey dey near di Naija Farms And Ranch (NAFARLS), wia all kain tinz dey unfold
anyone wey dey ply dat road fit see for demselves
I go also request make di higher-ups do di same, wit a view wey dem go use fix things
forget Abuja for one minute
look around Naija, and di plenti checkpoints roadblocks, really for highway across di Kontri by numerous security agencies, dem dey see am a reson for loss of time generally, or even for consumer goods and services
as di case be wit awa security organisations, dem dey always push back swiftly, wit well-oiled PR machines wey deny allegations or issuing veiled threats
no forget di fact say while plenti checkpoints fit be legal, plenti are not
dem make am clear by di way and manner in which di personnel mounting dey carry out dia activities
now, dis no be police-bashing piece
E no suppose disparge VIOs and FRSC personnel
E be general critique for checkpoints and how we dey do am for dis part of di world
which means we go look at odas, lyk di Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and dat of VIOs
again, I no go yarn too much, just make I suggest closer monioring of di checkopints and checkpoints, really for some revelation dey shock
dis na bikos dis no be piece wey suppose disparge anyone or any organisation
but generally someone fit do something about di ridiculous lack of quality of awa checkpoints?
checkpoints no be recent, e far as innovations go
dem be set standards for di various stypes wey exist, wetin we need do na to adhere to dem
dem dey quite helpful for fighting crime, we no fit wish dem away
But we owe to awaself to get dem right
like most things dem get di capacity for great good, but if to say dem handle am badly, e fit be source for plenti bad things
maybe if we focus on di one wey dey Abuja go help us, as best practices don dey spread nationwide
I no get interest in highlighting di bad, but di personnel wey dey di checkpoint dey make am inevitable
as all hope neva lost: I dey hope say somehow, someone, somewia wey fit do something about awa checkpoints go do something dem
dat someone, somewia, somehow, dey check awa checkpoints, and di pipo wey dey man dem
e fit make all di difference in awa safety and public perception about awa security personnel,wey be something we dey lack solely for a while now
Glut don jam Katsina tomato farmers
Farmers and dealers of tomatoes for Katsina state don experince for di past two weeks acute market glut; some don resort to dey sun-dry di produce
according to di farrmers, dem no dey expect dat kain development, considering di stiff economic condition wey dey di Kontri, high cost and demand for food items, as well as longtime border closure wey halt free importation of food items wey include tomato paste
Shehu Bashiru Danja, wey be tomato farmer yarn say dem dey expect huge revenue for dis period but dem dash deir hope wit di recent development
plenti of us don target christmas and New year period, wit di hope say we go make good sales or di produce, but e shock us say we go end up for market glut
hin tok say e really affect us bikos of di high cost of production wey involve fertiliser, seeds,herbicides/pesticides and labor
Bahiru kom add say since di closure for land borders and di outbreak of COVID-19, di market price for tomato no less pass N1,000 for one basket until recently
hin kom add for last year say dem sell one big basket of tomatoes between N3,000 and N10,00, one reason wey many irrigation farmers dis season go concentrate on tomato production, and dem dey hope say e go yield huge profits pass crops like wheat, irish potato,or cabbage
Hamza Dalhatu, wey be tomato merchant and farmer yarn say dem borne di market glut out of protest against di indiscriminate taxes and levies wey dem put for di produce for Southern market
so tey last year, increase don dey in taxes and levies on awa goods and trucks wey dey di southern part for di Kontri
di security issue wey dey linger be threats to awa merchants; na so dem suspend business till dem sort out things
we no fit kontinue lyk dat
Dalhatu tok say, all di cost burden go end up on farmers wey no go consider di cost of production .
one check for Danja and Funtua market don reveal say one small basket of tomatoes cost N400 wen one big basket no pass N1,200
so tey last week Friday
anoda tomato dealer, Sani Suleiman Hunkuyi, don express hope say things go soon normal as dealers for Lagos and Ibadan don visit some of dia members wey dey Sokoto, Kebbi, and Zamfara make dem fashion out new terms for di business
di market glut for di produce be temporary and farmers go soon kontinue dey reap I maximum benefits for dem sweat
Suleiman tok say
supreme price: di Tori wey dem no yarn of policemen wey dem kill for ENDSARS protest
Sergeant Adegoke Ajibola and Corporal Rotimi Oladele run as fast as deir legs fit carry,seek for place wey dem go hide, pleaded for deir lives as di mob close on dem
all dia pleas go fall on deaf ears
dem drag dem, beat dem, hit dem wit sticks, knives and any objects wey dey available for sight
for di time wey dem still dey beg make dem spare dia lives, dem set dem for fire for one heap of tyres
as di fire dey rage , dia voice lost for di flames, wey dem no go eva hear dem for for life
di two men wey dem burn to death for Iwo Road for di ancient town fo Ibadan , wey be di largest city for Naija, no be criminals
no, di only crime be say dem be crime fighters
one video wey go viral by one of di hoodlums show di despicable scene as dem set di policemen ablaze on top a heap of tyres wey dem don use and dem shared dia bodi
di two dey among di policemen wey no less 22, seven soldiers and 59 civilians wey dem kill for October 2020 during di ENDSARS protest, according to di toll wey President Muhammadu Buhari announce for one emergency meeting wey hin get wit former Nigerian leaders
di ENDSARS be decentralised social movement and a series of mass protests gainst police brutality For Naija
di slogan call for make dem disband di Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), wey be one notorious unit of di Nigerian Police and e get long record for abuse
di EndSARS protest, wey last two weeks, dey peaceful until hoodlums wey loot public and private-owned warehouse burn police station and destroy propety hijack am
according to di official record and findings by awa correspondence,Ajibola and Oladele no be members of di SARS wey dem just disband
in fact dem no be regular policemen wey dem dey see for road as finding don reveal say dem dey attached to di operation department for Oyo state police command
di area wey dem dey engage dey usually be for special duty as different companies and organisations de request, and as e dey approved by di command
dem dey dia way for dat engagement for one fish depot for di Wema Bank area wey dey Gbagi for Ibadan wen dem meet dia untimely death
coincidentally, Ajibola wey be 41 year-old and hin colleague,Oladele, get three pikin each
Oladele's wife, Feranmi,just born dia third pikin 16 days before di unfortunate incident
Feranmi, wey be di orphan, just as her husband wey late, tok say di news of hin death shattered her world
tears well up for her eyes as she dey recount di experience of six months ago wey dey horrifying
sensing danger as di EndSARS protest don dey tun violent for some areas, Feranmi don plead make Oladele stay for house
her husband ignore her plea, wey say hin no fit abdicate hin responsibilities as a law enforcement agent

na Daily Trust Foundation fund di Tori, and na MacArthur Foundation support am
Abiodun Alade and Eugene Agha for Lagos, Jeremiah Oke for Ibadan and Idowu Samotu for Abuja.
di only way be say make dem establish local storage and processing facilities wey dem go use produce zone across di Kontri
hin yarn say, make agric companies and entrepreneurs take dis challenge as soon as possible take use solve di long time problem
Dem dey develop Naija's gas for di domestic market
di natural gas na one cultured industry wey dey drive innovation and e dey touch nearly Evri field and aspect of life wey we care about
from mobile phones to di makeup wey we dey wear, to medical devices, bank cards, and even di football wey e dey kick around wit friends
Di industry na one of di building blocks of di things wey we need and love evri day
dem dey use natural gas for transportation, cooking, electricity generation and manufacturing
Dem dey use am as raw material wey dem dey use make ferterlizer,antifreeze, plastics, pharmaceuticals and fabrics
Di steel and paper industry dey also us e natural gas to generate process steam wey dem dey use for industrial applications
Data wey dey for ground don show say Africa's largest economy, Naija, get di largest natural gas reserves for di continent
wit oil, di industry go account for about 70 per cent of its revenue, e go make di sector one of Naija's best and most sought-afta employment sectors
plenti of Naija's electricity generation na from natural gas, while dem dey use di crude oil for power backup
one forecast wey di U.S Energy Information Administration do don show say dat natural gas go be di largest elcetricity generation source
Natural- gas dem bring its sevaral quality- of-life environmental benefits bikos e dey relatively clean burning-fuel
Globally, di sector dey dey produce millions of jobs, ,wit employment wey dey up to 40 per cent so tey di Great Reccession of 008 for di U.S alone
Thus, given di gas reserves wey dey exist, e shock to see say Naija no dey lead di continent gas industry
President Buhari don launch di kontri's decade of gas, for 29th of March 2021
Di aim na to transform Naija into a gas-powered industrialised economy by 2030
Developing di gas industry go boost oda industries through di provsion of electricity and raw materials
Here, we go shine light on three points: some gas development policies wey dey critical, di potential benefits of developing di gas industry for di domestic market , and di employent opportunities wey dey gas industry
So tey di discovery of gas for Naija, subsequent attempts to develop di industry
For example, di gas commercialisation and utilisation programmes contributed to reduce gas flaring and increase gas utilisation by about 300 per cent between 1995 and 2017
there be gas pipeline projects wey concentrate on di western part of di kontri and di continent
Dem commissioned di first Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System for 1989 to supply lagos and neighboring south-west states
Afta di success of di ELPS, di goverment agree make dem dey supply Ghana, Benin and Togo through di Western African Gas Pipeline wey dem commission for 2016
Howeva, dis project no dey favourable to di kontri's domestic market, given di persistent issues for power wey dey di kontri
Evidently, Naija's power sector dey challenged wit electricity facilities wey poor, shortage for natural gas supply, distribution network wey dey inefficient and transmission system wey dey inadequate
Accordig to di 2018 estimate wey di International Energy Agency do, na only 60 per cent of Naija dey use natural gas
population get access to electricity
power shortage don limit di growth for di Kontri's total population for all sectors
E don kos make plenti business close or move completely to neighboring kontries
E dey challenge new start-ups and attract foreign investment
Di lack of electricity don contribute to di high rate of inflation as business don dey pay for expensive alternative electricity source, dia production cost don increase, and e dey increase di price of goods and services
To mitigate diz issue, di Buhari administration don commision gas infrastructure project make dem promote use of gas for domestic market
Di projects include di second Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS-2) Obiafu Obriko
Oben (OB3) gas line and di Ajaokuta to Kaduna to Kano (AKK) gas line
Di AKK gas line project go pass through Abuja from Ajaokuta
Den we go see anoda line from Abuja to Kaduna,, den from Kaduna to Zaria, and from Zaria to Kano
wit hindight, dem suppose do dis projects since di turn of di millenium
Nonetheless, dem be notable projects and dem suppose praise dem wit optimism
Dem expect make di project guarantee net investment return
Di gas line go provide gas to cement firms, and residential customers
Di users of compressed natural gas like buses and trucks go dey able to buy di product cheaper as di supply don increase
Di governmet dey also plan to build three new gas-fired power plants for power generation plants wey dem fit locate for Abuja, Kaduna, and Kano, make dem use di pipelines gas to generate 3,600 MW power
Di power plant go provide electricity for households and many industries wey dey di Northern part of di kontri
Di benefit for producing a decent amount of power and raw materials from gas go born one success tori
For example, if dem resuscitate di textile industry e go mean say dem dey revive di largest manufacturing sub-sector, wey account for 22 per cent of employment and 15 per cent of manufacturing value-added for 1984
in di long run, di tax revenue for di performing industries and employees go outweigh di cost of pipeline projects
If to say goverment policies dey successful, all oda things as e dey equal, di natural gas industry go be one major source of job opportunities for Naija's labour force wey dey rise
Di industry get high concentration of contractors and sub-contractors, wit different splits wey dey between specialists
Dem characterise di industry as semi-skiled and skiled crafts trades positions
Demmno restrict jobs wey dey di sector to petrolrum engineers alone
plenti roles no need special education
Di skil na something e fit learn on di job, from attorneys to welders to architects, truck drivers and accountants
Di industry dey also pay minimum wage
E mean say di industry get enormous opprtunity to attract, retain, and developlifelong careers for individuals as di industry dey expand
To dey find job for di industry dey similar to oda sophisticated, high-tech industries
Employees suppose get decent education, some certification as industry specialist go be an advantage, training and experince go go far
therefore, as di goverment dey lay out policies for di Decade of Gas,, di opportunity for capacity development go open
Di education sector fit explore di training curriculum wey dey for di industry and ways wey dem go take use attract industry experts wey go contribute to capacity development
In conclusion, di decade for Gas na desirable policy
E be opportunity for Naija wey dem go use to develop di gas industry, even as e dey look a bit too late for dis administration
Thus, di goment wey next and all di relevant stakeholders suppose consider dis ingenuity wey dem go use transform di kontri to a gas-powered industrialised economy

As di demand for rabbit don dey increase, frmers dey explain say make di youths key in for dis kain of farming
Rabbit farming no common for Naija but di demand for rabbit meat dey grow as e be for kontries like Europe and Asia
Acoording to wetin di Food and Agriculture Organisation of di United Nations (FAO) don estimate say dem dey slaughter 1.2 billion rabbits annually for meat
Di South African National Agricultural Marketing Council for June 2020 don reveal say 1.48 million tons of rabbit meat were produced in 2017.
China wey be di leading producer dey acount for 62.9% of di production wey dey global, followed by followed by North Korea (10.4%), Spain (3.9%) and Egypt (3.8%), among odas
As 2019 dey end, Hungary, China, France and Spain dey among di major contributors to di trade balance for rabbit meat by value globally
According to wetin statistic say .Germany, Belgium and Italy na di leading importers as dem dey command 21%, 19.2% and 9.3% share of global imports respectively
For Naija here, one far, Wise Trust Intl Ltd dey change di narrative amidst huge and rising demand for rabbit meat and breeding stock for di kontri
Pastor Tayo Ayinla wey white meat dey drive hin passion tok am say hin first motivation for di rabbit business na di health benefit bikos pipo wey dey hin age suppose cut down di consumption of red meat and waka dey chop white meat hin kom add say di motivation further led to di discovery of its economic benefits.
Na di pastor get di biggest rabbit farm for di Federal Capital Territory
Hin get 17 species of rabbit on top di farm wey hin start like say a year ago for Karshi, for Abuja Municipal Area Council.
Hin dey raise dem for cage, hutches wey dem construct locally and in free range
Dis reporter wey dey Karshi, visit di farm wia di pastor kom share hin knowledge of rabbit farming so odas fit tap into am
Hin also get rabbits for anoda farm for Kwara state
Some of di free range rabbit for di farm
How rabbits dey multiply
Hin say if di farmer get about 60 to 70 doe ( na di female rabbit dem dey call doe and di male buck) wit an average of five births per rabbit, hin go get very good number per year.
For instance, on dis farm, we don see a doe wey born 10 to 11 rabbits
But I wan dey more conservative
So make we say five rabbits as an average: di one rabbit fit give farmer between 25 to 30 rabbits for a year bikos wen good management dey dem fit produce four to six times for one year
So if to say hin get five for one year dat mean say hin get 25
Multiply am by di 60 wey we dey tok about e make 1,600 rabbits for one year
Of kos, una fit get pass dat
pipo dey demand for rabbit meat
Di demand for rabbit meat dey grow and according to wetin Pastor Ayinla say, dem neva meet di demand fully
Hin tell di reporter say hin receive order of 10 tons of rabbit meat for di Southwest but e dey very difficult to get even one ton
At some time una go get perosn wey go dey request for 2,500 rabbits say hin wan breed am but hin go get up 500
One time dey wey we get request of 2,500 rabbits for breeding stock for di whole of di North (di client organisation get Northern representative for Abuja here), but for di whole of di North, we dey only supply a little above 200 out of di order wey dem place for 2,500.
So rabbitry na upkoming ATM moni dispenser
Hin say very soon e go turn moni dispencing business
Di rabbit value chain don boom
Di farmer explain for di rabbit value chain say : most of us no know di benefits wey we get for rabbit rearing
Number one be say, plenti value dey for rabbit farming
As a farmer una fit make moni from selling di rabbits breding stock to anoda farmer; una fit sell rabbit meat to those wey want am; una fit get income through di sale of dia poo or from di conversion of dia poo into gas for cooking, or generation of electricity and wetin remain of dat process fit be used as fertiliser.
Most pipo dey use rabbit wastes for fertiliser but e no dey as effective as wen una dey pass di poo for some process
Also, dem fit use di urine as pesticide for di production of vegetables
Cost wey dem dey take use start rabbit farm no dey expensive
wit just N25,000 to N30,000 farmer fit start rabbit farming
Di good thing be say anybodi fit do am; an old person fit do am bikos of di management dey very easy
Una no need one particular place to do rabbit farming bikos dem be neat animals, dem no dey smell
Actually una fit do am for una house even for person wey get two-bedroom flat
For instance, una fit convert one of di room
Dem no dey smell
Di farmers dey always kom buy from us; we dey assist dem set up dia farms
And as I tok am, for awa own little way, we start am about a year ago
Rabbit feed no dey expensive
Di thing wey good about rabbits be say dia feeding no dey demand, dem just dey chop anything
For instance, as we dey handle am here, we dey usually go meet pipo wey dey sell cabbage and collect di outer cover of di cabbage, e dey okay for dem
Also for di person wey dey sell watermelons, pipo dey usually chop di red part throw-way di cover
Di cover dey medicinal to dem
Also, we dey go market wey dem dey sell carrots go pick di leaves
Virtually wetin rabbit dey chop na almost free, and e dey get much easier
wen di rain start den we fit get plenti fresh leaves for dem
One word for di youths be say make dem work hard
My advice for di youths be say make dem understand say di goverment no fit meet all of awa needs
Di reason why we dey get some kain kwanta be say plenti pipo want make goverment jobs
First and foremost, una need look inward: wetin I fit do for myself
Until una fit do something for unaself una no fit do anything for di kontri
Una suppose understand say lots of opportunity dey as dis kontri is concerned
Some pipo go tell you say dem wan do dis and dat
Egun pipo speak beta pass una
But market no dey
So di question na: how una go dey kontri wey get pass 200 million pipo kom dey tok say money no dey
Una dey tok say market no dey
Na either una no understand how dem dey market wetin una dey do
Abi una no know how dem dey do business
Like for rabbit, if una see how awa rabbits be, di business go attract you, dem dey look so robust
So pipo dey say I neva see rabbit wey big like dis
Dis na di way we dey take use manage dem in terms of wetin we feed dem and di environment wey we create for dem
So pipo go begin dey look inwards.
Na only e-voting go ensure rancour say free polls dey for Naija- Diri
Senator Duoye Diri wey be di Bayelsa state governor tok say di hitch-free conduct of di Ijaw National Congress (INC) election wey dem do through electronic voting don indicate say Naija fit hold rancour-free national elections if dem adopt dat kain measure

Banks assets don declare and corruption war
Chairman for di economic and financial crimes commission (EFCC) Abdulrasheed Bawa don make declaration say dem go resuscitate di Bank Employees Assets Declaration Act of 1986 to block loopholes wey bankers don create to sanitise di kontri's financial system
According to wetin Bawa tok, dem take di decision due to di role wey dem dey expect make bankers play for di fight against corruption, as di EFCC don mandate am to ensure say dem comply wit di Act.
Section 1 for di Bank Employees Declaration of Assets Act 1986 don make am mandatory for Evri employee for di bank to make full disclosure of assets upon employment for annual basis.
Di law wey dey under Section 7 Sub-Section 1 stipulates say na offence e go be for an employee of a bank make e own assets in excess of dia legitimate and probable income
Afta di EFCC chairman don stipulate di deadline, consequences go arise as a result of non-declaration by bank employees
Spelt out penealty of 10 years inprisonment upon conviction as well as forfeiture of assets wey dey beyond and above legitimate income and probable earnings for dat kain bank employees.
Dis piece of legislature don dey so tey 1986 under di military
So tey, dis part of di constitution don dey ineeffective by those wey suppose dey implement am ordinarily
Bankers don aware of dis legislation but di level wey dem dey comply no dey encouraging
For di 80s, dem dey hand form to bankers wey dem go complete and submit
But as e dey go for awa kontri, dem don abandon di implementation of dat provision for di law , and dem no longer consideram as a fundamental part for di banking profession.
Stakeholders dey blame di failure on top di authorities wey include di CBN, Chartered Institute of Bank of Naija (CIBN) and Bankers Committee for some kain abnormalities wey dey di industry.
According to wetin dem dey tok, dem say diz regulators dey rely on di bank wey dem suppose supervise, make e supply information
For instance, dem don argue am say di failed banks episode apun some months afta dem give di regulator for diz banks clean bill of health
Dis suggest say dem don doctor di information wey di bank supplied
Naija don dey battle case like corruption and money laundering and dem dey accuse bankers and banking officials say dem be part of it
Some moni don remain redundant for plenti accounts bikos some account owners don kpeme which some bank officials go convert to dia own as dem go leave families of di account owners for penury.
Dis dey in spite of di fact say di banking sector no strange to self-regulation,given its tempting, delicate and di operating system wey dey fragile
Di CIBN Act of 2007 don dey regulate di banking system
E get code of conduct wey bankers don agree pon wit CBN
Disciplinary tribunal wey get power for di high court dey and e dey ensure say dem bring reported infractions, unethical conduct and indiscipline before di tribunal, and sanctions wey dem recommended for formal prosecution.
But one of di challenges be di weak reporting system wey bankers get wey dey lead to di inability of CIBN make dem take appropriate actions.
Di spirit wey stan gidigba for di back of di Act of 1986 na to make clear, di financial standing wey bank employee get for di time of employment, and afta years of service, in a bid wey go make dem ascertain say dem dey commensurate dia legitimate earnings wit dia lifestyles wey dey current
Na dis dey kom on top di heels of allegation say some bankers be direct beneficiaries for fraudulent transactions wey dem dey carry out for di bank
Wetin be common knowledge be say di declaration of assests by public officers wey include di civil servants, pesin wey dey politically exposed and those wey dey for di Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).
Dem require dem make dem declare dia assets evri four years
On top di election and appointment of political office holders, before dem assume office dem suppose declare di assets wey dey get pon entry kom declare am again for di exit point
Dem do dis declaration by oath
For anoda word, execution and attestation before di high court or some oda superior officer for di law dey
Di Naija customs service (NCS), Naija Immigration Service (NIS), among odas, dem don covered by di Code of Conduct Act wit regard to di declaration of dia assets.
As e dey so finacial experts believe say di impression wey di directive to bankers create make dem comply wit di of legislation wey dey pre-exist dey amount to stigmatisation and e dey also isolates bank employees, wey dey puts dem in di limelight.
In oda words, d belief of revisiting of di Act of 1986 dey encourage di policy of isolation wey dey kos apprehension in di industry.
Dis na di concern say di Act fit kos enrolment into di banking profession to further go down as a result of stigmatisation.
Some stakeholders don caution against di drama about stigmatisation, arguing say plenti bankers, from di highest cadre to di level wey low pass, dey live above dia means.
According to wetin dem tok , an average banker even from dia early point of calling, dey cut corners by conniving wit customers say dem go beat di system.
Dem insist say for evri major corruption, banker wey dey facilitate di transaction dey
E dey laudible say di EFCC dey try use di Act for reason wey good
Di worry be say di banks wey di goment no own per se although di goverment get shares in dem
Dem dey use bank save moni
Di koko be say laws wey dey check illicit enrichment dey
Article 20 for di UN Convention Against Corruption dey explicit on top dis
Section 7 for di EFCC act don empower EFCC make e dey investigate pesin wey hin lifestyle no commensurate wit di means of income wey dem get
Dem believe am for some part say di politically exposed person dey plunder di assests for dis kontri plenti of dem dey untouchable
Dem accuse EFCC say e no fair and even-handed
If dem sanitise di banking sector, we go get ripple effect for oda sectors of di economy
Dem take all diz measure to strengden di fight against corruption, and not to stigmatise di banking profession or portray it as di scapegoat wey dey witin di system.
Besides, di banking career no be one kain rouguish profession
Some bankers be di forefront of exposing some of di mega corruption issues wey wedon see di EFCC making headway.
Part of why dis law dey be say e dey ensure make di kontri dey free from financial crimes, and make e dey also block loopholes wey unscrupulous players dey esploit
While dem dey hope say make di Act of 1986 na sincere attempt at sanitising di system , dem suppose create platform wey go report thresholds of deposits on a daily basis, and di regulator suppose dey able to access it to know di declarations wey dem make.
E dey make am easy reference to wetin dem don declare as legitimate income to check those wey dey live above dia means

Farmers don raise concern as CBN don suspend anchor Borrowers loans
Farmers and oda stakeholders for di agricultural sector dey express dia concern over di suspension of agricultural loans wey dem dey access through di Naija Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) by di Central Bank of Naija (CBN) recently
I dey think say una dey run/jappa for me
E dey handle most of di agric loans to di farmers by di CBN especially its popular Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP).
Di apex bank say di fraudulent activities for NIRSAL loans under di ABP and dem order for di suspension of such loans until dem don pay all previous beneficiaries back.
E no dey clear yet if di suspension dey only on di Anchor Borrowers Programme alone or e also include those of Micro finance banks through NIRSAL.
Di suspension don ground loan activities fror NIRSAL and farmers dey worried say among odas, di timing dey wrong, as many of dem don go far wit plans say dem go expand dia agricultural production
One farmer wey dey really worried say wetin dey apun now dey threaten di economy and e dey call on top di CBN make dem please step in and save millions of Naija pipo make dem access diS loans for agricultural production.
Plenti farmers wey dey wait for NIRSAL disbursement for di social media handle don express sadness over di suspension of di loan facility as e dey threaten to ground dia dreams for expansion.
As hin dey react to di development for di chat wit awa Agric Editor, di leadership of all di farmers association of Naija, wey Architect Kabiru Ibrahin dey head am, tok say thoughdi CBN dey blames NIRSAL for di non-performance of di ABP, make dem do di needful in fishing out those wey dey responsible.
Make e dey kontinu to provide qualified farmers di support wey dem need
We dey urge di CBN make dem do due dilligence in prequalifying farmers wey dey participate for di programme bikos several cases of briefcase farmers wey dey pose as real farmers abound.
Dem collude wit some NIRSAL officials make dem defraud di programme
Timely repayment no dey forthkoming for di ABP bikos of di fraud
Anyone wey give bribe to take a loan wit an interest component no get desire to repay am
awa initial understanding of di role of di NIRSAL na to primarily incentivize commercial banks make dem embrace lending for agricultural production but certainly no be to prequalify prospective loan seeking companies.
dis na how corruption take take over and di farmers now be di worst for it
Hin say we dey call on top di CBN make e reverse di decision on top di disbursement of di ABP support to farmers
Dr Femi Oke wey be di AFAN chairman for South-west zone say di suspension of di NIRSAL loans go impact food production for di kontri greatly
As Oke dey follow di News Agency of Naija (NAN) for Lagos don urge di CBN make dem investigate di allegations wey dey against NIRSAL witout undermining di various efforts wey farmers get toward achieving food security and self-sufficiency.
Hin call on top di CBN make dem resolve di issues wey dey surround di suspension of di NIRSAL loans

NAN also reported say di CBN recently suspend all loans wey di NIRSAL disburse following di allegation of corruption by its officials
Wetin dey una mind
Di memo say dem go only reverse di decision afta dem pay all outstanding loan wey farmers neva pay back
According to wetin Oke yarn wen we hear about di suspension of di NIRSAL loans, we don know immediately say dis no good for di farmers and di sector.
for wetin we hear, dem base di suspension for di ABP
We want make CBN lay more emphasis on how dem go go about am bikos some of di farmers don go do interview on NIRSAL loans, while odas dey await di disbursement of di funds.
wetin go be dia fate now?
hin say, e no good and we dey implore make goverment chook mouth for di mata and address am
Oke don urge di goverment make di federal goverment intervene, in order make e no jeopardise di efforts wey farmers wey don invest for hin farm, and those wey dey wait for di loans wey go make dem plant dis season
Dem need do something immediately make e no go jeopardise di effort of di farmers say dem ready to go back to di farm
Plenti farmers specifically in di South-West dey wait on top di loan and dem dey expect say by now dem suppose disburse am
Very few of awa members don get access to di loan, plenti neva get access to di interview
me self neva do di interview
I still dey wait make dem select me
hin stressed am say, farmers no dey hapi on top di suspension of loan
Di AFAN chairman don tok am for di NIRSAL selection process say e dey slow bikos of di COVID-19 pandemic such dat na only about 10 per cent of awa farmers don benefit for di loan.
Hin say we want make di federal goverment clarify if di suspension go dey on di CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme alone and on di Microfinance bank through NIRSAL
Immediate reaction from di NIRSAL no dey ova di suspension of di loans as an official, wey crave make e dey anonymous, tok say na only di CBN fit tok on top di mata and e don tok.
Sources for di apex bank tok say di suspension dey to ensure efficiency for di system and assure farmers for di bank's commitment to guarantee food security

Hunger, poverty and di challenge for innovative food storage
If una visit plenti offices across di kontri for lunchtime during di months of may, june, july and August, chances dey high say una go find a good number of workers wey dey munch am for mouth.
True as corn don dey season one of di delicacies for dis time na di combination of roasted corn ( wey dem popularly code-name as mouth organ) and di pear for Africa pear.
Coconut na ocassional substitute wey dey close to pear dis writer get good authority ova am say plenti pipo dey find di coconut and a mouth-organ combination say e delicious
Outside dis months wey corn and pear dey season di combination no dey dey available
During di harvest months enough corn and pear wey go sustain di kontri for a substantial period, perhaps na an entire year, dem go don harvest am
But wit inadequate knowledge and how dem go utilize modern and cost-effective storage and preservation methods, tonnes of maize and pear just dey waste Evri year.
Di same dey apply to oda agricultural commodities for Naija
For harvest periods, surplus dey often dey, but in di absence of proper storage, a huge proportion of dis harvest dey waste.
Dis perennial issues don pose one huge threat to di economic well-being of farmers, di major wey dey operate for di subsistence level.
Di challenge wey be di kwanta of poor storge and preservation of food dey pose to awa kontri, don bekom more haunting wen pesin dey consider di difficulties wey confront us for di post-COVID era
E dey imperative say beyond di volume of awa agricultural output wey dey improve make we look critically at how we go empower farmers across di kontri manage dia harvests beta
Na dis go translate to immense economic value not only to di farmers demselves wey go enhance dia livelihoods, but also to di kontri as a whole, as plenti food go dey available for extended periods , for consumption and export
Plenti research organisations and universities don introduce different solutions to di kwanta of post-harvest losses as di years dey pass
Di innovations wey dem don develop, being home-grown dey unique bikos dem dey reflect di reality of awa local goverment
No be say dem dey relatively cheap, as dem dey often dey technically uncomplicated, but farmers fit adopt dem readily
For di area of fish farming, one innovation dey wey dem dey call am iced-fish box wey dem go use harvest fish go store am so e go remain fresh on transportation to di market from di farm or ahead of processing and storage.
Dem don develop special smoking kilns wey go replace di labour-intensive, traditional fish smoking methods wey no dey efficient and e dey unhealthy
Outputs wey dey commot for dis kilns be good enough for export and e dey several multiples of wetin dem dey ordinarily obtain for traditional fish-smoking methods.
Naija researchers don also produce composite packaging material wey dem fit use package dat kain smoked fish or even smoked meat as di case fit be, preserving di end-product and e dey boost di commercial appeal
If to say na beans, corn or rice wey don discoloured, mouldy, smelly or e dey infected wit weevils, grains dey pose gbege of storage for farmers and e dey lead to considerable financial losses
For di past, grains wey dem dey export from Naija don face rejection bikos of di unacceptable level of residual pesticides wey dem contain
Local researchers wey dey active for di area of grain preservation, churning out of a handful of innovative solutions ova di years
For instance, solar dryers wey dem develop for different products dey
If to say di abundance of sunshine wey dey awa kontri and di simplicity of construction of dis dryers, dem dey available for average farmers
Dem fit replicate construction easily for di local setin
Dis solar dryers work dey enhance di efficiency of drying of agricultural produce
Dem dey do dis as dem dey concentrate di rays of di sun on a particular surface, wey go dey enhance drying efficiency over di traditional method wey dem dey take use spread grains, cassava, plantain peeling and odas indiscriminately under di sun
local researchers don develop specially constructed steel drums wey wen dem shut am bikom airtight (hermit) and e dey allow make farmers store grains ova several months
Dem be specialised storage silos wey fit help store and preserve grains over plenti months
In fact one twin silo dey, wey fit accommodate 100 tonnes of grains at a time
Local researchers don also develop bio-pesticide as an alternative to chemical pesticides
Chemical pesticides wey dey available though effective against pest dey harmful to man and hin environment, too
Bio-pesticide for di oda hand, dey much safer and dem dey constitute no hazard for environment
Dem make One of such pesticide (NSPRIDUST) wey be an innovation by di Naija stored product research institute, from diatomaceous earth, wey be a powdery form wey dey occure for rock naturally for Naija
Bio-pesticides go help make Naija grains potentially dey more acceptable for di export market
We no fit leave fruit and vegetable out of di problem of poor preservation and storage for Naija
As we dey import apple, pears, strawberries and oda fruits round-di-clock plenti no dey wey we go yarn on top Naija's fruit exports
Again, over time Naija researchers don herald different solutions to dis yawa wey dey ground
One shed wey dem construct specially for fruit and vegetable for instance, wey dem make of simple and raw materials wey be local ones , and e dey help farmers preserve fruits and vegegtables for long
Den, di fruit dryer, wey dey dry certain fruits dey help to preserve dem
Local researcher dey work fervently on top fruits and vegetable conservation using di principle of evaporative cooling
Evaporative cooling na di cooling wey dey result make water evaporate from a surface
Incidentally, di use of evaporative cooling for fruit and vegetable preservation no be new thing, as dem don dey practice am for traditional setin for Naija
Researchers don dey find way wey dem go take use enhance di efficiency of traditional evaporative cooling systems wey dem go use preserve di shelf life of fruits and vegetables ova a duration of time
For tubers of yam and potatoes, local researchers don kom up wit products like ventilated yam barns wey go dey store yam tubers, diffused-light store wey go dey for di storage of potatoes, cassava root warehouse wey go dey store cassava roots among odas
Doubt no dey say widespread adoption of dis technologies by farmers across di kontri go help to considerably stem di tide of post-harvest losses for Naija
Na dis, one suppose repeat go transalate to significant economic value wey no go be for only farmers and di agricultural chain rate wey wide but also for di entire kontri as well
To get di agricultural value chain make e increasingly adopt diz innovations go entail patient and sysyematic engagement
Farmers cooperatives and association go be good medium wey go help reach farmers across di kontri wit information and education
na so di media and media institutions
Research institutes and faculties for agriculture for awa various universities, wey be vital hotbeds for innovation, go work collaboratively so tey dem go jointly share and popularise innovations wey dem dey emanate diafrom
Agricultural chambers for commerce be potential source of popularising dis innovations especially as e dey among policymakers and influencers suppose be involved also
Di increasing penetration of smartphones across di kontri also present opportunity wey go reach millions of farmers wit information and education

To tame Nigeria oil spillage and gas flarin scourge
E kom from Jerome Mario-Utami
Di recent news report say Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line wey Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) dey operate discharge 213 barrel crude oil for Ikarama community for Bayelsa don reach awa side say though Nigeria wey been dey proud say dey be giant of Africa and di black kontri wey get pipo pass for di world stil dey get plenti third world kasala
As dem dey clarify say na like 1.34 hectare land dem pollute wit di leakage wey rupture for di pipeline follow, SPDC confirm say dey finish di investigation of di incident, dey tok say out of 213 of SPDC bonny light crude leak, na like 110 barrel dem see recover for di recovery exercise wey dem dey do for di site, e kom remain 109.12 barrel of di volume wey spill.
Admittedly, wetin Dutch oil giant claim na fact wey dem fit verify but e fit no be di only explanation
Notwitstandin dia clarification,reasons dey wey qualify dis kind apunin for Nigeria oil and gas industry as reality wey dey suppose analyse generally
Make we start wit reality
Aside from di awareness say spillage dey happen, communal right for environment wey clean and access for clean water supply na hin dey don violate for dat kind case, wit dia admission, dey don abandon thousands of site wey dey don pollute for di region, wey dem nid identify and study for detail as dey compensate di community wey e affect well for dia loss wella, dis lastest spill apun weeks afta one wey resemble am for one pipeline facility wey rupture wey one International Oil company wey dey operate for Niger Delta dey manage, wey dem report say destroy Benikrukru and commuinty wey dey around am for Warri South-west local goment Area for Delta state.
And anoda one for early momo on Sunday, March 14,2021 for Polubobu / Opuama, Warri North local Goment Area for di state, go fit settle.
Dis kind big scale set of spillage also include but e no dey limited to; di big spillage wey dey history for place like Ogini land, Rivers State and Erovie community for Ozoro, Isoko North Local Goment for Delta state for 1990s, di two for Nigeria south south zone and negative impact still dey der.
Shey na di only explanation /example dem be dis?
Di answer na ogbonge
no, as oda ones dey
Oda critical reason / concern dem why we suppose see di situation as crisis.
Di first and veri important na di inability of Nigeria and hin pipo to appreciate and treat activity wey relate to crude oil spillage and environment pollution wey dey kom from exploration/crude oil production as national calamity
Di second na di stunnin conciousness wey gas flarin/ environment degradation dey apun bikos of activities wey dey related to crude oil prospectin/ production for di kontri dey under-reported.
Dis second concern dey kom from one recent comment, wey be say from media report na from di Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, wey tok say wetin hin agency find show say average of five oil spills na hin Nigeria dey record evriday.
Musa, wey follow journalists tok for Abuja, tok say for 2018, we get 600 oil spill incident and for 2019, we get about 700 oil spill-impacted site actross di kontri.
Dis comment wey dey open brain dey more important for wetin we dey discourse if pesin remember say Nigeria accordin to report don get about 139 place wey gas don flare across Niger Delta both for di oil fields wey dey water and di one wey no dey, wer gas wey dey flare dey reach 11% of evrithin wey dem dey produce.
Pass anything, na di question dem wey e bring kom mind be; wetin dey stop di development of petroleum sector and Niger Delta region
Shey Legislative work no dey?
Why dis kind legislative framework no dey provide strong source of solution for pipo and community wey oil exploration and production affect badly for coastal comminity dem?
If dis framework dey, why e no dey work or make dem do am?
Shey di framework get evrithin like legal solution for di issues of violations wey relate to oil?
Why di nation neva learn serious lesson from Dutch goment wia all di pipo wey dey operate must restore wia dem dey operate back to how dey meet am?
Regardless of wetin oda pipo tok, di truth be say if all of us get am for mind to develop policy wey go bring prosperity for oil and gas sector, while we go still save di pipo for di region, we ready to find di strategic triangles wey hold di key to success for hand.
Apart from di fact say success need make dem analyse am wit care, of di different kind of knowledge wey dem need to make innovation possible, e don necessary for di nation make dem hold di middle ground since both di ministry and sector don dey manifest signs for long time now say dem go be institution wey no get potential wey strong.
And as we know, any organization, whether private or public wey no gree search for hin potential, hin survival na by chance.
For dis level, if we luk di operational template of di ministry, and how dey don know say di up, mid and down stream players of di petroleum industry say dem no dey follow rules, e no go dey wrong make pesin conclude say dem fit divide di serious reasons wey dey kos Crude oil spillage/gas flarin to; regulatory framework wey plenti wey no dey work, oil and gas exploration and production for Nigeria dey; federal goment failure to make di kontri refineries dey work to dia full capacity back ; petroleum ministry inability to make International Oil Companies dey follow di international best practices as e relate to di environment wey dem dey work; Di last one, clear responsibility/work details wey no dey and action plans for agencies and parastatals wey dey function under di ministry.
Di failures dem wey dey up get direct consequence, na bad influence for di sector, di ministry and di region.
To take explain dis points, make we use di first challenge start, e dey important to dey tok about di law dem wey regulate crude oil exploration and oil production issue wey plenti law dey regulate but too dey weak and di Acts wey dey law wey no dey just complicate how e dey work, but e don too old as time don dey change, e dey create corner corner way for pipo wey dey operate for der especially the International Oil Companies (IOC) make dem fit use exploit both di goment and host communities.
some of dis laws/acts wey we dey tok about don dey since 1960 but dey no dey achieve dia purpose wey Di Petroleum Act of 1969, Di Harmful Waste(Special Criminal Positions etc), Act 1988, Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963, Petroleum(Drillin and Production) Regulation 1969 dey but no be oly dis one dem.
(Subsidiary Legislation to Petroleum Act) and di off-shore Oil Revenue (Registration of Grants) Acts 1971 among odas.
As dey no mind di number, concept, provision and definition dem, dis law dem no dey useful again, dey don old to di extent say dem dey give pipo wey dey work for di sector corner corner to dey chop both di goment and host community dem.

IPOB Emma Powerful don threaten pipo say he go spill blood.
IPOB leader don threaten pipo say hin go dey kil pipo wey no reason wit am
Emma Powerful wey be media and publicity secretary for IPOB threat to dey kil any Igbo pesin wey no follow hin warning don dey too serious, and dey no suppose ignore am except say we no get goment, wer small small fascist like Mr Emma Powerful as he call himsef go dey tok say hin go dey drag pipo kom out, dey send dem go meet Baba God as he tok bikos dey no follow am or hin organization.
Di mouth wey hin dey run no be play; as e be say di kasala for Nigeria South-east show say na plan dey plan am.
As he no understand how simple Igbo leadership dey be, wey be say dia leader na Onye-oje ozi or servant of hin pipo, wey make di pipo agree wit am afta he don consult plenti pipo, Emma Powerful wey prefer one thug title, Onye-ike, wey be say na to dey force dem, make dem fear am and now he dey threaten to kil di same Ndigbo wey he say he dey fight for.
For man wey be say he no dey tolarate, wey be say to kil pipo take push hin cause no be kasala, di question be say who go wan stay tru tru for Cave Republic wey be say na thug dey run am
Di Biafra wey pipo know for history no be Ndigbo choice; Na di only choice wey dem force Ndigbo do be dat for dat time, wey dem face bravely wit plenti courage and sacrifice so dem go fit defend and uphold
Biafra no too oppose authority reach how dey try make di pipo right dey valid, no be say make dem just exist, but na to live wit dignity.
Di Biafra wey dey history na like safety precaution for all Igbo pipo wey suppose don too suffer dat time fit kom, place wey dey fit stay safely.
Di declaration and di struggle of di old Biafra no be show or avenue to make moni wey di pipo wey dey lead am dey do pass now.
Before dem declare Biafra for 1967, Eastern Consultative assembly, one group wey dey represent, still dey advice for all di opinion wey pipo get for east, bikos of wetin dey apun gree say make dem make di declaration wit dia authority.
Na di reason wey make di whole Ndigbo and oda tribe wey no be Igbo, wey sacrifice, wey dem no fit forget gree protect di republic wey still small
As di war dey end sef, wey Biafra don fall, wey evribodi don settle, Ndigbo go back go protect Nigeria, wit clean mind, strong determination and courage, so e go fit work,
Di context of new Nigeria kasala and disagreement for dia point of view wey dey deep na bikos of one neo-capitalist state wey dey go backward, and di chain of di productive forces, wey dem chain, wey no fit produce di material of hin existence again.
As di new Nigeria kasala dey grow, wey e no dey progress and e slow, di simple tins like tribe, culture and religion dey struggle to preserve, express and recreate diasef.
ova-all, e dey easy to carry retirement flag, wen dey no understand how socio-economic infrastructure dey important if dey wan build kontri wey go survive.
South Sudan wey be Africa last born still dey breastfeed as dia condition now worse pass dia former condition.
Notin show say Biafra current leader wey like to dey make noise know anythin about how dem dey build or create kontri
Even if dem dey independent, to built state no dey di real deal, to dey command pipo witout respect , make di fascist leaders like Emma Powerful wey dey threaten to kil pipo don show already.
Ndigbo too posh to get leaders wey be thug and tout, wey no understand say Igbo political culture and framework na to dey consult elders.
Mr Nnamdi Kanu wey been dey command dem, no know any village for Igboland apart from hin own, dey claim to be dia leader like say na hin own, pipo wey be say he no know how dem dey live except for di moni wey hin dey send give dem from abroad.
Mr Emma "di Powerful" wey be dia media and publicity secretary don use hin arrogance and petty fascist inpunity spoil Igbo basic framework wey be say na to dey consult pipo and to dey agree for somethin generally before dey do am.
Na only organisation wey thug full dey threaten to destroy pipo wey no gree wit am.
But dis new threat wey Mr Emma "de Powerful" issue say he go send pipo go meet dia forefathers sake of say dem no follow am, don too much.
I been dey imagine wetin di men wey bring Union Jack down, kom use Green-white-Green cloth replace am, di cloth wey be symbol for hope for dat early morning for october first 1960
E for don be like di great dream logic of di marine wey plant di America flag for Okinawa for 1945
sometimes, I been dey dream say I be one of dem
I go dey imagine say I be like dem and den if I reach house afta di ceremony, as my mind dey sweet me bikos of freedom and di blank canvass put before my veri own means.
I go go bed, go nirvana, go wait for morning so I go fit wake for mornin, go work.
E don reach sixty years since dat time
Even though say na only 30 years I be, I don live for di bad dream of Nigeria history for all di year one by one for dis sixty year journey, I don feel evri disappointment and evri sorrow wey pesin fit feel bikos say dia kontri fail.
E don reach sixty years now wey all my dream leave, some die, bikos ravishin drought wey follow dis land wey get plenti water .
Odas don fly comot
wetin do us?
I remember one artwork wey dey tok about sometin like "Age of Discovery" for Internet wey I see.
Inside,one man stand ova anoda man wey sidan for hammock wit power.
Dis suppose Amerigo Vespucci representation as he dey wake America continent of dat time make dem join mankind league as di last continent.
Na me and my brodas dey do house work for holiday wen we dey grow up.

Unlike America, dey don know Africa since beginnin of time, Indeed, na she first wake, she wake di rest sef but na she dem no know pass for di family, maybe bikos she go sleep back wen her siblins go dey work take discover fire and wheel.
Pipo like Joseph been call her Dark Continent
Since den, Africa no get any popular culture wey pipo know kom still accept apart from bloody, rooten and poor mindset wey reach to make one teenage band wey kom from America from di 80s feel say na dia moral duty to kos rain wey go stop di drought wey wan carry dem go by force.
Odawise she go die
E no dey ancient pass dat one, wetin she need na rain, nature, di same tin wey dia ancient forefathers sef need dat time.
Shey na wetin apun be dat?
Shey we sneak go bed back, afta we wake di oda pipo for we world
And shey we go sleep back afta dey wake us di second time?
Wu go know say Africa, togeda wit Nigeria go spoil so tey, dem go dey wait make some teenager wey no sure say dem no dia right from left dey give dem charity.
No be me
Shey Conrad correct?
Shey na my duty to dey tok truth sake of say I dey honest, to wetin hin think say my pipo dey do
Shey make I fly go out like di rest of my dream?
Maybe make I do am.
How we take reach der?
We enta one car wey get engine, di sound good and e dey sleek, e kom life like Noah Ark as we dey go for 1960
We suppose dey rocket ship dey go Mars, instead na inside mud we sink put, for one Jalopy wey hin engine no good.
Before awa eye wey don dey gnash, di heart of darkness kom be my home, and my home kom be "di oda world", di opposite of civilisation, place wia be say tin wey no reach man level dey yeye man intelligence wey dem dey use boast and dia grace.
I don resist Conrad for long time now and di sun don dey set, I don tire to dey fight
I dey ready to surrender, my situation wan resemble di of Chief Joseph of Nez Perce native America wen dey subdue am
I don read hin sermon for hin pipo afta he surrender somewia and I no fit stop myself as I dey tok am
Dey kil awa chiefs dem
Lookin glass don die.
Toohoolhoolzote don die
All di old men don die
Na di young men tok say, Yes or No
Di pesin wey lead di young men (Olikut) don die
E cold and we no get blanket
Cold dey catch di small pikin dem die
My pipo, some of dem don run go hill, and dey no get food and blanket.
Nobodi know wia dem dey, maybe cold wan catch dem die
I want get time look for my pikin dem and see how many of dem wey I fit find
Maybe I go find dem among pipo wey die
Hear wetin I dey tok, my chiefs!
I don tire
My heart no well, e no hapi join
From wer di sun dey, I no go fight again foreva
I don decide for my mind say I go surrender, follow wetin my enemy tok
I don decide to follow awa dreams dem go di exile wey dem dey
I go join di queue wey dey long reach like one mile for America or Britain or Canada embassy kom fly go
Afte like three weeks afta October 1st 2020 as I dey drive from Dape, one ghetto area for Gwarhinpa, I notice sometin,
Green-White-Green
But for di middle wia di two green meadow wey leave space for di white valley, three word sing melody wey for no mean anytin to me before di world break.
Now who kom put dat thing for they?
I dey so heavy Ladena and to say i go see dis kind for here!
Dis place nah d place wey people wey get plenty face-value dey reason than I despair and dis fact no make me dey balance.
I kon realize wetin dey before me.
I fit fly and run away with oda people sweat.
I fit surrender fighting and my life go kon dey comfortable.
But nah here I dey and I con see say I no fit stand alone.
Shey make I stand alone
I fit fly, live and die.
But na, here before me, on my ancestors land di aspect of not wanting to die.
Here I fit live life wey go full of event and so so enjoyment, of building and breaking to record and d barriers wey pesin neva break anywhere and to dey live to defeat hopelessness.
Where people fit defeat hopelessness expect in d heart of darkness?
Maybe I go die while trying, but how man go die better wen he dey face challenges wey dey fear pesin like d one wey I dey face?
We no need to build skyscrapers, d station for nuclear power or maglev trains, Nah we go build d next best thing. Maybe Conrad fit want a piece of doz things.
He don reach his highest satisfactions but we dey ten percent.
We fit rise and rise sote Lambs go turn to Lions and by dat time d sun go dey shine on my generation, I go kon bikom a fulfilled man
I go endure di whole thing and maybe I fit see something chop from ham.
If no be so, I go still be a fulfilled man even if I dey on my death bed oneday.
Nothing sweet pass d happiness and joy wey person dey feel on deathbed.
Nah him make me bring out new terms of my surrender.
We go dey fight dey go.
Huzaifa na di management consultant wey dey write from Abuja.

dem don add 6 NIPP plant dem, 22 new substation for di power grid wey dey 6 years report.
Generation companies (GenCos) and 22 power substation wey dem build and dey operate between 2015 and now, don make improvement dey for di national eletcricity grid to di 5,800 megourtt wey be di highest peak energy wey dem record for March 2021.
Dis dey according to di latest NIPP report on top power project execution since 2015, wey Daily trust obtained from di Niger Delta power holding company (NDPHC).
Di NIPP na di intervention vehicle warehouse wey di federal, state and local goment own for NDPHC.
For 2015, di power grid don dey between 4,500 megourtts (MW) wey don bikom useful by di commissioning and utilisation of Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunshogo, Alaoji, calabar, Ihovbor NIPP GesCos
Dat one add nearly 1,000MW
Howeva, di grid continue to dey rise wit all-time peak electricity wey don reach 5,801.60MW as of March 2021, according to di statistics wey we get from independent system operation (ISO) arm of di Transmission company of Nigeria. (TCN)
NDPHC don start di NIPP intervention wit di first phase wey dey power generation.
E don begin dey build 10 power GenCos wey dem dey call ' The Big Ten' around gas-producing state dem wey include Ondo, Ogun, and Kogi states.
Howeva, work still dey go on dem till 2015
Dem lunch the second phase for 2015 to include intervention project, wey go focus on transmission, distribution, and energy wey dem don renew towards meeting NDPHC mandate for lighting di nation.
currently, dem bin dey six power GenCos wey dey produce about 3,400MW electricity for di national grid while di four oda GenCos dey ongoing.
Even among di four, some of im turbines don dey commission and dey operational since 2015.
Explanation of di report show say di NIPP intervention for di transmission section wey dey di power sector value di chain, NDPHC don complete 22 substations wey bin dey compromise 10 units of 330/132 kilovolts (KV) level and 12 units of 132/33KV substations.
E don also complete 2,194 kilometres wey dey 330KV power transmission line and 887km wey dey 132KV transmission lines.
Dis infracstructure since 2015, don add 5,590MVA energy supply capacity wey dey 330KV level and 3,793MVA wey dey 132KV level.
To promote energy wey dey clean and improve, di NIPP for di second phase don turn to major driver of di federal goment energy mix by 2030 wey dem dey call vision 30-30-30 wich seek energy wey go improve to at least 30 percent of di energy grid by 2030.
While e don install 20,000 solar home systems for some northen states, di NIPP don dey deliver a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to domot nationwide under di Economic Sustainability plan (ESP).
Dia bin dey intervention for di gas sector wey go solve major challenge of di power plant wich be di availability of gas-to-power.
According to di oga patapata for NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, for interview wey im get with Daily Trust,di company dey achieve dis tru di fuel and gas or public private partnership model.
E don create a department for dis to spearhead im gas pipeline and feed stock wey dey connect all di 10 NIPP GenCon.
wen dem tok power distribution, di report tok say di NIPP intervention bin don see di completion of ovr 360 NIPP injection substations wit a combined capacity wey reach 3,540 MW.
To complement dis substations, NDPHC don build about 2,600KM of 11KV power distribution lines and 4600KM of 33KM distribution lines wey dey supply electricity directly to transformer
Dia bin dey 296 appointed project wey dem don distribute, wich injection substations dey inside, 1924 of 33kv lines, 4600km of 11kv lines wit dem oda infastruction
NDPHC sef don increase im distribution capacity wit di installation of 25,900 completely self-protected (CSP) transformer wey dey across obodo, nah Mr Ugbo add dis one.
On top all dis achivement wey don help to improve di operation of national grid, di report highlight threat to di infastructure especially for di one wey dey di power distribution level.
Some of di wahala wey NDPHC dey see for dis distribution be say dem dey tif dia equipment and infrastructure, vandalism, and lack of cooperation from Distribution companies (DisCos
Di oda nah community wahala wey dey regard land and Right of way ( ROIs), motor accident wey don damage some power infrastructure and rising insecurity wey dey facility areas, e start
for a comment wey go empty di property of di NIPP intervention to Nigerian wey dey comsume electricity, di President for di Nigeria consumer Protection Network ( NCPN), Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo, im tok say di reason for di power sector privatatization exercise wey dem conclude for November 2013 hapen to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by
Im howeva tok say despite dis, di sector neva reach dat kin viability, so di goment need to deepen di interventions tru NIPP.
On top all di tremendous milestone wey NIPP/NDPHC don achieve, dia bin major area of impediment wey dey full realizeation of di lofty idea wey di management of NDPHC championed.
Mr Olubiyo tok say di wahala dem dey face include delay in taking over projects by di DisCos wich dem suppose capture for dia capital Expenditure ( CAPEX)
Im continue im tok say nah di Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) bin di inderance for di delay in di implementaion of di regulations of eligeable consumer
wit di kin huge power assets wey NIPP don provide, di Manufacturers Association of Nigeria ( MAN) and oda dedicated power users fit decide to connect to di NIPP plants and facilities directly and dey enjoy uninterrupted power supply, but dis bin dey delay.
Anoda wahala wey NDPHC dey get nah funding, wich im think say di equity stakeholders suppose raise for more power sector projects.
Di leadearship of di power sector go need to address di low tariff wey dey NIPP plants and di low load (Energy) dispatch wey dey available units from TCN
Consumer dem dey look for more electricity, why energy from NIPP GenCos con dey restricted ?
Nah so Olubiyo ask.
unlike oda places, Ramadan season for Nigeria don unfortunately turn into a season wey dey get unnecessary controversy
Di controvercy don start from di arrival of di Ramadan crescent wey dey usher in di new month and di moon go waka commot to show e end.
di Ramadan peroid dey equally witness controversy ova ideological, jurisprudential or political stances wey some Ulama expressed for di course of dia Quranic trfseer sessions
ova many many years, dia bin don dey unnecessary controversy ova say wich charitable work better pass between make dem dey suponsor broadcast Quranic tafseer abi make dem dey do charitable mass feeding of di needy for Ramadan.
As e dey go for oda Muslim societies, Ramadan dey always inspire a phenomenal risefor individual and for societal spirituality for Nigeria wer plenty wealthy pipo dey sponsorlive or recorded broadcast for Quranic tafseer by different Ulama
Many oda pipo dey spend more on top charitable feeding of di poor.
Howeva, while almost, if no be all, who dey sponsor di broadcast tafseerb dey spend for di charitable feeding too, no be all wey dey spend for charitable feeding dey suponsor di broadcast of tafseer.
Ramadan period for northern Nigeria, television and radio stations dey make profit wit di sale of airtime for tafseer and oda religious lectures wey individual, firms and groups sponsor
from di kin number of sponsor broadcast of tafseer an dem oda religious lecture wey dey for like 10 radio stations for Kano, for example, one fit begin dey wonda weda dem dey do oda programme for Ramadam period.
E good say dem dey sponsor tafseer broadcast, especially for Ramadan, di amount wey dem dey spend for dis regard be like say im dey imbalance if we consider di kin hunger wey dey wire di needy
afta all, if dem get chance to choose, dem go certainly choose food hangout ova dat kin sponsored broadcast, as e don be say public tafseer session dey evriwia for Ramadan wey persin fit choose wich to attend.
Besides, di kin underlying dynamics and politics wey dey for sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, persin no fit rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interest wey be di main motives for di sponsor of tafseer and dem oda religious lectures.
Wetin dey interesting be say, while some sponsor dey compete for who go sponsor di broadcast of tafseer wey some prominent Ulama dey anchor, some of di Ulama dey sponsor dia own broadcast tafseer even if dem no see persin wey wan sponsor; odas even dey beg for sponsor wey go sponsor dia programme.
Also, di content wey some tafseer and oda religious lectures dey feature get some serious flaws, to dey sponsor dis kin broadcast nah big misplacement of priority
anoda thing wey dey interesting be say, some dey sponsor di broadcast of Adhan ( Kiran sallah) for inside city like Kano.
wia, thank you to sheer wey dey increase for Mosques, regular Adhan don dey reach evri corner
Anyway, Ikhlas bin di ogbonge yardstick way dey determine if weda charitable feeding and di sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer broadcast dey worthy or not, striking appropriate balance between di two go give better outkom.
Even though say Ramadan be di month of di Quran wey be say Muslims suppose dey commited in terms of reading, learning wetin im mean and to dey live dia lives accordingly
Di month nah di month of generous charity wey be say Muslims, particularly di ones wey dey wealthy suppose dey do charity work, especially mass feeding.
Howeva, while dat one com be di bottom line, wich explain why di controversy no dey necessary, di Liberal Musilims don over do am
capitalizing on top public frustration wey dey inside di hunger wey dey wire di society, dem dey kwesion weda di sponsoring of di broadcast Ramadan tafseer dey worthy or relevance for under dis kin condition wey we dey find ourselves.
As dem don pretend show empathy and concern, dey tok say di two charity work be di same and make pipo choose between dem.
Under di hard condition wey pipo dey, e no surprise to dey see many pipo, including di ones wey fit discern, fall for di propaganda wey dem no know e context, nah im be di raging face-off wey dey between di Liberal Muslims, for anoda side, dem bin wan undermine Islamic and moral values for di society by force, togada with di
Also, contrary to wetin dem claim, di Liberal Muslims no dey disturb by di kin wahala wey dey for di vulnerable, dis don explain why dem neva urge those wey dey spend huge resources on top oda things, no mater how worthless im be, make dem divert di resources to charitable course.
Dem neva urge dat di kin massive amounts of resources dia elite role spend on top say dey wan maintain dia big lifestyles suppose dey diverted for di feeding of di poor or to take give dem shelter
Instead, dia conscience go kom alive wen resources dey for only, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daourh
Federers conqueror dey amazed by dream day wey dey di office
Afta im don wreck, Roger Federers return to di tennis courts, Pablo Andujar tok say dat na di sweetest moment a lengthy career.
Spaniard beat Federer 6-4,4-6,6-4 on top di Geneva clay for Tuesday to scata di swiss tennis great hopes wey dem wan use run di match togeda ahead different major tournaments wey French open, Wimblendon and di Tokyo olympics.
For match point on Tuesday, Andujar, wey be di world number 75, hold im head for im hand in disbelief afta he don beat di 20-time Grand slam champion.
I no fit believe am, nah wetin di 35-year-old tell ATPTour.com.
Di memories of Nigeria colo wey dey for black and white(iii)
sometimes afta dat, and afta I don get like two popular strip wey dey for di now default news paper wey dem dey call The Democrat, I get my first four letters wey reject me from Mavel Comics, I gada myself remain a young man wey still get hope.
with di kin ups and downs wey dey for Nigeria, im still allow me get dream, to be artist wey dey work for a ogbonge culture company wey for anoda kontiri, anoda continent
Fast-forward to 20002, one day as I dey sit down for di post office wey dey di centre of di city to drop off my latest art sample to Marvel Submission Editor, I no fit get bus
Plenty pipo dey use leg take waka, some gada for group, dem dey worry.
I dey weird out, waka go home, only to hear say raiot don start.
again, many pipo die for di riot, farmilies and friends tear apart as Christian dey beingn move to Kaduna South and Muslims begin move from Kaduna South to di North
My Kaduna, my Nigeria, don dey fall apart.
Di small consolation wey I get be some Christian friend wey stay for certain areas, like me, dem feel safe and no go anywia
So, as di violence dey intense for oda parts, I go dey play soccer for my street, dey exchange VHS tapes and bootlegs VCDs
Di idea to dey hate persin bikos of im religion or ethnic dey incredible for us.
But one teen, wey just move to our domot some years, nah im make me get encounter with intolerance.
if to say we be Muslims, playing soccer, dis new guy call us make we go attack di infidel wey dey live down di road.
we com look each oda jokingly, we dey confuse, afta wich we burst to laughter, we com tell say make im get out.
As if dat one no bad reach, my heartbreak for don worse as I see di apprearance of labels and slur from both of dem.
My perfect Kaduna don dey fall apart, and families and friends don dey part ways, no be say dem no love each oda but bikos say dat na di safest thing to do.
afta di wahala don end, I begin face university with cautious optimism.
literally, many old friend dey there, as Zaria no too far from Kaduna.
Many pipo dey get new friend, some dey till today, some don dey stronger
The best part be say, all dis friend dem weda new or old, no dey base on religion or ethnicity
Some of us wey notice know say, di Kaduna wey we know, love and don lose, neva really destroy.
E no fit go bikos say nah for our heart im reside, so e go hard to kil patapata
Afta all di almost 29 years wey I don spend as a journalist, show me things wey plenty pipo no fit experience for dia life.
I get front row seat to fight for, gbege attack, concerts by superstars dem, movies premieres and all kin generation-defining moments
I also get to dey interview for some big big newsmaker wey dey Nigeria, during moment wey dem get most chutzpah, or nothin at all.
Nah di Nigeria wey no get worrior wey no fit fight for social justice, virtue-signalers, outrage-peddlers, or cancel culture- purveyor.
Nah di Nigeria wey dey flawed, still dey remind me of my old Kaduna, even though di image different to each oda.
But bodi no fit take all of dem for too long.
On top of bed, I con look around my old room again, evrithin just dey as I leave am before im coronavirus lockdown.
I com smile to myself, nah from dat moment I begin to dey decide on di kin steps wey I go take.
I com twist di rubber band round di sack of fotos two times, com put am back for inside longbox.
Maybe one day I go look oda ones, di colour foto, wey carry more recent memories.
Maybe I no go do am.
One thing dey clear say: nah my mother, and father, and di kin relationship wey dem get or wey dem no get wit me, nah im make me di kin child wey I be.
Wetin I be to oda kids wey know me, also di kin man wey I be, to pipo wey know me.

Wey bin farming communities and dem bin farmers, dem fit comot dia farm dis season and dis fit negatively affect food surficiency and economic diversification policy of di Federal Goment, im added.
My visit go Adamour state
Working wit di goment for any level don offer innovators like me di chance to dey bring more beta and transformation wey we ordinarily no fit do for our field
I strongly believe say di goment, as institution, be di greatest vehicle for systemic change and positive transformation wey persin no fit find anywia.
For dat, weneva I kom across opportunities to work wit dem goment bodi, weda local or nah for outside country, I dey always dey hapi bikos say e represent a great opportunity for me learn from and fit contribute to di civil service wey dey fields dat are exciting and dey transformative for pipo beyond wetin my
One of my recent visit of such nature nah to Adamour state, wey dey fascinating for me bikos of im diversity, resilience and outstanding potencial.
I begin dey work actively for Adamour state some years ago, wit di international organisation, OXFAM, on top a project wey dey in line wit European Union's support to food security and resilience for Nothen Nigeria were we deployed a mobile solution to integrating di agricultural value chain.

Im dey, howeva, very very evident dat the Adamour state ministry of Entrepreneurship and development, togeda wit Poverty Alleviation and Wealth Creation Agency (PAWECA), e fit dey adequately utilised for trasforming di local economy, boosting youth entrepreneurship and to dey reduce unemployment drastically for di state.
But as im be for most goment institutions, dis dey require discipline and dedicated effort to fit achieve dem

Im tok on Friday wen im visit di digital pan-African news network, di TOS TV network, wey Ms. Osasu Igbinedion led for inside Abuja.
Di governor wey fault di strategy wey IPOB deployed led by self-exiled Nnamdi Kanu, dem howeva note dat dem no dey treat di Ndigbo fairly inside di kontiri.

As dem bin dey listen to oda reasons why im differ wit IPOB, di governor bin tok, But some of us no agree with im (Nnamdi Kanu) style bikos I no understand wia im dey go, wen im intend to pull di brakes and wen im go stop.
If to say I get a way wey I fit convey my view to di leadership of di group wetin I go tok be say make dem find di way to enter into conversation and let pipo know.
I no understand dia strategy and purpose.
I no understand why dem dey attack institutions of civil rule.
Plenty pipo dem wey dey apologetic to some of dis dem strategies no even know say dem dey ride for tigers tail.
If di police and military withdraw and den brigands becom enforcers of di law and order, if you get quarrel wit your broda, how you wan take resolve am?
While we still dey demand for national apology for di kin treatment dem dey meted to di Igbos during di nation's three-year civil war, Governor Ikpeazu tok say our national orientation suppose dey willing to say sorry.
No persin fit dey 100 percent korekt all in life
Even wen we wey deal wit our pikin dem if we do things wey no dey right, we suppose get di courage to come down to dia level and tell dem sorry but to create a utopian aura dat all dey well is either nothing is wrong

I dey speak like dis bikos say I spend seven years inside di University of Maguduri.
I don waka through all part of northern Nigeria
and I don sabi dis kontiri
I feel bad say wetin dey bring us togeda don dey gradually go oury.
Di NYSC don collapse
We suppose dey tok di truth no matta whose o dem form.
Some of di issues wey Nnamdi raise nah issues of injustice, marginalisation, inequality weda nah gender, generational whateva.
Any particular arm of di society wey dem exclude in any way get di right to feel say dem cheat am or dey unwanted.
so, some of di things Nnamdi tok dey valid.
some of us fit see am.
we no fit dey continue to dey run oury from di facts
Di Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) don accuse di FCT police command of harassment and intimidation.
Di group wey protest ova di continued detention of im leader, Ibraheem El-Zakzaky at Wuse Market, Abuja, yesterday, claim say di police throw teargas and shot at di protesters dem.
A statement wey Abdullahi Musa sign, on behalf of di Academic Forum of di IMN, tok say the police bin dey harass so many innocent pipo dem including passers-by, especially women while dem dey attempt to scatta di protesters.
We kom out as usual on di streets of Abuja dey halla on di Nigerian authorities make dem respect the rule of law and make dem free our leader unconditionally and also to remind di general public dat in 2015 within 48hrs d kil ova 1000 of im followers mercilessly by the officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army as dem don officially launch attack on im inside im own residence, dem kil almost evri soul wey dey inside di house and com set dia corpses ablaze.
Musa don add say dat di protest be don start for around 3:00 for afternoon and dey go serere from Sky Memorial but just dem wan scatta for Wuse Market, di police arrive and start to dey shoot teargas and life ammunition on di peaceful and unarmed protesters.
Di police harass plenty innocent pipo including pipo wey dey pass by wich plenty of dem be women and dem removed dia hijabs, im tok further.
di FCT police command spokespesin, ASP Maryam Yusuf, tok say di group dey disturb public peace wit dia protest.
NAPTIP arraigns, dem reunite five trafficked children wit dia parents.
Di FCT police command spokespesin, ASP Maryam Yusuf, tok say di group dem dey disturb public peace wit dia protest.
NAPTIP, for di press briefing at di weekend, tok say Abdulrahman, a 32-year-old man, him abducted children wey dem dey di age of four to seven and sell dem to some women wey dey different parts of di kontiri wey dey under di guise of say im adoption dem.
Di Director General, Mrs. Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, wen im dey hand ova di children to dia parents im say, di suspect tell di would be parents adoption papers purportedly from di Niger State Goment.
She tok say, dem catch am red handed wen im dey help im clients fill dia adoption application forms.
She warn say make parents dem dey guard dia children dem to avoid kidnapping wey dey apun, trafficking and oda crimes dem wey dey against humanity, she add say make dem no expose dem to pipo wey get criminal intention.
She tok say di pesin wey dey investigate di matta don follow an intelligence report dat Abdulrahman kidnapped children from Niger State and com sell dem into different parts of di kontiri.
Di DG also tok say di intelligence report don reveal that di suspect bin don dey do dat claiming to be a staff of di Ministry of Social Development of Niger State wey dey in charge of adoption dem matta.
She tok say Abdulrahman don confess say im don collect di sum of N100,000 for each of di children.
Di parents dem don laud di federal goment and NAPTIP management for rescuing dia children and don promise to take proper care of dem.
Governors dem wey dem elect on di platform of di pipos Democratic parti (PDP) don warn di Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) make dem no dey witch-hunt im parti officials dem.
Di governors dem don dey respond to di invitation of three officials of di parti by di antigraft agency ova alleged misappropriation of N10 billion, which the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) wey dem don already deny.
di forum, for di statement by im Director-General, Hon CID Maduabum, tok say di invitation of di officials ova a spurious petition by a disgruntled former member of PDP don raise quesion on di seriousness and impartiality of di anti-graft agency to do im work.
Di statement tok: While PDP as a political parti dey accountable to im members dem and di general public for im actions, we dey, howeva, concerned dat di old tactics of using di EFCC to dey silence political opposition don dey entre into our polity again.
we think say di EFCC wey dey di new leadership go learn from di mistake of pipo wey dey before am.
Nah misplaced priority e be for EFCC to dey abandon revelations of big big fraud wey many officials and agencies of di Federal goment dey do to pursue di PDP wey be di main opposition parti doing a yeoman's job to dey prevent di descent into chaos and anarchy for inside Nigeria.
Maybe some interests inside goment dey worried about di increasingly assertive role di PDP dey play in calling out corruption inside goment and wan to weaken and silence am.
Even di message wey dem dey tok about no make any allegation of misuse of goment funds, or cheating of any persin or public authority by di PDP.
E dey surprising dat EFCC wan use im scarce human and oda resources to begin investigation into PDP finances.
If EFCC dey even-handed and dey non-partisan, e suppose conduct investigation into oda political parties including APC, wey be di ruling party.
PDP dey up to date for making financial returns as di required by the Constitution to INEC
We no know say INEC don make complaints to EFCC on PDP's return.
We dey face existential threats as a nation and PDP suppose remain focus on im role as a watchdog on behave of Nigerians.
Di Senator wey dey represent Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, don lament say children be di one wey dem dey suffer most for di kontiri recurring economic and security wahala dem.
For di children's day message, Sani note say children don dey face di deprivation bikos of di insecurity wey dey many kontiri.
some of dem don dey stuck for inside Internally Displaced Persins (IDPs) camps.
dia education don suffer
plenty of dem no get access to healthcare.
Dem no get any recreation for dem
Dem dey abuse some of di girls.
Dem dey live inside di fear of di unknown.
Make we dey reflect on top our children loss of dia innocence and our duties dem and obligation wey we don lose as leaders and pipo.
plenty of dem die bikos say dem no get health care
Di economic impact of COVID-19 on dia parent dey affect di children in a nagative way.
Di quality of food wey dem dey chop don reduce to and some of dem no fit go school again, nah wetin im tok be dat.
Di lawmaker don call for effective implementation of policies and programmes wey go aim at providing betta education and betta health care for di children
Di investment wey put for our children nah di investment wey we put for di future of our kontiri.
Im add say, make we no fail for dis regards.
Wetin dey fuel insurgency?
Wen a group of pipo wey no dey informed get an idealogy wey dey fit die for, dem go do di illogical for am.
Di kind intercourse wey dey between ideology and ignorance no dey follow logic.
Dem consider murder as di sin wey dealy pass for Igbo land.
In fact, for di old days if dem committe murder, di community go proceed on many days of cleansing of di land and atonement for di crime.
Wetin change now?
plenty pipo don assume dat di Igbo are natively no dey violence and dat dey cannot in any circumstances dey take innocent lives violently.
Di Igbo pipo dey very peaceful, but wetin dey apun recently inside South-east don make us to dey doubt di assumption
All di regions inside di kontiri don dey marginalise as regards say di equitable distribution of resources to di pipo.
To dey clear, nah evri region don dey marginalise
Di statement wey dey more factual go be all Nigerians wey dey di bottom rung of di social ladder dey marginalise.
Nah Nigerians be victims of di carnivory of di elite.
E no mata say dem com from di North or di south.
Nah all of us be victims of elite conspiracy e no mata wia we kom from.
E dey so agonising say di scion of di south-east don dey turn dia region into Aleppo inside Syria.
Nah who bring war and violence into im own home?
As of 2019, di south-east dey reputed say e dey very safe pass any oda region for inside Nigeria.
E dey very buoyant and dey well fared on top di development inside index.
All of dat don dey tremble down.
Di kilin of police officers some of dem Igbo di targeting of northern residents; di destruction of property and arsoning of police stations dem be di tragedies wey no suppose apun.
Dem dey fed di cancer and dem allow am spread throughout di bodi.
Di Igbo dem nourish dis beast wey dey gnawing at dia groin.
Wen dem start di serial murder of police officers, some clap for di effort of dia kilers on di inscrutable assumption say di police dey inside cahoots wit criminals to destroy Igbo land.
Now, di destruction of di region no dey for di hands of some herdsmen or bandits, but for di might of di sons of di land.
How you wan take define irony?
Dem dey threaten di Igbo pipo wey get different opinions to di group sentiments wit violence.
Dem no know di Igbo to get strong head or conscripted into tyranny of opinions and actions
Dem know Igbo to be republican; dem dey open to robust arguments and dem dey subject evri thought to scrutiny.
Wetin com change?
He be like say di kilin of police officers inside di south-east bin don dey unmitigated and security agencies don appear to don leave di pipo to dia own fate.
Armed robber dem don return at scale.
Nah dis be pipo lamentation evriwia.
A lady wey share her experience of how a mechanic wey she pay upfront to fix her car inside Anambra runaway wit di moni and automobile, and even threatened her while im dey brag, police no dey inside di south-east again.
Jaguda don take control of interest areas inside di region.
Fear and wahala dey evriwia.
Life don bikom nasty, brutish and short inside a region wey dey peaceful before.
As a mata of fact, we dey on a familiar path albeit dey dangerous
Di signs dey very tragic
Pikin wey dem born for Nigeria in 2000 fit tell how Boko Haram take start inside North-east.
Di militant groups dey ourys target di security agents and formations eviritime.
Wen dey take dem out, di pipo no go fit defence demselves and di armed gangs go start a new order of violence.
Dem don kill securities and dem destroy security facilities in di South-east now
Afta di security scaffold don dey decimated, innocent pipo wey dey live di area and even those wey dey satisfied ova di revelry of blood fit bikom di next victims.
Dem be displaced persins wey dey live inside IDP camps for inside part of Eboyi state displace, dis apun as a result of interncine clashes among communities.
Wit di kin prevailing savagery wey di secessionist group, there go be more refugee problem inside south-east if dem continue wit di attack.
wia dey wan put pipo wey be say wetin dem dey do nah buying and selling?
we no fit end dis barbarity if we no agree
If some pipo choose to keep native sympathies for pipo wey dey take innocent lives, how go fit stop di bloodletting stop?
E dey for our hand.
Marwa don meet wit IGP, tok say Buhari don demand mopping up of dugs wey no dey legal.
President Muhammadu Buhari dan order di National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) make dem mop up all drugs wey no dey legal and substances inside di kontiri make Nigeria bikom a drug-safe haven.
Mohammed Buba Marwa (Retd) tok for Wednesday inside Abuja wen im host di acting Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman.

Na seven things go make or destroy Nigeria for 2023.
Buffeted by deep – seated existence challenge wey di leaders no fit tackle, many people don belief say di future survival of Nigeria no dey sure.
Di sign don dey certain and clear for di aspect of life; Many people wey dey under di country don dey under di control of non – state actors , shrinking economy wey result to rising of inflation and poverty and social sector wey don fall yakata.
But di one wey dangerous pass na di lack of trust wey dey among our leaders, pipo and all di ethnic groups and di social class of pipo wey make up di kontri.
Di fact say currently Nigeria don dey go toward a delicate moment of hin existence as a kontri wey no fit bi denied.
To dey sure, no kontri wey dem no face challenges from di start.
But di different wey dey between success and failure na di leaders wey no sabi manage di challenges and di way dem dey cope wit issues of di nation.
As he dey go, as we dey look di soso deteriorate wahala including di mata of our life all failure of our leaders of all levels of situations make dem take better hand hold di mata wey dey face the kontri make he better.
Soso many Nigerians dey doubt say di future of di kontri fit no bitter again.
Di thought of di people bi say di election wey go take place for 2023 go get plenty palava pass the ones wey we don get before.
Dey notice say di problem wey we see na him dey get solution, I don gather seven problems wey dey cause wahala wey need quick attention to solve and failing to solve doz problem fit make di kontri fall apart.
Di Fulani problem na him bi di number one koko wey of di matter wey dey cause kasala wey we gat take eye look into.
Di soso fight we don dey hear about di Fulani herders and di farmers in kontri dey cause contradictory and hatred between normal pipo and di aimless families of di Fulani’s.
We gat put mouth for di position wey Fulani hold in di histrorical, political and social evolution of Nigeria.
We fit describe Nigeria as country of joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheilk Usman dan Foldio and Sir Frederick Lugard wey bi di architect of amalgamation and di first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria
Sheilk dan Fodio
na di first person wey establish Fulani dominance for an area wey get di size of two – third of di Northern Nigeria for di Fulani’s wey lead di Jihad of 1804
Na for di political and social structure of dis dan Fodio creation wey di Britons build dia colonial enterprise for Nigeria, a legacy wey subsists to a large extent to dis day.
As a group, di Fulani wey bi single most powerful and influential factors for Nigeria politics.
Na dem dey control one half of di traditional/spiritual realm through di Islamic religion as well as di temporal turf of Nigeria politics and governance.
Di Fulani don arrange dis special advantage in di struggle for di control of di soul of Nigeria politics opens dem to accusation wit some reason wey dey one use to control forever for political power in di kontri to comot and damage other ethnic groups
Dem don point am out, wit som justification too, say sake of say dis kontrol and dominance work to dia advantage, Fulani political aristocracy dey always work against di attempt of oda ethnic group for di enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.
Even say dis accusation against Fulani don dey for years now, no time wey e dey more pronounced pass dis present time unda di administration of President Muhammadu Buhari wey be Fulani man.
Even say som go troway dis as part of di stuff of politiks for Nigeria, di claim say Fulani dey kontrol and retain large amount of political power in a way wey e affect and komot odas, no dey totally wrong. No be lie say di Fulani political aristocracy don find way to prolong dis kontrolthroughmago-mago agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment for di strategic areas of di kontri polity and economy.
Dis fulanisation agenda, as we expect, don turn oda ethnic group includin Hausa wey be di closest, against di Fulani, especially as dem don point am say na Fulani bin dey responsible for di banditry, kidnappin and oda violent crimes for North-West of di kontri.
In di current situation wey Nigeria dey, e no dey feasible again for Fulani to kontinue dey exercise di skewered and large kontrol of political power.
Dis no go only create a dangerous imbalance in di polity; e go also bring up a feelin, and tendency by di ethnic groups wey dem komot for politiks, to find ways wey dem go take disrupt di polity as we dey get am now.
For Nigeria to kommot for di dangerous situation of doubt wey dey build up currently, we must to address di issue of a bias political and economic kontrol of Nigeria, wey di powerful and influential ethnic groups dey show, to di exclusion of odas.
Anoda mata wey hang around Nigerian politiks and governance like burden wey dey pesin neck, get to do wit awa dangerous attachment to ethnic and religious ways, and awa effort to interpret evritin for awa kontri along dose lines.
We no be Nigerians for di true sense of di word.
Awa sense of togedaness as Nigerians to a large extent dey defined only by di land wey join all of us togeda rada dan by di value and identity wey we share togeda.
Na base on my-pipo, una-pipo and my-religion una-religion level we take dey relate wit eachoda, rada dan as Nigerians wey we all be.
Di proclivity to play di ethnic and religious card don becom so pervasively sef-perpetuatin to di extent say wia e no even dey necessari, we go try to invoke am jus to assure awaself say dis na di normal tin to do.
If my-pipo, una-pipo card no wok, we go use my-religion, una-religion card, and for wia dat wan no work, we go use di my-pipo una-pipo own.
We don too biliv dis factors as yardstick for almost evritin wey we do, sotey like addict wey dey deceive e sef on di happiness of takin substance, we just fit no gada di courage to kick di habit. Even say we sabi how harmful e be to awa bodi politic.

Reason why Zuba fruit market need kia-kia intervention.
For traders and farmers wey dey sell fruit and vegetables in di kontri, di Zuba international market, as dem dey call am, na major selling place.
No be only di Federal Capital Territory (FCT) dis market dey serve but all di states wey dey around too.
No be lie say di market na wia thouands of pipo dey see moni, most of dis pipo be women and small pikin wey dey buy and sell fresh produce inside and around Abuja wey be di nation capital.
Na plenti tonnes of fruits like orange, pawpaw, banana, plantain, pineapple, coconut, watermelon, vegetable and odas, dey enta di market evriday.
Awa tori-pesin wey go di market on Tuesday see say buying and selling plenti for imported apple and coconut business, and di market na major wholesale ground for people wey wan re-sell.
Na dis market over 70 percent of di fruits wey dem dey chop inside di FCT and states wey dey around dey from kom. Pipo gada as earli as 5am evriday to do business.
Plenti tonnes of plantain na im dem display to sell in di market on Tuesday.
Even say dis market get big potentials to strengthen di agric business locally and internationally, e get plenti challenges wey don dey for many years.
Di market still dey very rough, and na dirty ground dem dey put all di fruits. Dis dey make pipo worri on di health implication, especially as di kontri dey follow di rest of di world fight COVID-19 disease.
Also, na di same place dem dey pack fresh fruits and rotten ones put, and even di ones wey be wastage wey don get germs and diseases.
Plenti pipo also dey open to germs wey dey cause diseases becos of di dust from many legs wey dey walk for di dirty environment.
Again, di lack of necessary tins like cold room, gud road, water, standard shops, clean ground wey dem go dey put di fruits, and odas dey increase pipo concern on how safe di fruits dey, and e dey put evribodi wey dey chop fruits for Abuja and nearby at high risk.
But even as dis challenges dey so, activities for di market dey put moni for many pipo pocket, and e dey generate revenue for di government too.
Awa tori-pesin follow som farmers and dealers who don dey do business for di area for plenti years tok.
Tarsoo Alex, who get orange farm for Vandikya, Benue State, tok say e supply more dan 60 bag of orange to di market on Tuesday.
But na about five bag e loose becos of too much heat, wey di plenti sun cause.
E dey fear say if buyers no kom early, e fit loose more.
As e tok, 1 bag of orange na between N6,000 and N7,500, but im profit don too reduce becos of transportation wey cost from im farm for Benue to Zuba.
To stop di issue of wastage, e tok say plenti of di farmers don dey use jute bags, wey go allow air enter, instead of nylon bag wey go cause plenti heat for di fruits.
Unlike orange, plantain dey evriwia now becos na di season be dis, one young man wey go like make dem call am just Pastor na im tell awa tori-pesin dis.
E tok say befor aftanoon, dem go don buy all di plantain finish.
E dey help farmers sell dia market.
Na for dozen (12 bunch) dem dey sell am, and na between N5,000 and N8,000, as each one big reach.
Na grade by grade dem dey select Watermelons, from grade 1, 2 and 3, and na 50 pieces dey for each dozen.
Dia price also depend on d grade, u fit get di smallest one for N9,000.
Regular customer fit get am for lower price.
Na di same way dem dey sell pawpaw and pineapple, but na for bag dem dey sell coconut, while na for carton dem dey sell apple, but na grade dem dey grade am too.
On one Sunday for 2018, Daily Trust discover plenti place wia dem dey use carbide to make fruit ripe for di market. Plenti health expert don yarn say dis fit cause cancer.

IAR don dey do research on Tela maize as a way to tackle pests and drought
For 2019, Nigeria join six oda African kontri Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa and Ethiopia to enta a Tela maize project.
Di Tela maize project na public-private partnership wey go develop and commercialise di transgenic insect-protected and drought-tolerant variety of maize to increase di productivity of farmers.
Tela maize na double-dose (moderate drought and insect resistance) maize variety wey dem design to help farmers get beta yield.
For di Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR), Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, a join-bodi of scientists dey work on di maize variety to ensure say by 2022, farmers all ova di kontri go fit get am afta e don follow all di necessari regulation.
Professor Mohammed Faguji wey be seed breeder and di executive director of di IAR, tok say na two bad condition global warming bring (drought and flooding), plus pest wey make farming difficult for many small-scale farmers.
He tok say na dose problem di Tela maize go solve.
Daily Trust visit di farm on Sunday wia dem dey do different confined field trials to evaluate di efficacy and efficiency of di drought and pest-resistant quality befor dem collect di approval of di necessari authorities to release am to di environmental and afta, begin dey sell am for 2022.
Professor Rabiu Adamu na di principal investigator (lead researcher) of di genetically modified Tela maize project.
E tell Daily Trust on Sunday for di experiment farm wey dey Zaria say di research get two strong pupose: to produce transgenic hybrid variety of maize for di first time in Nigeria,
wey dey resistant to most maize pest, especially di major ones, stem borers and di fall army worms, and to produce maize hybrid
wey also dey tolerant to drought.
Dis hybrids dey genetically modified, and na biotechnology dem use make dem resistant.
Dem get gene from bacteria we dey live for soil wey dem put inside di maize gene, and e include resistance to insect pests, especially dose ones wey dey spoil maize, di fall army worm and di complex of stem borers, wey be three: di pink stem borer and di oda specie, di maize stalk-borer -Busseolafusca and Sesamiacalamistis.
Dis na di two main stem borers of maize for dis part of di kontri.
Dis hybrid wey we dey test dey genetically modified to resist damage by insect pests, especially stem borers and fall army worms as u don see for di farm, e explain.
E tok say di current crop wey dey di farm na di third Confined Field Trials (CFT).
No be only hia we dey hope to realise dis hybrid, but for Nigerian farm, for oda research institute and some out station to test dem to confam and validate di implication of di gene.
E kontinue say, afta, we go write memo to di regulator say make e allow us conduct more trails outside di conferment, for oda pipo farm and oda research institute.
On wen di farmers go fit get di seeds, e tok say afta one year wey di result don ready, dem go submit di report to di National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) for permission to take am to di farmers to do national multiplication trail.
Out of di 16 entry, dem go evaluate and submit di report of di best hybrid wey di famers select to di National Varietal Release Committee for Ibadan.
E tok say once dem accept say di varieties don meet di minimum requirement for dem to release dem as hybrid, dem go fit release am to di farmers.
If possible, di scientists dey reason December 2022 for di release so dat in about three years, farmers for evriwia go get access to di seed.
Dr Muhyideen Oyekunle, di leader, Trial and Pipeline Testing, wey carry awa tori-pesin waka explain di biotic and abiotic attribute of di ongoing progress of di Tela maize research wey dem plant for three plots to evaluate di efficacy of di resistance to drought, fall army worm and stem borers.
For di farm, plenty difference dey, di one wey no be GM maize, get infected wit pests, di fall army worm, stem borers, almost finish am completely, but notin touch di GM variety, even say dem plant di two (Tela Maize and di traditional seed wey no get biotech protection) side-by-side.
Di ongoing field result wey awa tori-pesin see show say great prospect dey, even say dem go still need see and evaluate di yield.
Until then, solution to pests and drought problems dey road.
Som of di varieties na yellow but most of dem be white. For di trial, more dan 90 percent na white maize becos na im industry players prefer.
But di scientists major problem na COVID-19 pandemic and di issue of misperception and misinformation about di technology.
Pipo wey no sabi how di technology dey work like to dey use social media and oda non-scientific way to confuse and mislead di public and oda scientists. Di lead researcher, Professor Adamu na im tok so.

Poultry feed crisis: Why we need more intervention.
Di crisis wey dey di poultry feed industry pass be careful late last year wen many poultry farmers begin dey close down dia farms, sake of say price of feed don high, and dis don make dia cost of operation too much.
Di leadership of di Poultry Association of Nigeria, di association wey all di poultry farmers for di kontri dey under, do emergency meeting for Abuja, to warn say if dem no do sometin kia-kia, di poultry industry fit die.
Di director-general of di association, Onallo S. Akpa, wen e dey call for immediate intervention by di federal government, tok say maize wey be N80,000 per ton and soybeans wey be N120,000 per ton for January 2020, don be N200,000 per ton (maize) and N250,000 per ton
(soybeans) for January 2021.
Clearly, as a way to prevent crisis for di feed distribution industry, di Central Bank of Nigeria put bodi quickly, as dem don agree to release about 300,000 metric ton of maize to di industry batch by batch.
Dis intervention, wey di stakeholders believe say e dey on time, be like say e don reduce di earlier tension wey dey di sector.
Di target, accordin to di bank, na to ensure say di poultry industry dey sustainable, job retention dey, circular flow of income kontinue, cheaper nutrition dey possible and poverty reduce.
Last month, about 50,000MT na im dem give stakeholders for di feed milling industry, and dem go release di remaining small time.
Stakeholders believe say quick release of di remaining tonnes go solve more of di feed challenges wey dey di sector befor di Easter celebration wey dey come.
Di current intervention na join-bodi between di CBN and partners like AFEX Commodities Exchange Ltd, wey dey kontrol di release of di grains.
Di reduction for maize production don be one of di major challenges for agricultural sector, becos as di PAN DG tok, dis na di food wey dem dey chop pass for northern Nigeria.
Dis na di reason why many feed producers wit oda stakeholders dey ask for more support from di CBN in di area of maize and soybeans production.
Di General Manager of Premier Feeds Ltd, Austin Daylop, wey be one of di beneficiary of di intervention, tok say as di new farming season for maize and soybean dey kom, we go need take quick action to meet di demand of di growing population, and also ensure say e no scarce for Nigeria.
Di Anchor Borrowers Programme wey CBN join bodi with di Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) do na one of dat solution.
We go need establish dat kind programme for maize and soybean production too.
E go surely help us reduce rural-urban migration of di farmers wey insecurity cause, especially for di Northern states wia dem dey plant maize and soybeans.
If we kontinue di join-bodi between di concerned government authorities and industry stakeholders like di Maize Growers Association of Nigeria (MAGPAMAN) and Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN) we go fit provide important field data, so dat policymakers go fit undastand di input wey dem need to expand di product capacity of local farmers.
Ayodeji Balogun wey be di CEO of AFEX, tok say: Wit di release of 300,000MT of maize,throughdi support from credible players for di ecosystem, plus awa team for AFEX, di CBN go fit give ova 35,000 farmers and agro processors a channel wey dem go fit dey buy and sell maize for subsidized rate, and laidat, dem go fit increase local demand, improve di way of life of di farmers and reduce di negative effect of di increase for maize price.

Di sides go meet again in three days time for Stamford Bridge to decide who go secure di top-four finish for di Premier League.
Chelsea go need a quick comeback afta dem lose for di fourth time in 27 games since Thomas Tuchel replace Frank Lampard wey dem sack for January.
Di Blues also get Champions League final wey dem dey prepare for against Manchester City in two weeks time, but dem fit end di campaign witout trophy or place for Europe premier club competition next season.
Chelsea success under Tuchel don kom, sake of dia beta defensive record, but dia struggle for di oda end don show again.
Tuchel men dominate befor first-half but dem struggle to create straightforward chances even afta Leicester defensive lynchpin Jonny Evans carry injury for di middle of di first half.
Wayward Werner Timo Werner
wayward finishing has characterised his first season in England since joining from RB Leipzig for Â£47 million ($66 million) and the German international had another day to forget in front of goal.
Tuchel turned away in disgust after Werner blazed high and wide from the edge of the box with the Leicester defence stretched midway through the first half.
Werner then came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time as his header drifted just wide and evaded Cesar Azpilicueta as the Chelsea captain launched himself in at the far post.
The welcome return of noise echoing down from 6,000 fans of each side from both ends of the ground helped mask a general lack of quality on the field.
Another 10,000 local supporters, key workers and Football Association stakeholders were also in attendance as Wembley gears up for hosting matches at Euro 2020 next month at 25 percent capacity.
One moment of magic proved decisive as Tielemans collected possession midway inside the Chelsea half and strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable strike into the top corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Tuchel flexed the strength in depth of his squad in an attempt to find an equaliser as Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz, Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic were all introduced off the bench.
But they were denied by the brilliance of Schmeichel in the Leicester goal.
Chilwell, whose every touch was booed by the Leicester supporters, nearly came back to haunt his old club as his header was turned onto the post by the Dane.
Mount then could not believe his luck as his sweetly struck shot was turned behind by a brilliant stop from Schmeichel.
Even when the Leicester keeper was beaten, Chelsea were denied by a VAR review.
A Wes Morgan own goal looked set to send the game to extra-time, but Chilwell had strayed offside in the build-up.
Leicester players and fans celebrate di decision like a goal and were in raptures again moments later after seeing out a nervy finale.
Tinubu, govs, oda S/West leaders reject secession
Inside di agitation for Oduduwa Republic for South-West, leaders of di All Progressives Congress (APC) for di geo-political zone meet for Lagos on Sunday, and dem show dia strong opposition to di agitation.
Di meetin wey hold for Lagos House, Marina, na base on di call of di former interim National Chairman of di APC, Chief Bisi Akande.
Dose wey dey di meetin na national leader of di APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun and Chief Bisi Akande.
Odas wey follow dey di meetin na General Alani Akinrinade (rtd), former governor of Ogun State, Prince Segun Osoba, Minista of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Chief Pius Akinyelure wit odas.
Daily Trust hear say di meetin na in response to di raging agitation for Yoruba nation by some pipo for di region, wit different rally wey dem don hold for South-West states to agitate for Oduduwa Republic.
Inside one statement wey Chief Akande read, di South West leaders tell security agencies and di federal government say make dem reduce tension for di kontri afta di worsenin security challenges wey dey torment di nation.
Na part of wetin dey di statement be dis; We note wit significant concern di security situation for di kontri.
Terrorism and violent criminality dey threaten many areas, badly affecting di live and livelihood of plenti innocent and peace-loving Nigerians.
We encourage di federal government to kontinue to make di necessary expenditure and allocate sufficient resources wey go enable di military and security agencies tackle di hard security challenges wey dey face us.
For Nigeria to overcome dis challenges, we need do so wit unity of purpose and action.
Di desire for peace and di chance for a prosperous and just society dey universal and e pass all form of regional, religious or ethnic division.
Sadly, many public figure don tok tins wey fit cause division and destroy di unity of purpose wey we need.
We dey restate awa extreme dislike of violence as a means to achieve either politikal or economic power and influence.
We strongly condemn any form of violence for any part of di kontri, regardless of where di victims or pipo wey cause di violence kom from.
Government need do evritin wey e fit do to protect potential victims and to help dose wey don be victims of terrorism or widespread banditry befor.
We support wetin di Southern Governors tok about ranching for dia May 11, 2021 summit wey happun for Asaba, Delta State.
We support becos dat kind decision go fit reduce di tension between farmers and herdsmen, and e go also help di long-term economic development of di farming and herding communities togeda.
2023: INEC don verify voting points for conversion to polling units
Di Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday begin a nationwide verification exercise of di voting points (VPs) wey dem propose say dem wan convert to pollin units (PUs) tru-out di kontri.
INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu na im tok am on Tuesday for Abuja, wen e visit som of di centres wey dem wan use and som current PUs for di FCT and Nasarawa State.
Prof. Yakubu, wen e dey follow tori-men yarn for di commission Local Government office wey dey Karu, Nasarawa State, tok say di purpose of di verification na to make sure say dem do di right tin befor dem convert di VPs to PUs.

Meanwhile, di commission tok am yesterday say dem don upgrade 956 voting points to polling units for Sokoto State.
A guide to soya bean farming as planting go begin by June
Soya na plant wey dem dey grow, mostly becos of e beans wey dem fit use do different tins.
Na legume wey get high nutritious value.
Awa agric editor wey don dey monitor di soya bean value-chain tok say, even say dem know Nigeria as di largest producer of soya for Afrika, di production level still neva reach im full capacity.
Dis na becos most of dose wey dey plant soya bean for di kontri be small farmers. Dem no dey plant am as di main crop, but dem dey use am support oda major crops like corn, cowpea (beans) and cassava.
Som soya bean farmers wey follow Daily Trust yarn believe say wit small agricultural tools and effort, we fit grow di crop for many states for Nigeria.
Di reason why more farmers suppose enta soya bean farming
Mallam Yinusa Jimoh, wey be Ilorin-based retired agric extension officer, tell Daily Trust for fone say apart from di domestic and economical values wey soya bean get, e dey also improve soil fertility and dem fit use am kontrol striga.
E tok say di market for soya bean dey grow fast for Nigeria, and opportunity dey for farmers to improve dia income.
One handbook wey di International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) produce on soya bean show say di fast growth for poultry sector during di past five years don also increase di demand for soya bean meal for Nigeria.
The IITA handbook reads in part: It is also a prime source of vegetable oil in the international market.
Soya bean get average protein content of 40 percent and e get more protein pass any of di common vegetable or animal food source wey dey for Nigeria.
Accordin to IITA, SALMA Oil Mills for Kano, Grand Cereals for Jos, ECWA Feeds for Jos, AFCOT Oil Seed Processors for Adamawa and PS Mandrides wey dey Kano dey all process soya bean.
Wetin dis one mean be say ready market dey for farmers wey get interest for soya farming for di kontri.
Right now, for di local market, one de-rica of soya bean na N600; dependin on di area, while dem dey sell 50kg bag for around N17,000.
Di global demand for di crop na about 11 million tonnes, while di yearly amount of soya bean wey dem dey chop for Afrika na about 619 thousand tonnes.
Di best way wey we fit take use farm soya bean
Accordin to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, soya bean planting dey always start for June, and e dey grow well on all type of soil, except deep soil wey no fit hold water.
Dr Joseph yarn farmers say one important tin to consider wen pesin wan start soya bean farming for Nigeria na rainfall.
E tok say Nigeria get very gud climate wey dey perfect for soya bean to flourish.
As Awoniyi tok, gud harvest depend mostly on regular irrigation, becosthroughirrigation, di crop fit grow for areas wey no get plenti rainfall.
Accordin to IITA, make dem no plant soya bean for sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to prevent drought stress, dem advise say make dem no plant am for soil wey get plenty water or soil wit surfaces wey fit break, cos dis no go make di seed komot well.
Clear all di plants wey dey, befor u prepare di land.
U fit prepare di seedbed manually wit a hoe or animal-drawn equipment or tractor, IITA advise.
Land wey dem prepare well dey allow di seed germinate well, and e dey reduce weed infestation.
IITA add am join say; U fit plant on ridges or on flat seedbed.
Experts don warn say to choose di type of soya bean wey u go plant, u need look at di period wey e dey take mature, di yield potential, lodging, and how well e fit tolerate drought and resist pest and disease.
John Stephen, wey be soya bean farmer for Garam, one community for Niger State, close to di FCT, insist say na di maturity period u need to consida first wen u wan choose di type of soya bean wey fit ur location.
Stephen advise say, for areas wey get low rainfall, make u consida di seed wey dey mature early rada dan di one wey dey mature late.
Although seed wey dey mature late dey always get beta yield, but e dey risky to plant late maturing seed for dry environments becos of late season drought.
IITA advise farmers say make di type of seed wey dem go choose be of high quality becos soya bean seeds dey quick lose dia viability.
According to di institute, e dey common for soya bean not to grow afta 12 to 15 monts wey e don dey for storage, even wen dem keep am well.
So, make u use seed wey never pass 12 monts so e go fit germinate well.
Select di gud seed komot for planting so u go fit make sure say dem no get insect, disease, or weed seeds.
Make u no buy seed from open market, cos di ability for di seed to germinate no guarantee.
Planting seed wey get poor quality no go produce beta yield.
Di institute advise for di handbook.
Conducting germination test
If e dey possible, IITA recommend say make u test di seed befor planting.
Di institute recommend say make di germination rate be 85 percent or more to get gud stand.
Accordin to IITA, to conduct a quick seed germination test, make u select 400 seeds randomly, den plant 100 seeds each for four woodin or plastik boxes or seedbed wey u don prepare.
Plant one seed per hole wit a distance of 10cm between di seeds.
Soak di woodin or plastik boxes or di seedbed well wit water befor planting and make u dey put water evri mornin and evenin.
Begin dey count di seedlings five days afta planting and complete di counting within 10 days.
If u fit count a total of 320 seeds wey germinate, e mean say di germination rate of di seed na 80 percent and above.
Wen di percentage of germination na 80 percent or less, u go need increase di seed rate to achieve 100 percent.
Fertiliser application
IITA advise say to recommend beta fertiliser for soya bean production, pesin go need to do a gud soil test.
For normal kondition, soya bean as legume wey e be suppose provide esef wit nitrogenthroughbiological nitrogen fixation.
Until nodulation don happun, di soya bean plant go dey depend on di soil nitrogen to grow.
Phosphorus na im di plant dey lack pass, derefor, make u put di best phosphorous fertiliser so e go fit grow well.
Di institute still advise farmers say make dem put di fertiliser inside di soil wen dem dey harrow and level di farm.
Pests, diseases and weeds
Na problem Perennial and most annual weeds be to soya bean wen e jus dey grow
Gud weed kontrol programme for di proper time fit reduce di effect of weed.
Weed kontrol for soya bean fit be manual or chemical, or both.
Manual weed kontrol
: Make u do di first weedin two weeks afta plantin and di second one, five to six weeks afta plantin.
Make u no weed di farm immediately rain fall, becos dis go make di weed grow for anoda place.
bad weedin or delay fit make di yield reduce badly.
Chemical weed kontrol:
Herbicides na safe and effective way to kontrol weed for soya bean farming, if we use am wella.
Di kind herbicide wey u go use kom depend on di kind weed wey dey dere and if di herbicide dey available.
Herbicides dey available for pre-emergence or post-emergence weed kontrol for soya bean.
If u use herbicide durin plantin, u go need weed di farm five to six weeks afta plantin.
Na different insects dey affect soya bean farm, but na only few of dis insects no get any economic importance, and dose ones wey fit damage crops no dey plenty reach di amount wey go need kontrol measures.
Durin di vegetative stage, di crop dey immune to caterpillars but e dey very weak to silverleaf whitefly attack.
Harvest
Soya bean dey ready to harvest for shelling and fresh use from 65 days afta planting.
Howeva, dry soya beans need 100 or more days befor u fit harvest am.
Soya bean farmers don advise say for beans wey get green shell, u fit harvest am wen di pods dey green, full and plump.

na only ur ability go give u di chance no matta wat, becos we no sabi corruption, e tok.
How to use SEEDCODEX to check fake seeds
If u dey plan to buy correct seed, make u find di ones wey get SEEDCODEX tag by di National Agricultural Seed Council (NASC).
Di SEEDCODEX tag na electronic seed verification and authentication system wey dey attached to every seed pack.
Farmers go fit scratch am and send di code to one numba for verification.
Di Director General of di council, Dr Phillips Ojo, tok dis for Abuja wen e dey follow tori-pipo yarn about di readiness of di agency to provide quality and certified seeds for di 2020/2021 plantin season.
Awa call to farmers na say only di seeds wey get di NASC SEEDCODEX tag fall for dis category and na im make dem buy from dia seed suppliers.
Di SEEDCODEX tag, as u know, na di result of di NASC electronic seed verification and authentication system wey go enhance di efficiency of awa seed certification and quality assurance program wey we establish to prevent seed adulteration by greedy seed merchants.
Farmers suppose know say all di certified seeds packs for Nigeria must get dis authentication tags wit di code on dem, so farmers go fit send di code to immediately verify if di seed wey dem buy na original and dem go fit report any mago-mago seed dealer for di national seed business to NASC, Dr Ojo yarn.

She tok say na honour e be for her to serve di Trump administration.
Grisham no give any reason for her decision.
We still neva know weda her resignation na becos of di attack on di Capitol by pipo wey dey support outgoing president Donald Trump.
Traffickers hide drugs for inside statue of Blessed Virgin Mary
Drug traffickers wey dey find easy way to smuggle illegal drugs don follow di religious route as dem load di statue of di Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus wit drugs.
NDLEA operatives wey dem plant for two courier companies seize di drugs wey dem hide inside di statue, and som odas for inside motor spare parts wey dem wan ship go Canada and UAE.

Pastor Adefarasin; if Nigeria na scam; den all of us na scammers
Na di compulsory duty of everi citizen to hold di government to account.
In fact, citizenship na call to duty for di state.
And no compulsory duty wey pass make citizens dey scrutinize and monitor dia employees “ di government“ frequently.
Criticising di government na part of di rights of everi citizen, and active citizenship get to do wit takin di governmentthroughe pace.
No government wey dem no dey criticise, and no government too special for pipo to criticise.
But, we need differentiate between any government and Nigeria as a kontri.
Government go kom and go, but Nigeria go remain.
We need understand say Nigeria na di pipo wey dey inside.
So, wen we belittle di kontri, we just dey shoot awasef for leg.
If we tok say Nigeria na scam, indirectly wetin we mean be say, Nigerians be scammers.
Nigeria no be scam, like som of dose wey dey abuse di nation dey always tok, unknowingly; Na we turn Nigeria to anytin wey e be.
Nigeria no be just a place somwia.
Nigeria na di pipo.
Di gud, di bad and di ugly “ na we make am be laidat.
Anytin wey dey affect di kontri, na we be di agent wey cause am.
If Nigeria na scam as Pastor Paul Adefarasin tok, den we all be scammers.
Even say I agree, say Adefarasin anger na becos of di love wey e get for di kontri, im comment say Nigeria na scam and fraud no dey reasonable.
If Nigeria na fraud; den all of us be fraudster, leaders and followers join.
All of us don contribute to di dissapointment of di entity.
We dey live for a kontri wia pastors dey run dia ministry like business.
Dem dey run am like business enterprise but dem no dey pay tax for dere.
CAMA; Government introduce a law wey go regulate di business undertaking of di religious industry and wey go bring som transparency and accountability inside di spiritual business.
But na pastors dey against dis law pass.
Still, na dis same pipo wey no wan follow di law be di loudest voice wen dem dey pass capital sentence on Nigeria.
Funny tin be say, dis pastors dey follow di law of oda kontri dey run dia church for dose kontri.
Dem dey submit dia finance for regular check by di authorities for UK, US and oda places.
But for Nigeria dem dey live above di law.
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome don dey spread harmful lies about COVID vaccine.
E claim say na di concoction of di anti-Christ.
Dem fine am 125,000 pounds for Uk, sake of say e dey tok harmful and unsubstantiated tins about di vaccine.
But for Nigeria wia e dey kontinue to bring different COVID conspiracy, dem neva call am to kom explain im offence, sake of say na man of god e be.
Maybe na why Nigeria be scam.
If Nigeria na scam, den na becos of pastors wey dey siddun for top, kom dey step on di law wey dey govern di land.
If Nigeria na fraud, den na becos of pastors wey dey sign agreement wit politicians everi election period; dey campaign for dem on di altar, dey command di demons of hell untop dose wey no gree accept dia anointed candidate.
Clergymen dey as corrupt as di politikal class.
Also, civil servant, wey dey collect N150,000 per month, but get pikin for UK school, and property for all ova di major cities of di kontri, go abuse Nigeria and carry all im hypocrisy put for lamentation and insult to di state.
E go calm down ignore e own contribution for di corruption wey dey destroy di kontri.
Also, som citizens dey reject laws, rules and regulations.
Wia traffic light dey, dem go ignore am; wia protocol dey, dem go bypass am, and for places wia dem don get standard for gud service delivery and operations, dem go abandon am.
Still, all of dem go blame Nigeria for di bad status quo as if say di kontri dey exist witout di pipo.
Di problem wey Nigeria get na pipo problem.
But di bad tin be say nobodi wan take responsibility for di terrible way wey tins be.
We dey blame di Nigeria wey no exist.
Na all of us get hand for inside di bad situation of Nigeria.
Instead make we dey follow di tin wey we don conclude about Nigeria, make we forsee goodness and positivity into di system, and make we dey work to make awa kontri di tin wey we want make e be.
Nigeria go be wetin we want make e be.
Di politicians get comma.
But dat na di reason why new generation of leaders must come up and take kontrol.
Nobodi fit free awa mind except us.
Citizenship na call to duty.
NIGERIA NO BE SCAM.
Why separation no be di Silver Bullet to Nigeria challenges
Di principle of self-determination as e dey for di UN charter wey awa pipo wey wan separate hold-on to, take effect for a time wey many pipo for di world dey under colonial yoke or oda form of kontrol by outside power.
Di principle na to give chance to independence and liberation movements so dem go fit gain dia freedom and determine dia path of future development.
For di world wey we dey today, dis principle only apply to few pipo, becos majority of di world don dey free from colonial kontrol and sef-governing.
So dem go need adjust di principle of sef-determination, wey dem establish under di UN charter, so e go fit accommodate di demand of awa pipo wey wan separate, becos if we follow wetin dey dere, dem no qualify.
First of all, dem go need to prove carefully and convincingly say di area wey dem claim to represent dey under som form of kontrol, and say dem dey lack di basic freedom wey everibodi suppose enjoy as e dey di UN charter.
And for wia dem wan prove dat one, dem go need convince di UN on di steps wey dem don take, from di national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to present dia case.
And di UN no go just take dia word laidat.
Dem go get committee wey go confam di fact to know weda true-true, Nigeria as a kontri dey practise di basic requirement of demokracy or not.
Dem don even complicate di case wit di fact say dose areas no be area wey dem dey fight untop, and no be area wey dey under any trusteeship wey go need UN referendum to give dem direct independence or ask dem who dem wan join inside di pipo wey dey fight untop di place.
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.
E no dey give chance make som movement wey no know wetin dem dey about abuse im wide and transparent process.
Di case of marginalisation, wey dem mention as part of di reason for separation, dey too simple to waste awa time untop.
Na everi democratik system dey get winner and loser for election.
And as awa politikal system no perfect reach, di konstitution make am compulsory say as many ethnic group and geo-political zones as possible must get representative for government and im institutions.
E go tough for di pipo wey wan separate to convince di outside world say dia case of marginalisation dey more compelling pass dat of more dan 300 oda ethnic group wey dey Nigeria.
Wetin dis one mean be say, why di international community, wey di pipo wey wan separate dey report and seek support from go single out jus two out of like hundred of dat kind case wey dey ring for di Nigerian media say na im dem go work on ?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?
Out of all di three tins wey make awa secessionists dey agitate, no one dey convincing or compelling enough to justify dia action.
On di amalgamation argument, Nigeria own no be special case for Afrika or for di world.
If Nigeria go need break up unto say Britain no join am well, den dis go be di case of almost all di kontris for Afrika.
In short, if dem use dis principle, e go start di course to begin a new scramble for Africa by di old and upcoming world powers, and like befor, na Afrikans go be di victim.
Make we no deceive awasef, becos if di break-up of Nigeria happun (God forbid), e go lead to di birth of kontris
wey go dey weak sotey, dem go dey beg from di foreign powers.
We don get som argument wey dey compare di break up of Nigeria wit dat of Eastern European states and di Balkans.
Untop dis one, e go beta make we undastand well say di tin wey work for Europe fit no work for Africa.
In di case of di kontris wey we mention, na part of di great geo-strategic games of di major world powers wey get direct cultural, economik and politikal link and interest for di emerging scenario.
And dis kontris don get clear boundary befor dem agree to kom togeda for mutual defence durin di uncertain situation of di Second World War.
Immediately di Soviet order, wey join dem togeda begin dey scatter, all dis kontris need go back to di status quo ante.
And, more importantly, dis developments get di backing and guarantee of di important powers for Europe and di world.
Se Nigerian secessionists get dat kind recognition and profile in di face of di principal powers of di world wey go make dem answer dem?
Surely, di answer na zero.
Dis no kom mean say di agitation of pipo to separate for di kontri no get som gud reason.
Anybodi wey dey live for dis kontri wit dis rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainty and di unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of di government to dis challenges go conclude say truly, we dey for a kontri wey dey fail for im basic konstitutional duties and responsibilities.
And for a fragile kontri like awa own, wey get plenti fault, e dey normal for tendency or preference for separation to arise and grow fast wit di clear dysfunctionality of di government wey dey.
And na everybodi get dis dis feeling.
But as discouragin as di outlook be, and as temptin as di outcome dey appear, separation no fit be di solution to awa current challenge as a nation.
Indeed na prospect wey get som unknown dangers, danger wey no be for di secessionists alone but for di kontri as a whole.
Nigeria no dey perfect.
Even som of di advance kontris don show say despite dia years of existence and dia gud systems, dem no dey free from crises wey dey kom from internal conflict.
Make we no dey deceive awasef say as we dey try break up awa kontri, som kontris go graciously assist us.
Wetin dem go do na to give us di means to destroy and weaken awasef, so dem go fit benefit while we go suffer am.
Na di truth about di international system be dat.
As di popular German beamter tok for di beginnin of my paper; Na we be awa own problem and solution join togeda.
We need put awa mind, talent and effort togeda to develop Nigeria instead say we wan breaking am.
Fidelity celebrate Children Day wit N9.3m money gift to dia customers
To celebrate dis year Children Day, Fidelity Bank pay N150,000 to 62 pipo wey get Sweet Account (SWEETA) tru-out di kontri, wey be di total of N9.3 millionthroughdia savings loyalty programme wey dey go on.

About di initiative, Fidelity Bank CEO, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, tok say all-round quality education na im be di strong way to train di children of tomorrow and to train special children who go fit compete wit odas for di world.

Di bank don dash out N4.1bn to 10,280 customers since dem start di loyalty programme till today.
Investin in young pipo: Ahmed Bobboi example
For July, 2017, I get di honour to spend one evenin inside one British bank wey dem dey call Coutts, as part of di plenti activity wey dey for us as di 2017 Queen's Young Leaders.
U fit dey wonder say why I go dey write about event wey I go for place wey dry like bank.
Anyway, Coutts no be ordinary bank.
Apart from say na one of di eight oldest bank for di world (dem start am som 329 years ago for 1692), Coutts na private bank wey dey popular for im big customers like Her Majesty di Queen.
Inside di big hall, na two welcome us under a big dome for di centre of di building.
Na sharp-sharp I recognise one of di two men wey stand wit a familiar wide smile.
Na Sir John Major, befor-befor British Prime Minister and Chairman of di Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.
We don meet befor, for one dinner wey dem organize for us for di Australian High Commission wey dey London, and na dere e congratulate us for awa recognition by Her Majesty.
Dem introduce di oda man to us as Lord William Waldegrave of North Hill. Na im be di Chairman of di Board of Coutts Bank and Chairman of di Royal Mint Advisory Committee.
Dat evening dey full of entertainment; eatin and drinkin. E sweet well-well
But apart from di display and glamour, we tok and gist wit Lord Waldegarve and Sir Major, two outstandin leaders for di United Kingdom (UK).
Dem show dia happiness to celebrate awa achievement, and dem describe us as special pipo. Dem encourage us to develop awa skills more and create long legacy for awa kontri and di Commonwealth togeda.
Afta, I follow Sir Major and Lord Wadegrave yarn for private, I ask dem som question about public service, banking and finance, innovation and young pipo generally.
I learn a lot of tins from dem
and I komot for Coutts.
Dat night seriously inspire and motivate me more as a change agent, innovator and young leader for Nigeria.
Weda u dey for government, or u dey business, and especially as innovator or entrepreneur, I no fit tok am finish, how important dis kind inspiration fit be for di work wey u dey do.
Som pipo fit komot face for dis confirmation say e no dey relevant. Dem don forget how dis kind tok fit be beta way of mentorship and motivation for upcomin leaders, and e fit serve as example for dem to see champions among pipo wey be like dem.
Di feeling of validation and motivation, wit guidance and support na necessary ingredient for everi leader, especially young pipo.
Di earlier awa older generation for Nigeria realise and accept dis culture of support and mentorship wit dia full chest, and truly celebrate awa achievements, di beta e go be for di future of dis kontri and di growin population of young pipo.
Make u forgive my digression.
Di reason why I dey narrate dis experience na say, since wey e don happun, I no experience dat kind tin again, until recently wen I siddun wit anoda public servant for Nigeria, di Executive Secretary of di Petroleum Equalisation Fund
(Management) Board (PEF-M-B), Alhaji Ahmed A Bobboi.
Even say oil and gas no be my main industry of discipline or practice, I get strong opinion say make pesin no sabi am dey very careless since di contribution of di sector to revenue
pass any oda sector for di kontri.
So I don dey try sabi wetin dey happun for di industry, even say I want make we shift and focus on non-oil sources of income.
I dey happy say I get di opportunity to yarn wit a crucial stakeholder like di executive, especially becos di organisation na pacesetter for di use of advance technology to improve efficiency and performance for di sector.
Howeva, wetin I gain from dis experience even dey more valuable pass my understanding of di industry more.
We discuss difrent topic; from history to government, and from job creation to innovation and entrepreneurship.
E dey very excitin and refreshin, and e carry me straight go Coutts again.
I meet Mr Bobboi for di first time wen I join one team wey e follow kontrol, we dey work untop one regional entrepreneurship acceleration programme under di supervision of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) wia different community for di world join MIT for evidence-based practical approach to make di entrepreneurial ecosystems strongthroughinnovation.
I dey suprised by di vision and dedication wey dis go bring for PEF-M-B to dey involve for dis project, as e surely dey visionary and more beneficial to help build a formidable entrepreneurial ecosystem wit partner like MIT pass di ordinary Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme wey most organization dey do, wey no dey get impact most times.
For dat particular encounter wey I get wit am, we yarn about awa two-years programme wit MIT and di big responsibility of truly acceleratin entrepreneurial development as remedy to lack of jobs and catalyst for prosperity.
The He spoke about various pain points for him as a leader and the approach to solve them.
One of di wonderful takeaway wey I collect na im idea about di National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and how we fit use am serve young graduates and di nation beta.
Becos e don dey notice say som corps members wey dey serve for PEF-M-B dey always dey idle, di executive secretary tok say e don dey find way to ensure say di corp members no just dey engaged, but say dem komot wit skills and knowledge wey go last, and wey go give dem career wey pass government job.
Part of dis go be to do one big programme wey go turn dem to entrepreneurs wey get passion for innovation,througha dedicated and well planned innovation and enterprise trainin durin dia service year for PEF-MB.
Di honesty and sincere disposition of Mr. Bobboi dey visible and penetrating truout awa discussion and me sef kom get di strong will to do my best, no be only to kontinue dey innovate for different sector but to also dey ensure kontinuity for di inspiration and support of younger leaders and innovators, wey go fit make all di difference for awa dear kontri Nigeria.

Rice sufficiency: Nigeria get long way to go Expert
Dr Philip Idinoba, wey be rice commodity specialist for AfricaRice, don show im consign untop di increasin population wey dey affect Federal Government effort to boost rice production.
Idinoba yarn dis one for interview wit News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) for Gombe on Tuesday.
E tok say government need to invest more on rice, so e go fit boost Nigeria food security.
As e yarn, di government dey do plenti tins to boost rice production, sake of say na staple food, but di growin population of di kontri dey bring down di effort.
E tok say di rate of urbanisation, wey be one of di key factors of rice consumption for Nigeria, dey veri high pass di rate wey we take dey use plant rice.
Nigeria still get long way to go for rice sufficiency.
We dey make effort everi yearthroughdi Anchor Borrowers Programme, special intervention programme and oda donor funded projects.
All dis na to bring som tins wey go help farmers increase dia yield and productivity.
But even wit all dis Federal Government effort, di numba of new mouth wey dey join evri year cancel all dis improvement. Idinoba yarn.
Plenti tins to do
Di agronomist add am join say we need to do plenti tins by increasin awa investment, especially for dry season farmin.
As Idinoba tok, we fit take advantage of dry season farmin to boost rice productivity.
We go get beta result for rice production if we fit close di gaps wey dry season dey always cancel for rice cultivation.
E yarn say, if u get eight million farmers wey dey plant rice for wet season, and only two million out of dem dey plant rice for dry season, den di effort never reach yet.
Idinoba, wey still be water management specialist, advise farmers wey dey areas wit flood for di kontri say make dem plant di kind seed wey go fit tolerate flood and go fit survive for water between three to four weeks.
He tok am say All dis varieties, wey dem release three years ago, and still dey multiply by di National Seeds Council of Nigeria, wit oda seeds companies, dey available, and farmers go fit get am.
Dis year, wit di kind tori wey we hear from farmers for Kebbi, Jigawa and Adamawa wey use dis kind varieties, u fit no get complete failure laidat.
Derefor, make we combine dis kind technology go help one way.
Di rice specialist add am say for dose kind areas, improvement go need dey di cropping environmentthroughdi construction of water structures to kontrol, retain or evacuate water.
Volleyball: JVC Bauchi get eye for Premier League ticket
Monday Dada wey be di Coach JVC volleyball club of Bauchi, don yarn say im team dey eager to collect promotion enta di Nigerian Premier League.
Di coach yarn dis one on Wednesday afta im side beat Oyo State 3-1 (25-23, 25-21, 28-30, 25-22) for di ongoin 2021 National Division 1 Volleyball League for Kaduna.
E tok say base on di kind players wey dey di team, JVC of Bauchi belong to di Premier League class.
JVC of Bauchi dey di Division 1 league, and dem go collect promotion enta next season premier league, unto say na dere di big guns dey, and na wetin we dey aim for be dat.
We no dey expect anytin more dan to get di ticket, e yarn.
Dada sef take responsibility for di failure of im team to beat Kwara State on Tuesday. E explain say na becos of im own technical mistakes.
For oda match wey dem play yestaday, Spartans Spikers of Yola lose 2-3 (21-25, 22-25, 25-17, 25-21, 12-15) to Kwara United, Katsina United flog Caliphate Spikers of Sokoto 3-1 (25-23, 25-19, 22-25, 25-12) while Kada Kings scatter Equity Spikers of Kebbi 3-0 (25-14, 25-15, 25-14).
Wetin Kano need for 2023
Kano need create new path to development for 2023.
Dis na becos di state don dey enta di pit of poverty.
Awa rich pre-colonial history show say na Kano rich pass for all di Hausa states, becos di state dey involve for di economy.
Even say di colonialists destroy di economic foundation of Kano and oda society wey dem colonise, di policy of di pipo wey lead di Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contribute to make Kano remain as di leadin economic centre of Northern Nigeria.
For example, dem establish di first modern water treatment plant wey dey di region for 1931, di first independent power plant for Northern Nigeria, wey get 15MW, and for more dan 80 years, dem neva establish any one wey resemble am for Northern Nigeria.
Dem establish di first industrial estate wey dey di Northern Region, dem inherit only one primary school for 1926, and for 1963 everi village don get primary school (more dan hundred), dem establish secondary schools, dem no meet any hospital (except one dispensary) and for 1963 dem don build two general hospital and more dan hundred dispensaries for everi village.
Na dem lay di foundation of modern Kano.
Politikally, na dem make di NPC becom di rulin party for Nigeria.
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintain im position as di second to Lagos.
Kano no get kontrol ova macro-economic policy but e leaders fit provide di right environment for economic growth.
For example, di Dawanau Market, wey still be di biggest grain market for West Africa, e dey bring pipo from all part of di kontinent, even from far place like Gabon and Congo.
All dis na result of di foresight wey Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless im soul), wey establish di market get.
Di three administration wey don rule Kano from 1999 till today, fit claim say all of dem be di best tin wey don happun to Kano, but why Kano don reduce to numba nine for Nigeria?
One single project no dey wey don bring correct economic change for Kano, even afta plenti effort of consign pipo.
If di elite dey focus and determine, wit state leadership as e dey for di pre-colonial period, Kano no go go down to numba nine for Nigeria wit GDP of $13.30b afta Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).
If we no prevent am now, we no go fit imagine di disaster wey go kom in di next 10 years.
Dis na becos of many reasons. One of dem be say we get more dan four million pupils for public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 dem go don finish secondary education.
Assume say na onli 10 percent of dem (400,000) go go higher-level, di government go fit sponsor dia education?
Afta dem complete higher education, di economy go fit give dem beta employment?
As e be so, e no fit.
Dis na becos, more dan 250 medical doctors and more dan 1000 nurses wey di state government dey sponsor, na im dem no fit employ.
We go dey deceive awasef wit di skills acquisition programme wey dey train artisans wey no go get any job afta dem learn di skills, sake of say di local economy no fit employ dem.
Everi day we dey hear billions wey federal government allocate for one economic programme or di oda, and still, we no dey reason pass to train plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.
Since, awa idea no dey about how we go use resources employ di large population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) do wen e begin di city walls.
We need tink outside di box.
Kano no need genius wey get di best qualification and experience, or saint as di next governor.
Dis na becos di governors wey dey for di last 20 years get som of di best quality, and dem fit even don do dia best, but as all of us dey see, di result no be di best for di state.
So, we need reason outside di box.
Di two parties, APC and PDP no fit provide di kind leadership wey we want, sake of say na godfathers dey kontrol dem, and dem no get idea on wetin to do, but dia main focus na how to share di state resources.
Di best tin wey dem fit do na to negotiate for governor wey go serve di interest of a godfather or cabal.
So, di two parties no be di best option.
Beta pesin fit kom outside on e own, or wit di help of oda beta patriotic pipo.
E fit use any way win, even if e negotiate wit any of di two parties or anoda party sef.
E dey possible
E don happun befor.
One example wey dey near us na Nasir Elrufai for Kaduna State.
Im be one of di best for im generation, but di security situation for di state don pass im power, sake of say e dey depend on im personal intelligence and capacity.
Pesin wey beta pass am for Kano no go make di place beta unless dem change som important tins.
I no claim say I get all di answer or even say na me get all di idea wey dey down.
Som of dem na part of Aminu Kano idea.
Plenti beta idea dey for di mind of more intelligent pipo.
Di idea wey I dey suggest na base on my small experience as labourer of politicians and som trainin wey I get outside dis kontri.
Right now, Kano dey crossroad, and dis ideas fit dey useful.
Som pipo need kom togeda to organise one political movement wey no dey in kontrol of anybodi but pipo wey wan sacrifice.
Make dem look di suggestion below:
Need dey for us to start political organisation at di lowest level and make sure say na di members dey in kontrol.
Material reward no go dey, but sacrifice.
Dis dey possible wit mobilisation and di right message.
Befor di election, di movement or party need take detail inventory of di state and design comprehensive action plan wit specific targets wey dey measurable .
Operational guidelines go dey for all appointees plus di governor, and dem go need announce am so every citizen go fit know and challenge, if dem no follow am.
Anybodi wey dey find position inside di movement or party, go begin from di lowest level to di highest.
Som pipo go argue say dis strategy go kill ambition.
Wetin we need now no be ambition but sustainable system wey dey in kontrol of di pipo.
Also, make dem no give anybodi any position unless e don fulfil som basic condition of competence and honesty, and e go bring reference and guarantor.
All public officers must declare dia asset publicly, and dia family members own join, immediately dem reach office. And forensic experts go need verify everytin .
From time to time, di public need dey know dia salary and expenses (plus travel, entertainment etc).
Anybodi wey becom governor or reach any position no go ever do tins on e own.
Di governor no go ever
Make appointment alone.
Criteria, go dey, dem go need set expectation or target for dose kind appointment, and dem go need dey assess and evaluate am from time to time.
All contract wey dem go award go dey fair and transparent, and expert inside and outside di government bureaucracy must evaluate am.
Allocation of plots must dey transparent too.
No governor go get total kontrol of di treasury and na competent staff go dey in charge .
Di governor go be di leader wey go guide all di institution to develop and end one-man rule.
If di governor dey free from dis prison of power, e go lead di state to greatness.
E go lead by example and corruption go reduce becos dem don block all di way wey e fit use abuse power.
Governor suppose dey to supervise public servants and make sure say everybodi do im duty well.
E suppose inspire im pipo wit good lifestyle, commitment to service and transparency.

Arteta must deliver next season
As I don mention befor, Arsenal no get am for mind to sack Mikel Arteta and di club management go back am to turn di Gunners around next season.
Nobodi dey sure if Arsenal don take di right decision, but di club dey plan bring more talented players dis summer.
Pipo dey ask serious questions about di manager ability, and even e own dressin room players dey look am dey wonder if na im be di right man for di job.
For 39 years, Arteta get reputation, wey e build wit Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.
But, afta seventeen months wey e don dey in charge, di fortune of Arsenal neva improve and plenti pipo go argue say di performance of di team dey low pass wen Unai Emery, di man wey e replace, wey knock am out of Europa League dey dia.
Arteta na captain for Arsenal befor and di fans welcome am as dia new champion. But dem don dey lose patience and dem dey agitated as dem see sayChelsea and Tottenham done move ahead.
Di Super League disaster no be sometin wey pipo go forget for a long time
but I fit tell u say di Kroenke owners no dey go anywia.
So, e dey Arteta hand to improve tins, build strong team and get im tactics right next season, if not di proud Gunners fit crash and burn.
De Gea no go gree to be No 2
Even say Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea get im contract till 2023, im agent dey test microphone, to see di club wey go wan sign am.
I dey hear for inside Old Trafford say even say e get gud parole wit di current No 1 Dean Henderson, De Gea no go siddun take bench for long.
I dey hear say Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid get interest.
We no go deny say di 30-year-old dey on top of im career, even say som pipo for inside di club believe say e don drop small for di past two years.
Manager Solskjaer tok say, Goalkeeper departments dey veri tight knit group.
Dem dey work for preparation, dem get different gym session, personal session to di rest of di squad and dem dey stay togeda more.
Naturally dem dey create a bond and di spirit for di goalkeepin department dey high.
Na beta competition.
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesnt regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion.
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire-fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay.
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him.
Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira, Callum Robinson, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league.
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad?
No, it isnt Raheem Sterling.
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards.
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest.
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham.
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen, things have not gone well for the German.
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid-19 and had to battle back to fitness.
Di upcomin Champions League final and di next pre-season, Tuchel believe, say e go show di best attackin midfielder and forward
