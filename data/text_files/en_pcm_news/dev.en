Police arrest 16 suspects over cultism, recover firearms in Enugu
The Police Command in Enugu State has arrested 16 suspects within two weeks, one female inclusive, for cultism and unlawful possession of firearms.
The command also recovered two cut-to-size locally-made guns, one locally-made pistol, two live cartridges, six mobile phones, a powdery substance suspected to be heroin and weeds suspected to be Indian Hemp.
The Command's Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe, said this in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Enugu.
Ndukwe said that the feat was achieved by joint operations carried out by police operatives attached to 9th Mile Police Division, Anti-Cult Unit and personnel of the Nigerian Army, 82 Division in Enugu.
He said that the joint operation took place between April 19 and May 4, within a span of three council areas in the state.
They included: Cornelius Uche, 31; Ifeanyi Umeneze, 22; Chijioke Anachuna, 34; Chibuzor Umeayo, 28; Chinedu Okeke, 23; Ozinachi Obadike, 22; Ifeanyi Nwagbo, 27; Chigozie Okeke, 18, and Chikamso Odinwankpa, 18; were all arrested.
They were arrested on May 4 within Ezeagu Local Government Area following their alleged involvement in bloody cult clashes.
Others included: Ozor Chidubem, 22; Amina Inalegwu (female), 18; Benard Bright, 20; Ugwu Chidera, 21; Ani Chukwuebuka, 23; and Onoh Obumneme, 20; who were all arrested on April 19 at about 3:30 a.m.
They were arrested along Enugu-Makurdi Expressway, 9th Mile, Udi L.G.A. on their way to plan and perfect a heinous cult activity, as preliminary investigation reveals.
Another of the suspect, one Uchenna Aniagozie, 28, was arrested on April 28 for his alleged involvement in a deadly cult clash sometime in January 2021.
Preliminary investigation shows that they all confessed to being members of Vikings Confraternity, he said.
The police spokesman said that the suspects would be prosecuted accordingly once ongoing investigations into their nefarious activities were concluded.
To this end, residents of the state have been called upon to remain law-abiding, vigilant and quickly report suspected criminals and their activities to the nearest police station.
Residents can call the Command's emergency hotlines on 08032003702, 08075390883, 08086671202 or 08098880172, he added.
How cassava is becoming gold in Benue
In Benue State, farmers are expanding their fields almost every season to increase production as cassava farming becomes a thriving business in all the three senatorial districts.
Although the state is largely known as the highest producer and consumer of yam in the country, cassava consumption now gradually reigns.
As such, more farmers are said to be cultivating cassava.
A cassava farmer in the Gboko area of the state, Titus Atondo, said he started cultivating the crop for many years now.
Atondo said cassava farming posed little or no challenge because farmers only need to spray the farm once to repel weed, then wait for harvest.
Cassava chips are very expensive now.
I have a large cassava farm where I make money and my family consumes some of the produce, he said.
Faith Ben is now preparing a large expanse of land in the Ugboju area of Otukpo Local Government Area to cultivate cassava as soon as the rain begins, following the high demand of the by-product in her vicinity.
The demand for cassava is usually high these days.
From the tubers to the processed produce, it has become a money-spinning crop.
That's why I am going into the farming.
And I am doing so purely for business, she added.
On his part, the state chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Aondongu Saaku, admitted that cassava consumption in the state had become more than yam in recent times.
Saaku said this is because cassava is eaten in varieties, unlike yam.
Meanwhile, the Director of Agric Science in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Thomas Unongo, explained that cassava farming has been thriving in the state in recent times because no aspect of the crop is wasted.
Unongo, whose farm occupies three and a half hectares in Apir, Makurdi, said that for the past two years, he had been cultivating the land with new varieties of cassava released by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA).
Apart from weed control, it is one of the cheapest crops to grow.
Rice production costs between N200,000 and N300,000 per hectare, while yam costs between N150,000 and N200,000 per hectare, but inputs for cassava production for farmers with stems cost only about N150,000.
And where there is light vegetation, it could be as low as N100,000.
It is really cheap and the output/return on investment is one of the highest in Benue now, he said.
Unongo further noted that the challenges of farming cassava in the state hinged on insecurity as herders attacks worsened.
He alleged that herders usually removed the stems and tubers for their cattle.
He, however, advised that to get a better yield, one would have to apply weed control three months after planting, stressing that when weeds are allowed to grow in the farm, they invite pests, such as grasshoppers.
He said inputs like fertiliser, herbicides, among others, are necessary, adding that there's the need to observe farm sanitation, which would help against attacks by rodents.
Unongo maintained that while the conventional old varieties of cassava would last up to two years before harvest, with one-year maturity, the new improved varieties have a maturity period of five and seven months; but the eight months are superb for harvest.
Cassava farming is turning to gold in Benue because the state is nearer to the North, where the crop is not produced.
Also, the produce, especially garri, is becoming costlier because vendors are everywhere in villages mopping up the chips desired more for the Northern market, he noted.
Start agric revolution now, Bode George, Gen Olanrewaju tell Sanwo-Olu
Prominent Lagos indigenes under the aegis of Eko Pataki have asked Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to immediately begin a move towards revolutionising agriculture in the state.
The indigenes made the call against the backdrop of the recent decision to block food supply to the South by the Amalgamated Union of Food Stuff and Cattle Dealers in Nigeria (AUFCDN).
Reacting to the development yesterday, the group said there was the need for the government to redirect its policies towards broadening agricultural investment in order to enhance food sufficiency in the state.
This was contained in a joint statement by the leader of the group, Chief Bode George, and its trustees, Gen Tajudeen Olanrewaju and Mr Gbadebo Dallas.
The group charged the governor to engage the huge unemployed youths in the state to drive the agricultural revolution.
The statement reads in part: The recent action of the Amalgamated Union of Food Stuff and Cattle Dealers in Nigeria which halted the convoy of trailers from bringing tomatoes, pepper, onions and all kinds of foodstuff to the South should awaken the leadership of Lagos State to redirect its policies in widening its agricultural investments.
Lagos State which is naturally our foremost concern as Eko Pataki should henceforth impress into immediate duty a massive workforce of her unemployed youths across the IBILE traditional enclave, whipping our vast and enriched lands into a huge agricultural holding.
From Ifako-Ijaiye to Imota, from Epe to the rolling fields to the mangroves of Badagry, Lagos State is blessed with nutrient-rich agricultural fields that can quickly be marshaled into farmlands where various kinds of crops from tomatoes, lettuce, pepper, beans, rice, corn, yam, potatoes, cassava to many others can be planted to enhance our self-sufficiency in food production.
It is our candid advice to Governor Sanwo-Olu to quickly reorder the state's priorities in ensuring that our state becomes the new food basket of the country thereby triggering a new agricultural revolution in the state of excellence.
China to raise proportion of middle-income earners
China's consumption has been on a continuous rise in recent years, and its consumption structure is also being optimized.
Last year, the country's total retail sales of consumer goods reached 39.2 trillion yuan ($6 trillion), and final consumption contributed 54.3 per cent to China's GDP.
As a result, China maintained its position as the second-largest consumption market in the world.
New business forms such as online shopping and influencer marketing experienced rapid development.
In 2020, a total of over 24 million Livestream shows were aired on e-commerce platforms; online sales of national entity bucked the trend and grew 14.8 per cent; the express delivery industry handled 31.2 per cent more parcels than it did a year ago.
China has become the world's largest market of online retailing for eight consecutive years.
The robust recovery of China's consumption, despite the severe impacts from COVID-19, showcased the strong resilience and huge development potential of the Chinese market.
As a major force of consumption, the middle-income group is a pillar of the economy.
At present, China has 400 million middle-income earners that account for around 30 per cent of its population.
In developed countries, the distribution of household income is always in an olive shape that is sharp at both ends and plump in the middle.
In other words, the middle-income group usually accounts for 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the population in developed countries.
Such a structure is considered healthy and good for economic and social development.
In contrast, China still has a long way to go to expand the size of its middle-income group.
Vice-Minister of Commerce Qian Keming said that with 1.4 billion people, China boasts a super large market and huge development potential.
In the next 15 years, the number of Chinese middle-income earners is expected to reach 800 million, which will generate robust momentum for consumption upgrading and bright prospects.
According to China's 14th Five-Year Plan, China will work to increase the income for graduates of universities and vocational schools, skilled workers and migrant workers in the next five years.
Experts believe that it's both possible and necessary to include them in the middle-income group.
Graduates of universities and vocational schools come in huge size and are well educated and skilful, which makes them possible to become middle-income earners.
Most people from this group, with their degree of education and competence, will not work simple and repetitive jobs, so it's possible that they become middle-income earners, Su Hainan, a contract research fellow with China Association for Labor Studies, told People's Daily during an interview.
According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS), China has over 200 million skilled workers, who take 26 per cent of its total jobs, up from 20 per cent a few years ago.
More than 50 million of them are highly skilled workers.
In recent years, skilled workers are in a short supply in China, and their income keeps rising.
The MOHRSS recently issued a guideline, encouraging enterprises to institute an annual salary system and offer special awards for skilled talents, especially highly skilled ones.
Migrant workers are a major part of China's workforce, many of whom are also well educated and skilful, and are able to work complicated and innovative jobs, Su said.
Last year, the number of migrant workers in China reached 280 million, including 170 million who worked out-of-town.
The average monthly income of them stood at 4,072 yuan.
Many of them are getting close to the threshold of middle income if calculated in terms of household.
To make a part of migrant workers middle-income earners is necessary for narrowing the rural-urban income gap, improving the competence of workforce and accelerating rural vitalization, and it's also feasible to do that, Su noted.
As the income of these major groups rises in the future, the size of China's middle-income group will be further expanded, turning the country's household income distribution into the olive shape.
By that time, China's consumption vitality will have been further activated, and the country will also release more dividends to the world.
Aba agog as maiden Gov Ikpeazu golf tourney tees off
Over 2,500 players from across Nigeria and West Africa are currently vying for laurels in the maiden edition of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu open golf championship which teed off on Wednesday, May 19 and will end on May 23at the famous Aba Golf Course.
The Governor who teed off the tournament charged the players to enjoy the game and also the hospitality of the people.
He said they should find time to visit major shopping centres in Aba to buy memorabilia to take to their respective homes.
The governor also promised to continue to support the sport and assured that his administration will construct a new golf course in Ohafia to further deepen awareness and participation in the game.
He said,I pray that golf which is a unifying game will continue to unify us in Nigeria and also avail us of the health benefits of engaging in this gentlemen's game.
In his remarks, the National Director of Competitions, Professional Golfers Association of Nigeria (PGAN), Johnbull Dangofa informed Ikpeazu that having gone round the historic city, he was pleased with the prevailing peace and the good infrastructure put in place by the governor.
The President of Aba Sports Club, Chief Jerry Kalu, expressed members appreciation to the governor for the support given by the state government to ensure the smooth take-off of the competition.
He said more than 250 golfers had registered to take part in the tournament.
A letter to DSS and other intelligence agencies
You guys are supposed to be smart.
I know you evolved from the police just as did many other agencies.
By splintering from the police you were meant to be cleaner, and smarter, much quicker on your feet.
Is it politics that overcame you guys?
I heard the National Security Adviser, Monguno, for the first time since he was appointed years ago the other day, sounding very eloquent with his Queen's English.
He should be polished, after all he was one of those privileged ajebutter Nigerian children who attended Kings College back in the day.
From his speech I could hear and see an organised mind and an intelligent, functional brain, and I wondered at length why and how Abba Kyari managed to cage such a person while Buhari looked on.
Monguno, later went on to allege that quite a number of the arms and ammunition that Nigeria paid for under the recently ambassadorised military chiefs were nowhere to be found.
When he saw that feathers were ruffled, he tried to walk back what he was alleged to have said.
A couple of days after that happened, we heard in the news that Buhari stopped some weapons acquisition he wanted to make from Dubai through third parties.
The report put Monguno in bad light and sought to expose his hypocrisy.
Will we ever find a way out of our insecurity maze?
We are no longer hearing from the leadership of the DSS.
Since the initial gra-gra and controversies they've fallen silent.
No one sees or hears from Yusuf Bichi anymore, but we sometimes see smart DSS chaps in dark suits and goggles performing their bodyguard services to the high and mighty.
We even see them on few occasions heavily kitted up like ninjas, complete with balaclavas and some out-of-this-world machine guns.
But that is where it ends.
It seems that the president does not care about the efficacy of the DSS and so they too have jejely withdrawn to their cocoon.
There is some politics going on there.
The police, we know their problem; that one is agelong.
I am writing not to draw the attention of these bodies to myself
but well I am available for their attention if they take this personal.
I am writing as a concerned Nigerian citizen.
I'm afraid that there is no intelligence in this country anymore.
I am prompted to write specifically because the nation is totally adrift and even if we accuse the politicians of being asleep at the wheels, it is inexcusable for our intelligence services to also be snoring.
There looks to be a deliberate abandonment of Nigeria into the hands of the elements kidnappers, secessionists, fake news agents, online terrorists, and other forms of terrorists.
Who does not know that security is won and lost at the level of intelligence?
Whereas Nigeria has come to disrespect the police force, but many still hold the intelligence services in awe as we see them as elite corps.
At least they cannot be seen on the roads collecting money from bus drivers.
However, one can conclude that with the rifeness of crime, and general disintegration of society, the intelligence services have lost their bite and famed prowess, especially under this government.
How can a faceless group named FUNAM be sowing so much discord in the Nigerian society and we have intelligence services feigning ignorance?
Whoever is putting out statements on behalf of FUNAM is certainly playing a childish game on the minds of Nigerians but even professors believe them.
This is because at the end, we are very emotional people in this country.
However, the intelligence services have deliberately looked away while all this has been going on.
I googled statement by FUNAM just to be able to get some direct quotes for this article and up popped a statement from 2018
wherein this same FUNAM claimed that Nigeria is their only inheritance and that the whole of Nigeria up to the Atlantic belongs to them, that Plateau is their indigenous territory, even as they claimed responsibility for some gruesome killings.
In recent times, the same group claimed that it attacked Benue Governor Ortom, and only missed killing him because of some slight technical communications error.
The group went further to say Our intention is unequivocal: TO KILL HIM.
The mission will one day be fulfilled and very soon too.
Furthermore, We warn collaborators working against Fulani people across Nigeria: WE SHALL GET YOU irrespective of your hidden place
We state clearly, any state or individual that opposes RUGA will be confronted.
Any State or individual that opposes ranching, we shall get you.
Speak against ranching and RUGA even on the internet: Our Noiseless fighters shall find and fix you
In the next few months, FUNAM will carry out attacks on strategic human and material assets of States and Non State groups or individuals known for their anti-Fulani campaigns¦ We shall hunt you down in your houses, in your work places, in your car, in your streets.
It's a matter of time.
People sign these documents but no one has been apprehended, neither has the statements been declared fake by our intelligence services.
From my own humble perception these statements are childishly written by someone who wants to foment trouble and arouse public anger and disunity in general.
The statements also deflect from focusing on real perpetrators.
I have been on many WhatsApp groups trying to calm people down by bringing attention to the fact that their minds are being manipulated.
But why am I doing DSS job?
Even Ortom had earlier called a press conference at which he read another statement that this group put online to the extent that Benue State belongs to them and that it was their pleasure to kill Tiv people!
A lot of Nigerians have been hailing Ortom for being a governor who loves his people for these public shows.
However, those who attacked him must be found.
We hear that the police have arrested some fishermen in the area.
I have become a bit wary as every crime in Nigeria is now attributed to herders.
Are we not leaving the space open for other criminals to ride on our sentiments?
Are we saying with all the resources at the behest of our intelligence services, no one can fish out those dumping things online, stewing up the minds of Nigerians, causing mayhem all over the place and even getting people primed to the idea of war and national disintegration?
Is this the best that we can do really gentlemen?
Harry-Meghan interview: Queen is sad, says Buckingham Palace
Queen Elizabeth II has expressed sadness over the interview granted by her grandson, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had in the interview narrated the conversations around about
how dark Archies
(their newborn child) skin might be and how the child would not be given a royal title and police protection.
However, Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Tuesday that the Palace is saddened by the challenges faced by her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, and takes their allegations of racism in the royal family seriously.
The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan.
The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning, the palace said in a statement released on the queen's behalf.
While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.
Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members.
More than 12 million viewers viewed the British broadcast of Oprah Winfrey's interview with Meghan and Prince Harry on Monday night.
The interview also attracted a 54 percent share of the television audience at the time.
Fury vs Joshua will be in Saudi Arabia in August Hearn
Saudi Arabia will host the world heavyweight boxing title unification fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua in August, promoter Eddie Hearn said on Tuesday.
Joshua holds the IBF, WBO, WBA and IBO titles while fellow Briton Fury is the WBC belt holder.
August the seventh, August the 14th.
I think it's a very bad secret that the fight is happening in Saudi Arabia, Hearn told Sky Sports television.
It's the same people we did the deal with for Andy Ruiz, that event was spectacular.
As partners they were fantastic as well, he added.
Joshua won back his belts from Mexican-American Andy Ruiz Jr in Diriyah, on the outskirts of the Saudi capital Riyadh, in December 2019.
Why secession is not the silver bullet to Nigeria's challenges (II)
The proponents of Nigeria's break up hinge their reasons on three main pegs; the 1914 amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates which gave birth to Nigeria, the United Nation's charter on self-determination and allegations of lack of representation and marginalisation in the affairs of the country.
The notion that the 1914 amalgamation which secessionist groups say was the foundational move from which most of the current challenges facing the Nigerian nation emanated need to be vigorously challenged and totally debunked.
In this regard, it will benefit us to know that there was an earlier amalgamation in 1906 where the Lagos colony which had been in existence in 1862 was merged with the southern protectorate.
Like the subsequent 1914 amalgamation which seems to enervate the secessionists, the 1906 amalgamation too was a forced one between unwilling entities which had little or no cultural similarities.
Pray what did the peoples of the coastal states in the Niger Delta region have culturally and historically with the Yorubas of the Southwest?
What links historically and culturally do the Igbos in the eastern hinterland have with Yorubas for that matter?
As far as can be deduced, the reasons for rejecting the 1914 amalgamation also suffice for the one of 1906 in that they were both a forcible measure against peoples of different historical and cultural backgrounds.
Why then do the secessionists harp only on the 1914 amalgamation to press home their demands neglecting conveniently the 1906 amalgamation?
The reasons are simply because for their own narrow political narratives and ends which seek to justify a North versus South secessionist agenda the 1914 amalgamation narrative is more suitable.
It would not make good strategy if they also have to cite the 1906 amalgamation which essentially, by import and effect, was similar to the one of 1914.
How would it look for instance if Oduduwa secessionists say that the 1906 amalgamation was the reason why Igbos who are of different historical and cultural background have come to dominate the economic and commercial life of Lagos and as such the Oduduwans are seeking out of this marriage with the Igbos forced on them by the British?
Or the Igbos claiming that the 1906 amalgamation was responsible for the skewered nature of economic infrastructure being concentrated in the Southwest which compels them (Igbos) to have to invest in the Lagos economic zone rather than the East at great inconvenience?
Another fallacy being peddled about the 1914 amalgamation which was purportedly signed by representatives of Nigerian entities, was that it was to expire after a hundred years meaning by 2014.
That Nigeria is still existing after the expiry date of 2014 is something the secessionists are trying to instigate other Nigerians to agitate against and ensure the end of this expired contraption as they call Nigeria.
Again this is as near a namby pamby narrative as it can get.
By 1914 the British had established full and total control of the territory we now call Nigeria as all pre-existing entities such as they were had become subsumed under British rule.
British colonial rule over Nigeria had been unquestionably established which made the amalgamation a purely administrative measure by a colonial overlord for which he did not need the permission of his subjects to carry out.
In this regard the amalgamation could not have been time bound as claimed, and it was not.
If ever there was a time for the amalgamation to expire as claimed, it had to be at the end of the British colonial enterprise which at the time was not in the reckoning of the British.
If there was a genuine document that contained the terms and condition of the 1914 amalgamation including the signatories representing various pre-existing Nigerian entities as well as clause stating the date of expiry, the onus is on those peddling such as basis for the break-up of Nigeria to present it as proof to us of their justification.
In any case, even if such a document existed, with Nigeria's independence in 1960 it ceased to be valid because all entities in Nigeria at the time partook through their elected representatives to discuss and agree on terms to be part of the new country.
If an agreement such as being bandied about on the amalgamation existed and if the parties that took part in the independence talk agreed for its retention and inclusion in the independence constitution, it would have become a relevant constitutional and legal case for the secessionists to cite in their agitations.
On the issue of the UN provision on self-determination as cited by the secessionists for their action, it is important to bear two important points in mind.
The UN is not a world government with executive powers to superimpose its will on national governments.
A country can invoke the principle of sovereignty to block the implementation of any UN resolution it considers in conflict with its national interests.
Although Nigeria is signatory to the UN charter including the provision on self-determination, it can and has the right to block any attempt by any group within it to break-up the country by latching on to that provision.
Thus even in the unlikely event of any break-away group in Nigeria securing UN support, Nigeria can within its sovereign rights stand against such a move.
But what is more significant is that although the UN charter provides for self-determination, the UN places a great onus on seeking such to prove their credentials and case comprehensively.
The process of seeking and eventually getting UN support for a self-determination bid is a very complicated and convoluted one which will take years to come to fruition and may not result in success ultimately.
Those seeking to invoke the UN principle of self-determination for their secessionist bid must first of all prove that they have the mandate of the people of the area they seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through the media or internet.
They must also show proof that the area seeking to secede has been denied or does not have adequate representation at local, state and national levels of the government of the country.

Lebanon starts its COVID-19 vaccination drive, PM says will wait his turn
Lebanon started its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Sunday by inoculating the head of critical care at its biggest public hospital, followed by 93-year-old celebrated Lebanese actor and comedian Salah Tizani.
Battling a sharp spike in infections in recent weeks which has overwhelmed its healthcare system, Lebanon took delivery of 28,500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Saturday, the first batch of 2.1 million doses set to arrive in stages throughout the year.
Delays in signing a deal to purchase a vaccine and the rollout of an inoculation programme had caused frustration in Lebanon.
The World Bank, which helped fund the first batch of doses, has said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need.
I will not be receiving the vaccine today, for today is not my turn and the priority is for the medical sector that has done its duty and presented big sacrifices,
caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab told reporters at the Rafik Hariri hospital, where Lebanon's first coronavirus case was quarantined about a year ago.
Tizani, who is better known by his stage name Abou Salim, encouraged everyone to get the vaccine.
For those who are afraid to get vaccinated, I swear by God, it is protection for them, he said.
The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials
say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon's population of more than six million, which includes at least a million Syrian refugees.
Lebanon has been under a 24-hour curfew for nearly a month, although the government began lifting some restrictions this week.

Trump impeachment article heads to U.S. Senate
A second impeachment trial of former U.S. president, Donald Trump is set to come a step closer.
The U.S. House of Representatives prepares to forward the article of impeachment to the Senate.
Carrying the charge of incitement to sedition, the article is to be read before the second chamber of Congress at 7 p.m. on Monday evening (
Trump is facing an unprecedented second impeachment trial based on a charge of incitement of insurrection over the deadly storming of the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters on January 6.
According to impeachment rules, the arrival of the indictment article at the Senate formally triggers the start of the impeachment trial, which will be the first faced by a president after leaving office.
However, Senate leaders have agreed to modify the rules by having the impeachment article delivered on Monday evening and then delaying the actual start to Feb. 8.
The Capitol attack
A violent mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol just after he used fiery rhetoric at a rally to promote baseless claims of election fraud.
The attack, which sought to halt lawmakers certification of now-President Joe Biden's victory in the November election, left at least five people, including a police officer dead.
In the Senate, a two-thirds majority is needed to convict.
It is unclear how many Republicans might join the Democrats in such a vote, which could also bar Trump from holding office again.(dpa/NAN)
Court convicts 39 tricycle, bike riders without permit
A mobile court sitting in Benin has convicted 39 people for operating tricycles and motorcycles without rider's permit.
The prosecutor, Mrs P O. Ovbiagele, had told the court that the 39 people were apprehended within Benin-Agbor road axis, riding their bikes and tricycles without permit.
According to Ovbiagele, the offence is punishable under section 9(4) and 27 of the Second Schedule of the Edo Traffic Control and Management Agency Law, 2010.
The accused persons pleaded guilty to the offence and asked for leniency.
The Chief Magistrate, Mutairu Oare, thereafter, convicted the 39 persons and ordered them to pay N5,000 fine each, and obtain the rider's permit within 24 hours.
According to him, if they fail to obtain the permit, parking fees of N1,000 would be charged on their impounded bikes and tricycles on a daily basis.
Oare also said that after six weeks of non-compliance, the tricycles and bike would be forfeited to the state government.
Gunmen kill traditional ruler, 3 others in Benue
Gunmen on Wednesday killed a traditional ruler, Chief Hyacinth Ajon and three other people in separate incidents in two Local Government Area of Benue State.
The deceased traditional monarch was said to have been killed alongside one, Benjamin Anakula in Tse Zoola community of Makurdi LGA while two others whose names were not given were also killed in Guma area of the state.
Eldest man in the community, Aho Zoola, alleged that gunmen suspected to be herders attacked the villagers at about 2:00am, shot sporadically and killed the two people.
according to the report of one of Governor Samuel Ortom's media aide, narrated that the attack on their rural abode came to them as a surprise because they never had any issues with herders.
The media aide, Jimmin Geoffrey, had stated that the governor was returning from a burial in the area when he had a stop over to sympathise with the villagers who are already displaced from their homes and assured them that he would do everything possible to get security agencies to the area.
Similarly, the Chairman of Guma LGA, Caleb Aba, told newsmen in Makurdi by telephone that the two other people were killed on Wednesday in Mbayer-Yandev council ward of Guma.
Aba however fingered suspected herders behind the killings in his domain.
Dr Mahmud Tukur: Tribute to distinguished accomplishment
In the end, it is not the years in one's life that count, but the life in one's years Abraham Lincoln
The limited space available here is certainly not enough to describe the late Dr Mahmud Muhammad Tukur, a Nigerian politician and former Minister for Commerce and Industry during the administration of General Muhammadu Buhari.
Tukur, who belonged to a small clique of policy advocates in Northern Nigeria, died on April 9, 2021, at the age of 82 years.
He has since been buried in Yola, Adamawa State.
Dr Tukur was the 1st indigenous Director of the Institute of Administration, Kongo, Zaria.
He took the mantle from Prof. S.S. Richardson in 1967 until 1975 when he became the first Vice-Chancellor of the Bayero University Kano.
Now recall it was the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, who upon attaining independence of Northern Nigeria, declared before Sir Garwin Westray Bell the last Governor-General in 1957 at the Lugard Hall Kaduna, that the commitment of training the manpower in the North, which according to him On them, we will rely on the attainment of improving the health, prosperity and happiness of our people without discrimination on grounds of tribe or creed of which Dr Tukur and a few distinguished others were the foundation recruits.
Some have said the journey of President Muhammadu Buhari into politics is incomplete without Tukur.
Yes, no doubt, the description of Tukur as being among the intellectual powerhouse of the president is true since his contemporaries included Mamman Daura, Liman Ciroma, Adamu Ciroma, and Hamza Rafindadi Zayyad.
Mahmud Tukur was a firm, tenacious and resolute man who led an impactful life, a man of deep conviction and inner strength, who served the North incorruptibly and enhanced the betterment of the country's democracy.
Under his tutelage as Director, Institute of Administration, Zaria, he supervised and superintended the building of a crop of the intelligentsia in the North and was deeply committed with a strong sense of duty to the building of a Nigeria that is equitable.
We can safely deduce then, that an entire genre of the past and current civil servants, private sector executives and political elites in the North passed through the hands of the late scholar who affected every facet of education and saw to the manpower upliftment of not only his the region but Nigeria at large.
President Muhammadu, in a tribute to Tukur, said Dr Mahmud Tukur's service to the nation will be remembered by generations.
He had a passion for a prosperous, economically strong and united Nigeria.
He was a proud nationalist.
Buhari recalled that as Minister of Trade in his first coming as military Head of State, Dr Tukur introduced a lot of schemes that revived the local industry, boosted exports and gave real meaning and effect to import substitution in regenerating the indigenous manufacturing sector of the economy.
He prayed to Almighty Allah to accept him in Aljannah Firdaus and give the family, friends, the Adamawa Emirate Council and the people of the state the strength to bear this great loss.
Indeed Tukur's enviable position and competence increased his public profile in Nigeria.
It indeed takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, therefore the contributions of Tukur in the development of the education sector during his stint at Bayero University and his tireless efforts in the peacebuilding process and socio-economic development of Northern Nigeria can never be forgotten.
Late Tukur, born in 1939 in Yola, Adamawa State, obtained his First Degree in International Affairs and Political Science at the University of Wales (where he was the recipient of the Elizabeth Morris Memorial Prize for graduating first in his class).
He also obtained a Master's Degree in Public International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh and a PhD. in Public Management at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna.
He also studied at Northwestern and Oxford Universities.
The deceased was a Fulbright-Hays Fellow, senior I.U.C. Fellow and associate member of St. Anthony's College, Oxford (1974).
He goes into history as the first Vice-Chancellor of Bayero University, Kano.
In his career as a public servant, the prominent scholar of worldwide fame served on the Adebo and Udoji National Wage Reviews and the Constitution Drafting Committee of 1976, he was also a member of the sub-committee on Citizenship Rights, Fundamental Rights, Political Parties and Electoral System under the chairmanship of Alhaji Aminu Kano.
He was a member of the National Constitutional Conference (1994\1995) and the Vision 2010 Committee (1997).
In 1984, during the military regime of Major General Muhammadu Buhari, he was appointed Minister of Commerce and Industries by the Federal Government.
A business executive, the late Tukur chaired the activities of Fukarabe Industries Limited, Kaduna, and fulfilled the obligations of many corporate directorships.
He was a Coordinator of Policy Analysis Limited and authored and co-authored many books, of which the most prominent is: Leadership and Governance in Nigeria:
The Relevance of Values, published in 1999.
He is survived by three wives, nine children and many distinguished brothers, including the prominent global industrialist and world-renowned business mogul, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, former Governor of the defunct Gongola State, one time Minister of Industries and ex-chairman of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Late Engr Hamman Tukur a former Director-General Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources and Pioneer Chairman, Revenue Mobilization and Fiscal Commission.
We commiserate with Nigerians on the demise of this courageous academic, who, contrary to being also a match-maker, had a more distinguished career in the service to the nation.
Nigeria would surely miss the statesmanship of the Adamawa born Dr Mahmud Tukur, an enigma during his lifetime, who displayed genuine magnanimity and moral courage, and who always put national interest above ethnic or group interests.
Reputed for his uncompromising adherence to due process, he was indeed a bridge builder, ever ready to deploy his wisdom and knowledge garnered over the years for the good of his country.
Dr Tukur was a man of peace and unquestionable diligence and professionalism whose death is a great loss to Nigeria.
He lived an impactful life and contributed immensely to Nigeria and has etched his name on a platter of gold in the country's history.
We all have a collective duty to keep alive his service patriotic duty for a peaceful and secured country.
The federal government should immortalise him by naming any of any educative or renaming the Institute of Administration ABU Zaria in his remembrance.
Nigeria has indeed lost a rare gem, patriotic Nigerian par excellence, an academic extraordinaire and great author, who had served this nation meritoriously, a man of strong character and conviction who led one of the most impactful lives anyone would have wished to live, going by his well-defined roles in the growth of humanity and his untiring commitment to nation-building.
His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten
In the end, as Abraham Lincoln succinctly asserts, it is not the years in one's life that count, but the life in one's years.
May Allah SWT uplift his works and grant him Aljannar Firdaus.

Benue warns of imminent food crisis
The Benue State Government at the weekend raised an alarm over imminent food crisis unless the challenges of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in various camps across the state were urgently addressed.
Executive Secretary of State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Dr. Emmanuel Shior, made the observation during an interactive session with newsmen in Makurdi.
Shior said it became necessary to sound the alarm as most of the IDPs are farmers who have been chased out of their ancestral lands occasioned by herders attacks for over two years now.
The herders are the reason why the IDPs are in camps and till date, there are still pockets of attacks around Torkula and Idyer in Guma, Moor in Kwande, as well as some communities in Agatu and Logo, he said.
The SEMA boss said it was worrisome that the state has over 500,000 IDPs in eight designated camps across the state alongside others scattered in makeshift shelters in relatives homes while the state government continues to spend so much to fend for them.
He explained that, we have spent billions of naira in taking care of the IDPs since 2018.
We have eight official camps housing over 500,000 IDPs in those camps.
He however added that Governor Samuel Ortom had put in place the IDPs disengagement plans to ensure the safe return of the IDPs to their homes, noting that with the high number of IDPs in the state, it would be difficult to just close down the camps, especially as there were still pockets of attacks and their deserted homes not safe for return.
Shior appealed to the federal government, international donor partners as well as well-meaning individuals and corporate organizations to come to the aid of the state in that regard, stressing the need for the federal government to release the N10billion that was promised to Benue among other states for the resettlement of the IDPs.
12 killed in fresh Benue attack
Gunmen have reportedly killed 12 people in several communities of Ado Local Government Area in Benue State.
Witnesses said the attack on the communities was carried out simultaneously between Saturday night and early hours of Sunday in Tologa, Ndi-Obasi, Odoken all in Ekile Council Ward of Ijigban District, Ado Local Government Area.
Chairman of Ado Council, James Oche, told journalists in Makurdi on telephone that 12 people were killed during a coordinated attack on five villages in his area.
Oche alleged that the attack was a reprisal by suspected herders after some persons believed to be IPOB members crossed over from Ebonyi State to his Ado Local Government in Benue State and killed one elderly Fulani man identified as Muhammad Isah.
I suspect that the herders came on reprisal because of one elderly Fulani man known as Isah Muhammad who lived in one of the affected communities that shared boundary with Ohakwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State and was recently killed by IPOB members, who crossed over to the comunity in Ado, he said.
Contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for Benue Command, DSP Catherine Anene, was yet to reply to calls and text messages put through her telephone at the time of sending this report.
How local production of COVID-19 vaccine will save Nigeria
The federal government has reiterated the need to have a home-grown COVID-19 vaccine for its over 200 million population, saying local production of the vaccine would save the country the cost of importation as well as make it easily accessible and affordable.
The Minister of state for Health, Dr Senator Olorunnimbe Mamora said that in order to achieve home-grown COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria, there is a need to support research institutes.
He said this on Monday at the Nigeria institute of medical research (NIMR), Lagos during the commissioning of the next generation sequencing as well as a tour of the projects within the institute.
According to the Minister, Although there is a vaccine in the country, we will not stop research institutes from working on the one they are researching on.
Having our own home-grown vaccine is the ultimate in which case, we don't have to look to any other country for a vaccine.
It is in our own interest that we ensure we get to that point where we can lay claim to our own vaccine.
Nigeria and 53 other African countries are yet to produce a vaccine for over 1.34 billion people.
The continent is reliant on the vaccine produced from outside the continent.
The Director-General/CEO of NIMR, Babatunde Salako, revealed that the institute has been having a collaboration with the Usmanu Danfodiyo University in Sokoto and the National Veterinary Institute in Jos for robust research on vaccine development in Nigeria.
Prof Salako hinted, While NIMR is currently using Gibson assembly cloning in developing multi-valent peptide subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus, Usmanu Danfodiyo is employing bioinformatics and nano-technology to make DNA vaccines, and National Veterinary, on the other hand, is using reverse genetics in engineering New Castle Virus to express SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.
This is a serious effort to be supported by the government.
The newly commissioned sequencing machine, he explained, was acquired to serve in the molecular surveillance as well as monitor the variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria.
The machine, he insisted, would prepare the country in the fight against other infectious agents such as Lassa fever virus, Yellow fever, Ebola and other infectious agents characterized by the genetic code.
Gunmen abduct Nasarawa lawmaker, 3 others in Kaduna
Unidentified gunmen have abducted a member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly representing Nasarawa Central State Constituency, Mr Ismail Danbaba, his driver and two others to an unknown destination.
Daily Trust gathered that Danbaba, who was travelling to Jos, Plateau State capital for a workshop alongside his driver and two others people in his vehicle, was abducted on Saturday evening.
The Chairman, Nasarawa State House of Assembly's Committee on Information, Mr Mohammed Omadefu, confirmed the incident in Lafia on Sunday.
He said the lawmaker was abducted along Akwanga/Jos road close to the forest in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
Our correspondent learnt the legislator was ambushed and whisked away to an unknown destination with his driver and two others in the vehicle.
Omadefu, who represents Keana State Constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), informed our correspondent that the lawmaker's abductors had already contacted the House but were yet to make demands.
He said: The lawmaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Mr Ismail Danbaba, who is representing Nasarawa Central, was kidnapped yesterday in the evening while he was on his way for an official function along Akwanga/Jos road in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
When our correspondent contacted the Police Public Relation Officer, Nasarawa State Police Command, ASP Ramhman Nansel, he said the incident did not occur in Nasarawa State, so he would not comment on that.
He said: Please, contact the Police Public Relation Officer in Kaduna state.
Nasarawa State command is not aware of any such incident.
4 killed in police faceoff with IPOB sit-at-home enforcers in Ebonyi
Four people are feared killed in shooting between members of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra and police in Ebonyi.
Early indications are that a police officer and three IPOB members are among those killed, though Daily Trust is unable to independently verify the identities and the numbers.
The shooting occurred in Nnodo in Ebonyi local government area of Ebonyi state where police encountered IPOB members enforcing the group's sit-at-home order.
A reliable source who doesn't want his name on print told Daily Trust that motorbikes and cars were set ablaze during the attack.
And in order to stop them, the police was mobilized to the area leading to shooting during which deaths were recorded, he explained.
The police are yet to put out any official statement on the incident.
FULL LIST: The 30 guests that will attend Prince Philip's funeral
Only 30 guests will be present when Prince Philip, the late husband of Queen Elizabeth, will be laid to rest.
Aged 99, Prince Philip died after a brief illness on Friday.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, members of the public were advised not to partake in the funeral.
The Queen reportedly faced a very difficult decision selecting the small group from the original 800-strong congregation of St George's Chapel in Windsor, West of London, where Prince Philips will be laid to rest.

Issues FG must fix to regain cotton glory
In the last two years, cotton production has been gathering momentum, but the challenges of farmers have remained unsolved.
Cotton farmers in Nigeria are mostly smallholders, with production largely through the rain-fed system, using traditional farm tools and animal traction (animal drawn implements).
However, few now have access to tractors.
In the 1980s, cotton was grown by about 900,000 smallholder farmers, holding an average of 0.5 to 1.5 hectares in an estimated total area of about 700,000 hectares across the country.
However, with the collapse of the textile and garment industries, as well as poor market, most of the farmers abandoned production for other crops with better market potentials.
Current production level
The annual demand of cotton in Nigeria is estimated at 88,000 metric tonnes of lint, which is about 255,000 metric tonnes of seed cotton.
Until 2019, the total domestic production was below 60,000 with many farmers struggling even to achieve the average yield of between 400kg and 750kg of seed cotton per hectare despite the fact that some of the seeds have yield prospects of about 2.5 to 3.0 metric tonnes per hectare.
Statistics from the National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN) showed that the number of farmers under the association has grown from 90,000 in 2018 to about 134,000 farmers for the 2020 wet season.
In 2019, the farmers achieved 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes, which amounts to about 80,000 metric tonnes increase.
For this 2020 wet season, production was expected to reach 200,000 metric tonnes, according to NACOTAN.
The current market
A farmer, Bala Sarkin Ruwa in Shelleng, Adamawa State, told Daily Trust on Sunday that he sold the 2 tons of his cotton early at N180,000.
But his counterpart, Mr Joshua Dadi said he sold at N200,000 in January 2021, describing the price as fair.
Mr Anibe Achimugu, national president of the NACOTAN and managing director of the Arewa Cotton, described the current prices as good for the farmers, compared to previous years.
In 2019, the price per tonne was N205,000 for farmers.
That means a farmer was doing over a N100,000 profits directly into the pocket if he was able to produce 2 tonnes of seed cotton.
The intervention is such that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wants to jump-start the sector.
And of course, you want to leave it, to a large extend, at market-driven prices and demand.
Now, the minimum price, at least this year, is N185,000 per metric tonne, which is still better than if it was to be left on its own and not encouraging to farmers, and so on, where prices were N140 to N150,000 per metric tonne.
I think the minimum guaranteed price since the intervention has been good, he said.
Issue of quality seed
Professor Ishiyaku Mohammed, the executive director of the Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, said the institute had released13 different varieties of cotton seeds with very important economic attributes that increase the income of farmers and provide different products for utilisation, either as fiber or for making textile products, or even for providing oil.
The farmers said that last year, there was an improved access to better quality seeds, with a potential yield of 2.5 tonne per hectare if the best agronomic practices were followed.
With that, Achimugu said a farmer was jumping in yield figure of between 400 to 500 kilogrammes per hectare to 1.2, 1.5, and in fact, some were getting the 2.5 tonne per hectare.
You know it is how well you manage your farm, the dedication and skill you have, but I will tell you specifically that perhaps the lowest that was recorded was around 700 to 750kg per hectare.
But farmers were hitting 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes per hectare, which was fantastic.
In 2018, the federal government, through the National Varietal Release and Naming Committee, approved the commercialisation of two transgenic cotton varieties, MRC 7377 BG 11 and MRC 7361 BG II developed by Mahyco Nigeria Private Ltd, in collaboration with the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.
Resuscitating cotton industry, a lifeline
Cotton is the key component of the textile and garment industries because it provides fibre for the manufacturing of textile products.
However, the faith of the nations textile industries had gone down to a pulp for decades since the glorious years.
In the 1970s to the 1990s, the Nigerian textile industry accounted for about 25 per cent of the Manufacturing Value Added (MVA).
It used to be the largest employer of labour (more than 600,000 people during the 1970s to 1980s) in the manufacturing sector after public sector in the early 1990s.
However, experts hinged the collapse of the textile industries that made Kaduna a household name in the country on the high operating cost, resulting from poor energy supply, infrastructure decay and proliferation of the market with cheap and smuggled textiles.
This also forced some to relocate to other countries within the sub-region.
Out of the 54 ginneries available in Nigeria, only 22 are functioning at very low capacity utilisation.
Ginning capacity of the existing ginneries is about 650,000 tonnes of seed cotton but national production falls to less than 60,000 tonnes per annum representing about 10 per cent capacity utilisation according to the data from the Raw Material Research and Development Council (RMRDC).
This trend has a spirally limiting effect on the cotton value chain development locally, culminating in the folding up of several textile industries (83) between 1995 till date, while the few that are functioning (23) are performing at low capacity utilisation, Professor Hassaini Ibrahim Doko, the director-general, RMRDC said.
Experts said to bring cotton value chain back to life and its glorious days, the federal government must champion the revival of industries through various policies and financial interventions.
FG must tackle smuggling, cheap import
The Director-General of the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association, Alhaji Hamma Kwajaffa, said smuggling and cheap Chinese imports had been the bane of the country's cotton industry.
Despite the procurement act for local content to be sourced first, nothing has changed much as most of the materials used for uniforms majorly come from China, while others come from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The original thing should have been that all our uniforms are sourced locally from the textile companies.
If you look at our schools, Army, Navy, Air Force, Immigration, Customs etc, if their uniforms were all sourced locally, of course many of the textile industries would not have closed.
Our problem is actually smuggling.
You know our dealers can go to China; and in China, anything you ask for they can do it for you.
They go to China with our textile design and the Chinese would do it for them the way they want, and this ends up in Nigerian markets, Alhaji Kwajaffa lamented.
Cotton farmers, through the NACOTAN, want the federal government to take up cotton as a national asset and introduce a Nigerian standard, which can help the country to have a good grading system, as well as the establishment of high volume instrument cotton testing laboratories, he also said, adding that these will take care of many issues.
Banditry affects production
In the last two years, many cotton farmers could not access their farms because of the activities of bandits along major producing areas.
Recently, the only surviving textile company in Kaduna State shut down operations and sacked over 100 staff due to the absence of raw materials because the farmers were complaining that bandits won't allow them go to their farms.
Stakeholders said government must reinvigorate its security architecture to enable farmers return to their farms as that is the only way to reduce poverty in rural communities.
Abdullahi Salisu Dayi, a farmer in Malumfashi Local Government, said that unless something spectacular happened in favour of cotton production, he doubted if farmers would engage in it as they did last year.
Climate change affecting production
Last year, many cotton farmers in Katsina, Gombe and Adamawa states suffered erratic rainfall, which has affected yields.
Some farmers who spoke with Daily Trust on Sunday in Adamawa, Katsina and Gombe said their yields were severely affected by little or heavy rainfall.
Joshua Dadi in Kem, Adamawa State, said his yield was affected because of a sudden cessation of rainfall.
Although he got 4 tonnes in his two-hectare farm, the yield is below the 2019 yield.
Hamisu Sani in Katsina said cotton farmers suffered most as demand for the produce is not like that of rice, maize or soybeans, yet its price is good at N200,000 per tonne.
Heavy rainfalls permeated our cotton farms and stagnated the growth of the crop, as well as caused rot of the cotton balls at their early stage, he added.
Another large scale cotton farmer, Alhaji Kamilu Kankara, said he also suffered low yield of the produce due to heavy rainfall.
Over the years, demand for food items has prompted my gradual withdrawal from massive cotton production.
This year seems the worst for me as I only harvested nine bags from two hectares that were giving me three tonnes of cotton, he said.
With a growing population of over 200 million and army of unemployed youth roaming the streets, experts said government must give priority to sectors like agriculture huge attention, both in budget, policies and financial interventions.
Cocoa production is not progressing in Edo Farmers
Cocoa farmers in Edo State have lamented that lack of support from the state and federal governments is hindering cocoa production in the state.
The state chairman of the association, Thomas Ekpenriebe, stated this in Benin while speaking with journalists on the prospect of cocoa farming in the state.
He said the farmers had not gotten any support from either the state government or the Federal Government, in term of inputs and funding, saying the development is really affecting cocoa production in the state.
As it is now in Edo State, we go to Ibadan and Ondo states to get the new hybrid of cocoa because the cocoa seed garden in the state is not functioning, and nobody is managing it.
Also, there is no extension service for cocoa farmers in the state.
In the 1960s, cocoa was the cash crop used to develop the country.
Today, there's nothing coming from the state or Federal Government.
We are just working on our own and it is affecting cocoa production in the state and the country in general, he said.
The farmers solicited the support of the Edo State Government to invest in cocoa farming by reawakening extension service, re-established cocoa seed garden to avoid travelling to other states for seedlings and also generate more revenue for the state.
The chairman also lamented the activities of middlemen in cocoa business in the state, which he said was affecting profits accrued to cocoa.
While calling for the re-establishment of a cocoa board across the country, he said, The board would serve as a regulatory body that would help cocoa farmers to identify licensed buyers and control the price of the commodities.
He explained that currently, Edo State has the best quality cocoa due to the concerted efforts by relevant stakeholders.
Ekpenriebe also identified unfavourable climate, outbreak of fire, COVID-19, absence of a regulatory body as major hindrances to the sector.
Entrepreneurship development: Purpose and mindset
After the arrival of the colonial masters to various parts of what later became Nigeria, and the beginning of the introduction of Western-style public administration, the need for trained native public servants began.
With increasing need for various services, the vacancies for trained manpower continued to balloon for several decades up to the 1980s.
But by the late 1980s, we had begun to not only saturate the public services, but were probably over-employed.
If any realistic and prudent thing is to happen to our public services over the next one decade, it should be a deliberate and systemic rightsizing, and that is a polite way of saying downsizing except probably for the military, the police and other such services.
Yes, obviously, people will die or retire and there will be need to employ for replacements and for some marginal growth as well.
But those combined vacancies are very unlikely to meet up with the rate graduates from high schools and universities are churned out from all around the country.
We have to, therefore, not only accept the reality that the public sector is never meant to be there to just employ graduates but to also gladly accept the truism that the public sector should, instead, focus on developing the enabling environment that will see to the creation and growth of businesses of all sizes in all sectors and crannies of the country.
If you ask me, successive federal governments in the past have done reasonably well in encouraging graduates to go into self-employment and business through programs with the Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, SMEDAN, NDE, NIRSAL, etc.
But the call has not been sufficiently loud and unequivocal: The government must cease creating any impressions that it can directly employ the multitudes of our youths, by honestly and clearly communicating that there are limited employment opportunities in the public sector that can come up from time to time.
Instead, the government should continue to focus on strengthening the various interventionist and enabling programmes that will facilitate the creation of employment by the youth themselves.
Obviously, all the aforementioned programmes can only succeed and be sustainable if a sense and responsibility of accountability are both inculcated and enforced in our youth.
With a population of over two hundred million people and growing, there are more than sufficient local markets for many products and services.
From abundant fertile land for agriculture all across the country, to solid minerals in most states of the federation; information technology, manufacturing and services, we really are literally a bottomless pit of opportunities for serious entrepreneurs.
Over the coming weeks, this column would endeavour to bring out topical issues on entrepreneurship that will help our youths in understanding opportunities and how to seize them and create jobs for themselves and others.
The starting points for the success of any and every worthy endeavour in life are two: purpose and mind-set.
One of the reasons many people fail to achieve meaningful and sustainable success in business and life is because they fail to identify their life's purpose from the get-go.
Even when they can boast of what might seem to be reasonable outwardly achievements, they may still lack the full internal satisfaction necessary to keep them motivated and going for the marathon this life is.
Lack of purpose costs us resources such as our time, finances, efforts, relationships, etc.
In the long run, we realise that it has deprived us of true meaning in the various spheres of our lives and the contentment that comes with it.
Without a purpose or with a weak one, an individual can easily be swayed away from their otherwise noble journey.
Entrepreneurship is particularly challenging.
Without a clear purpose that has deep meaning that is internalised, you risk missing your way or giving up when you hit headwinds, and there will be a lot of it in the journey!
The next most important thing after purpose is your mindset.
Consciously or subconsciously, everything starts with our mind-sets.
Successful entrepreneurs have an amazing perception of what they want to achieve years and even decades before it becomes reality.
It is the clarity of the vision in their minds that keeps them highly motivated internally and quite relentless on the outside.
And so nothing seems to be able to stop them.
In the conceptual development and production of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the American Walt Disney faced an unbelievable resistance from financiers, contributors and other associates including his brother, Roy Disney.
Hollywood wags referred to the project as Disney's Folly.
But Disney was very clear in his mind as to what he wanted to achieve.
He refused to lose focus on his desired outcome.
In the end, the project cost a whopping 1.5 million in 1938 US dollars.
But in the first weekend of its release, Snow White brought in $8 million, representing about $134 million in current dollars!
This level of confidence is never accidental.
It is a consequence of a mindset that is committed to achieving identified objectives.
Ask any successful entrepreneur, they will identify with this story of vision, mind-set and resolve.
With a clear purpose and a committed mindset, the next important thing the budding entrepreneur should be aware of is what to expect in entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurship: What to Expect on the Journey will be in this column next week.

Niger Senator wants electronic voting mandatory for 2023 polls
The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Mohammed Sani Musa, has advocated mandatory use of electronic voting during the 2023 general elections.
Speaking with newsmen on Monday in Abuja, Senator Musa said electronic voting would increase participation in elections as it would allow voters to vote from anywhere.
The lawmaker therefore urged the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) working on the amendments to the Electoral Act 2010, to include the mandatory use of electronic voting during elections, in their final report to the senate at plenary.
Senate President Ahmad Lawan had said that the National Assembly would pass the amendment to the Bill before the Summer Recess which is in June.
Electronic voting will increase the level of participation because it will allow them to vote from anywhere.
It will also eliminate violence because the majority of people who have access to the internet will prefer to vote in their homes or offices instead of going physically to the polling stations where armed thugs could cause havoc, he said.
Grazing crisis: Why states should adopt Zamfara template
Kwagga Dlama Zira Eliphelet is an architect, designer and project manager of the Zamfara Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) project.
In this interview with Daily Trust on Sunday, he said the Zamfara model could be used in solving the crisis between herders and farmers across the country.
He is of the opinion that the template can be best implemented based on the peculiarity of each state, with the overall interest of creating peace, jobs and economic opportunities.
There is crisis in the livestock sector in Nigeria, especially in the area of animal feeds.
Many stakeholders are suggesting that one of the ways forward is to create ranches for herders in order to tame grazing crisis with farmers.
As an expert in this area, to what extent do you think this can help?
The incessant farmers-herders crisis has eaten into the fabric of this country and contributed to the division we are experiencing.
As a matter of fact, ranching is where the solution to this problem lies because for every well-meaning Nigerian, RUGA, which stands for rural grazing area, has been with us since 1946, but it has been dormant.
In the 21st century, the best way to float production in the livestock system is to have farms or ranches for full commercial production.
Open grazing and travelling kilometres is outdated in every strata of humanity today.
So, this is an opportunity for us to harness our potential in agriculture, which we have forgotten.
The RUGA template we should adopt is unique and peculiar.
There are states that cannot have RUGA or ranches, but they have the potential to benefit in a very big capacity, in terms of livestock production.
The farmer needs to produce what the herder would use as raw material, just as the cow dung is manure for the farmer.
The RUGA should not be forced on all the states, but each state can take advantage of it, based on its own peculiarity.
If the far northern states build ranches, I expect the southern or middle belt states that can't have RUGA to take advantage of it by putting up large scale fodder of pasture production farming, which will sweep most of our teeming youth out of the streets.
This is an opportunity for governors and commissioners of agriculture to look at how we can harness these potentials.
RUGA should not be viewed as a programme that would cause division.
When the federal government mooted the idea of the national livestock programme, some states, especially in the South, kicked against it, saying it was a way of taking their lands for herders.
As an expert, can you throw more light on how this can be resolved?
The salesmen of the president could not sell the idea properly because, as a matter of fact, the issue of RUGA settlement is not about land grabbing.
You can't go to Adamawa to grab someone's land, even if they are mixed with Fulani.
It does not work like that.
You have to look at the peculiarity of each state to decide if a settlement can be established there or not.
So the president and his cabinet should look inward and at the peculiarity of each state.
That is why today, despite being the main programme of the president, the issue has not been nipped in the bud.
This is because they were doing it as a holistic approach in the country.
There are lots of government farms that have been abandoned; this is an opportunity to use them.
Let us come together to renegotiate this project and you will see that people will adopt this roadmap.
Let us have a policy that is workable for us all, with sincerity of purpose.
There should be a proper dialogue between states that are arable for this project, and this will harmonise the relationships we all share.
There are fears that the traditional Fulani may find it difficult to be confined in ranches, how will that be attended to?It is not confinement.
Just as the indigenous people in other parts of the country are repulsive to this because they have not been given a sense of belonging to the project, it is the same with some indigenous Fulani that cannot move because they have intermarried.
There are Fulani that are resident.
For instance, in Adamawa, there are those who stay in a place and they can be differentiated from those who engage in seasonal movements.
So they can also adopt the system of being in a place if the proper orientation is given.
What I am trying to say is that we should look for ways to stop the upward and downward movement.
Nobody will dispute the fact that fattening is when you keep cattle in a place.
This concept is not to imprison the herder but to provide new opportunities.
Zamfara is noted as one of the states piloting RUGA, and you are a key stakeholder in the project; what is the situation now?
The project is a bargaining chip for peace so that the economy would thrive.
When we started work, we were told that before Governor Matawalle came into office, the rate of banditry made the state inaccessible, but he was able to broker peace.
This should not only be applicable to herders.
How do we harness and build up our own farming communities?
What other essential amenities and infrastructure do we need to give our farming communities?
Is it very good rural roads that would bring all those grasses out?
Is it good canals that would take water further to where the streams can't go, or are boreholes at intervals to give good water, primary health care?
There are basic things that need to be provided.
But it is a right of the citizens and should not be a privilege.
Specifically, what do you have in the Zamfara RUGA project?
The RUGA model encompasses 23 items.
We have the road network, which is about 13.673 kilometres.
The ranch is in the Ranji Sakida Grazing Reserve in Maradun Local Government Area; and it is 2,218 hectares.
The pilot phase started with about 100 hectares, but due to natural formations, it took about 300 hectares.
That is for housing and other structures, but we expect it to take almost the entire place because of pasture production.
There are other reserves meant for similar projects, like Zumi Gidan Jaja with about 36,200 hectares and the Dantsado Kuyanbana forest of about 10,000 hectares.
On the pilot phase, the state government acquired a pivot sprinkler system, which has about 850 meters in diameter and radius of about 475.
Apart from the roads, we have water reticulation, which serves about 27 kilometres.
There is a water storage facility, four overhead and four surface tanks, each of which accommodates 250,000 litres, cumulatively giving you 2million litres.
Then we have solar-powered industrial boreholes, with 8 attached to each one.
We have 10 hand-operated boreholes, which are already sunk.
As at December, the reticulation had gone to about 18 kilometres, out of 27.
We also have health facilities, including a primary health care with a 30-bed capacity and theatres, outdoor patients department, a nursery for delivery, which is attached to the maternity.
We are not expecting any case that is more than the capacity of the health care.
There is the veterinary clinic, which has the capacity to accommodate about 1,000 herds within its own confines.
And it has its own theatre and isolation rooms, including 12 paddocks.
There are markets with open and closed stalls and abattoirs.
But in the context of a Fulani man, he does not kill his animal in his environment, so he takes it to a far place to slaughter, so the abattoir is located outside the ranch.
The abattoir is going to be in Maradun town.
We have 210 plots for herders, each measuring 2,475 square meters, and are divided into four.
Six hundred square meters is given for the living area so that the herder can build his hut the way he wants it.
The other three are divided, fenced and demarcated, with each paddock having a gate.
We provided a squat system for them and a soak-away to each house.
Out of the 210 allotted plots, there are five bedrooms for the Fulani or Hausa leaders.
Three and two bedrooms are for ward heads.
There are religious facilities: an eid ground, a central mosque and outdoor spaces that can accommodate up to 1,000 persons.
There is also an Islamiyya attached to the mosque, as well as a school, so that they can have an opportunity of Islamic and western education.
There are other spaces left for future development.
What are the economic benefits of the settlement in the future?
We have phases one and two.
Phase one is to provide the basic amenities in bringing the herders back into a cluster.
The economic benefits are that it will attract investors over the world.
It will bring the production of meat, which in turn provides revenue.
It will open job opportunities for veterinary doctors, agricultural extension workers, companies that can come in to engage in milk, cheese and manure production, bio gas, bone processing, hide and skin processing, animal feed from the blood, in combination with other ingredients, then pasture production from farmers.
Planned $250m funding for national carrier unsettles operators
A projection by the federal government to raise $250 million for the proposed national carrier is raising questions among operators in the aviation industry, Daily Trust reports.
According to a document released last week by the aviation ministry, the federal government expects private investors to raise $250m for the proposed carrier as it insisted the project would be delivered before 2023.
In the document which gives an update on the national carrier project and other sub-projects in the roadmap, the Ministry of Aviation explained that the project development phase has been completed.
The government explained that the next phase would be the placement of Request for Qualification (RFQ) in local and international media.
$250m approximately is to be raised to start up the airline by private investors, the document stated.
But stakeholders doubt the feasibility of the project, saying investors might be unwilling to put their money in such a venture.
Rather, some of them called on the government to harvest the facilities of the airlines under its management to set up the national carrier.
The Managing Director, Flight and Logistics Solutions, Amos Akpan said it would be an uphill task for private investors to invest $250m in establishing a national airline.
He attributed the difficulty to several factors such as return on investment (ROI), business environment, among others.
He said, Positioning to attract investment is more critical now.
If the gestation of investment runs into the next government coming in 2023, will it affect the agreements established with this government?
Nigerians still experience discriminatory aircraft leasing agreements and insurance programmes.
We are still trying to effect the implementation of no duty on aircraft spare parts.
The forex regime is yet to accommodate airline operators.
Interlining and cooperation is still at the concept stage.
Let's fix the platform or foundation first before we can build or launch on it.
In his remarks, aviation analyst and Head of Research Zenith Travel, Olumide Ohunayo, stated that there is no amount too small for a national carrier if there is high credibility and contact with lessors, aircraft manufacturers and other airlines.
Group Captain John Ojikutu (rtd), an aviation analyst, wondered what $250m would do for the project and the would-be investors.
Private investors will include foreign and local; how much is $250m in a national carrier or how many aircraft would that buy?
How much would government investment of 10% be in the national carrier?
If we want a national carrier let it be now
or we better go for a flag carrier and the government take a rest from the journey it started in 1993 when the national carrier became a government airline.
But another analyst, Mr. Chris Aligbe, said raising $250m for the project would not be difficult, noting that there are many investors who are willing to put in their money on the project.
According to him, the $250m would be more than enough to start off the project depending on the strategy being adopted.
Almost 500 bags of onions looted from attacked Imo truck — Market leader
Halilu Mohammed is the Secretary of Onions Dealers Association in Imo State.
In this interview, he narrated how suspected members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) attacked and confiscated two trucks transporting onions to the eastern part of the country.
Can you tell us how the incident happened?
Well, there were two trucks conveying onions from Kano State.
These people stopped the vehicles and seized the drivers and the vehicles and they later drove the vehicles to one side where they ransacked and sold all the onions before we could get the security agencies to get to the area.
Each bag of the onion costs at least N15,000 at market price but they sold each of the bags at N9,000.
Who are those people that carried out the attacked?
Of course they were Biafran militants (IPOB), who were marching with their flags.
They carried out the attack, looted the goods and sold each and every of the onions conveyed in the vehicle.
Where did they carry out the attack?
The attack was carried out at the market where these vehicles were stopped and ransacked.
They gave out a price and sold each bag of the onions at the price of N9,000 and went away with the money.
Before security agencies arrived, they have already sold out all the onions in one vehicle.
It was after security agencies have arrived then we moved the other vehicle to a safer place so that they do not attack again and possibly go with the vehicle.
Who owns the goods?
The onions belonged to one Alhaji Bello who also owned the trucks conveying the onions loaded from Kano to Imo state.
What is the estimated value of all the onions in each vehicle?
We have estimated each of the vehicles was conveying at least 470 bags of onions.
And each of the bag of onion is sold at a market price of N15,000.
What is the implication of this incident and what effect could it have on business in that area?
The incident has already affected both the people in that area as well as those traders who engage in such businesses.
Now, people are already in fear, and those drivers have lost the peace of mind to convey onions to Imo state.
Everyone is scared of the probable danger.
We have so many vehicles on ground that refused to convey onions to Imo state.
What actions are you taking?
Well, we are keeping in touch with our leaders, our traditional rulers and government to look into the situation for appropriate action.
How are northerners in the eastern part coping with the unrest in these areas?
Now everything seems to be normal.
The tension is subsiding unlike when the incident happened.
Gunmen kill pregnant woman, abduct lawmaker in Nasarawa
Gunmen have reportedly killed a pregnant woman in an attack on Abebe village in Keana Local Government Area of Nasarawa State.
It was gathered that the incident happened in the early hours of Saturday when the assailants stormed the village with sophisticated weapons and shot sporadically, causing pandemonium as residents scampered for safety.
The President, Tiv Development Association, Comrade Peter Ahemba, who confirmed the incident, alleged that the attacks and killing of Tiv people of Nasarawa State in the last two months was targeted at chasing them out of the state.
In another incident, gunmen have reportedly abducted a member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Mr. Ismail Danbaba, his driver and two other persons.
It was gathered that Danbaba, who represents Nasarawa Central constituency in the State Assembly, and three others, were abducted on Saturday evening while travelling to Jos, Plateau State capital for a workshop.
A member of the states parliament, Mr. Mohammed Omadefu, who confirmed the incident in Lafia, said the incident happened along Akwanga/Jos road, close to a forest in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State.
Omadefu told our correspondent that the abductors had contacted the states House of Assembly but were yet to make any demand.
When contacted, the Police Public Relation Officer, Nasarawa State Command, ASP Rahman Nansel, said since the incident didnt happen in Nasarawa State, he would not comment on that.
Please contact the Police Public Relation Officer in Kaduna State.
Nasarawa State Command is not aware of any such incident, he said.
Cement scarcity: Dangote to revive Gboko plant
The management of Dangote Cement is set to improve cement availability in the market as it plans to revive its Gboko plant which shut down over four years ago.
The Group Sales and Marketing Director (GSMD) of Dangote Cement, Rabiu Umar, stated this Thursday in Kano while interacting with building industry professionals.
The company has been up and doing to ensure an effective restoration of cement supply across the states.
Dangote Cement will soon inject 2000 trucks into the cement supply chain as well as the revival of the Gboko plant and extension of a production plant line.
The Registrar, Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), Prof. Joseph Odigwe, told the participants that Nigerias cement industry has been producing cement that is of international standard.
Engr. Aliyu Aliyu, said Dangote cement has gained the confidence of cement users in the country, adding that there is a need for brand specification to allow its effective use.
3 names disappear from U.S. Intel Report on Khashoggi after initial release – Reports
The U.S. intelligence community has replaced its long-awaited report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, with another version that no longer includes the names of three men initially considered as complicit, CNN reported on Monday.
On Friday, the U.S. intelligence community declassified a report saying that the Saudi crown prince had approved the operation that killed Khashoggi in 2018.
Later that day, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against former deputy head of Saudi intelligence, Ahmed al-Asiri, and the crown princes personal protective detail.
Saudi Arabia, in turn, has strongly refuted the information about the alleged role of the kingdoms leadership in the incident, adding that the kingdom had already convicted and sentenced those responsible for the killing.
According to the broadcaster, the three men, whose names were removed from the report, participated in, ordered, or were otherwise complicit in or responsible for the death of Jamal Khashoggi.
The first name is Abdulla Mohammed Alhoeriny, who is the brother of General Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Howraini and heads the Presidency of State Security, the broadcaster reported, citing a person familiar with the inner workings of Saudi intelligence.
Abdulla is named in Saudi reports as the assistant chief of state security for counterterrorism.
The two other names that subsequently disappeared are Yasir Khalid Alsalem and Ibrahim al-Salim, CNN said, adding it was not clear who they were.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to clarify to the broadcaster why the names were initially included in the report, while a senior U.S. administration official said on Friday before the change was noticed that there was no new information in the report.
We put a revised document on the website because the original one erroneously contained three names which should not have been included, an ODNI spokesperson told CNN.
Khashoggi went missing in 2018 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Riyadh initially denied any knowledge of Khashoggis whereabouts but eventually admitted that he had been killed inside the diplomatic mission.
The Saudi government sentenced several people over their role in Khashoggis murder and has repeatedly denied allegations that members of the royal family were involved in the incident.
The position of Saudi Arabia has already been supported by a number of Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, as well as by the Arab League.(Sputnik/NAN)
Reasons wheat price will remain high
For decades, the wheat story in Nigeria has not been positive despite various federal government pronouncements and task forces set up to scale up wheat production.
The challenge forced many wheat farmers to direct their energy more towards rice which enjoys favourable policies and funding.
The local demand for wheat has grown to over 6 million tonnes (MTs) in 2021 due to a growing population estimated at over 200 million.
For instance, the demand by flour millers is estimated at 5.1 MTs, while other users outside the processors use about 1m MTs.
The current rice production according to an estimate from the Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) is about 420,000 MTs, with production estimated to reach over 600,000 MTs when harvest begins in the next two months.
Few months ago, the price of wheat hit N32, 000 per 100kg bag, forcing prices of flour and other household consumables like bread to go up.
Domestic production of wheat is moving at a very slow pace because there are many issues that make it be on a declining trajectory since 2018.
ABP not rolling
Since 2018, wheat farmers stopped benefitting from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) after accessing about N2.3 billion that year.
This year, about 285,000 farmers have been validated by the CBN, but their issue with their financial institution over the 2018 poor loan recovery rate, which was about 40 percent, is counting against them.
The President of WFAN, Alhaji Salim Mohammed Sale, told Daily Trust that they were not participating in the ABP despite having about 285,000 farmers cleared and qualified for it.
Alhaji Sale said because of the poor recovery rate, the first participating financial institution withdrew from them and that their attempt to change to another bank was not accepted by CBN.
The same thing happened in 2019 when 11,000 farmers were cleared but did not access the fund because of the 2018 recovery rate.
Alhaji Sale further said, This year we engaged 285,000 farmers and CBN has validated the list.
After speaking with Unity Bank, they said they were not interested in working with us, so we moved to Keystone Bank.
After meeting all the requirements necessary, Keystone wrote a letter looking for the cash backing of the programme, but there were challenges because we have one exposure which we were unable to pay…
So we were told to go back to Unity Bank where we have the exposure.
However, we highlighted three or four points; that they should continue with the programme with us so that one, we will have sustainability in wheat production; two, defaulting farmers are not the ones to be engaged in the programme so that it will serve as a lesson to them and it will encourage them to pay back and rejoin; three, we will have learnt from our past experiences in recovery and come up with something more effective in the recovery system; and four, deployment of mechanisation that will make the programme sustainable.
He pointed out that the best way was not to stop the programme completely, but to evolve other ways that would improve recovery, adding that not all rice, maize and cotton farmers paid all their loans, but that the programme still continued for those crops.
He said this was going to affect wheat production, noting that even with the ABP, many farmers were still not willing to go into its production.
Alhaji Sale explained that, It was the association that brought courage for farmers to go into production because of the agreement between them and the offtakers.
You cannot grow something that you do not have a market for.
We tried and created the market between us and the millers.
Even individuals in wheat farming come through the association to sell the product to the milling plants; and they find it very easy.
Now that they are not in the programme, the farmers find it very difficult to sell the product in the market.
Two, there is insufficiency already in the subsector of wheat.
The only way you can reduce that and cut down the import bill we are paying is by engaging multiple farmers to produce.
Seeds looted in Jos
Daily Trust gathered from reliable sources at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development that during the #EndSARS protest, about 3,600 bags of improved wheat seeds were looted.
The grains were stored in Jos, the Plateau State capital, because of its conducive weather.
Since the looting, no farmer has received any assistance in terms of cash and planting materials.
Despite insufficient certified seeds, some farmers get seeds through the community seed production system whereby each farmer saves seeds against the following production season.
There should be stability in food prices – CEO, Titan Farms
Following the skyrocketing inflation in the country, an Ibadan-based rice farmer and the Chief Executive Officer of Titan Farms, Engr Gbenga Eyiolawi, has urged government at all levels to ensure price stability in food items across the country.
Eyiolawi said instability in the prices of food items has serious effects on the budget and expenditure of families and households, urging government at all levels to be more responsible and responsive to their responsibilities.
Speaking during the launch of Titan Farms City, an affiliate of Titan Farms, a combination of real estate and agriculture, he said his company would ensure an all-year-round supply of food items in affordable prices.
Titan Farms City, which is a marriage between real estate and agriculture, is where we cultivate, instead of just processing.
At present, we only process.
Of course, we want to ensure an all-year-round supply; so, all our produce are to be processed right here, he said.
On how to address the rising cost of food items, he said, We cannot give an immediate solution to the challenge, but we can do a projection of what would be a solution in the nearest future.
That is why we have the Titan Farm City to ensure that there is enough availability of stock and raw materials for processing, and to ensure uniformity of prices over a period of time.
We are working and collaborating with existing farmers.
At present, we have 52 farms that have signed agreements with us to help them process their harvests.
Gunmen attack bullion van, cart away undisclosed amount of money
Two people are feared killed after armed men attacked a bank bullion van at Elemosho Village along Akure-Ondo Expressway in Ondo East Local Government Area of Ondo on Thursday evening.
Witnesses said the robbers came in a Lexus car, waylaid and attacked the bullion van headed toward Akure around 5pm and made away with an undisclosed amount of money.
Three people were shot in the operation, which last minutes before the gunmen ran into the bush, witnesses said.
One of the victims was alive while it was not sure whether the other two survived it, a witness said.
Residents also fled into the bush in the wake of the sporadic shooting.
Two of three vehicles in a convoy were riddled with bullets in the attack.
The eyewitness added that the men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency, Amotekun, were invited to the scene and took one victims to the hospital.
Commander of the Amotekun, Adetunji Adeleye, confirmed the incident.
When we got the information, my men moved in there and met one of the persons that were shot at the scene and we have taken him to the hospital.
There has been no casualty, he added.
Similarly, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro said the robbers had ran away before police arrived the scene.
He said the command had commenced investigation into the incident and the detectives from the command had been on the trail of the robbers.
First UAE ambassador to Israel takes up post
Israels president on Monday formally received the first-ever ambassador from the United Arab Emirates to the Jewish state, following last years historic agreement between the countries to normalise ties.
UAE envoy, Mohamed Al Khaja, who arrived in Israel earlier Monday, delivered his credentials to Israeli President, Reuven Rivlin, at a ceremony in Jerusalem.
After greeting Khaja in Arabic, Rivlin said: The entire Israeli people welcome you with joy.
This will be your most important mission – to welcome the hands reaching out to you… treaties are signed by leaders, but real, sustained peace is made between peoples, face to face, the president said.
Khaja said he would work tirelessly to strengthen the political ties between our two countries, in the service of our peoples and regional stability.
The UAE was the first country to agree to establish full diplomatic relations with the Jewish state under the Abraham Accords, a pact brokered by former US President Donald Trump.
The agreement made the UAE only the third majority Arab nation to form official ties with Israel, following Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.
Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan have subsequently joined the Abraham Accords.
The agreements broke with a longstanding Arab consensus that there should be no normalisation with Israel until it reaches a comprehensive peace deal with the Palestinians.
Earlier Monday, Khaja met Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi in Jerusalem, who wished him success in his historic mission.
Khaja told Ashkenazi he was very proud and honoured to be the first Emirati ambassador to the State of Israel.
Israel opened its UAE embassy in January, with veteran diplomat Eitan Naeh heading the Abu Dhabi mission.
Israel and the UAE have already signed treaties on direct flights and visa-free travel, along with accords on investment protection, science and technology.
On Tuesday, Khaja was scheduled to visit Yad Vashem, Israels national Holocaust memorial and education centre.(AFP)
US Congress certifies Joe Bidens election win
The US Congress, on Thursday, certified Joe Biden as the next US president, dealing a blow to Donald Trump, whose supporters stormed the Capitol hours earlier, triggering unprecedented chaos and violence in the seat of American democracy.
Lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives successfully beat back Republican efforts to deny Biden the electoral votes from swing states Arizona and Pennsylvania.
After a mob breached the US Capitol and sent lawmakers scrambling for safety, members of Congress returned shaken but undeterred to fulfill their duty in certifying Bidens 306-232 Electoral College win.
Lawmakers voted down the two challenges to Bidens victory, with several Trump loyalists reversing course in the wake of the violence that drew shock around the world.
Egged on in an extraordinary rally across town by an aggrieved Trump, a flag-waving mob broke down barricades outside the Capitol and swarmed inside, rampaging through offices and onto the usually solemn legislative floors.
Security forces fired tear gas in a four-hour operation to clear the Capitol.
Police said that one woman, reportedly a female Trump partisan from southern California, was shot and killed and that three other people died in the area in circumstances that were unclear.
Red-hot Iheanacho, Onuachu, Osimhen make Super Eagles list for Cameroon friendly
Technical Adviser of Nigerias
Senior National Football team, Gernot Rohr, has drawn up a provisional squad list of 31 players for the Super Eagles prestige international friendly game against five-time African champions Cameroon in Austria on Friday, 4th June 2021.
The game will take place at the Wiener Neustadt in the Austrian capital, Vienna starting from 8.30 pm Austria time.
The duo of Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City, England), Victor Osimhen (Napoli, Italy) and Paul Onuachu (KRC Genk, Belgium), who are in top form for their respective clubs, top the list unveiled on Friday which also has Captain Ahmed Musa.
Other top players in the list are deputy captain William Ekong, goalkeeper Maduka Okoye, defenders Kenneth Omeruo and Chidozie Awaziem, midfielders Wilfred Ndidi and Oghenekaro Etebo and forward Samuel Chukwueze.
Super Eagles youngsters, Victor Osimhen (L) and Samuel Chukuweze celebrate after winning bronze at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt.
Portugal-based Abraham Marcus is called for the first time and Enyimba FCs energetic forward Anayo Iwuala, whose tenacity and drive has helped the Peoples Elephant to the quarter-finals of the CAF Confederation Cup, has an opportunity to fight for a place and continue on his international footprints, following cameo appearances against the Benin Republic and Lesotho in AFCON qualifiers in March.
The provisional list of 31 will be whittled down to 23 before the Super Eagles fly to Vienna for the clash with perennial rivals Indomitable Lions.
Cameroon wrestled down the Eagles for three of their five AFCON titles (1984, 1988, 2000) but have not beaten Nigeria in regulation time since a 1-0 triumph in a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at the Stade Omnisports in Yaounde on 27th August 1989.
The Eagles lashed the Lions 4-0 in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Uyo in September 2017 and were forced to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture in Yaounde, setting the stage for Nigerias qualification for the finals in Russia.

Drawing Nigeria back from the brinks
The worsening security challenges in the country seem to be getting out of hand.
Many who have so far commented on the issue have painted pictures of hopelessness.
To say the least, it has reached a point of despair and as human beings, Nigerians are beginning to doubt if we can survive it and live together once again in a peaceful society.
Prominent personalities in the country seem to have given up hope which has led to their conclusion that the only way out of the quagmire is for the federal government to seek foreign assistance to be able to tackle the security challenges.
The main opposition political party in the country, the PDP, had also added voice in telling the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government at the centre that Nigeria needs external help to address the festering insecurity in the country.
On his part, the immediate past President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, said President Muhammadu Buhari is overwhelmed by the security challenges, insisting that the federal government needs urgent help and must seek such without wasting time.
He also advised the president to bring together all former presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand.
The ex-senate leader further called on the National Assembly to be more assertive in finding solutions to this issue of insecurity adding that the legislature would not be helping the Buhari administration if they did not become more insistent and decisive in their approach to getting the security crisis tackled immediately.
The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said that Nigeria needs unity to surmount the current security challenges, observing that every nation will go through difficult times and we must unite to succeed.
He added that no president wants a country in chaos, noting that only a concerted and united response will end the numerous security challenges.
The best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people.
The welfare of our people is extremely important.
And yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times.
How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear; those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country, he explained.
The truth, however, is that the situation is not yet too bad as is being projected by many stakeholders.
All hopes are not yet lost.
This is not to say that they are not right in their observations and recommendations.
The situation can be salvaged through collaboration with all stakeholders especially the traditional rulers, religious leaders, synergy among security agencies and the ability of the federal government to provide a level-playing field devoid of ethnic, religious or political interests.
Time has come when the role of traditional rulers in peace keeping must be recognised at all levels.
They are the custodians of the peoples culture and to some extent, their religion.
Traditional rulers, because of their closeness to the people, can play a great role in solving the security challenges if properly mobilised and engaged at local government, state and federal levels.
If the traditional rulers at various localities across the country are fully engaged, they can be the major source of information to the security agencies in terms of identifying any criminal elements lurking around their domains because they know who is who in those areas.
There is also the need for security agencies to work together in the fight against insecurity in the land.
There must be a uniting force among them so that at any point one agency must not be away from what the other is doing to avoid not only duplication of duty but also to be on the alert based on information passed across various formations.
The ugly incident that took place in Maiduguri some days ago where a fighter jet belonging to Nigerian Air Force bombed soldiers going to repel Boko Haram attack is a clear indication of lack of proper information and coordination among the two agencies.
All the relevant agencies at the theater of war must be up and doing in information gathering and sharing among themselves to know when, where and how to strike when the enemy approaches or at most to, through such information, nip in the bud plans of such an enemy and prevent them from approaching not to talk of striking.
Religious leaders through their various organisations such as Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, among others, must also be engaged and enlightened on what to preach to their followers and how to monitor their activities.
These men of God are respected by their followers to the extent that whatever they preach is always swallowed hook and sinker whether such utterances would cause chaos or not.
They should be properly mobilised and sensitised on the dangers of wrong preaching that could pitch the various religious sects against each other.
Examples abound where crises have erupted from worship centres due to what the leaders must have told their followers to do, either to retaliate one perceived injustice or the other.
With proper sensitisation, such would not happen because they must have been educated on what to preach and what not to preach while with their followers.
It is pertinent to state here, however, that all these would come to nothing if government at all levels fail to provide a level-playing field for peace to reign.
Governments at all levels must strive to provide basic amenities that could engage the youths and take their minds away from crime.
In trying to solve the security challenges, governments must always ensure that they do not take sides based on ethnic, religious or political differences when addressing issues of security breaches.
Perpetrators of crime must be treated equally according to laws of the land no matter who is involved.
A clear example of treating some criminals with kid gloves is the purported arrest of some operators of Bureau De Change in Kano that are allegedly sponsoring activities of Boko Haram insurgents.
Up till now, their identities have not been revealed which has had a negative effect on the fight against insurgency.
Government must ensure that they are always in touch with the people especially at the grassroots level for them to know what it is doing about the present situation in the country in order not to allow rumours to thrive.
With these, Nigeria will surely surmount the security challenge that has bedevilled her for over a decade now with much ease.

Officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) have intercepted a container bearing 4,996,200 capsules of Tramadol weighing 2,498.2 kg at Onne Port, Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
In separate statements spokesperson of NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, and that of NCSs
Area II Command, Onne Port, Mrs Ifeoma Ojukwu, said the consignment was intercepted on Tuesday.
The illicit drug was packaged in 1,387 cartons and concealed in 1,000 cartons of ceramic tiles.
Ojukwu said that the seizure was made possible with help from international partners.
Meanwhile, the NDLEA said a 42-year-old Muntari Hamidu was arrested in Nyibango, Jimeta, Yola, Adamawa State, with 13 sacks of cannabis sativa weighing 166kg.
This is just as 35-year-old Sani Musa was nabbed with16.1kg of skunk at Ngurore, Yola South LGA of the state.
Babafemi said that both were arrested on Sunday, 16 May, 2021.
According to him, on the same day, a team of NDLEA operatives from Ondo State Command also arrested one James Godspower with 36.5kg of cannabis sativa in Faloye, Ogbese, Akure North LGA of Ondo State.
Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NDLEA, Brig-Gen.

IPOB: Residents shun sit-at-home order in Ebonyi
Residents in Ebonyi State, on Saturday, shunned the sit-at-home order proposed by the supreme leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (lPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.
Daily Trust gathered that markets, hotels, Abakiliki Rice mill, motor parks and shops opened for business on Saturday.
Taxi, Tricycle and motorcycles were also operational.
Our correspondent, who went round the Abakiliki metropolis and its environs, also observed that security agencies patrol some major roads in the city on Saturday.
Kanu had, on Thursday, cautioned people of the Southeast against flouting the May 29 sit-at-home order.
Although there is still panic owing to rumour that the exercise was shifted to hold on Monday.
IPOB had said: We, the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), ably led by the prophet of our time, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to announce once again, that this years annual Biafra Remembrance Day and candlelight procession will take place on Sunday night 30th of May, while a sit-at-home and total lockdown takes place on Monday, 31st May, 2021, and not May 30th as earlier announced.
Tottenhams top-four hopes in danger after Leeds defeat
Leeds beat managerless Tottenham 3-1 on Saturday to put a huge dent in their ambitions of securing a coveted Premier League top-four spot.
Son Heung-min cancelled out Stuart Dallass early goal for Leeds midway the first half but Patrick Bamford restored the home sides lead and substitute Rodrigo struck late on.
Spurs, who sacked Jose Mourinho last month, remain eight points behind third-placed Chelsea but now have just three games left – one fewer than their London rivals.
It means Tottenham, beaten Champions League finalists in 2019, are almost certain to miss out on playing in Europes
elite club competition for a second consecutive season.
They even face a fight to qualify for the Europa League after their first league defeat under interim boss Ryan Mason.
Leeds know what theyre doing, they play a certain way and it took us a while to get into the game, Mason told BT Sport.
In the second half, we were the better team.
The moments we had, you have to take them in these games.
Today was a massive game for us, to lose it hurts.
Its difficult to win in the Premier League
but weve got to have our full attention on next week now.
Big six Leeds, who climbed above Arsenal into ninth place, produced another scintillating display against one of the Premier Leagues big six.
Marcelo Bielsas side, promoted last season, started brightly and took an early lead when Dallas smashed home in the 13th minute.
Jack Harrison fizzed the ball across the box from the left and Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris did well to save Sergio Reguilon from scoring an own goal.
But he could do nothing to prevent Dallas from smashing home from close range at the back post.
Tottenham hit back to equalise with their first shot on target on the counter-attack in the 25th minute.
Dele Allis clever through-ball carved Leeds open and Son raced clear to side-foot home.
Harry Kane thought he had given the visitors the lead when he dinked home after combining brilliantly with Alli and Son but his cool finish was ruled out after VAR confirmed he had been marginally offside.
Leeds regained the lead in the 42nd minute as Bamford finished from close range for his 15th Premier League goal of the season following Ezgjan Alioskis cut-back.
Kane had another effort ruled out for offside early in the second half as Spurs pushed for an equaliser and then rattled the bar from a free-kick with less than 20 minutes to go.
But it was Leeds who struck again to seal the three points, with Rodrigo finishing after a cross from fellow substitute Raphinha with just six minutes left.
Leeds are the first side to remain unbeaten at home in a Premier League season against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs since West Ham in 2015/16.
The Africa we strive for is possible in unity and solidarity
By Mevlüt Çavusoglu
I would like congratulate all our African friends on May 25 in commemoration of the Africa Day wholeheartedly.
We remember with appreciation the African countries coming together under the roof of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), later African Union (AU), on May 25, 1963, predicating on independence and freedom, and displaying a common consciousness based on solidarity and unity.
The success story reached in the following decades in this spirit and understanding gives us hope for a bright future of the continent.
Without a colonial past and having attained its full independence with its struggle against the occupation forces during the War of Independence, Turkey is one of the countries that best grasps the meaning of this day.
We are happy to share today this common joy, conscious of the importance of remembering the struggle for independence by the peoples of Africa for freedom, equality and justice, and evoking the founding goals of the AU.
Our approach to African countries completely matches the founding principles of the AU and is built on a holistic, inclusive, equal partnership on the basis of mutual respect and win-win strategy.
We share the spirit of 1963 and the vision of Africa and attach great importance to Agenda 2063 and UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In our concerted journey, which gained momentum with our observer membership status to the AU in 2005, we have covered plenty of ground with the First Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit that we hosted in Istanbul, and by being declared a strategic partner of the union in 2008.
After the Second Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit held in Malabo in 2014, our ties with African countries have become stronger.
We hope to host the third summit in our country in September, which we believe will offer opportunities for a strong and comprehensive cooperation between Turkey and Africa.
We continue to contribute to peace and stability and economic and social development in Africa through our public institutions, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the private sector.
Our Africa Initiative and Africa Partnership policies, considered among the most successful initiatives of our foreign policy, constitute an added value to our relations with the continent.
We can see this constructive effect in many areas such as trade, investment, culture, security, military cooperation and development, and especially in our intensifying and developing political relations with Africa in the last decade.
We are pleased to observe that African countries also attach importance to strengthening cooperation with our country.
We continue to integrate Turkey and Africa in all areas.
While the number of our diplomatic missions in the continent was only 12 in 2002, we increased this number to 43, with our embassy opened in Togo last month.
African countries also increased the number of their embassies in Ankara from 10 in 2008 to 37.
Turkey, which is the fifth country in the world in terms of the number of diplomatic missions, continues to bring the issues of Africa to the agenda at the global level with its wide diplomacy network, and also continues to cooperate with African countries in regional and international platforms.
We continue to develop our commercial and economic relations with a win-win approach.
Despite pandemic conditions, we managed to keep our trade volume close to the previous years data
The total value of our direct investments in Africa has exceeded $6bn.
Our Turkish contractors contribute to Africas development by undertaking more than 1,150 projects.
We appreciate the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA), which is considered the most important project of Agenda 2063.
We are ready to share our experiences with our African friends and provide support in this regard.
Development and humanitarian aid of Turkey continues to contribute to the creation of favourable conditions for the establishment of a prosperous Africa.
The official development aid provided by our public institutions to Africa between 2005 and 2019 has reached almost $3.5bn.
In line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda commitments, our total development aid for 46 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), 33 of which are in Africa, was $8.7bn between 2009 and 2019.
We are also pleased that the sustainable development projects of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TİKA), which representation office number has reached 22 in Africa and which bilateral official development assistance for the continent exceeded $500m, are embraced throughout the continent.
The Turkish Maarif Foundation (TMF) has been providing education services to more than 14,000 students with 144 schools and 16 dormitories all over Africa.
The number of our African students who graduated with the Turkiye Scholarships programme has exceeded 15,000.
Holding the honour of being the only foreign company that flies to the highest number of destinations, including 60 cities in Africa, Turkish Airlines continues to contribute to the reunion of Africa with the rest of the world.
We did not leave our African friends alone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Within the framework of the pandemic, we provided medical equipment donations, cash donations or purchase permission assistance for the export and purchasing of medical supplies to 44 African countries.
The approximate value of relief aid material we made to the region has reached $12m, and the amount of our financial aid has reached $6m.
Turkeys endeavours for developing vaccines against COVID-19 is also continuing.
We are determined to complete our vaccine activities in autumn and offer these to the service of all humanity, especially to African countries.
The theme of Silencing the Guns: Creating Conducive Conditions for Africas Development and Intensifying the Fight Against the COVID-19 Epidemic set for Africa Day celebrations to be held online this year due to the pandemic is in harmony with Turkeys humanitarian and entrepreneurial foreign policy agenda.
Standing against all kinds of violence, advocating the resolution of disputes through dialogue, and conducting mediation activities when needed, our country strongly supports the goal of silencing the guns.
Turkey, along with its different mediation and facilitation roles undertaken across the world, is also the Co-Chair of the Group of Friends of Mediation established under the UN, the OSCE and the OIC.
We believe that our joint effort with the AU, which is a member of the friends group in UN, will contribute to security and stability in Africa.
With its innovative steps, Turkey shapes not only the diplomacy of today, but also that of the future.
In 2019, we announced the Digital Diplomacy initiative by taking advantage of the transformative power of technology.
We believe Africas recent focus on digitalisation for sustainable development is spot-on.
Within this context, we have observed with pleasure that digital transformation is recommended to achieve Agenda 2063 targets and to ensure sustainable economic recovery in the Africas Development Dynamics:
Digital Transformation for Quality Jobs report published by the AU this year despite COVID-19.
We are ready to work with our African friends in the field of digital transformation.
We will continue to be in unity and solidarity with African countries and the AU with the strength and inspiration we derive from our centuries-old historical, cultural and human relations with Africa.
I avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate Africans on this day with heartfelt feelings.

Blackmail counterproductive to development, economic growth — Gov Emmanuel
Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, has urged the people to shun blackmail as such vices is inimical and counterproductive to economic growth and development with huge undesirable consequences.
The Governor gave this charge when he led top government functionaries to a special Inter-Denominational Thanksgiving Service to mark the 6th anniversary of his administration on Sunday at Believers Assembly of Nigeria, Uyo.
Governor Emmanuel who reflected on the mercies of God which he acknowledged gave him wisdom to lead the state through a turbulent economic time occasioned by the outbreak of Covid-19, appreciated the support of Akwa Ibom people, and described them as partners in the success story of the state.
We are standing here to give God all the glory, the psalmists will tell you, O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good for His Mercies endureth forever.
We are thanking God for extremely tough six years economically, weve been challenged on all sides but we are not depressed.
So we want to give God thanks for those six challenging years God has led us, he has helped us to keep faith, he stated.
He assured the people of delivering on all his promises, pointing out that his commitment to the development of the state remains absolute as he will continue to serve passionately and diligently.
I want to assure my people that we will continue to serve God through all of you and please we need everyones cooperation just to pray with us
let God take us to where we are going.
Let me sound a bit of warning, stop castigating the Governor that he has built an International Worship Center, you dont understand what I am doing, I am raising an altar that will negate every other speaking.
I am raising an altar that will take us to where we are going to, he stated.
Speaking earlier on Saturday, in a state broadcast to mark his 6th anniversary, the Governor listed the many positive impact his economic and industrialization policy has had on the economy of the state, reiterating the determination of his administration to fulfill his campaign promises to the people with more vigour and determination, noting that he is in a hurry to industrialize and change the narratives of the state from being a purely civil service State to an industrialized entity.
Giving a sectoral breakdown of his achievements in office, the Governor said in the agricultural sector, he has kept his promise to ensure that the state produce enough food at affordable prices to feed the people.
He recalled that his inauguration of the Technical Committee on Agriculture and Food Sufficiency have borne incredible fruits.
Our staple food items such as garri, rice, yam etc are produced mostly by our people here.
From the rice mill in Ini Local Government Area, to the numerous garri processing mills scattered all over the three senatorial districts, to our low interest loans given to farmers, to the cassava plantation through the FADAMA 3 scheme, we are working to ensure that our people have enough food to eat at quite affordable prices
Our investments in this critical sector goes beyond making food available for all, we are also leveraging in on our comparative advantage in agriculture through the establishment of a fully functional Directorate of Agriculture and Agro-Allied Investments, he stated.
In the health sector, the Governor noted with delight that when he came in, most of the general hospitals were derelict as patients and hospital staff were battling snakes and other reptiles every day.
He stated that his administration has equipped the Ibom Specialist Hospital with the most modern medical facilities compete with an ICU and these huge investments came in handy during the challenging months of the Covid-19 pandemic as the highly trained medical professionals performed exceedingly well to stem the spread of the deadly virus.
Listing the achievements of his industrialization policy, Governor Emmanuel said, through the efforts of the Technical Committee on Foreign Direct Investments, he has attracted over twenty economically viable and employment – generating Industries to the state including the Coconut Virgin Oil Refinery, a digitalized flour mill which produces the flour we need for our confectioneries industry, the Metering company, the commencement of the Liberty Oil and Gas Free Zone, the Ground breaking ceremony for the construction of Sterling petrochemicals and Fertilizer production factory, the $1.4 billion Ammonia and Fertilizer plant, and Ibom Air which he noted has become a national sensation.
Explainer: What you should know about cattle-ranching
With the incessant attacks between farmers and herders, state governments, mostly in the South, have resolved to ban open grazing and adopt ranching as an alternative to the age-long practice of herders roaming with their cattle to seek pasture for their herd.
As the call for the adoption of ranching grows, herders, who are mostly drawn from the Fulani ethnic group, have expressed lack of knowledge on how the new system would work for them.
This is evident in a statement made by the Sarkin Fulani of Iwo in Osun State, Alhaji Momodu Adamu, during a summit in which he stated that most Fulani are unaware of what ranching means.
Ranching is strange to us.
We are willing to learn.
We want the government to teach us about it.
We will continue to live in peace.
What is ranching
The National Geographic said ranching involves rearing livestock, especially cattle, on a vast area of land.
This activity, which is business oriented, enable livestock to graze in a controlled land for pastures, fodders and water provided for consumption through purchase of hays and growing of pasture.
The practice is not a sedentary mode of grazing since the spacious land allows herders to walk around with their herd to consume grown fodder in a confined area.
However, growing fodder in the grazing area might not be sustainable as lack of rainfall or water to grow it would result in shortage.
Overgrazing is another factor making it unsustainable.
The concentration of livestock in an area, as ranching offers, reduces the proclivity of fat reduction among cattle as well as contributes to the livestock subsector.
National Geographic notes that Ranching is an efficient way to raise livestock to provide meat, dairy products, and raw materials for fabrics.
It is a vital part of economies and rural development around the world.
But the livestock industry has effects on the environment through contributing to air and water pollution.
Harmful products from ranches can include manure, antibiotics and hormones given to the animals, as well as fertilizers and pesticides.
Similarly, chemicals from tanneries that treat animal hides can also seep into water.
Facilities
In an article, Encyclopedia Britannica states that barns, which serve as shelters, are the most important elements in a ranch.
This facility is enclosed thus wouldnt be suitable for a nomadic herder who has developed a strong relation with his herd.
As such, a pen would be more suitable to keep a close eye on them.
Other facilities are a milk parlour, mowers, tractors, hay barns, water irrigation system and a stall barn for the animals to rest, feed, milk and watered.
With electricity not reliable, components of solar can be a feature in ranches in Nigeria.
Ranching and the National Livestock Transformation Plan
A human rights lawyer Femi Falana said that ranching is not a new development in Nigeria with the first ranch in Nigeria established in Cross River State at Obudu in 1951 by the British, but was taken over by Eastern Regional Government after independence.
He added that the Awolowo regime had a ranch in Akunnu, now Ondo State with Ahmadu Bello establishing one in Mokwa, Niger State.
During Yakubu Gowons regime, Audu Bako had the best ranches in the country in Kano.
Also, there are grazing reserves which are domiciled on bigger lands that house many herders and their families in some parts of the north.
With the ranches no longer functioning, the federal government in 2018 introduced the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP).
The plan which was piloted in Adamawa in 2019 had the backing of the National Economic Council composed of the governors of the 36 States governors and chaired by the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo.
The NLTP is a N100 billion 10-year initiative (2019-2027) that would ensure Economic growth and avert the farmers/herders crises.
The plan will see to the creation of four ranch sizes housing 30, 60, 150 and 300 cows with feeding facilities, watering facilities, a market and a breeder ranch for a minimum of 1,000 cattle.
Osinbajo in a speech during the launch of the programme said the ranches would propel integrated business centre for commercial crop production, the supply of livestock materials and facilitation of improved access to basic services for herders.
According to him, participating states will provide the land as its own contribution to the project.
The Federal government merely supports the project.
It is a plan that hopes to birth tailor-made ranches where cattle are bred, and meat and dairy products are produced using modern livestock methods.
During his presentation, he delinked the NLTP from the controversial cattle ranching colony, RUGA, which was perceived in some quarters as a land-grabbing project by the federal government to house herders and their families in a particular area.
2023: Disquiet in Kwara APC over governors sister
The protracted leadership crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took a new twist following calls for the removal of Senator Khairat Gwadabe, a sister to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from the Membership Registration Appeal Panel set up by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee by some aggrieved founding members the party in the state.
The call for Khairats removal is coming on the heels of the fierce struggle for the control of the soul of the party in the state between the governor and some aggrieved leaders over the second term ticket for 2023 as the next electioneering campaign beckons.
The governor and some notable leaders in the party have been at loggerheads since the administration came into power in 2019 in the state over disagreement in his style of leadership.
But despite some spirited efforts to bring everybody on the same page, according to insiders in the party, the issue appears to have festered, with the latest imbroglio having the potential to consume the party in the race for the top seat come 2023 if the needful is not done by uniting all the forces that collectively defeated the last Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in the state, led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki.
For many members of the aggrieved group, which has the support of top party leaders like the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his counterpart for transport (state), Gbemisola Saraki, under the factional caretaker chairman, Hon Bashiru Omolaja Bolarinwa (BOB), Khairats inclusion in the membership of the committee was part of a grand plan by the governor to hijack the party machinery in the state in the build-up to the 2023 elections.
Some of the top leaders and party supporters in the state, who said they had been disenfranchised from the registration/revalidation process, pointed accusing fingers at the former senator, who they accused of working with the Senator John Danbois committee which headed the last exercise in the state to disenfranchise leaders and members believed to be against the governor.
Her membership status of the committee, they argued, was to finish the work she started in the state at the national level to remove any obstacle against the second term ticket of the governor and pave the way for his smooth emergence as the partys candidate in the next gubernatorial election.
In one of the press releases that have since trailed the issue, a faction of the APC in the state believed to be loyal to the camp of Lai Mohammed and other aggrieved leaders, openly rejected the inclusion of Senator Gwadabe in the 61-member committee.
The group, known as Integrity Group, in a statement signed by Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello, declared the appointment as unacceptable.
According to the group, Here was a governors sister who worked in tandem with the Danboi committee to commit all sorts of atrocities and impunities against the partys interest in Kwara State.
Their call was echoed by another group believed to be fronting for the minister, Concerned APC Youth Stakeholders, which petitioned the national secretariat of the party as run by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) over the issue, alleging the over 600,000 of its members have been disenfranchised with the connivance of Senator Khairat.
But shortly after their positions were made known, the governors men and foot soldiers also went to town with their trumpet to drum support for the governor and his sister over the matter.
It was the publicity secretary of the party, Alhaji Folaranmi Aro, a staunch loyalist of the governor that fired the first salvo thus, Those against the senators inclusion have no basis.
Under the aegis of the Reformist Progressive Forum, the group that supports the governor, in a rejoinder to the statement by the Integrity Group, noted that Senator Gwadabes rejection by the group of political puppets in Kwara is baseless and unfounded.
This is unreasonable, illogical and destructive criticism.
When contacted for comment, Saheed Popoola, a loyalist of the minister and lawmaker in the Kwara State House of Assembly from Offa, told Daily Trust Saturday that he was not in town.
But a top member of the party and diehard supporter of the minister from Kwara Central said although Alhaji Lai Mohammed and few others registered despite condemnation of the exercise, the action was in demonstration and solidarity with prominent national leaders of the party like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who did but still faulted the process, calling for improvement.
But on the issue of how this might affect the partys chances in 2023, the top party official said, There is still a long way to go, and many considerations may be laid on the table before then.
Our workings now are first to get the sham which the last exercise clearly was upturned and get the national leadership to approve the conduct of a fresh exercise in the state.
For Kunle Suleiman, a lawyer and pioneer chairman of the PDP in the state and an unrepentant apologist of the governor, what is happening is politics and the party will rise above it when the time comes.
He, however, said their concern was how to deliver good governance, which the governor promised.
However, a member of the AA group and supporter of the governor in Ilorin west told Daily Trust Saturday that those aggrieved party members kicking against the inclusion of Senator Khairat were jesters.
He added that the party had since moved on from that exercise.
For Gods sake, those who are complaining dont know what they are doing and saying.
Khairat is a member of the APC and can be made a member of any committee based on her contributions and recognition in the party.
She is entitled to it.
If she is a sister to the governor, should that deny her right?
In politics, and where you have factions, this type of thing happens.
Somebody that is not given something always complains; and those complaining now belong to BOB and Lais group.
They thought they could control the registration exercise and party politics but now realised that it has suddenly moved out of their hands.
They are complaining because they lost in the partys power game for now, he added.
He, however, said the party would get its acts together in the remaining two years, adding, We came to the APC in factions.
These same people that are saying the governor will not get the ticket also said so during his first term and did not vote for him, yet he got it; and he will get it again.
It is about strategy and getting your politics right.
We are not afraid.
Also, the issue of the governors kind of politics has been at the centre of the present disagreement, with notable figures like Professor Abdulraheem Shuaib Oba and Akogun Iyiola Oyedepo describing him as a featherweight politician that could be easily discarded in 2023.
In the view of some political watchers, what has played out in the way the governor has dealt with Lais group and how he handled the registration exercise only indicate how things could get complicated in the struggle to control the party ahead of 2023.
Vandals cut off section of Warri-Itapke rail line
Vandals have cut several sections on the Itapke-Warri rail line.
In a viral video, the vandals, still unknown, used what appears to be a saw to slice through the rail line to a point where the pieces could be taken thereby exposing passengers to danger.
The incident, our correspondent gathered, happened along the Warri-Itakpe standard gauge line around KM 30 Adogo, Kogi State section of the rail.
The managing director/CEO, the Nigerian Railway Corporation, Engr.
Fidet Okhiria, confirmed the incident to our correspondent.
He, however, said the train is still being operated as there is an alternative.
The incident happened two days ago.
But we are still in operation because we have an alternative, he said.
Pillars battle Nasarawa Utd in top of the table clash
Kano Pillars will square up with perennial rivals, Nasarawa United this afternoon in the Nigeria Professional Football League week 23 top of the table clash at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium Kaduna.
However, in case of a draw, the winner in the other fixture between Kwara United and Rivers United in Ilorin will go to the top of the table.
While Pillars are on 41 points, Kwara United, Nasarawa United and Rivers United are on 39 points each with a chance of going to the top.
Therefore, if the two matches in Kaduna and Ilorin end in draw, Pillars will assume leadership again pending the outcome of tomorrows match between Abia Warriors and Akwa United in Okigwe.
Although Pillars will be motivated by Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa and their influential captain Rabiu Ali, they must be wary of Nasarawa United who ended their 12-year unbeaten home record with a 2-1 victory in 2015.
In todays match, Pillars will have to put an eye on Adamu Hassan who left them under unpleasant circumstances in 2020 to rejoin his home club and has been consistent in scoring against them.
It will also be recalled that the experienced striker scored a brace against Pillars when Nasarawa United trounced them 5-0 in a friendly match last year.
And when they met in the first round of the ongoing season in Lafia, it was the same player who denied Pillars victory when he scored the equaliser in the 1-1 draw.
Hassan is, therefore, confident he will score against his former club as he told Daily Trust yesterday that he normally scores anytime he plays against Pillars.
I know they must have mapped out their plan against me but it has been hard for them to stop me.
They think they know me
but I keep scoring against them.
Tomorrows (today) match is not going to be an exception.
I know by the grace of almighty Allah, I will score again, he said.
In other week 23 matches billed for today, Adamawa United will host Katsina United in Gombe, FC IfeanyiUbah visit Dakkada in Uyo, Lobi Stars will move from Lagos where they lost 0-1 against MFM to play Wolves in Ozoro, MFM will attempt to dim Sunshine Stars in Akure while embattled Wikki Tourists battle Enyimba in Bauchi.
Power: Nigerians spend $21bn on generators — Reps
The House of Representatives has said the manufacturing sector lost $200 billion while other Nigerians spent $21 billion on generators between 2015 and 2021 on self-generated electricity due to poor electricity supply from the national grid.
The House also called on the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to suspend the proposed increase in electricity tariff.
According to Aniekan Umanah who moved the motion at the plenary on Thursday, NERC, working with Distribution Companies (DisCos), increased electricity tariff five times since 2015, the latest being on January1, 2021.
According to him, despite the increases, Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation, but grapple with epileptic supply and poor services from the DisCos.
Poor services by the DisCos have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200bn to inadequate power supply while a whopping $21bn was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generating sets within the period under review.
The House, therefore, urged the federal government to direct NERC to rescind the decision to further increase electricity tariff proposed for June, 202l, in view of the hard times Nigerian masses were going through.
The house mandated the committees on power, poverty alleviation and labour, employment and productivity to ensure compliance.
Border reopening discourages hoarding in Katsina markets
The reopening of four land borders by the Federal Government last week has significantly slowed down hoarding activities in Katsina markets, Daily Trust can report.
Prior to the announcement, grain merchants and other businessmen hid under the guise of company agents to buy farm produce in bulk and store to maximise profit in the near future.
According to dealers, despite the restriction on the importation of rice and other food items, merchants were still skeptical to stockpile farm produce as government might change its decision anytime, depending on the circumstance on ground.
Alhaji Aminu Hussain, a sorghum merchant, said hoarding of farm produce was not a new business in the markets, but the practice seriously increased with the new agricultural policy of this administration and border closure.
Many of us made huge profits on farm produce last year, that is why our people came out early in this harvest period, mopping up the produce; but the recent reopening of land borders has slowed us down.
The fear among us now is that market price of food items will come down.
He added that the shortfall of farm output, occasioned by incessant activities of bandits this year, had also motivated the merchants to hoard the produce.
Rice, maize and sorghum were the most targeted produce.
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, a grain dealer at Bakori market, said the announcement of border reopening last week had made an impact on the market price of major food items.
Unlike last year when, by this time, maize was between N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum was N7,000, they are now sold at N14,000 and N13,000 respectively.
The recent announcement of border reopening has crashed down the price of paddy rice from N14,000 to N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 to N13,000 and maize from N15,500 to N14,000.
Tarzana added that most merchants withdrew from bulk purchase of the produce after the announcement, expecting that waivers for the importation of food items would follow anytime soon.
Our correspondent observed that there are mixed reactions to the land border opening.
Majority of the farmers and merchants prefer the borders to be closed so that they would continue to exploit the numerous value chains of our local agricultural produce.
Consumers, on the other hand, welcomed the recent development, in anticipation that government would allow importation of rice and other food items.
But their expectation was shattered by governments reiteration that rice, poultry, cooking oil and other food items remained banned from importation.
Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, an agric expert, enjoined the Federal Government not to bow to pressure and give waivers for food importation.
Government has invested a lot in the agricultural sector and we should not allow such huge investment to go down the drain by wavering food importation in this country.
It is true that there is palpable fear of food crisis, but we can mitigate that through irrigation farming.
Besides, food importation will only worsen the already economic recession the country is battling with, Muazu said.
He added that farmers would be seriously affected if government reversed its policy on food sufficiency.
Why flood-resistant rice is crucial to farmers
The threat to food security in Nigeria as a result of flood will soon be an issue of the past following the release of the FARO 66, a variety of rice that is resistant to flood.
FARO 66, recently released to rice farming communities by the National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), is a variety that has characteristics and traits that are different from what local farmers are used to.
This variety is taller than other ones known to the farmers.
With its height, coupled with effective ecological farming management, it is capable of withstanding the stress of flood to a larger extent.
Acceptability of new varieties among farmers has always been a huge challenge, and the introduction of the FARO 66 is no exception.
However, when fully embraced by the farmers, the threat to food security in terms of rice production would be reduced.
During this years Field Day, organised by the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi State, farmers and other stakeholders were introduced to the new variety after a field trip to the institutes demonstration farm in the metropolis.
At the demonstration farm, farmers were exposed to FARO 66, which withstood the stress of the recent flood, side by side with the farm of other rice varieties that were washed away by the same flood.
The two farms, which are situated side by side, revealed the flood disaster tolerant capability of the FARO 66 variety, as despite all stress, it grew to maturity.
On the farm of the other rice variety, only the remnants of the rice plant could be seen.
Speaking to our correspondent, the head of the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, said the FARO 66 variety could best resist flood if planted early.
He added that with its hard stem and height, if planted early, the variety could grow to a size that when flood sets in, the plant could resist the condition.
He said FARO 66 was released two years ago, but acceptability, as is the case with any new variety, must be gradual, noting that when it becomes widely accepted among farmers, flooding would not be a threat to rice farming any more.
According to him, to sensitise the farmers as research on the improved variety progressed, they were carried along to appreciate the processes and results recorded.
He added that the scientists on the research work were optimistic that if farmers were allowed to appreciate the ability of the plant to withstand flood, acceptance of the new variety among them would not only be fast but also effective.
Shema, who said lack of sufficient funding had been their major constraint in the research work, called on all stakeholders to invest in the initiative for a better tomorrow as research is not only limited to the development of improved varieties but also created jobs, as well as developed the economy of a nation.
He explained that public lectures were also conducted as part of the day one Field Day activities, saying the essence of introducing public lectures in this years activities is to bring to the notice of stakeholders that research only comes to fruition with sufficient funding
He appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to inject enough into research.
The day two was on exhibition and application of technology in farming.
When we said flood-tolerant, we are not saying it will not be affected by flood completely.
What we are saying is that with its characteristics and desirable trends, it would withstand flood stress to some extent.
FARO 66 is tolerant to flood because it is taller than FARO 44 and FARO 52.
Its stem is also harder than the other varieties.
Ecological management in term of timing for planting is key in resisting flood.
Early planting saves a larger proportion of the crop when flood sets in.
The moment rain starts, farmers dont need to waste time.
They should immediately mobilise for planting.
This enables the crop to have good vigour and be established well before the flood comes, he stated.
Chelsea and Leicester charged over players clash
Chelsea and Leicester City have been charged by the Football Association (FA) following a stoppage-time clash between players and staff from both teams during their Premier League game on Tuesday, the governing body said on Thursday.
Three days after Leicester beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley, the sides met again at Stamford Bridge in a match key to their hopes of finishing in the top four.
It is alleged that both clubs failed to ensure their players and /or club officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative behaviour during the 93rd minute, the FA said.
Para-athletics team charged to be worthy ambassadors
The Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare has charged the Nigerian Para-athletics team to Nowil, Switzerland to be worthy ambassadors of the country as they seek to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.
The Minister gave the charge on Sunday when he bade farewell to the team for the Qualifiers at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.
He said, Nigeria is solidly behind your bid for qualification for the Para- Athletics event in Notwil, Switzerland.
In addition, he commended the special athletes as he said There is no doubt about your abilities which you have always proved over the years.
You must be worthy ambassadors of our dear country by conducting yourselves very well to attain the best standards for Qualifiers.
Dont be distracted.
Nigerians are solidly behind you.
You have always made us proud and we are confident that you will not disappoint this time by reaching the qualification threshold.
We have done our bit, now the ball is in your court to ensure that Nigerias flag flies high.
10 Athletes will be seeking to qualify in the para-athletics event taking place from 11th -17th
May 2021 at Notwil in Switzerland.
Sasakawa moves to cushion COVID-19 effects on farmers
Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000) said it had initiated a process through which farmers are linked with commodity buyers as a way of cushioning the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This was disclosed by the organisations research and training officer, Mr Benjamin Shamaki, during a media field tour they organised.
According to him, Sasakawa has trained farmers in Kano and Gombe states on effective utilisation of the aggregator facilities, as well as linking farmer associations with prospective buyers to ensure value for their produce, as well as ensure quality of what the farmers are selling during the pandemic period.
We have trained women farmer groups, not only in modern farming techniques but also on value addition to their produce.
We have encouraged them in the formation of associations, through which we successfully linked them up with buyers of their produce.
They also produced along the value chain of a particular crop, he revealed.
Similarly, the chairman of Bagwai Farmers Association, Malam Danladi Yahaya Bagwai, said farmers in the area were ready to make good use of the aggregator facilities provided for their agricultural sustainability by SG 2000, adding that they would ensure proper utilisation of the aggregator facilities.
According to him the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed negatively affected farming activities in various states of the federation, including Kano.
He added that without Sasakawas intervention, farmers in the area would have been out of business for long.
He further revealed that during the pandemic, farmers in the area were assisted with improved seed varieties, fertilizer and pesticides, which he said had helped them tremendously during the period.
The chairman also stated that the introduction of an aggregator facility, which serves as service providers to eliminate some of the marketing effort issues in the area, had helped farmers to store and access their produce with ease, as well as sell with high market value.
He said the aggregator facility had enabled farmers to collectively put their produce together in one centre and Sasakawa would connect them with mega companies that would buy the produce with value and in good market value.
It has been on record that farmers in this area have been producing, but due to lack of proper marketing strategies, they usually ended up getting virtually small value of no value for their produce.
Sasakawa has established for us an effective aggregator centre, and it has equally provided us with the knowledge on how to effectively utilise this facility to increase our products market value.
No doubt our initial inability to put into practice a proper marketing strategy that will ensure effective gain in sale of our produce in the open market has negatively affected our productivity, he said.
Similarly, according to the Sarkin Noma of Bagwai, Alhaji Bello Gurdo, in the irrigation site of Kano State, COVID-19 and its aftermath has made things harder for farmers.
He said the site, which is 1,562 hectares of land, had hundreds of farmers, both male and female working on it.
He added that the intervention received from SG 2000 had assisted the farmers to remain afloat during the period.
Blast heard in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia – report
An explosion was heard in the Saudi Arabia capital, Riyadh on Tuesday, according to a Reuters correspondent, but the cause of the explosion is yet to be ascertained.
Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV cited local reports of an explosion and videos circulating on social media of a missile being intercepted over Riyadh.
On Saturday, the Saudi-led military coalition engaged in Yemen had said it had intercepted and destroyed an enemy air target launched towards Riyadh.
Poverty of governance and illegal weapons in circulation by Adefolarin A. Olamilekan
Governance in Nigeria in recent times especially since the return of civil rule in 1999 increasingly attracts significant attention.
The attraction is a sad tale of incessant governance failure to address the insecurity situation all over the country.
There is a sense in which the current situation makes a case for a wider understanding and recognition of governance, especially with millions of illegal weapon circulation in Nigeria.
The nation is not in a palatable one, but concerns over the safety of citizens.
There is an inherent cry for help by the people for a decent existence in terms of security of life and properties.
As of today, the menace of illegal weapons in circulation in the land is a huge threat to our economic sustenance, unity and co-existence.
It is in this that we discover the nexus between governance and millions of illegal weapons in circulation being a salient matter at this point of our national life.
The current drift and drain of governance in Nigeria in the last two decades have position many Nigerians to be conscientised by the practical experience of poverty of governance.
Therefore, it is also very imperative for us to point out what governance entails in its simple sense, as well as in the context of this piece.
The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition defines governance as an activity of controlling a country or the way in which a country or institution is controlled.
Thus, governance involves a process of control and controlling activity in a country, including arms and weapons in circulation.
Again, governance can be seen as the process whereby constituted official elements wield powers, authority and enact policies concerning public life and economic decision for overall social development.
However, this governance process takes the in-depth application of suitable and influential decision that impacts on the management and distribution of resources that includes revenues, man and materials.
Moreso, it involves the regulation, implementation and enforcement of desirable policies for target objectives, goals and aspiration through capacity.
Therefore, governance is simply controlling for desirable development result of which, safeguarding life and properties of citizens is key through exact regulations of arms and weapons is vital.
However, many reasons are being advanced to explain the continued inexorable poverty of governance in Nigeria.
For instance, poor institutional capacity leads to government failure, so also is the wider inequality, access to justice and fairness that create a burden of oppression and repression.
In addition to this, is the ever-rising provocation of nepotism and bigotry, ethnic sentiment that amputate national cohesion in decision making, coupled with negligence on the part of political representatives.
The recent alarm raised by the Chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC) and former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar at a dialogue session of the committee with stakeholders at Transcorp Hilton in Abuja that over 6 million illegal weapons are currently traced to civilians, many of whom are jobless, hungry and angry.
The number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.
He went further to reveal the deplorable insecurity challenge in the country.
Informing the nation that 80,000 Nigerians have died in recent months with close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) spreading across the country all because of growing dire insecurity and illegal weapons circulation in the country.
He also added by saying that the security forces are not only overstretched but are under-funded, asserting that they can perform better with more sophisticated weapons, equipment and with accountable funding provided.
The concern raised by the former head of state and the chairman of National Peace Committee (NPC) stands a reason to take governance seriously over the carnage in the land.
Incidentally, this has shown that even those who exercise power and authority are living in fear.
It is in this context that they must pay heed to the cry of the people for help by taming the illegal weapon circulation.
Moreover, a recent report on arms proliferation in Africa tagged
Small Arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration in Nigeria highlighted that arms proliferation gave rise to armed groups and also led to the displacement of several Nigerians.
Conversely, the report stated that the proliferation of arms in Southern Nigeria has led to increasing violence in the region, such as communal clashes, cultism, kidnappings, ethnic and religious clashes, and militancy in the Niger Delta.
In the same vein, the report had it that in the Northern region, due to existing state corruption, large tracts of ungoverned spaces, and mass unemployment has been responsible for rising criminality and violence in the region.
The report opines that the aforementioned succeeded because of the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).
The situation calls to question, the feasibility of the National Task Force on Small Arms and Light Weapon.
Hence, we must chart the way forward, even though it looks blink and insurmountable.
We must rise to the occasion to tackle illegal weapon circulation in the country with the entire government structure confronting the menace headlong at federal, state and local government.
Equally, the National Task force on Small Arms and Light Weapon and office of the National Security Adviser to the President (ONSA) must re-double their efforts in the fight against illegal arms proliferation through preventive and repressive engagement.
Succinctly, appropriate people-centred governance programmes and security policies are needed to incorporate not just community policing but individuals and group policing networks of intelligence sharing.
Essentially, transparency, accountability and responsibility are the key watch of governance, without this, eliminating illegal weapons in circulation is tantamount to fruitless exercise.

Nigeria records highest start-ups among peers — Report
Nigeria has ranked highest in start-ups among other countries in Africa, a report by fDi Intelligence, a specialist division of the Financial Times, has stated.
An analysis of the report by Tolu Olasoji in the Leadership newspaper indicated that while Nigeria can boast of the largest number of start-ups in the Africa technology ecosystem, it lags in other important metrics.
The report compiled by fDi Intelligence in partnership with Briter Bridges, said investment in the continents start-up space is tiny in comparison to the global North.
For example, US start-ups raised $156.2bn in venture capital last year, per Pitchbook.
By comparison, African start-ups have raised just more than $2bn in the past two years, according to data.
Seventeen countries were selected for evaluation based on being home to several tech hubs, having more than 50 start-ups, and attracting investments greater than $500,000 between 2019 and 2020.
While South Africa ranked first place in the advancement of start-ups, Kenya came second.
But in terms of capacity, Nigeria had the highest volume of start-ups – over 750.
South Africa came second, but its start-ups raised $241m raised in 2020, compared to Nigerias
$64.1m.
The country was missing altogether in the top 10 for categories that are critical to helping a start-up thrive beyond its founding, including cost effectiveness and the level of countrywide tech talent.
It also only ranked sixth for business friendliness.
This highlights the frustrating state of conducting business in Nigeria by entrepreneurs, the analysis stated.
Father defiles underage daughters in Anambra
The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Anambra has presented a 48-year-old plumber, Thomas Igbo, for allegedly raping his three underage daughters.
The ages of the three defiled children are eight, three, and one and half years.
Mr David Bille, the commandant of the corps in the state, equally presented one Solomon Isaac for jumping into the NSCDC premises at night hours.
Bille told journalists on Thursday in Awka that some civil society personnel on May 25, reported that Igbo was defiling his three underage daughters.
When we got the report, we arrested one Thomas Igbo, a plumber, residing in Enugwu-Ukwu town in Njikoka area of the state.
Our medical personnel later conducted a test and uncovered that the children were being abused sexually.
The suspect confessed to the crime and very soon, we will conclude the investigation and arraign the suspect, Billie said.
The Confession
He said that he only had carnal knowledge of the eight-year-old daughter once and used his fingers to penetrate others at different times.
I had sex once with my eight years old daughter.
Others, I only used my fingers to penetrate their private parts when I am bathing them, he said.
Igbo, from Ikoloani Igboetiti area of Enugu State, claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol the day he slept with the daughter.
On the case of 28-year old Solomon Isaac, Billie said he was arrested for jumping in the premises of NSCDC state headquarters, Awka on May 24.
But Isaac, a native of Ejuleala Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi, claimed he was being pursued by cultists about 8 p.m. on the day he was arrested, saying I jumped into the place for safety.
Mrs Laura Ugwuanyi, the state Coordinator of the National Human Right Commission, who was at the NSCDC office during the presentation of the suspects, expressed worry over the upsurge in rape cases in the state in recent times.
She advised residents to always report such ills whenever they got to know about them as a way of fighting the menace.

Inside Buni-led committees tortuous journey of 9 months
The emergence of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordunary Convention Planning Committee on June 25, 2020 gave a huge relief to party members after a period of intense crisis in the party.
This was sequel to the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) over an alleged abuse of office.
Pundits say the party under Oshiomhole was gradually going into extinction following the crisis that engulfed the system.
The Buni-led caretaker committee was mandated by the National Executive Committee (NEC), which is the second highest decision-making organ of the party, to reconcile all aggrieved members, embark on membership drive and organise a national convention within six months.
But the committees timeline was later extended by the NEC on December 8, 2020 by another six months to enable it accomplish its mandate.
The committee, on assumption of office, commenced the process of reconciliation nationwide and recorded significant milestones in the process.
On August 23, 2020, the Buni-led committee summoned the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, to the partys national secretariat in Abuja, where they were reconciled and asked to work together for the party.
Similarly, the committee received some Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) bigwigs who jumped ship into the APC following moves by the ruling party to whittle down the structures of opposition parties ahead of the 2023 general elections.
The latest defection was recorded on Thursday when Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State dumped the PDP for the ruling party.
Ayades defection came six months after his counterpart in Ebonyi, Dave Umahi, joined the APC.
Similarly, the APC has, within the period, harvested other PDP bigwigs, including a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; former national chairman of the PDP, Chief Barnabas Gemade; a PDP senator representing Adamawa North, Elisha Abbo.
Chief Jimoh Ibrahim; a former Head of Service of the Federation, Mr Danladi Kifasi; Senator Isa Hamma Misau; Alhaji Salisu Takai; senators, members of the House of Representatives; members of state Houses of Assembly and many others also pitched tent with the ruling party.
Most of the defectors attributed their decision to pitch tent with the APC to an alleged poor handling of issues and injustice in the PDP, a claim that was refuted by the top echelon of the opposition party.
Unveiling his scorecard recently, Buni said the committee had resolved some life-threatening challenges in 11 of its state chapters, adding that reconciliation effort was still ongoing in the party.
Daily Trust
Saturday reports that the APC had not renewed its membership register since the initial registration exercise of 2014 despite the surge in its membership.
Sequel to this, the caretaker committee, during a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Aso Villa recently, got his nod to embark on nationwide membership registration and revalidation exercise which ended on March 31, 2021.
The Buni-led committee had pushed for the establishment of a tripartite committee to be saddled with the responsibility of enhancing communication and relationship between the executive, legislature and the ruling APC, with a view to ensuring smooth and effective service delivery to Niigerians.
President Buhari appointed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as the chairman of the tripartite committee.
The president had said an amicable resolution of conflicts in the party through regular consultations would create more understanding.
The Buni-led committee had also led the party to victory in the Ondo State governorship election.
Our reporter also learnt that the APC was amending its constitution to bring sanity and discipline among card-carrying members.
A source in the party said the constitution was being amended to include, among other things, a clause that would compel its elected and appointed officers to meet with people at the grassroots, at least twice a year.
Speaking at the partys secretariat in Abuja a few months ago, Buni said, Apart from the issue of membership registration, there are the outstanding issues of constitutional amendment.
This is a matter that is as important as reconstitution of leadership, if not more important.
I believe our capacity to strengthen our rules through constitutional amendment would help us to put all the problems that led to the crisis that brought us to this point behind us.
I will, therefore, invite you to take all the necessary steps to forward recommendations that will enable us to strengthen our rules.
Hurdles
Tongues are wagging over the possibility of the caretaker committee to organise an elective national convention not later than June this year.
There are twists and turns, dark clouds and anxiety as pundits are arguing that the much-touted June convention date is shaky and may hit the rocks.
Impeccable sources confided in our reporter yesterday that the APC top echelon was still battling to unite members, bury internal crisis in state chapters, reach key decisions on the issue of zoning, organise ward, local government, state and zonal congresses as a prelude to the convention.
Daily Trust
Saturday reports that the caretaker committee has not yet constituted convention sub-committees that would help in planning and executing various tasks ahead of the convention.
There is an uproar over alleged plots by some party bigwigs to extend the timeline allotted to the Buni committee and shift the partys national convention beyond June.
There are concerns that barely 40 days to the expiration of the interim committees timeline, it is not yet ready to organise the national convention and congresses to elect a new crop of leaders at various levels.
The committee also has a herculean task of putting things in proper shape and organising congresses, where new ward, local government, state and zonal executives would emerge.
This is sequel to the dissolution of the partys structures from ward to zonal levels at the NEC meeting of December 8, 2020, which was held at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.
But a statement by the secretary of the caretaker committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe few days ago in Abuja, indicated that the party was not planning to release its schedule of activities for congresses and convention any time soon.
However, there were reports in some quarters that the committee would release the timetable soon.
Reacting, Akpanudoedehe said, The CECPC is focused and is delivering its mandate to recover, rebuild and reposition the APC, as well as achieve peace-building, true reconciliation and to give a sense of belonging to every member of the party.
On Monday, May 17, 2021, the APC national secretariat resumed from Sallah break and will also resume work on several ongoing and important party activities.
As usual, we will promptly communicate the outcomes of these activities through official channels when available.
We have never lied on our activities, and we simply have no reason to.
The consultative party leadership style instituted by Governor Mai Mala Buni as chairman of the CECPC has institutionalised the APC as a party of processes and internal democracy.
But some party chieftains are worried that the party would hit the rocks if the convention is not held in June, citing legal issues.
There is also anxiety in the APC as controversy rages among top party leaders over which zone should produce the partys 2023 presidential candidate.
There are hints that the convention is being delayed for various issues, including zoning, lingering crisis in some state chapters, fear that some members might pull out if the outcome of the convention does not favour their interests.
Others say the APC is buying time to wait for the PDP to decide on zoning of its 2023 presidential ticket and chairmanship before acting.
Daily Trust
Saturday reports that the PDP national convention is expected to hold in December, 2021 when the tenure of the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC would elapse.
Discussions around alleged lack of reward system in the APC is equally generating tension and gaining momentum by the day.
Party stalwarts are grumbling over the issue and asking the national leadership of the party not to allow new entrants to hijack the system but recognise and reward old members who contributed to the growth of the party.
However, it is left to be seen whether the Buni committee would tackle all the challenges before June and organise a crisis-free national convention or get an extension of its timeline for the third time.
Nigeria loses N3.7tr to poor cold chain logistics
Nigeria is estimated to be losing N3.7 trillion annually due to wastage arising from improper storage of foods.
Chairman, Governing Council, Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), Mr. John Onojeharho disclosed this while speaking at the 8th Nigeria Annual Transport Lecture held in Lagos at the weekend.
He said, Nigeria is ranked one percent in terms of cold chain management.
The market is huge and if properly tapped, we can save $9 billion annually by avoiding food wastage through proper storage.
Onojeharho said if the 15 million metric tonnes of perishable goods wasted annually were well preserved, inflation would drop and there would be drastic improvement in the economy.
He added that Nigeria ranks 110 out of 160 countries globally in the performance index of logistics.
The transport expert attributed poor cold chain logistics to lack of good road infrastructure, continuity of the cold supply chain, high capital investment, power supply amongst others.
Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi who was represented by the Executive Director in the ministry, Mr Agbaji Francis, said there are efforts by the government to improve the transport sector.
He said in the rail subsector, 859 kilometres of standard gauge rail lines have been constructed and commissioned for commercial use in the last five years.
Air Peace gifts passengers cards, others
To mark the Eid-el-Fitri celebrations, Air Peace is delighting its customers with numerous gifts in-flight.
The Eid campaign is intended to put smiles on the faces of the customers for choosing Air Peace.
The campaign entails placement of gift cards in random seat pockets and during the flight, passengers are told to check the seat pockets in front of them to know if they have won a gift or not.
The activities started on Wednesday, May 12 and will run through the week.
Passengers stand a chance to win gifts such as thermo water-flask, food flasks, diaries, umbrellas, notebook bottles, remote organisers and free Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO) cards.
Spokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, reiterated the airlines commitment to offering unparalleled flight experience while also expressing gratitude to all customers for their continued patronage.
He added that this is an extension of the airlines Random Acts of Love campaign.
The airline initiated the campaign during Easter last month, to appreciate its teeming customers for their loyalty.
Nigeria has low dairy consumption level — Report
Nigeria has a low dairy consumption level at 15 to 20 litres per capita in spite of its health benefits with citizens opting for other staple food, a report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) stated.
CHI Limited, a dairy manufacturing firm in Nigeria quoted the report in a statement yesterday.
It said: This is partly attributable to low purchasing power of the average Nigerian household which rank milk and dairy products as non-essential luxuries and prioritise other staple foods such as rice, beans and yam.
Towards improving the situation, CHI said it would mark its first Hollandia Dairy Day next Tuesday to drive national discourse on the health and nutrition benefits of dairy consumption.
The day which will be marked through a conference with the theme: Dairy Nourishment to Support Healthy Living, is the first of such by a single company.
Chi said the physical and hybrid conference would feature presentations, interviews and panel discussions from health experts and nutritionists as they provided insights and shared perspectives to guide informed decisions about dairy consumption as part of a daily balanced diet.
The company stated that, By provoking the conversations and stimulating public action/intervention, Hollandia aims to drive consciousness for dairy consumption and its importance to achieving optimum health, and to get many more Nigerians drinking, using and consuming dairy products.
Dairy foods such as milk and yoghurt contain essential nutrients, including Vitamins A and D, Zinc and Protein which support immune function, especially as Nigeria and other countries battle the COVID-19 pandemic.
2023 polls: PDP asks INEC to transmit results electronically
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct and transmit results of the 2023 general elections electronically.
The partys position is predicated on INECs announcement of its readiness to conduct online (electronic) registration of voters for future elections in the country.
The party, in a statement on Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said since INEC is now in the position to deploy technology to conduct online registration of voters, which entails electronic transmission of voters data to its central server, the commission can also conduct an electronic transmission of results directly from the polling units to its central server.
Our party calls the attention of the commission to the fact that it no longer has any excuse not to employ the direct transmission of results from polling units, which will ensure credible elections by eliminating manipulations, alterations, switching and disappearance of election results during manual collation processes.
The PDP insists that if INEC can use the electronic platform for registration of voters, it could as well deploy the same technology for electronic transmission of results in future elections including the 2023 general elections.
Our party, however, urges INEC to ensure that the online registration of voters is credible, transparent and not open to the manipulations of desperate politicians.
The PDP also calls on the APC leadership in the National Assembly to know that it has no further pretext to continue to sit on the Electoral Act
Amendment bill and frustrate genuine efforts to ensure credible, free and fair elections in our country, the PDP said.
Kidnappers kill Minor after collecting N5m naira ransom from parents in Kaduna
A boy kidnapped from his parents home in a Kaduna suburb was found dead, seven days after he was taken and N5 million ransom paid for his release.
Muhammad Kabir, the victim, who was taken from Badarawa suburb of Kaduna North local government area, is believed to have been killed by his kidnappers.
His body was found in drainage in Kano after a weeklong search.
One of the arrested suspects leading the police to the drainage where the body was found
Sources in the area believe a neighbour connived with another resident, an ex-military personnel, to kidnap the boy.
Police have arrested three people, including the said neighbour, in connection with the kidnap and murder of Kabir.
Sources in the community also told Daily Trust that immediately the boy was declared missing, a search for him was done for days before a call came in from the kidnappers demanding N50m, and then later reduced the amount to N35m before finally agreeing to N5m.
Abdulrahman Kabir Magayaki, a brother to the victim, told Daily Trust that the late Kabir was taken away from their house to Zaria from there to Kano State where his body was retrieved after the ransom was paid.
One of the suspects that took the boy away was our neighbour while the ex-military personnel was also a resident in the community.
They took him to Zaria from there to Kano where his body was retrieved inside drainage after they collected 5 million naira ransom, he said.
He said the victims body was brought back to Kaduna and buried according to Islamic rites on Saturday.
Another resident said the victim must have been killed after he recognised the faces of his abductors since they are all living in the area.
Details of how the suspects were apprehended remain sketchy but they led the police to where the body was dumped.
Kaduna State Police Command Spokesman ASP Mohammed Jalige who confirmed the incident said the three suspects confessed to the crime but said he cannot comment on the military background of one of the suspects until investigation is concluded.
Nadal, Djokovic eye history as Roland Garros embraces quiet night in
Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will set their sights on more Grand Slam history at Roland Garros as the French Open embraces a new and eerily empty era of nighttime tennis.
The 14th title in Paris for Nadal would take him to a record-setting 21st major, surpassing the mark he shares with Roger Federer who has already written off his hopes of adding to his lone success in the French capital back in 2009.
Djokovic, the champion in 2016, can move to 19 Grand Slam titles with victory.
That would make the world number one the first man in over half a century to win all four majors on multiple occasions.
Nadal arrives in Paris buoyed by having defeated Djokovic in the Rome Masters
final in what was the pairs 57th meeting.
It was Nadals 10th title in the Italian capital.
Not that he was reading too much into the statistics as far as Roland Garros is concerned.
I think I can work on a couple of things that I can do a little bit better, he insisted.
I just need to keep going.
I know what I need to work on and Im going to do it.
Work, relax mentally, and work the right way.
At last years delayed Roland Garros, Nadal swept past Djokovic in straight sets in the final.
It was Nadals 100th win at the tournament against just two losses since his 2005 title-winning debut.
Giving Djokovic hope, however, is the knowledge that he was responsible for one of those losses, in the 2015 quarter-finals.
He is also a four-time runner-up although three of those defeats in the championship match came against the Spaniard.
2022 govship: Fayose endorses Ekiti PDP chair
A former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has anointed Bisi Kolawole, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chairman in the state as his preferred candidate for the 2022 governorship election in the state.
Kolawole, a former house of assembly member, was officially presented to Fayoses supporters across the 177 wards to prepare a solid ground for his emergence in the primary.
Fayose described Kolawole as a bridge-builder, one who could bring in a better future for Ekiti and the party, adding that he was our collective project.
Joy and sadness at Liverpool
Liverpool ended the season on a high note having qualified for the Champions League with a third place finish.
Regrettably the season also ended on a sad note with Liverpools excellent Georginio Wijnaldum departing for Barcelona.
I am told he has agreed a two-year deal.
He will be difficult to replace and has been Liverpools best player this year.
Gini has played in all 38 Premier League matches for the Reds and his reliability reminds me of Steven Gerrard who was also a hard act to follow.
He said a few days ago, Im fighting against tears right now.
The people in Liverpool have shown me love during my five years here.
I will miss them.
Jurgen Klopp knows he has to go into the transfer market and is currently working with his scouts and backroom team to identify who would be good enough to slot into the team.
Peps favourite celebratory moment
Following their success at winning the Premier League title and finishing off with a 5-0 victory against Everton, Manchester City players, staff and the manager went into full party mode.
Alcohol flowed, Pep Guardiola could be seen smoking a celebratory cigar and singing along to super band Oasis.
Peps favourite moment of the evening?
It was 11pm and 15 pizzas were delivered from a local takeaway.
And Pep was allowed first choice of his favourite topping!
Arsenal must decide about Willock
Discussions are already taking place behind the scenes at Arsenal regarding the future of Joe Willock.
The 21 year-old has progressed superbly this season, both physically and mentally, whilst on loan to Newcastle and he equalled club legend Alan Shearers record of seven goals in seven games.
Some would say it has been a one man show by Willock which propelled Newcastle up the league from a perilous position close to relegation.
Mikel Arteta is trying to decide whether to extend Joes loan period or bring him back to the Emirates where the danger is that he could spend most his time on the bench which could destroy his new found confidence.
Gareth still wont reveal his plans
This week I tried to learn for you Gareth Bales intentions for next season
but he is playing his cards very close to his chest.
No matter how much I tried, Gareth would only say he has made up his mind what is happening now
his loan period from Real Madrid to Spurs has ended but if he let his secret out it would cause chaos.
He just kept smiling.
Gareth then flew back to Spain by private jet and joined his family who have remained at home in Madrid during his time in the UK.
Spurs do not have a loan extension option or one to buy him outright and therefore Chairman Daniel Levy would have to renegotiate a new deal with Real Madrid if he wants Gareth for next season which is his final contracted year to the Spanish side.
Rumours about Spurs head coach
I am receiving rumours from Tottenham that there has already been contact with Roberto Martinez regarding the managerial role.
Martinez is currently leading Belgium in the Euros but is keen to return to club management.
Spurs have publicly said they are not interested in Martinez however the rumours I am picking up are strong.
Moyes addresses West Ham fans
I was amused by West Hams manager David Moyes response to their successful bid for European football next season.
There were 10,000 fans in the London Stadium and after West Ham beat Southampton 3-0
he addressed them by saying, Make sure you are all vaccinated and get your passports out because were going to Europe!
West Ham are about to reward Moyes with a new three-year contract.
Edinson explains his motivation
Edinson Cavani has been talking about his role at Manchester United.
Having signed a new one year extension to his contract he explained his motivation at being the senior player behind the scenes at Old Trafford.
He said this week, Ive always been a student of football.
Throughout my whole career, Ive tried to learn and absorb positive things that could make me a better player and a better team-mate
and I try to show that with the team.
Nowadays, Im the oldest player, the elder statesman in the team and that is a great motivation for me.
It pushes me during training sessions, it pushes me when I go out and play a match and compete.
So I try and enjoy it and work hard for my team
and I have to set an example.
I think that you set an example with your behaviour, how you compete, doing your best for your team, always being there to train and trying to be the best player in training sessions.
Is Werner good enough to play for Chelsea?
Chelsea striker Timo Werner has run out of chances and
Blues coach Thomas Tuchel is looking around Europe for new talent capable of scoring regularly.
Werner is Chelseas joint leading scorer with 12 goals and 14 assists this season but only six of these have come in the Premier League and the German has missed a large number of clear-cut chances.
Chelseas other main striker Tammy Abraham is out of favour and is looking to leave which leaves Tuchel with the task of finding a replacement.
Whether or not Werner is sold is yet to be decided however Romelu Lukaku is having an excellent season at Inter Milan with 23 goals and Erling Haaland has scored a goal every 93 minutes with a total of 39 goals in 40 games for Dortmund.
Both are on Chelseas radar.
The Blues clearly need to find a new Didier Drogba and owner Roman Abramovich has promised the funds to make it happen.
36 year-old Fernandinho set to stay at City
Despite his 36 years, Fernandinho remains a player
Pep Guardiola wants in his squad.
The midfielder has played 34 times this season, scored one goal and made two assists.
His main quality is being able to dominate the centre of the pitch and foresee what opponents are going to do and stop them.
Fernandinho joined City in 2013 from Shakhtar Donetsk and Pep has kept him at the heart of this team since he joined in 2016.
He was also handed the club captains badge following David Silvas departure.
In recognition of his leadership and importance Manchester City have extended his contract for another year.
The pressure on Guardiola to find another holding midfielder has now eased but it is Citys intention to look for a permanent replacement as Fernandinho approaches retirement.
Amazing fact about Leicester.
I was speaking with Leicester this week and my contacts pointed out an amazing fact.
Leicester have just missed out on a top four Champions League qualification place for next season and yet they spent 242 days in the top four of the Premier League table whereas qualifiers Manchester United were in the top four for only 155 days, Manchester City 131 days,
Liverpool 140 days and Chelsea only 103 days.
Leicester are a fantastic family club with genuinely nice people working there
and I am sorry they have, once again, missed out on the top prize.
Olusegun Ajuwon: Its wrong for sports ministries to concentrate only on football
The Chairman of Aso Table Tennis Club, Dr. Olusegun Ajuwon has said too much attention being paid to football by sports ministries and administrators
is detrimental to the existence of other games.
Speaking recently in Abuja, the table tennis enthusiast reiterated the need for corporate organisations and individuals to sponsor more table tennis tournaments.
Ajuwon also spoke on efforts his club is making to develop the game in the FCT and beyond.
Youve been so committed to the game of table tennis.
Where do you draw your inspiration?
I cant tell exactly what the motivation is all about.
All I can say is that I like the game.
I like the game of table tennis.
It is a game that is easy to play.
What I mean by this is that you dont need costly gadgets to play table tennis.
I started playing table tennis in my school hostel.
The school built concrete slabs for us to iron clubs.
But that became our first table tennis board.
We would put two tins of peak milk and a stick to make a net.
We would then use kpako (wood) or cardboard to produce bats with which we played the game.
Balls were always available for us to play.
I think that is where I derived my inspiration for the game of table tennis.
I had the opportunity to play golf but I think it is for rich people.
So I settled for table tennis due to its simplicity and effectiveness in terms of exercise.
Table tennis is one of the safest games one can play.
Would you say enough effort is being made by the appropriate authorities to develop the game of table tennis in Nigeria?
I am not a fan of Big Brother Nigeria, BBN, but I can see that in their last edition, they promoted table tennis.
Anytime they were free they played table tennis.
It is wrong for the ministry of sports at both the federal and state level to concentrate only on football.
I think it is wrong because it is not everybody who can play at the highest level.
But table tennis can keep so many people engaged.
Paying too much attention to football is wrong but it has become a tradition.
And where we copied football from, there is so much pool betting in Europe, especially in the UK.
There is so much betting around the game that is why it is so popular.
Here in Nigeria, we are so blessed with talented youths in table tennis
so we should be able to domesticate it.
It is easy to start.
And we can engage so many people at any time.
This is my appeal.
Would you say there are enough tournaments to keep the players busy?
We should pay more attention to hosting more competitions at regular intervals.
It doesnt have to be so big like bringing together all the states like Aso Table Tennis Club is doing.
It can be local but let it be a constant thing like every month or every two months, there is a competition.
Among other benefits, this will help keep the kids away from social vices.
How much is Aso Table Tennis club contributing to the growth of the sport in the FCT?
Before we involved other states, this competition was exclusively for the FCT.
After some time, we began to involve neighbouring states.
At the moment, what we do is to get a coach in the FCT to go round the secondary school to publicise this competition.
Ajoke Ojomo and three of her mates graduated from a secondary school here in the FCT.
They were discovered through this tournament.
So the Aso table tennis championship is for the FCT and Abuja people should take full advantage of it.
The tournament is not going to leave Abuja.
Are there any concrete plans to ensure that this tournament is held annually?
What I know for sure is that it will continue to hold because we are getting more and more people who are interested and have the means to support us.
They are willing to give.
It may also interest you to know that what we use in hosting this competition, big as it may sound, is not so much.
Our budget is below N5m.
And I am sure one year is enough to raise N5m.
So there is every assurance that the Aso table tennis championship will continue to hold every year.
At the moment, how many corporate organisations are sponsoring Aso table tennis tournament?
For the 2021 edition, we got a big sponsor but we are not mentioning his name.
Hopefully, we would get more sponsors so that we wouldnt have to worry when the competition is near.
We are also hoping that if the economy improves, we would bring on board more corporate sponsors.
Three years ago, we were hopeful but the economy has been bad so anywhere we go, they say
well you know what is happening.
However, we hope to get corporate sponsorship that will be constant.
How much support is Aso table tennis and the game in general enjoying from the FCT Sports Council?
I think they can do a little better because the players that went to the recently concluded National Sports Festival in Benin City didnt have enough support from the FCT Sports Council.
I think we can do better.
There are so many talented players in the FCT waiting to be discovered and nurtured.
Police arrest 4 over murder of groom-to-be in Kwara
Police in Kwara have arrested four people suspected to be involved in the killing of Olokose Ojo, a staff of University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, six days before his wedding.
Ojo, in his early 30s, worked in the National Health Insurance Scheme unit of the hospital.
It is believed the attack was orchestrated by the kingpin of the gang and the deceased next-door neighbour named as Kazeem Mohammed who lured him to a bush in Patigi on the guise of helping him purchase three cattle to be used for the event at the rate of N350,000.
He was however murdered and his body dismembered by the gang after withdrawing over N1.2m from his account with his ATM and demanding N12 million ransom from his wife-to-be, Ilori Oluwakemi.
His body was exhumed by the police and taken to the UITH mortuary for autopsy.
The police gave the names of the other three suspects as Mohammed Chatta, Jimoh Abdulateef and Madi Jeremiah all of whom are now in custody adding that they will be charged to court once judiciary workers call off their strike.
Speaking on the development, Police PPRO, Ajayi Okasanmi, said the suspects confessed in their statements that the victim was lured into the remote part of Patigi where he was told the cattle he paid for were tethered but was shot on approaching the spot.
The deceased was said to have been buried in a shallow grave inside the bush and his head and arm severed to be used for alleged money ritual.
Food, beverage companies fast collapsing — TUC
The Trade Union Congress (TUC) has decried the negative effects of federal government policies and the COVID-19 pandemic on the food, beverage and tobacco sector, saying the sector has suffered several factory closures and redundancies.
TUC President, Quadri Olaleye, who doubles as the outgoing President of the Food Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association (FOBTOB), stated this in Abuja during the 14th National Delegates Conference of the association.
It is no news that the COVID-19 pandemic spotlighted the food, beverage and tobacco industry as an engine room for boosting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The hardworking members of the Association defied all odds to ensure that food items were made available to Nigerians during the lockdown.
It was very unfortunate that despite the vantage position of this industry to our economical sustenance, it has not received 10 percent of the attention given to other sectors of the economy.
The production cost has gone up but nothing has been done in terms of financial support and tax relief by the government to cushion the effects of this.
Rather, we are subjected to different bans ranging from accessibility of forex to import of raw materials to forced backward integration.
We are not opposed to backward integration in any form but its implementation was ill-timed as it has led to massive redundancy in our industry, Olaleye said.
He explained that companies under FOBTOB had sacked not less than 1,478 workers between 2015 and 2021, which had diminished Nigerias revenue.
He further said, It is our hope that the government would wake up from the snail speed approach to governance since governance is a serious business for serious-minded people.
The government must urgently start addressing the issue of the growing unemployment rate, insecurity, and the general infrastructural decay in our nation.
