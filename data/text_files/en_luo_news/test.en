DP Ruto finally shares event with President Uhuru
After a lengthy absence from functions presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto has finally showed up for one - the national prayer breakfast'.
Ruto is attending the May 27 prayer breakfast event at Parliament Buildings among a host of other national leaders.
This is the third time this year the two are attending the same event after the burial of former Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae on February 15 and a Cabinet meeting 10 days later.
Prayer Organising Committee Co-chair Dan Maanzo on Tuesday while confirming Ruto’s attendance downplayed the frosty relationship between the President and his deputy, adding that the event provided an opportunity for leaders to reconcile.
“We hope that the prayers will provide a platform for "the leaders to reach out to each other and reconcile,” said the Makueni MP.
On February 5, the DP skipped the ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of former President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi despite his name being on the programme.
Their fallout was amplified in the months of March and April when Ruto skipped various Covid-19 addresses by President Kenyatta.
On May 4, Ruto skipped the reception of Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu at State House, Nairobi, with his aides saying he was not invited.
Emmanuel Tallam, the Communications Director at the DP’s Office, told the media that Ruto followed the televised proceedings from his Karen Residence Office.
Ruto also skipped this year’s Labour Day celebrations at State House, Nairobi which was attended by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli and Labour Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui.
“We honour and celebrate the extraordinary sacrifices that workers, households and enterprises continue to make to advance our country’s transformation agenda amid the devastating surge in the Covid-19 pandemic,” the DP tweeted on May 1.
According to the Constitution, Ruto is the principal assistant of the president and should attend all gazetted State functions at which the only speakers are the President, him, the host governor and sometimes Raila.
Since March 2018, when President Kenyatta shook hands with ODM leader Raila Odinga, and more so 2020 and 2021, the DP has been isolated in his own government, making him an outsider in decision-making and key meetings.
He has however attributed this isolation to an attempt by President Kenyatta’s inner circle to lock him out of the Head of State’s 2022 succession plan.
“If President Kenyatta now trusts other people and consults more with Raila, I have taken it with grace. The style changed, and it is the prerogative of the President being the boss,” Ruto said during a recent interview with Citizen TV.
Today’s event whose theme is a “Hopeful Future” brings together leaders from all the arms of the Government and across the political divide when the country is in the middle of a pandemic.
The prayer meeting is being attended both virtually and physically.
The event that takes place on the last Thursday of May each year, is hosted by Speakers of the bicameral parliament Justin Muturi and Kenneth Lusaka and Chaired by Senate Majority Leader Samuel Poghisio, co-chaired by Maanzo.
Chief Justice Martha Koome, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka are also in attendance.
The NPB was first held in 2003 after former President Mwai Kibaki took office with its primary purpose being to meet, engage, interact and pray for the nation in the company of fellow leaders from all sectors of society.
Man seeks court's intervention to clear confusion over three dates of birth
Age is just but a number, the saying goes.
But that is not always true for everyone.
One such person is Francis Paul Kerre whose identification documents show three different ages.
Tired of the tribulations the discrepancies in his age have brought him, Kerre has moved to court to have the matter resolved once and for all.
His birth certificate and national ID show he is 70, KRA Pin Certificate 66 and his passport 60 years.
Kerre now wants these details aligned to give him a peace of mind and spare him the many questions he sometimes has to answer.
He says an earlier plea to the registrar to rectify the anomaly did not bear fruit.
He contends that the person who prepared his birth certificate entered the wrong birth date.
Court documents read that he has since confirmed the year he was born.
Kerre says he was born on October 15, 1954.
This is the date in his KRA Pin certificate, which means he is 66.
The petitioner avers that the error in the birth certificate was caused by the initial entry in his birth certificate when he was born and he has since confirmed his correct date of birth.
The petitioner seeks court’s intervention to rectify his birth certificate and have the correct date of birth entered in the register and his birth certificate,” Kerre’s court papers read in part.
Teenage pregnancy, early marriages to blame for Ugenya school dropout cases
The Ministry of Education has blamed teenage pregnancies and early marriages for rising cases of school dropouts in Ugenya, Siaya County.
County Director of Education Nelson Sifuna said there are also reports of children dropping out of school for bodaboda business while others cross to Uganda through Busia border in search of jobs.
Sifuna urged locals to take advantage of the free primary education programme despite other challenges to ensure all children of school-going age attend school.
"But we also understand that life at home has been difficult especially for the orphans who have to provide for themselves," said Sifuna.
He said most of those who drop out of school said they did not have uniforms while some said they had to fend for their siblings or themselves.
Sifuna challenged parents and guardians to monitor school-going children so that they don't engage in negative social activities that could distract them from school.
“Most of the children also live with their grandparents and you know they are never strict with their grandchildren who get lots of freedom and end up engaging in negative social activities," he said.
Between 2018 to 2020 about 53 pupils dropped out of school while another 39 students dropped out of Secondary schools in Ugenya sub-county, Siaya County.
Meanwhile, Daniel Odhiambo, a local philanthropist, has donated over 200 school uniforms to needy pupils.
Odhiambo said he made the donation after receiving complaints from local widows and grandmothers taking care of orphans that they could not meet the pupils’ needs because of the tough economic situation in the country.
He said some school-going children from needy backgrounds, mostly orphans, have dropped out of school due to lack of school uniform.
"Most of them especially girls feel shy when they don’t have uniforms or have torn ones and end up dropping out of school. That is why I sponsored them to stay in school," he said.
The ministry has now resorted to sensitisation in all forums, use of role models to offer talks to the school-going children.
Odhiambo encouraged former students to visit their schools, especially in the villages to help the ministry fight school dropout.
He lauded the county government for initiating adopt a school programme that has been distributing masks and sanitisers in local schools.
"We have taken advantage of the programme to encourage alumnus to visit their former schools and offer talks," he added.
Drama in Migori, widow evicted from land by sister-in-law
Standing on her husband’s grave, Felister Wabwire wails uncontrollably as police officers plead with her to leave.
The police are here to execute an eviction order on the widow from the land she claims was bought by her late husband, Fedelis Wabwire, in Oruba Keyo Village, Migori County, 25 years ago.
The eviction followed Senior Principal Magistrate Johnstone Munguti's order obtained by the widow’s sister-in-law, Nekesa Mukhongo.
Nekesa claims the land belongs to her and that her mother and two brothers were buried on it.
“I have stayed here for over 25 years and gave birth to four children with my late husband who died three years ago,” Felister said.
She said it was one year ago when her sister-in-law, Nekesa, together with her husband came and claimed they owned the land.
“I don’t know where to go with my children and I am requesting the government to come to my aid,” she said.
The widow’s son Julius Fedelis Wabwire said her mother and the entire family were evicted from the land by police officers in the morning and had nowhere to go.
But Nekesa told The Standard Felistas had separated with her late husband and only came back after he died and took over the land.
My brother’s wife was convinced by her children to come back to her home and continue settling here.
It’s me together with my husband who bought the land for my late mother, the land belongs to me,” she said.
In the ruling in which the eviction order is said to have been issued, the court noted that Felistas had no Kenyan identification papers and directed police to investigate her nationality.
Three fishermen arrested after death of colleague in Lake Victoria
hree fishermen have been arrested in Homa Bay County in connection with the death of their colleague.
The fishermen who hail from Wadiang’a beach in Suba sub-county were arrested Monday morning and detained at Sindo police post.
Dancun Omondi alias Nelly met his death on Saturday night while in the company of his colleagues who were on a fishing expedition.
The four fishermen had left Wadiang’a beach and went fishing near Takawiri Island in the neighboring Suba North sub-county.
According to the Secretary of Wadiang’a Beach Management Unit Collins Ochieng’, Omondi disagreed with one of the three fishermen and ended up fighting.
“The fishermen said Omondi slipped into the lake while exchanging blows with the colleague,” said Ochieng’, adding that the fishermen went into the lake when they were drunk.
“I think they were acting under the influence of alcohol which is rampant in our beaches,” Ochieng’ said.
Omondi’s body is yet to be retrieved.
Suba Sub-county Police Commander Antony Njeru said the three men have been detained as police probe the matter.
“We don’t know whether they killed him and dumped his body in the lake or the fisherman drowned after slipping from the boat as they say,” Njeru said.
Njeru said he will hand the suspects to his colleagues in the Mbita Sub-county where the incident occurred.
Man in trouble for defiling teenage girls in his house
Security officers in Homa Bay County have rescued two schoolgirls from a man who allegedly has been defiling them for the last month.
The 15-year-old girls were rescued from a house at Kadongo trading center, Kowidi Sub-location in Rachuonyo East Sub-county on Saturday.
The minors hail from Nyakach sub-county and disappeared from their homes a month ago.
One of the girls sat her 2020 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCSE) and got 288 marks at a primary school in Kisumu County and another one is a Standard Seven pupil.
The children were found in a carpenter's house and were identified by a Nyakach resident who had gone to Kadongo, who then informed family members.
Kowidi assistant chief Michael Aoro rushed to the scene and rescued the minors.
“The incident is strange because the man has been defiling the girls in his house. One of them is telling us that she used to sleep in a chair while the other was sleeping in the man's bed,” Aoro said.
"But her statement does not make sense because she is not telling us the reason why she left home and resorted to sleeping in a chair inside a house that doesn’t belong to her relative,” he added.
The administrator took the minors to Othoro Police Station where police interrogated them further before they underwent medical tests at Othoro Hospital.
Police are still looking for the man who escaped during the raid.
“The man disappeared after realising that the minors’ family members were in his house,” Aoro said, adding that they will ensure he is arrested.
He urged parents to take care of their children to prevent such incidents.
Let parents be keen in monitoring movements of their children to enhance their safety.
Defilement is a serious offence,” he added.
Magoha challenges Homa Bay-based varsity to prioritise fish production
Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has told Tom Mboya University College management to prioritise research on fish production and how to end perennial water shortage in Homa Bay County.
The university which is the first higher learning institution in the county was opened in Homa Bay town in 2016.
It currently operates as a constituent college of Maseno University.
Prof Magoha, who was accompanied by Homa Bay Deputy County Commissioner Jude Wasonga, Homa Bay County Director of Education Fredrick Kiiru, Maseno University Vice-Chancellor Prof Julius Nyabundi and Tom Mboya Principal Prof Charles Ochola, said the purpose of a university is to undertake research for ending problems facing the society.
“Homa Bay County is known for water shortage but the work of a university is to solve societal problems.
Let this university focus on water and do research which can end water shortage in Homa Bay,” said Prof Magoha.
Magoha who spoke on Friday when he supervised the construction of a Sh300 million storey building that will be used for classes and laboratories in the university, said the young university can survive well if it focuses on fish production.
He argued that the community in which the university operates recognises fish as their best diet hence investing in research aimed at producing fish will make it prosper.
I am impressed by the infrastructural development going on in this university.
“However, it must invest in research on fish production for it to survive,” he added.
The CS said the university has the capability to be the chief producer of fish in Homa Bay County as part of both academic and economic development.
“We don’t expect lecturers of this university to depend on fish got from elsewhere. Focus on fish production too,” Magoha said.
Tom Mboya is currently undertaking a number of infrastructural development projects to enable it to acquire a charter so that it becomes a fully-fledged university.
However, it has not been established when it will acquire the charter.
It has 3000 students pursuing various courses.
The university started with agriculture, business and education courses.
The university was built at the Homa Bay Farmers Training Centre (FTC) which used to train farmers on good farming practices.
Employment court reinstates impeached official until case is determined
The High Court has granted reprieve to impeached Homa Bay County Health executive Prof Richard Muga.
Prof Muga was impeached by Homa Bay MCAs on May 12 over alleged abuse of office and gross violation of the Constitution.
County Assembly Deputy Speaker Ellyas Orondo tabled a motion that led to impeachment of the Health executive.
Muga later filed a petition at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu challenging the MCAs’ action that was intended to remove him from office.
In the case, Muga sued Homa Bay County Assembly and Governor Cyprian Awiti.
Justice Stephen Radido yesterday ruled that Muga should continue serving as Health executive until the case is heard and determined.
“This court grants conservatory orders staying the whole of the respondent’s action of removing the petitioner from the position of CECM for health pending hearing and determination of the application and petition filed,” Justice Radido ordered.
The County Assembly and Awiti were directed to file and serve their submissions before August 5.
Muga was also told to file and serve any further affidavit together with submissions on or before June 21. The judgement will be delivered on October 27.
Girl, 17, disappears in puzzling circumstances on first day of Term 3
A17-year-old girl from Oyugis in Homa Bay County has disappeared from home in unclear circumstances.
Eunice Awino, a student of Atemo Mixed Secondary School, vanished from home on May 10; the first day of Term Three studies in the adjusted 2020 academic calendar.
On the said-date, the teenager’s mother, Rael Akinyi, says she went to her bedroom at 6am, and found Awino still asleep.
Waking up late was uncharacteristic of the teenager, the mother said.
Her school is quite far from where we stay.
“On normal days, she usually leaves earlier than 6am,” Akinyi told The Standard.
When she asked the teenager why she hadn’t left for school yet, Awino allegedly told her she hadn’t shaved her head, and she would, therefore, be ordered to return home upon reporting to school.
“She further said that no serious learning takes place on Day One of school resumption,” said Akinyi.
The distressed mother said she, consequently, allowed the girl to stay home as she (Awino) prepared to report to school the following day; May 11.
Akinyi, thereafter, left for Oyugis Town, where she was scheduled to meet a staffer attached to the registration of births office so that she could process Awino’s birth certificate, ahead of KCSE exam enrolment.
When the mother-of-ten returned home in the afternoon, her daughter, who is the lastborn, was not around.
Her school bag was also missing.
Her books, however, had been stashed in a sack and placed at a corner in the living room.
The money Akinyi had left Awino for food was still on a stool, the girl’s mother said.
Neighbours told Akinyi that they saw the teenager leaving home on a boda boda at noon on May 10.
“I, immediately, inquired from all my relatives who live nearby whether Awino had visited them, but they responded in the negation,” said Akinyi.
Later that day, at around 9pm, Awino called her mother using an anonymous contact, and informed her that she was housed by a middle-aged woman in Kisii, and that Akinyi shouldn’t worry about her.
The distraught parent reported the happenings to her daughter’s school the following day before filing a missing person’s report at Oriwo Police Station.
Almost two weeks later, Awino is yet to be found.
“The only thing I know is that she was last spotted in Nyamira Market. My attempts to trace her have been futile. I hope we find her safe.”
Atemo Mixed Secondary School principal, Philip Ayoo, confirmed to The Standard that the minor is a student at the institution.
She (Awino) has never had any disciplinary problems.
We are shocked to learn that she went missing from home,” said Ayoo.
Rusana's candidature causes political heat as race to succeed Obado intensifies
he entry of Migori County Secretary into the race to succeed Governor Okoth Obado appears to have rattled seasoned politicians who have accused him of using elders to endorse his candidature.
Christopher Rusana's endorsement by Suba Community elders has seen other aspirants cry foul, saying the decision of the elders who attended the May 3, meeting in Kisii was compromised.
The aspirants led by Migori Woman Rep Pamela Odhiambo have vowed never to step down.
Odhiambo, businessman Philip Mwabe, former Migori MP John Pesa, former Mombasa executive Seth Odongo and businessman Owiso Ngao have rubbished the endorsement, saying the process was unfair and that the outcome was influenced.
The exercise was conducted by elders led by Pentecostal Evangelical Faith of Africa (PEFA) chairman John Okinda and a team of six opinion leaders from Suna East and Suna West constituencies.
The meeting held at the Carmel Park hotel in Kisii town was attended by Mrs Odhiambo, Rusana, Mwabe and Pesa while Odongo and Ngao did not attend.
Speaking to The Standard early this week, Mwabe said he opposed the voting idea after the candidates present refused to pick insisting that despite the selection of Rusana, he would be on the ballot.
When contacted by The Standard, Pesa and Mrs Odhiambo said they are still in the race.
“My candidature is not on reverse gear. I will be on the ballot come 2022,” said Mrs Odhiambo.
Rusana has, however, downplayed the wrangles, promising to consult with his opponents to ensure the region produces a candidate.
In a phone interview with The Standard on May 16, Rusana who wants to run on an ODM ticket wondered why the change of heart yet his opponents fully participated in the exercise.
“We were all present, and they fully participated, I still don’t know what happened a few days later, maybe the media can find out from them,” he said.
He said with the elders’ blessing, it is all system go as he tries to consolidate his backyard before he can approach other regions.
The country secretary said he is banking on the support of the masses and not that of Governor Obado as his opponents are claiming to win the seat come 2022.
“There is something the elders saw in me, I don’t take it for granted and will not disappoint their trust,” added Rusana.
“Because I am always a quiet person, my opponents have been underestimating me. I will not mind getting the support of like-minded leaders who will help me shape Migori, I will first take my mandate to people.”
According to the Suba community elders led by chairman Riogi Riogi, having a single candidate would increase their son or daughter’s chances of succeeding Governor Obado.
Riogi said he is aware of the wrangle, but called on other aspirants who felt shortchanged to seek dialogue.
“In our own wisdom, we saw that placing a single candidate would strengthen the community’s unity and supporting the candidate would be easy and hence the winning of the elections,” Riogi said.
The Suna clan, which is part of the Suba community, has been angling to field a single candidate to solidify Suna West (46,162 votes) and Suna East (46,574 votes) out of the 389,182 votes in Migori.
With Governor Obado ditching the ODM for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Kuria community factor, the 2022 Migori gubernatorial race could be the trickiest.
Obado is reported to have mounted a massive membership recruitment drive for the PDP after announcing he will ditch Raila Odinga-led ODM.
The governor's point men have rolled out registration and membership drive across the county manually and digitally in an exercise expected to run up to the end of the year.
Other aspirants who are eying the seat include Assembly Speaker Boaz Okoth, Senator Ochillo Ayacko, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno, former Nyatike MP Edick Anyanga, US-based academician Mark Ogutu and businessman Robert Okong’o.
Homa Bay health workers: MCAs interfere with health services
Health workers’ unions in Homa Bay have accused Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) of interfering with health services at the County Referral Hospital.
The County Assembly recently adopted a report that the acting Chief Executive Officer of the hospital Peter Ogolla be removed to pave way for the reinstatement of the former CEO Dr Lilian Kocholla who was recently shown the door.
Dr Kocholla was sent on compulsory leave because of alleged poor management which had put the hospital in a deplorable state.
This made MCAs through the Health Committee conduct investigations which revealed the hospital lacked many essential drugs including panadol.
Instead, the MCAs blamed the health executive Prof Richard Muga for the problems in the hospital, before they impeached him a few days later.
But the Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) and Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO) accused the MCAs of interfering with the service delivery at the facility.
The county KNUN Secretary Omondi Nyonje, KUCO Executive Secretary Philip Mbom and KUCO chairman Stephen Obunga said changes in the management of the hospital should not be altered again.
“It is true that there has been an issue of poor management at the hospital and that is why patients were forced to buy many essential items including gloves for medics to attend to them,” Nyonje said
He, however, noted that the new management should be given time“ to enable Dr Ogolla to apply all his skills of correcting anomalies which were caused by the previous management.”
Mbom argued that the recommendation by the MCAs to reinstate Dr Kocholla is tantamount to interfering with the provision of health services at the hospital.
“The change of management was made to correct weaknesses which impeded the proper provision of health services in the hospital. Any attempts to defeat the changes mean impending delivery of health services to Homa Bay residents,” Mbom said.
Obunga said health is a sensitive department that should be handled keenly. “We urge MCAs to handle health department with utmost care because any mistake by management of a health facility can cause loss of lives.”
The County Assembly Health Committee chairperson Joan Ogada said their aim was to improve service delivery in the hospital.
“The staff at the hospital should forge a spirit of teamwork and unity to ensure quality health service delivery to Homa Bay residents,” Ms Ogada said when she tabled the investigative report in the Assembly.
The fate of Prof Muga now lies in hands of Governor Cyprian Awiti who can decide to sack or retain him in his executive committee.
Veteran journalist Philip Ochieng was buried at his home in Manyatta Village, Migori County yesterday.
His family, led by daughter Judith Adhiambo, eulogised him as a family man.
They said he was a celebrity to the outside world, and famous as a wordsmith, but was always quiet at home.
“It had great meaning for me. My father was never an orator both in public and at home,” said Adhiambo.
The family said despite Ochieng’s quiet disposition, he still played with the children, especially his grandchildren.
His grandson, Philip Ochieng Junior, said he spoilt them by taking them to parks and buying them candy.
“He was a doting grandfather, we were always there and fought to catch his attention and open the door for him when he came home from work,” Junior said.
Editor’s Guild president Churchill Otieno remembered Ochieng as a person who stood out as the father of professional journalism.
“Many appreciate him today for being a mentor. We appreciate him for the courage.
“He built that stage into a global one and his home was no longer Manyatta but the world,” Otieno said.
He thanked Ochieng’s family and the people of Manyatta village for giving them a great person.
Senator Ochillo Ayacko said the late Ochieng shared knowledge as he prepared people to succeed him in the field of journalism, which he helped shape for six decades.
“In this village, we will remember him as a great person,” Ayacko said.
According to the family, Ochieng, who spent many years in Nairobi, came back home this year and fell sick after three weeks.
He was taken to St Joseph Ombo Mission Hospital where he died on April 27.
Ochieng was married to Jennifer Dawa with whom they had four children.
He had another child from an earlier relationship.
ODM, UDA protest as police storm Ongwae's home over Bonchari by election
Asection of political leaders in Kisii has protested after armed police officers stormed Governor James Ongwae’s home.
The politicians allied to ODM and UDA parties said it is unfortunate that police were being used politically to intimidate other leaders ahead of the Bonchari by-election slated for Tuesday next week.
The two parties have raised concerns over intimidation and harassment by police as their respective candidates conduct campaigns.
The by-election has attracted 13 contestants.
On Thursday night armed police stormed Kisii County Governor James Ongwae’s residence as he was having tea with Senator Prof Sam Ongeri and Woman Representative Janet Ong’era on accusation that they were holding an illegal political meeting.
Addressing the media in Kisii town on Friday morning, Ongwae said he had been informed that an unlawful assembly was taking place at his residence, which they had come to disperse.
Ongwae said he requested the police to withdraw but they latter insisted they would not leave until the two legislators had left his residence.
“I am calling on President Uhuru Kenyatta to put a stop to this, elections come and go. Leaders are all transitory. Democratic institutions must be respected. 50 officers can’t storm my house as if I am a wanted criminal,” he said.
The governor added: “I didn’t become a governor by accident. I was elected by majority votes. This is not the way to run a Country. I have been a Permanent Secretary and I didn’t see such decisions made. This is unfortunate.”
Senator Ongeri said the party understands the art of winning and losing in any elections.
While urging IEBC to take charge of the forthcoming by-election, Ongeri said he had traversed the Bonchari constituency and was hopeful that the residents will make the right choice.
“You may have a temporary relief that you won but I can assure you that you have lost it all. One must understand where people are coming from and where they are going. There are seasons for everything, don't try to maneuver and manipulate the result,” he said.
Ong’era in her sentiments said it was shocking for police officers to raid the governor’s residence without a court order.
“I am demanding concrete reasons from IEBC and other relevant agencies on why they allowed for a by-election yet they know there was Covid-19 amongst us."
"We have a by-election in Juja but we have not seen such kind of harassment,” she said.
ODM party Secretary General Edwin Sifuna said that "desperate times call for desperate measures."
Deputy President William Ruto’s quest to infiltrate the Nyanza region ahead of next year’s elections is gaining momentum as his new allies in the region stepped up efforts to popularise him.
The leaders, most of who are considered ODM rebels after falling out with party leader Raila Odinga, are pushing for a generational change in the region’s leadership and a new economic path in their efforts to market the DP.
Last week, leaders who included one of Ruto’s point men in Nyanza, Eliud Owalo, met at a Nairobi hotel to plan what they described as their economic strategy for the region.
They said their strategy will form the basis of their negotiations with other presidential hopefuls ahead of 2022.
According to them, anyone seeking the support of the region will have to enter into a pre-election economic pact with them.
This comes as Raila struggles to calm a storm that recently rocked ODM leading to Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo being kicked out of a key parliamentary committee.
Many former foot soldiers of Raila attended Friday’s meeting convened by Owalo, who is also a former aide to the ODM leader.
They include those who decamped after losing ODM nominations in the 2013 and 2017 elections, among them former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno and former Rangwe MP Martin Ogindo.
Ranguma is hoping to challenge Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o for the Kisumu seat.
A source who did not wish to be named said those present were warming up to join United Democratic Alliance (UDA), which is associated with the deputy president.
“We want to challenge ODM’s dominance in the Nyanza region. Our goal is to rally the region to support Ruto’s presidential bid,” said the source.
The politician claimed that they have the blessings of Ruto to organise the meeting with one of the agendas being to look for ways to attract more Nyanza leaders to their camp.
The strategy also involves attracting professionals from the region who will help compile the economic needs of the region in a document that will form the basis for Ruto’s campaigns in Nyanza.
The group issued a statement saying it was reviewing Nyanza’s economy with the aim of finding ways to improve it.
Owalo accused unnamed leaders from Nyanza of being preoccupied with the pursuit of political power and failing to address the economic problems of the region.
Luo Nyanza has supported Raila since his first attempt at the presidency in 1997.
In 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta, with the help of the former secretary-general of the disbanded.
The National Alliance party Onyango Oloo tried to make inroads in the region, but residents voted for the opposition leader.
Lecturer awarded Sh 416,000 for breach of contract
Apart-time lecturer has been awarded Sh416,000 after his employer breached his contract by refusing to pay him salary for eleven months.
The court ruled that the evidence by the E-Smart Technical College lecturer Tobias Andhala would be fully adopted as the college failed to step in court even after being served with a notice.
“Andhala testified on March 4, 2021, and his testimony was not challenged or rebutted, and the court will enter a judgment for him in the sum of Sh416,000 that he demanded from the College,” said Justice Stephen Radido of Kisumu Labour Court on Friday.
Andhala was employed as a part-time lecturer at the College on June 28, 2015, and by May 27, 2016, the College had not fully paid his salary.
On September 5, 2017, he escalated the dispute at the Labour Court after efforts to compel his employer to pay him.
“The college was served the court papers through its secretary on October 26, 2017, but it did not file a response,” said Radido.
This prompted the court to direct that the case proceeds without the party that had defied court summons.
At the close of the hearing of the case, the court was convinced that Andhala had a contract with the college which was abused.
Justice Radido further ordered that the award would accrue interest from September 5, 2017, when the case was filed.
The court directed Andhala to settle all the legal costs in the suit.
Police in Kisumu have arrested a 63-year-old woman in connection with theft of mosquito nets which were stolen from government stores.
Police said they recovered 19 bales of nets suspected to be part of those stolen from Rabuor and Nyang’ande two weeks ago.
Officers from Obunga Police Station, working on a tip-off from the public, raided a house at USAID Estate on Friday and nabbed the woman.
She was taken to Obunga Police Station after failing to explain the source of the nets, then transferred to Central Police Station where she was booked.
The woman was later moved to Ahero Police Station in Ntyando, where the initial report about the loss of the nets was made.
Kisumu Central sub-county police commander James Ng’etich said they are investigating the matter.
“We decided to hand the suspect to officers in Ahero since the theft had been reported there and they had also arrested other suspects,” said Ng’etich
The county launched the distribution of treated mosquito nets to residents two weeks ago in an exercise that will see at least 790, 000 nets given to 1.2 million people.
The nets had been kept in various stores, mostly hospitals and schools within Kisumu’s seven sub-counties.
However, the exercise was halted in parts of Nyando after it was discovered 340 bales, each containing 50 nets, had disappeared from Rabuor and Nyang’ande hospitals.
County Malaria Coordinator Lilyana Dayo, who was coordinating the distribution of the nets, noted that the theft was discovered on the day the distribution was to begin.
At least four officials from the two hospitals were arrested in connection with the theft.
The arrest of the 63-year-old woman at Obunga however marked the first breakthrough in the investigations after police discovered 19 bales of mosquito nets suspected to be part of those that were stolen.
The police said the woman told them she was selling the nets on behalf of an individual she declined to name.
Nyando sub-county police boss Lewnard Matete said the woman will remain in custody until Monday when she will be arraigned.
Matete said the suspect had been uncooperative and has declined to divulge information regarding the nets.
“She keeps changing her story. Police are unable to trace the movement of the nets because the suspect does not want to give information.
She is now claiming she cannot recall the name or identity and does not even have the contacts of the person she claims delivered the nets to her house for storage. The suspect says all she knows is that the person comes from Busia,” said Matete.
Efforts by the suspect’s kin to have her released on police bond failed.
“With this kind of conflicting information, it is not safe for us to grant her police bond. She will have to wait in the cells until Monday when she will go to court,” said Matete.
The implementation of a multi-million-shilling project launched by Dr Ida Odinga in Homa Bay County could delay because of a stalemate between the contractor and Kenya Power.
The project christened Dr Ida Odinga Library, Research, Innovation and Resource Centre is under construction at Ogande Girls High School in Homa Bay Town Constituency and is expected to cost over Sh300 million.
The project started in December last year after a groundbreaking ceremony presided over by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, his education counterpart Prof George Magoha and Dr Ida.
Its foundation is complete but the construction cannot go on because of electricity cables hanging over the site.
The cables supply electricity to Suneka town in Kisii County from Homa Bay town.
Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma who toured the project accused Kenya Power of failing to move the cables.
“The contractor has told me he asked Kenya Power to relocate the power lines but the organisation has not done so. The company should move with speed and relocate the power lines. Electric cables hang above the site hence the work cannot continue,” said Kaluma.
The MP said the cost of the project is likely to go up if the stalemate persists.
“The stalemate must be resolved. We want to see the project completed as planned delay in implementation of a project has financial implications hence this matter must be handled with the seriousness it deserves,” Kaluma said.
Homa Bay County Kenya Power Manager Ken Okumbe said his office is aware of the stalemate and has given the contractor a quotation of the fee he is supposed to pay to facilitate the relocation of the power lines.
“It is true they reported the matter to our office. We gave them the quotation for rerouting the power line but they have not paid,” said Okumbe.
The project aims at establishing a library with a capacity of 500 students, an amphitheatre that can accommodate 1,000 people, an ICT hub and a creative centre with a recording studio.
Construction of the resource centre was expected to take 18 months, from December 21 when the groundbreaking ceremony took place.
The local NG-CDF contributed Sh50 million towards the project.
A 77-year-old woman from East Kolwa in Kisumu East Sub-County has been taking care of abandoned teenage mothers and widows for 25 years now.
Florence Otieno says the initiative has enabled her to “give a second chance to a vulnerable group of women”.
Otieno first put up the rescue centre at her home in 1996 after being involved in a road accident, which left her partially paralysed.
“The crash made me discover that life can be lost within a second. Due to that fact, I pledged to make the society I live in a better place by helping the vulnerable. In this case, it is majorly teenage mothers and the widows,” she told The Standard.
The septuagenarian has thus far rescued 38 teenage mothers, and at least 12 widows.
As the number of girls increased in her rescue centre, so did her financial responsibility.
Otieno said she, consequently, had to devise new survival methods.
“I set aside a parcel of land for farming. The widows and the teenage mums would farm commercial crops, which we’d sell and use the proceeds to feed and clothe ourselves,” she said.
Other girls diversified into sandal, shoe and handbag-making business.
They use material from water hyacinth harvested from Lake Victoria to make the products.
The money raised under this initiative is used to finance the girls’ education.
Teenage pregnancies continue to be a headache for national and county governments.
Data by the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) indicates two out of ten girls in the country aged between 15 and 19 years are either pregnant or have given birth.
In Kisumu County, a multi-sectoral group headed by ODM leader Raila Odinga’s wife, Ida Odinga, is at the forefront in raising awareness against premarital sex.
Otieno says her initiative has helped prevent some of the young girls in her centre from being exposed to sexual predators.
Benta Awino, a mother of two, is one of the beneficiaries of Otieno’s rescue programme.
Awino’s house in Orongo Village was recently deluged by heavy rains, which forced her to relocate. Otieno took the youthful widow in.
“I am thankful to Florence [Otieno] for starting this helpful cause,” she said with a light Duchenne smile.
More than 2,200 families in Migori and Homa Bay counties have been displaced by floods following heavy rains.
At Kakelo Kakoth location in Migori County, some 300 homes were submerged on Monday, forcing locals to move to safer grounds.
In Lower Karapolo, 60 households had been marooned by the floods while West Kanyuor location had 99 households affected by the floods.
According to Lower Central Kadem Chief Philip Orwa, areas around Kuja River such as Lwanda and Kuja were also flooded.
Nyor Primary School teachers from Lwanda had to wade through knee-high waters to get to the school.
Young pupils skipped school for fear of being carried away by floods.
The school’s headteacher Elisha Ondiek noted that learners from Kuja area had a hard time getting to school.
Kabuto Primary School, Nyora Primary School, Angugo Primary School and Molly Secondary School were also among the flooded schools.
Hundreds of families have been displaced in Rachuonyo North due to heavy rains which have pounded Homa Bay County in the last three days.
More than 100 households were displaced in Kogembo sub-location in Rachuonyo North sub-county.
The floods occurred after River Awach broke its banks.
According to Kogembo Assistant Chief Hezekiah Owino, the floods began on Monday night.
Simbi primary and Simbi secondary schools were also flooded.
At Nyapuodi village in Kanam A location in the same sub-county, hundreds of families were affected too.
“At Nyapuodi beach, four houses fell after heavy rains. Our roads are impassable,” said George Orimba, a local resident.
In Kobala sub-location in the same sub-county, many families were displaced after their houses were marooned by floods.
In Ndhiwa sub-county, hundreds of families were affected by floods after River Kuja broke its banks.
Residents have appealed to government agencies for humanitarian aid.
“We appeal to the government to intervene and rescue us,” said John Odiembo, a resident of Ndhiwa.
Meanwhile, farm produce worth millions of shillings has been destroyed in Naivasha due to heavy rains.
The most affected is Mirera estate off the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road.
The road between Mirera and Karagita was completely flooded, forcing motorists to seek alternatives routes.
Also rendered impassable was the road linking Kijabe Mission Hospital to Moi South Lake.
According to Njoki Nyanjui, one of the affected farmers, the flooding started on Sunday following heavy rains in the upper catchment area.
She said the waters had flooded their farms and roads, leaving a trail of destruction.
Njoki called on the county government to address the issue of drainage, terming it a major challenge facing the area.
According to a message sent by the Red Cross, there were indications that the ongoing rains could cause more floods in the region.
KeNHA warns motorists against using Goye crossing as floods wreak havoc
Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) has warned motorists against crossing Goye causeway due to the overflowing Lake Victoria.
According to KeNHA, the situation is as a result of the heavy rainfall pounding the Nyanza region, affecting sections of the Lake Victoria basin.
"Since there is no alternative access to Osieko, we wish to advise motorists along that section not to attempt crossing the overtopped section, and to only cross when water levels are low," said KeNHA.
The authority further warned trucks against using the crossing as they evaluate mechanisms of undertaking works on the structure.
Goye crossing, which was built in 1975, was estimated to operate for 20 years before a new one could be built.
On Wednesday, commuters were stranded for the better part of the day as they waited for the water levels to go down.
Onyango Oduma, a driver, told The Standard that he has not reported to work because of the condition of the road. "I've not been able to cross to the other side to get sand for my clients."
Oduma said the failure by the government to construct the bridge despite numerous complaints from the residents has led to the current situation, adding several operations have been affected.
Last week, transport along the busy road was paralysed for hours following an accident.
Residents called on the government to repair the road to save them costs they incur and the time they waste using the dilapidated road.
A truck overturned and blocked the road leading to a snarl-up.
A commuter, Dorothy Achieng who had an appointment at Got Agulu Hospital, said she was forced to walk for more than two kilometres.
Aggrey Ochieng, a resident, termed the road critical to the economy of the county and accused local leaders of neglecting it. “We have raised the issue with the MP, governor and KeNHA but nothing has been done.”
Elisha Odhiambo, a resident of Usenge Town, said they were spending a lot of money on car repairs.
Matatus and boda boda riders have also hiked fares, said Odhiambo.
Yesterday, KeNHA said that there were plans of constructing a permanent bridge.
"Procurement process is underway to solve the rising Lake Victoria water levels at that crossing," KeNHA said.
Five suspected terrorists arrested in Kisumu on Sunday have been transferred to Nairobi as detectives move to finalise investigations.
On Monday, a Kisumu court granted the police 10 more days to continue holding the suspects for interrogation.
Yesterday, detectives from the Anti-Terror Police Unit drove the suspects to their headquarters at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for further questioning.
The suspects are Jamal Muhamud, Abdul Razzaq, Nadeed Muhammad, Amin Muhammad and Younas Muhammad, all of Pakistani origin.
A detective privy to the investigations said that the suspects had travelled in two groups through the Kenya-Uganda border.
The suspects had done their best to shake off police officers before hawk-eyed officers nabbed two of them in Kombewa in Kisumu following a tip-off.
An interrogation of the suspects established that another group had also made its way in to Kenya and was on its way to Kericho.
This prompted police officers to mount a roadblock at Ahero and searched all vehicles from Kisumu.
“They were keen on escaping and even alighted at Ahero and started walking back when they learnt officers were on their trail,” said a detective privy to the investigations.
The detectives are also probing some of the people they might have contacted.
It is unclear whether they had intentions of carrying out attacks but the police indicated that their behaviour and some of the items they had aroused suspicion
A detective involved in the case said the suspects were found with "many" telephone gadgets and military regalia.
Yesterday, Kisumu County Commander Samuel Anampiu confirmed the suspects had been transferred to Nairobi.
“We transferred them to Nairobi for ease and convenience of processing,” said Anampiu.
The changing face of Siaya town thanks to devolution
The face of Siaya town has tremendously changed thanks to devolution that has not only attracted investors in the once sleepy, dusty town but seen the initiation of a number of projects.
Development projects are slowly changing the fortunes of the town that has struggled to find a footing despite it being the headquarters of the county but questions have been raised on the amount spent on some of the projects.
Siaya town has grown from a market formally known as Ahindi years ago to the district headquarters and now to county headquarters.
Among the projects changing the face of Siaya is the Sh340 million Siaya High Court building that is nearing completion.
Judiciary Chief Registrar Ann Amadi inspected the building last December and gave it a clean bill of health saying the works were almost complete.
The county government also recently spent Sh43 million on Ahindi Gardens and the governor’s park that were commissioned by Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa.
Wamalwa also commissioned the new Sh75 million county headquarters.
The county government has also spent Sh165 million on renovating the Siaya County Referral Hospital.
Governor Cornel Rasanga said another ongoing project is Sh400million ultra-modern stadium which is 90 per cent complete.
The Sh100 million street lighting project by National Government and tarmac roads within town that were part of the Siaya-Nyadorera highway project, have also contributed to the town’s new look.
Kennedy Onyango, a resident of Siaya town said some of the projects such as the street lighting project were as a result of the goodwill that had been bolstered by the Handshake between ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta.
John Odhiambo, also a resident, noted there was a big improvement on the face of Siaya but raised concerns on the cost of most of the projects, especially those done by the county government.
Walter Okello, the Lands chief officer said the county government has also started demolishing temporary structures to create order and improve the image of the town.
He added that there is need for residents with old buildings within the town to renovate them so they conform with the standards of a town.
We have currently stopped renewing leases of those with old buildings unless they are renovated.
“Those with temporary structures that will be demolished have also been showed a trading area within town where they are required to put up their business structures,” Okello said.
Professor Paul Achola, who is the chair of the municipality board in the county, says several years ago, Siaya was just a market and social centre but it has grown.
He said in 1940s, the current Siaya town was only known as Ahindi market where people came to purchase food and household products.
It was also a social centre for sporting activities before it became the district headquarters.
Rasanga said that the development projects are sufficient evidence that devolution is working.
“Evidently, the county government of Siaya continues to implement projects with a view of improving the socio-economic well-being of the citizens and changing the landscape of Siaya town,” Rasanga noted.
“My government’s partnership with the World Bank through Kenya Devolution Support Programme and Kenya Urban Support Programme have since seen us implement some key projects in the county.”
Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga was put in a spot for allegedly spending more money from the county emergency fund than the initial budget in the fight against Covid-19.
In a virtual meeting with the Senate Standing Committee on Health yesterday, Mr Rasanga was hard-pressed to explain where he got Sh115 million for Covid-19 related activities yet the money allocated to the county emergency fund was Sh100 million.
The Auditor General's special audit report on utilisation of Covid-19 funds by counties, flagged over-expenditure from the county emergency fund in Siaya.
“It was established that as of 31 July 2020, Sh115,884,928 had been committed for Covid-19 related activities which was against the approved budget allocated to the county emergency fund for Covid-19 purposes,” read the statement in part.
But the governor said the county only spent Sh100 million and not Sh115 million as the special audit report indicated.
There may be an error but I can confirm that we did not spend more than Sh100 million.
"I can confirm that all commitments were charged within the funds. There was no over expenditure,” Rasanga told the committee.
The Auditor General defended the report, saying there was proof of payment vouchers amounting to Sh115 million.
The committee questioned the conflicting information from the county and AG.
“So where did the Auditor General get the findings if the governor is insisting that the amount used was Sh100 million? Did the report come from the sky?” Posed Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina.
The committee chair Kisumu Senator Fred Outa however, demanded that the governor provides proof of expenditure.
“We will give you one week to provide evidence that you did not spend more than Sh100 million,” Mr Outa stated.
Siaya appropriated Sh270 million in respect to Covid-19 and related emergencies out of which Sh100 million was from the county emergency fund with the county receiving Sh60 million on July 3 and another Sh40 million on July 14 respectively.
Other funds received by the county are government conditional grants worth Sh97 million, Danida Sh6 million, national government health workers allowance Sh36 million and Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KSDP) Sh30 million.
Rasanga was also faulted for not spending KSDP and the government’s conditional grants in good time.
“As at the time of the audit the conditional grant and KSDP were still held in the Siaya county Covid-19 fund account and the Siaya County KSDP respectively. This was attributed to absence of approved budgets, work plans, and procurement plans to facilitate spending,” the report said.
The governor said the KSDP funds were used to purchase Covid-19 supplies.
Commitment for isolation which represented 71 per cent of the funds could only be paid out on completion of the isolation centres."
At the time of the audit, the funds had been committed and the service providers/contractors were at various stages of delivery/completion of isolation centres which had not reached the payments stage, and hence the un-utilisation of funds at that time,” he explained.
Student almost missed national test due to illness
Towards the end of 2020, Henry Madaga was down with complications related to ulcers.
He spent a number of weeks on treatment to the point of contemplating missing out on the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination.
But yesterday, Madaga, 18, was all smiles as Education CS George Magoha read his name as one of the top performers, after he scored an A plain, and emerged the eighth best countrywide.
The first-born in a family of five, who wants to become a doctor, was at his uncle’s clothes’ shop in Kisumu when the results were released.
The alumnus of Maranda High School said: “I did not know I would manage to sit the examination. The sickness put me down, but I thank God I overcome it.”
When The Standard caught up with him at the shop in Chichwa Market, he still appeared weak.
Persistence kept him going, he said, adding that he would like to join the University of Nairobi.
Paul Kaunda, who was Madaga’s head teacher at Kosau Primary in Kisumu County, was elated by the performance.
Madaga was Kosau’s best in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education.
“He didn’t have school fees to join Form One, and we asked the then Maranda principal to admit him,” Kaunda said.
A family in Ogango, Manga Sub-county in Nyamira, is in distress following the disappearance of their kin after he left school more than three months ago.
According to the boy’s mother, Jane Mirambo, the family was not aware that he was missing until two days after schools closed for the Easter holidays.
“I waited for Kevin to come home but he didn’t show up. When we went to school to inquire about his whereabouts, we were told he had not been seen for nearly the entire term,” the mother told The Standard.
She said they reported her son’s missing at Sengera Police Station under OB 7/23/0/2021.
Ever since, it has been a blame game between the school administration and the family over who should bear responsibility for the missing boy.
An exit sheet recorded by the school administration and which was shared with police shows that Kevin Machuki, a Form One student at Nyaisa SDA Mixed Day and Boarding School, had left the institution on January 10 to attend a funeral at home.
“We are not aware of any funeral at home this year. The report is untrue,” Anne Kemunto, the boy’s sister-in-law said.
Remarks on the records of official communication between the school administration and Kevin’s mother indicates she could not be reached on phone to be alerted that her son had secured an exit from school to attend a funeral at home.
However, a text message is said to have been sent to the parent to that effect.
“We could not deny the boy permission to attend a funeral, especially after he insisted he had to. After desperately trying to reach the mother on phone, we decided to let the boy go."
"A follow-up when he failed to report back a few days later was difficult since the mother could not be reached. The parent’s phone was off all the time,” Tobias Omollo, the school principal, said.
According to Mr Omollo, the parent should have made a follow-up at school after receiving the text message alerting them that their boy had been allowed out of school.
“We alerted the parent through an SMS after we failed to reach them. Why did they not respond in time after the boy failed to arrive home? We made another follow-up but there was no response,” he said.
The school head said their records show that on February 2, 2021, the mother went to school and paid Sh4,000 fee, but never sought to know his whereabouts or even inquire about his progress from the class teacher.
“It is a normal procedure that whenever a parent goes to his child’s school, he or she seeks a class teacher to inquire about their progress or even drop some pocket money for them."
"In Kevin’s case, he never had any money in the bursar’s pocket money account,” Omollo said.
But the mother said on the day she went to pay the fees, the students were sitting exams, and that was why she never inquired about her son.
The claim was, however, contradicted by the school records.
A copy of the school’s official academic calendar that was shared with police probing the matter indicates that students were not sitting exams on the said day.
Exams were conducted between February 9 and February 12, and not February 2, as the mother claimed.
Manga Police Commander Gabriel Mwangangi said the file on Kevin’s disappearance had been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
“We heard both parties and we have done investigations and made our recommendations, which we have forwarded to the DPP. It is evident that there was laxity somewhere, but it’s upon the DPP to make a determination on the case,” Mwangangi said.
Kemunto described Kevin as a calm person who had few friends.
“He was always quiet and very conservative. He has never been involved in any vices or bad company,” Kemunto said.
The family is appealing to anyone who could be having information on the whereabouts of the teenager to report to any police station.
Stop using Otiende’s ouster to divide ODM, Kaluma warns party opponents
Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma on Sunday, May 9 accused ODM political enemies of using the recent removal of Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo from a parliamentary committee to divide the party.
Speaking at Ogande Girls High School when he supervised the implementation of development projects by the NG-CDF in his constituency, Kaluma accused ODM opponents of blowing the matter out of proportion to taint the party’s image.
“There are people who take advantage of Otiende’s removal to create unnecessary division in the party. They invoke issues which never existed between the MP and the ODM party leadership,” Kaluma said.
Kaluma said it was wrong to blame ODM because of making changes in a parliamentary committee, adding that such changes were normal procedures.
“It is normal for a political party to change its members in a parliamentary committee hence the recent change in JLAC should not be an issue,” he said.
Kaluma said Otiende’s removal should not be misunderstood to be punishment by ODM as some people are trying to portray it.
He said Otiende still wields membership of the powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) committee in Parliament.
He said Rarieda MP should have been removed from the PAC if ODM had issues with him.
“If ODM leader Raila Odinga was in Parliament, he would be the one chairing PAC committee because this is a highly valued committee headed by an opposition leader. But Otiende’s membership in the committee means ODM values him,” Kaluma said.
The MP told ODM supporters and residents of Nyanza region where Otiende hails from to be wary of the enemies.
“The enemies are out to divide us as a party and as a community but let us stand firm to withstand their dirty plans,” Kaluma said.
Otiende was recently removed from the vice-chairmanship of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) in the National Assembly and replaced by Ruaraka MP Tom Kajwang’ over his stance on the Building Bridges Initiative Bill.
He told Nyanza residents to be ready for a referendum after the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Constitutional Amendment Bill 2020 was approved by parliament.
He said time had come for Kenyans to have a new Constitution.
“We are soon going to start campaigns because we are likely to hold the referendum in August this year. Let our people be ready,” Kaluma said.
He said the Bill will help fight corruption by compelling the Judiciary to conclude graft cases within a period of one year after being filed.
Male nurse arrested in Siaya for defiling Form Two student
Police in Gem, Siaya County on Friday, May 7, questioned a male nurse for allegedly defiling a Form Two student.
The nurse based at a health dispensary in Gem sub-county was, however, released because of insufficient evidence.
The nurse is reported to have committed the offence on May 2, but other sources indicated he was having an affair with the minor.
Gem sub-county police boss Charles Chacha said they have launched investigations, and that police were trying to piece the evidence together to build a case against the nurse.
He said the nurse denied knowledge of the girl, adding that he was dating an older lady different from the one in question.
"We arrested, questioned the nurse and released him. We have taken the minor to two different health facilities in Siaya and Gem for medical reports but they found nothing tangible that can help us with the investigations," he said.
Chacha said members of the public found the nurse with the 17-year-old girl in his vehicle which was parked near a bush.
"The investigations may have dragged a little because we did not receive this report at the right time. The parents had first reported to the area chief. They have been trying to solve the matter away from the authorities but pressure from the residents is the reason we got this case," said Chacha.
He added: " Most parents have made it difficult for their defiled children to get justice after opting for an out-of-court settlement with the offenders. This is unfair to the victim."
Chacha said after learning about the incident, they traced the girl and his parents and took her to the hospital.
"We cannot arrest him and take him to court yet due to lack of evidence. The girl has been denying everything. She denied knowledge of the nurse when we questioned her," added the sub-county commander.
He said police are still investigating the matter and will ensure the minor gets justice.
Nyamira County leadership has been put under task to explain how the devolved unit lost Sh2.8 billion in salaries allegedly paid to ghost workers in the financial year 2018/2019.
The burden of the illegal employment that six years ago put Nyaribo in roguer heads with his then boss, the late John Nyagarama resurfaced Friday afternoon, this time round putting Nyaribo in a tight corner with the county's oversight body.
The recruitment of the alleged staff led to an increase of Sh3 million paid out as salaries every month. The said employees are said to have been employed without due process.
Committee chairman Achilo Ayako who is the Senator Migori tasked the Governor to explain how the County got to a point of recruitment staff without following the right process including placing an advert and allowing the County Public Service Board to carry out interviews.
“These are human beings that should be available physically. This is a mess that occurred more than two years ago but the County Government lacks basic documents to support an irregularity that was committed.”
Governor Nyaribo did confirm that there were no proper records to help him trace the alleged ghost workers. “I have commissioned a staff audit process to help unearth the mess that might have been committed.”
The County Public Service Board Chairman Dr Peter Kereri was also at pains to explain whether the said 736 employees were duly employed or not.
Dr Kereri confirmed that the employment of the said staff was done by the County Executive.
I had not reported to the office at the time but can confirm that there was communication between the board and the executive on the need to employ subordinate staff and some enforcement officers.
However, he was not able to table the names of the employed staff nor could he confirm the number of the people who were employed at the time.
Nyamira Senator Okongo Mogeni said the reinstatement of the 736 staff was done irregularly and through collusion between the County Government and some advocates by signing a consent.
“These people must appear in Court one by one and be charged. They must provide their employment letters to prove that indeed they exist. This is a conspiracy that must be investigated. Somebody must have blocked the court process to have Nyamira residents save billions of money paid to ghost workers.”
He added: "There is no ruling over the case as it is being said here. What is filed is just a consent to end the case and reinstate the workers.”
Bomet Senator, Benjamin Langat who is also a member of the Committee observed that the County Government lacked proper documentation in almost every document.
“We want to pin the mess on the actual sinners. Who employed these people? Who mooted the idea to create the vacancies? If they were fired, where are the sacking letters? If they still exist, where do they work?”
The Governor was given 14 days to produce proper documentation to a number of queries that were also raised during the hearings.
The Committee has been sitting at the Kisii County Assembly hall for the past one week.
Migori Governor Okoth Obado who was set to be grilled on Thursday morning snubbed the committee hearings.
Homa Bay County Governor Cyprian Awiti also could not attend the hearings.
He was to appear before the committee on Friday morning.
Migori MCAs on Thursday, May 6, refuted claims that Majority Leader Ken Ouma and chief whip Kevins Keke were ousted because they are People’s Democratic Party (PDP) sympathisers.
PDP links rock Migori Assembly as MCAs oust majority leader, whip
County Assembly Speaker Boaz Okoth said out of 41 MCAs from ODM, 27 signed for the removal of the two.
The duo’s removal came after ODM MCAs served the speaker with a report containing the changes they wanted to be made.
According to Okoth, ODM MCAs resolved to elect Owiyo as Majority Leader and his East Kamagambo counterpart Nyawade as the assembly’s chief whip.
Masaba MCA Abedy Marowa accused the ousted Majority leader of delaying the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) motion in the assembly and that he was supporting the PDP agenda.
"Members found that the ousted leaders were bankrolling PDP issues," claimed Marowa.
West Kanyamkago MCA Peter Mijungu described the ousted Majority leader as the greatest PDP sympathiser.
Ouma (South Sakwa Ward) and Keke (South Kamagambo) were on Wednesday ousted in a heated session that has led to cracks in the assembly.
Ouma and Keke termed their removal as unfair, adding that those who pushed for their removal were ‘PDP sympathisers trying to woo locals’.
Ouma said his removal was intimidation after he questioned the misappropriation of funds.
Owiyo who is the newly elected Majority leader said ODM leaders in the assembly never had any meeting or consensus 'with a party called PDP'.
He said the process of restructuring the assembly leadership should not be politicised, adding that no member met any PDP officials.
"Members of ODM have a mandate and the obligation to choose the people they want and remove those whom they feel are not fulfilling their mandates. All that is being said is out of anger," said Owiyo said.
Nyawade said it was unfortunate that the reshuffling of the top seats was being linked to PDP sympathisers.
There has been political heat in Migori following the defection of Governor Okoth Obado to PDP.
ODM faulted Governor Obado’s defection to PDP with the MCAs, threatening to impeach him.
A man accused of killing a butcher man in Homa Bay County will be detained for seven days before being charged in court.
The suspect is accused of killing Martin Owiti in Rodi Kopany last Wednesday.
Police on Monday obtained court orders to continue detaining him pending completion of investigations.
In an affidavit sworn by Ben Wanyama who is attached to Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations, he said he was yet to record statements from witnesses.
“A postmortem examination on the deceased has not been done nor has the mental assessment of the suspect. I pray to the court to grant us seven more days to enable us complete investigations,” Wanyama told court.
Homa Bay Senior Principal Magistrate Thomas Obutu granted the orders.
The butcher was reportedly stabbed with a knife inside his butchery at about 9.35pm on Wednesday. The motive of the attack is unknown. Owiti’s body was moved to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary.
A driver who was sacked by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology has been awarded Sh342,316 for a breach of his contract.
Justice Stephen Radido of the Kisumu Employment and Labour court observed that Edwin Mutanda was fairly sacked for forging a work ticket and his argument that he was being victimised because he was a union official was untenable.
“The court finds that the summary dismissal of Mutanda was fair. But I will award him a sum for the breach of his employment contract,” said the judge last week.
Mutanda alleged that he was victimised on the grounds of his being a deputy secretary of the Kenya Universities Staff Union (KUSU) and for having agreed to be a witness in a criminal complaint against the vice-chancellor.
The university, however, contended that his dismissal was based on his negligence and careless performance of his duties. The particulars given were that he falsified a work ticket.
The court found out that the entries in the work ticket were deliberate and were meant to claim a higher daily subsistence allowance.
Mutanda challenged the university’s disciplinary process on several grounds, including that the committee was not properly constituted because “it was co-chaired by the VC and was thus biased.”
He also argued that trade union officials present during the hearing of his case did not represent his interest in the true letter and spirit of unionism.
The hearing of a case in which Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has been accused of destroying a tea plantation worth Sh2 million was adjourned after he failed to appear in court over Covid-19 fears.
Mr Sang was expected to appear in person for the start of the hearing of the case.
Prosecution had lined up four witnesses to testify against him.
The governor’s lawyer June Maasai yesterday told Senior Resident Magistrate Beryl Omollo his client had exhibited Covid-19 symptoms and was in isolation.
The accused was in close contact with the deceased when the deceased was still in hospital.
He was also in contact with some relatives during the burial preparations.
The court heard that the government had since conducted Covid-19 tests on officials and eight samples had turned positive.
The prosecution and lawyers representing the complainants in the case had protested over delays in the hearing of the case and claimed it had stalled for more than two years.
The prosecutor, Sylvester Thuo, backed the push to have the matter adjourned, but raised concerns over the slow process.
The magistrate granted Sang an adjournment but directed that the court be supplied with a medical report on the governor’s health within two weeks.
“The matter was first brought to court on June 2019. It now qualifies as a backlog,” said Thuo.
“The hearing date will be fixed on the next mention date,” said Omollo.
Aman burned a relative's cow after he was denied a cup of milk in Bomwagamo, Nyamira County.
Nyambiri assistant chief Peter Oyange said the assailant later surrendered to the police and confessed to burning the lactating cow in the shed after being denied a cup of milk.
The cow died in the inferno.
Mr Oyange is said to have executed the awful incident at around 4am on Tuesday while the owners were asleep.
It is yet to be established what charges police plan to charge the suspect with.
Nyamira County Commissioner Amos Mariba said there are concerns over rising cases of substance abuse among the youth that has contributed to an increase in cases of lawlessness in the county.
"We suspect such incidences could be linked to substance abuse among young people. Our fight against the vice is a notch higher and we hope to bring the situation under control," Mariba said.
This is the second incident involving the maiming or killing of animals to happen in the area within a period of less than two months.
In March, an unknown person moved into an elderly woman's homestead and slashed her pregnant heifer’s hind legs, rendering it immobile.
The once vibrant Yala town is now in the doldrums after the closure of Odera Akang’o College campus that gave it a lifeline.
When the campus that was a constituent college of Moi University was shut in 2019, the livelihoods of more than 50,000 people was affected.
The town, situated along Kisumu-Busia highway in Gem Sub-county, suffered as a result of closed businesses, deserted restaurants and vacant rental houses.
Business people and residents now say the town has lost its glory.
“A lot of traders have closed their businesses,” said Peter Adhaya, chairman of Yala Young Traders Association.
“When the university was still operating, business was good. Students would do everything within Yala town. Now rental houses have been converted to guest rooms, but there are no customers,” said Mr Adhaya.
Those who had shops and eateries around the hostels and the university were the worst-hit.
Businessman Asis Awan, 62, who was born in Yala town, said businesses in the area have gone down by 50 per cent since the closure of Odera Akang’o College.
Awan said business people who spent millions of shillings to put up rental houses and hostels are counting losses since some of them had taken loans.
He revealed that his hardware business has not been spared as construction projects have stalled or gone down.
Mr Awan, a member of the National Committee of Chamber of Commerce and Siaya branch representative, said there was no hope of businesses getting better.
Agnes Achieng, a vegetable vendor who had a stall just opposite the college where several hostels are situated, said she had to move to the market centre to start all over again.
“I stayed at home for two months trying to strategise. My vegetable business collapsed in 2019. I had a stall where most of the students were living and when all of them finally left, my business collapsed,” said Achieng.
The campus was launched in 2008 as a satellite campus with only 32 students.
The college did not receive government-sponsored students from Moi University for some years, but managed to admit privately sponsored learners.
Before its closure, the college had received an ultimatum from the Commission of University Education that it risked closure if the management did not get 50 hectares of land for expansion after an inspection in 2016.
The Commission of University Education had given the campus a timeline of two years to ensure all the requirements were met by February 2018 when another inspection was to be conducted before a final decision was made.
Odera Akang’o College campus, which currently sits on six hectares, had 1,142 privately sponsored students at the time of its closure.
In a bid to beat the closure warning, the college had received 90 hectares in Nyamininia near Yala.
The county government committed Sh35 million two years ago to help improve, construct and refurbish the campus structures and it was to offer tuition scholarships to its staff in return.
However, Moi University administration pulled out, letting go all the workers who had remained at the campus, forcing it to close.
But there have been plans by other higher learning institutions seeking to take over the college.
Karachuonyo constituency ODM officials have told political leaders to end clan politics in Homa Bay County.
Addressing journalists at a Homa Bay hotel on Sunday, ODM chairpersons from the six wards in Karachuonyo Constituency and the constituency chair have denounced clan politics if the county is to elect a good governor.
The leaders were speaking after claims by some contenders that the Rachuonyo clan which comprises Karachuonyo, Kasipul and Kabondo-Kasipul constituencies will decide who becomes the next Homa Bay governor in 2022 because of their numerical advantage.
They argued that Rachuonyo clan has more voters than other clans in the county.
Kendu Bay Town Ward chairman Justus Osumba said the narrative is outdated and divisive, adding that cannot the county has eight constituencies.
He argued that three constituencies alone cannot make a candidate win a gubernatorial seat.
Osumba said there is a need for Rachuonyo clan to welcome gubernatorial candidates from other constituencies.
“We are only three constituencies hence our sons and daughters who want to vie for the seat cannot succeed without the support of voters from other constituencies,” Osumba said.
The senior citizen said clannism will deny the county good candidates for the County top seat, adding that all candidates are welcomed to the larger Karachuonyo region.
“All those with desirable leadership qualities to ascend to power should do their campaigns across the county without discrimination,” said Osumba.
Karachuonyo Constituency Joshua Maena said politics of incitement and discrimination had been overtaken by events.
He said there is a need for politics of inclusivity to enable Homa Bay to get a good governor after the 2022 General Election.
“Let us stop discriminating people. This type of politics is obsolete,” said Maena.
He cautioned leaders against branding others as 'outsiders' during politics to achieve their selfish political interests.
“You find a man who has lived in an area since childhood is branded an outsider when he ventures into politics. Segregation is wrong,” Odero said.
Some of the political leaders who are eyeing the county gubernatorial include Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata, Woman Rep Gladys Wanga, County Secretary Isaiah Ogwe, businessman Jared Otieno, former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, KUPPET Secretary General Akello Misori, ODM National Chairman John Mbadi and politician Luis Otieno.
They want to succeed Governor Cyprian Awiti who is serving his second term.
Two children were killed after their house collapsed at Ururi village, Bondo Sub-County, on Saturday morning.
The two, Juliana Achieng', 2, and Mary Achieng’,12, were sleeping in the house together with their parents when the incident happened.
Their father, Fredrick Achieng’, who survived the tragedy, told The Standard that the incident happened at around midnight.
"Our roof was first blown off before the walls collapsed on us, killing our two children," said Achieng’.
He said villagers who rushed to the scene after they heard screams rescued them.
He appealed to well-wishers to help him get shelter and meet the burial expenses for his two children.
The bodies were taken to Bondo sub-county hospital mortuary.
The late Keziah Obama has today been laid to rest at her Kogelo village in Siaya county.
The late Keziah was the mother of former US President Barack Obama’s half-brother, Malik Abong’o Obama.
She died on April 13, 2021, while receiving treatment at a UK-based hospital.
Mama Keziah was the spouse of the late Barack Obama senior. She was 78 years at the time of her death.
Her body arrived in Kenya on Friday morning before it was transported to Kogelo where she was buried.
Malik, who is the eldest son while speaking on behalf of the family eulogised his mother as a loving and responsible woman.
Among leaders who attended the burial were; Siaya Deputy Governor James Okumbe, Senator James Orengo and Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo.
Speakers eulogised mama Keziah as an inspiring woman, who had brought up a great family.
Orengo said his relationship with the Obama family dates back to the years when Senior Barack Obama was alive.
He described the late Senior Obama as a reputable economist.
Orengo said the late Senior Obama was among the team of economic specialists who worked on the sessional paper number 10 of 1969 that guided the development of Kenya for decades.
"He was a great scholar who did his studies in several universities and later returned to Kenya where he worked as an economist in the Ministry of economic planning. He worked with other great ministers who were also my friends like the late Tom Mboya," he said.
MP Otiende said the Obama family has elevated Kenya to the international map by producing the first black president in the US.
"This is one family that has given us so much pride. We are on the international map because of them. Their son, former US President Obama put us on an international map," noted Otiende.
Deputy Governor Okumbe also described the Obama's as a great family that had uplifted not only the image of the country but Siaya county as well.
Okumbe said he is a friend to the family through Auma Obama who was his great friend.
"Auma and I have done a lot of development projects, especially for the Kogelo family. She has always invited me for her functions for the community where she gives back through projects," added Okumbe.
The late Mama Keziah was buried a few minutes after 1pm in accordance with the Muslim rites.
Two security guards were on Thursday night brutally murdered at Ndondi market centre in Alego Usonga, Siaya County.
Baragulu assistant chief Maurice Abudha said they also found the body of another watchman who was manning a building with a shop and a bar.
The two were manning a local bar and hardware store at the market centre.
"The two watchmen were killed by robbers who broke into the shop and hardware store. They got away with a lot of goods from both the shop and hardware store," he said.
The bodies of the two watchmen had deep machete cuts on the head.
Siaya OCPD Bernard Muriuki said the police had launched investigations to nab the culprits.
"I cannot give details at this time. We have just started the investigation," he said.
Meanwhile, residents in the area have called for increased police patrols, citing increasing cases of insecurity.
Martha Awino, a businesswoman at the centre, said several shops were broken into and goods stolen last month.
She said a watchman was killed at the market centre last year.
The perennial water shortage in Homa Bay town will finally end after the Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency (LVSWWDA) purchased Sh200 million water distribution equipment to fix it.
The equipment imported from Belgium includes steel water pipes, water pumps and other items used for constructing water supply systems.
LVSWWDA chairperson Dan Omino and Homa Bay Water Sewerage and Sanitation Company managing director Evans Nyagol received the consignment on Thursday, April 29.
Omino said the equipment will complete a mega water project christened, Homa Bay Cluster Water Supply Project, funded by the National Government in collaboration with Belgium through the LVSWWDA.
Homa Bay town, the administrative headquarter of the county, face shortage with the current water treatment plant producing only 2.5 million litres per day instead of the required 5 million litres.
Omino said once completed, the new project will produce 8.8 million litres of water per day.
He said the project will meet the needs of the growing population of the area residents for the next 20 years.
“This project will produce excess water which will take care of the needs of the growing population for the next 20 years. This means a shortage of water can only occur in this area after two decades,” said Omino.
Omino added that the project will majorly use solar energy to pump the water.
“Electricity will only be used where there is no solar energy. But we intend to rely on solar,” he said.
The major component of the project encompasses piping of water from Lake Victoria to a treatment plant to produce clean water which is to be pumped to the residents’ taps for consumption.
He said the agency is about to complete another component of the project in Rodi Kopany Township which will produce 400,000 litres of water through two boreholes
Nyagol said pumping of water using solar will prevent huge electricity bills which had impeded their efforts in the past.
The electricity bills had frequently disrupted the water supply when Kenya Power disconnected their power supply.
“We are going to supply water stably upon completion of this mega project and water shortage will be history here,” Nyagol said.
He told residents to be ready to receive water from the project.
The project which started in March 2019 is expected to end in November this year.
The Nubian community has called on authorities to improve conditions at a field in Kolwa, Kisumu County, where they are living in makeshift structures after they were evicted from a disputed land.
They have also urged the county government to expedite the process of resettling them.
Kenya Railways (KR) has laid claim to the land in Kibos, which the Nubians say was given to them by the colonial government in 1937.
The field, next to Kisumu East CDF office, is prone to floods that have made life difficult, especially for the elderly.
KR accused them of encroaching on land meant for expansion of the railway line and forcefully evicted them.
The Nubians say their eviction was illegal.
They were moved to the land where they are currently living by the Kisumu City authorities.
“We had lived on the land since 1937 before we were forcefully evicted. It has been tough for some of us, especially those of us who are elderly,” said 82-year-old Khadija Rajab.
The 850 people have been living in deplorable conditions for three months now since they were evicted from what KR says was a railway reserve.
“We did not expect this. But if we must move out so the railway can be expanded, then the government should compensate us,” she said.
Rajab said other than floods, they have to contend will mosquitoes and rodents.
She wondered why they were taken to the flood-prone field, a move she said has complicated their lives.
They have been depending on Kenya Red Cross Society, relatives and well wishers for food.
Abdi Asha, 39, called for justice saying KR had no right to take away their land.
“We are Kenyans by birth and deserve fair treatment,” Asha said.
Most of those living on the 18 acres belonging to the county government cannot fend for themselves.
Acting City Manager Abala Wanga said the county government has started the process of resettling the Nubians.
In the meantime, Wanga said they had built three tents to improve their living conditions and were in the process of controlling floods at the site.
Hassan Hussein, an elder, said they were happy the county government had started settling them, but urged the authorities to expedite the process.
Last month, the Environment and Land Court extended conservatory orders stopping KR from forcefully evicting the Nubians from the land.
This followed a petition by Fatuma Bilal, Rashid Sadii, Mohamed Abdulrahman, Mwanamisi Kinduli, Yaya Musa and Asaman Musa filed on behalf of the community.
Man killed by crocodile in Lake Victoria, another survives attack
A family in Wigwa village in Kisumu County has been left in grief after their kin was killed by a crocodile in Lake Victoria.
Gabriel Okoth Oduogo, 35, was on a fishing expedition in the company of his friend when the incident happened at Nyandiwa beach.
His friend survived the attack but the incident caused panic all the way to Dunga beach where the fishermen trade.
Eyewitnesses said the crocodile emerged from a nearby papyrus weed on the shoreline before it attacked the deceased by grabbing him.
''He was attacked by the reptile in the morning in the company of others who had gone to lay fishing nets to harvest fish,” Saitoti Ayoro said.
He cried for help as his shaken colleagues ran for their lives before they gathered courage a few minutes later to hurl stones at the reptile as it swam and dived in the water.
The fishermen later swam to safety at Dunga beach where they reported the incident to the locals and Kenya Wildlife Service(KWS) personnel who dashed to the scene in search of the body.
This is the second time a crocodile has attacked a fisherman in the lake in less than a month and more intriguingly from the same family.
According to the deceased sister Caroline Owuor Oduogo, just two weeks ago, one of her brothers Nick Owino Oduogo was attacked by a crocodile while on a fishing expedition.
Owino luckily escaped with injuries after the crocodile attacked him while fishing in the lake in the broad daylight.
His father Joseph Oduogo was at pains to come to terms with the tragedy.
He said he got the sad news while visiting Owino who suffered injuries on his leg and hand that were mauled by the reptile.
''One of Owino's fingers was bitten as he struggled to free himself from the tight grip of the crocodile’s jaws and now again his brother has been killed by the reptile. Why does this happen to my family,'' he sobbed.
He recalled it was just by good luck that Owino's colleagues who were on the boat by then tying a rope responded by pelting the reptile head with huge stones and a panga.
The victim was rushed to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Referral Hospital where he is undergoing treatment after his lucky escape as the search for Okoth's body continued.
Owino's sister Owuor, said her brother was still writhing in pain in a hospital bed and had lost a lot of blood due to excessive bleeding from the mauled hand and leg.
"He needs three pints of blood because he bled a lot," said Owuor.
County police commander Samwel Anampiu said he had deployed security personnel to control crowds building at the scene.
Dunga Beach Management Unit chair Joel Otieno blamed the attacks by crocodiles on an increase in fishing activities in the lake.
wo men were on Thursday arrested in Migori while transporting bread alleged to be lighter than the industrially accepted weight.
The suspects, a driver and a salesperson, were transporting the loaves of bread in 50 crates from a Kisii bakery.
The bread was to be supplied to shops and supermarkets in Migori Town.
Residents had filed complaints about the weight of bread they had been buying from local shops, stating the brand from the Kisii bakery was “notorious” for selling them low-weight bread.
The consumer protection department officers laid a trap with police and impounded the vehicle as soon as it arrived in Migori Town.
When 770 samples of the packaged loaves were weighed, the scale indicated that each loaf was 365 grams instead of the industrially-accepted 400 grams.
The inspector in charge of commercial goods weight in Migori, Tobias Nyakamo, told The Standard that the suspects will be charged with contravening Part Six of the Consumer Protection Act.
The Ministry of Trade in Migori said it will conduct impromptu inspections to ensure goods sold to consumers meet the requisite standards.
The Consumer Protection Act allows the Consumer Protection Department to investigate complaints relating to false or misleading representations, unconscionable conduct as well as supply of unsafe, defective and unsuitable goods.
The Department also investigates undertakings that fail to comply with prescribed Consumer Product Safety Standards and prescribed Product Information Standards
Consumers can complain directly to the Authority through Email, telephone call,s or walking into the Authority’s offices.
The consumer is required to fill in a consumer complaint form and provide all the relevant information concerning the complaint.
On receipt of a consumer complaint, the Consumer Protection Department will acknowledge receipt of the complaint and advise the consumer on any information gaps.
Upon receipt of all the information from the complainant, the Authority shall analyse the complaint and contact the accused party for information if necessary.
The Authority may then apply administrative remedies to solve the complaints which include: refund, replacement or repair of goods, withdrawal of misleading representations, recall of unsafe goods and notices to the public on the existence of such goods.
Complaints that do not fall under the Authority’s jurisdiction are referred to the relevant Government Agencies.
Complaints that are not solved under the above arrangement are forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) after the completion of full investigations.
Upon conviction, a person who contravenes the Part Six provisions of the Act is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to a fine not exceeding Sh10 million or both.
A miner has died and 300 families were displaced by floods following heavy rains that have hit Migori County.
Most of those affected are from North Kadem ward in Nyatike sub-County. They are currently camping in schools and churches.
The victims said they have also lost property, including livestock, that was swept away by floods.
West Kanyuor chief Philip Opolo said flooding got worse after Migori and Kuja rivers broke their banks, and expressed fears more people will be displaced.
He said a gold miner, identified as George Oriedo, died on Monday evening after walls of a mine in Mikeyi collapsed on him.
Witnesses said Oriedo went into the mine soon after the rains had stopped then the accident happened.
“The walls of the mine had been weakened by the water. They collapsed and he suffocated,” Jared Nyakie, a head teacher at Ndemra Primary School, said.
“The floods have affected livelihoods. We are appealing for relief food to feed those affected,” chief Opolo said.
He added that the floods have not halted the construction works of a Sh1.7 billion road in the area.
Engineers working on the 42-kilometre Masara-Sori road have however been forced to seek government approval to redesign a section of the road, around North Kadem ward, that is affected by the floods.
Nyanza Regional Commissioner Magu Mutindika said 25 kilometres have been turned into bitumen standard road.
The remaining 17 kilometres will form part of what would be redesigned.
“The area has been affected by floods and this has forced the contractor and government engineers to seek approvals to redesign that part of the road,” Mutindika said.
He said the redesigned road will see flood waters escape through culverts.
“The works will include diversions and more gravelling in affected areas,” he said.
Two suspects charged with manslaughter in a case where a 10-storey building collapsed in Kisii killing eight people in November 2016 have been freed.
Jeremiah Matoke and Jeff Ocharo faced eight counts of manslaughter.
They were accused that on November 10, 2016, at Kisii Municipality block 111/236 in Kisii town, they unlawfully and negligently caused the deaths of the eight people.
Kisii Chief Magistrate Nathan Lutta noted that in a criminal case, the duty was always on the prosecution to prove its case against an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
“From the evidence produced in court, it is not demonstrated that the said parcel belongs to the accused,” Lutta said.
Patrick Achoki, the County Director of Physical Planning, said an inspection on the collapsed building was done in September 2014.
At the time, Achoki said they did not have a record of approved buildings. “We requested the owner to submit the plans, which were later approved.”
The then National Construction Authority regional manager, Lucas Adwera, testified that they visited the site in July 2016 and found out that there was a lack of compliance and immediately issued a suspension notice.
The accused persons, however, denied the offences saying they were not the developers of the said property.
With the ruling, the affected families will be forced to explore other means to get justice.
Burundi President to attend Madaraka Day celebrations
Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye will jet into the country on Monday, May 31 to attend Tuesday’s Madaraka Day celebrations.
According to sources within the government, President Ndayishimiye might be the only foreign Head of State to grace the ceremony, which will be held in Kisumu County.
East African Community (EAC) recently named President Ndayishimiye as rapporteur while President Kenyatta was chosen as the community’s chairperson.
In June 2020, President Kenyatta congratulated Ndayishimiye on his election as President and pledged to work with him, saying Burundi was Kenya’s valued development partner.
The visit comes after a similar one to Uganda on May 13 to woo Ugandan investors to invest in Burundi.
This year’s Madaraka Day celebrations will be an invite-only event as part of the Covid-19 measures.
Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said only 3,000 guests have been invited to attend the celebrations.
“Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium can accommodate 35,000 people, however, we have only invited 3,000 which is about 10 per cent of the entire capacity. This is in line with the Covid-19 protocols,” said Governor Nyong’o.
This is the first time Kisumu will host a national ceremony.
Previously, the holidays were presided over in Nairobi until the Jubilee regime revised the trend to rotate the celebrations in counties.
Madaraka Day is celebrated every year on June 1 to commemorate the day Kenya attained internal self-rule in 1963 after colonisation from Britain.
Rescue efforts on following collapse of county building in Nyamira
Rescuers were last evening working against time to find survivors after the collapse of a Nyamira County Assembly building that was under construction.
By 6.30pm, 25 workers out of 35 that were working at the site before it came tumbling down had been rescued.
The building at the county assembly collapsed minutes past 5pm.
Nyamira County Commissioner Gikaro Mariba told The Standard on phone that authorities were doing all they could to rescue those trapped.
"The rescue mission is ongoing. Locals and a combined team of government rescuers are on site to help those trapped," Mariba said.
The staircase to the four-storey building collapsed as the workers prepared to leave the site after the day's work.
The main road in Kitutu Masaba constituency has for a long time been used as a political carrot to woo locals into voting for politicians who pledge to tarmac it.
For over three decades, the Amabuko-Rigoma-Magombo-Kemera road has made and unmade politicians, as many have used it as a campaign tool.
Nearly all the MPs who have been elected from Kitutu Masaba have pledged to have the road tarmacked from Kemera town, where it connects with the Kisii-Nyamira-Chemosit road to Amabuko shopping centre where it joins the Kisii-Keroka-Sotik-Nairobi highway.
It is not only MPs who have used the road as a political tool to win votes from residents; other leaders who have been eyeing other political seats have also used it.
The late President Daniel Moi, retired President Mwai Kibaki and President Uhuru Kenyatta all used it as a campaign tool.
During Moi’s era, the road was marked for upgrading to bitumen standard but this did not happen because of the political winds of the time. Former area MP, the late George Anyona, became a fierce critic of Moi.
At one time, Anyona had promised to repair the road but because of lack of political goodwill from the government, that did not happen.
President Kibaki also pledged to have it finished around 2010, but the road was never upgraded.
Having the road tarmacked remained a pipe dream until 2013 when the work began.
Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto, while campaigning in 2013 ahead of the General Election, also earmarked the project for construction.
And in 2017, construction works on the road stalled at Gekano Tea Buying Centre after the contractor terminated the works.
The other section near River Gucha bridge and a 15-kilometre stretch remain incomplete.
Area MP Shadrack Mose has been fighting to have the road completed before his term expires. His plan seems to succeed as a contractor is already the site to do the job.
Currently, survey works are being carried out by a Chinese company, which was given the contract.
“This is a very important road, which no one can ignore. Tea farmers in the area have faced difficulties in transporting their produce to the factories because of the poor state of the road. Such challenges will soon be a thing of the past,” Mose said.
Residents say completion of the road will give the area MP an upper hand in the 2022 polls.
“Mose will have higher chances of re-election if he pushes the government to finish the project before next year,” said Peter Mokua, a resident of Gekano.
Oscars pushed back to April 2021 as film industry scrambles to adapt amid coronavirus
Film's most prestigious award has had to be postponed after the industry took a major blow amid coronavirus.
The Oscars ceremony for 2021 has been shifted back by nearly two months after the majority of films since March this year had to be put on hold.
It has been moved from a February 28th to an April 25th date.This move should accommodate early 2021 releases, delayed because of the pandemic.
President of the Academy, David Rubin, and CEO Dawn Hudson, said of their decision: “For over a century, movies have played an important role in comforting, inspiring and entertaining us during the darkest of times.
"Our hope, in extending the eligibility period and our awards date, is to provide the flexibility filmmakers need to finish and release their films without being penalized for something beyond anyone's control."
The new date’s means nominations will be announced on March 15th 2021, with the submission deadline for general entry categories (which includes Best Picture) on January 15th.
It is yet another blow to music fans as Kenya mourns popular Benga artiste Erick Omondi who died of cancer in Bondo, Siaya County on Tuesday morning.
The death of the ex-member of the legendary Nabi Kings Band popularly referred to by his fans as "Long Lilo" has gutted his fans.
The 37-year-old father of three died at 4:30 am while undergoing treatment at Bondo Sub-County Hospital.
His wife Goretty Awino and family spokesperson Olima Gondi confirmed the death.
Long Lilo thrilled his fans with his husky voice and engaging lyrics during his prime days when he sang alongside Osito Kalle, another legendary Luo Benga icon who trained him.
Some of his hit songs include Goretti Awino, Were wuod Ogalo, Okoth Mang’ang’a, Kong’o shida, Anita Nyausonga , Thomas Mwaya and any more. In his song Japuonj, Omondi praises Osito Kalle for his ability to nurture other singers like himself, Odhiambo Tusker, Aluoch Pamba, Atommy Sifa, Ogina Koko (currently Ramogi FM presenter) and many others.
Odhiambo Tusker after graduating from the hands of Osito composed a hit song Jopuonj, a piece which praised the efforts of teachers in the society and received widespread acclamation among the Luo fan base.
Osito who mentored them also starred with other songs such as Lesna buoyo ma wiye, Asembo piny maber, Jaber jaula and much more.
Long’Lilo was reportedly ill with cancer for a long time and at some point was appealing for medical help.
His death comes barely a week after Luo Ohangal fans were shocked with the sudden death of Abenny Jachiga who died in Kisumu abruptly and was buried with less than 48 yours against the wishes of his fans.
Nothing shakes the conscience of mankind than an unexplained death of a celebrity.
Ken Walibora was not your ordinary celebrity pushed to fame by benevolent spirits.
At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated Swahili writers in Kenya and one of the universally acclaimed authors.
Lovers of literature are pained not just by his death but the brutal manner in which it came.
Such death is reserved for troublesome characters in literary works.
In such extra ordinary circumstances, the people of Khabondi would seek solace in the emotive Luhya dirge “Olumbe luno toto lwakhabere lurungungwa, mana lukhaya khwira, ndakhaluwere ing’ombe!” translated to mean “If death could be paid to spare someone, I would have given death a cow”.
Admittedly, I have never physically met Walibora.
I first knew him in Standard Seven in primary school when my Kiswahili teacher Peter Busolo insisted that I read Siku Njema and explain the synopsis to him in seven days.
By that time, Siku Njema was a compulsory Kiswahili set book in secondary school, but here was a village-bred juvenile being asked to interpret it.
Mr Busolo understood the kind of books that would inspire students’ passion.
That was the last time he asked me to read any of Walibora’s books.
I took it upon myself to monitor the author’s publications and read them.
Walibora was a gifted story teller who understood an African village with magic.
Our continuous interaction has been through his works.
His characters lived among us.
Walibora wrote about things that we could see in our daily lives as students. Most of his characters were an inspiration.
I drew quite a number of lessons from Walibora’s works that have guided me to date.
In his master piece Siku Njema, Walibora demystifies the long held African concept of illegitimate children with a single phrase “Mwanaharamu hamna, kitendo ndicho cha haramu” to mean “there is no illegitimate child, it is the act that is illegitimate”.
Walibora’s main character in Siku Njema, Msanifu Kombo happens to be such a child. Through him, we are exposed to traumatising experiences that single mothers and their children go through.
The contempt with which society treats such children, and above all, their determination to succeed amid such challenges.
Perhaps it is because of his humble upbringing or the strict Christian upbringing under Jehova’s Witness denomination.
In my teaching of Children Law, I have found myself citing Walibora more than any other literary scholar.
His contribution to jurisprudence cannot be gainsaid.
As a lawyer, I draw inspiration from Walibora’s book Kufa Kuzikana, translated by Prof Egara Kabaji et al as “Friends for Life”.
In this text, a litigant who has made several trips to a lawyer’s office to claim money paid to the lawyer by an insurance company after an accident eventually commits suicide when the lawyer becomes uncooperative.
The mastery of African idioms runs through his works.
Such lawyers within the legal circles are known as ambulance chasers. They exist in every corner of this country; taking advantage of victims of accidents to mint millions of shillings.
My prayer is that the fate of Walibora’s characters will not befall him in death.
In such a society as ours, it calls for the courage and sobriety of men like Walibora to expose the social evils bedeviling mankind.
The social pretense, political expediency and economic marginalisation are some of the things that informed Walibora’s works.
The simplicity with which he told complex stories reveals the character of a man who was attached to society.
The soils will consume the finest brains of our land.
Literature can be very predictive. Many things that Walibora wrote about have come to pass.
His death and burial resemble that of the characters he wrote about.
In William Shakespeare’s words, my heart is in that grave where Walibora’s remains are being preserved.
Blessed are the soils of that quiet village in Cherangany, where Walibora was laid to rest.
To your fans, we shall remain friends wa Kufa Kuzikana as we wait for that Siku Njema that we shall join you wherever you are!
May his soul rest in peace.
Hyrax Hills National Museum, one of Kenya’s critical archaeological sites and a national monument is marking 100 years of existence this month.
The famous archaeological site which has since placed Kenya as home of Early Man opened its doors in 1920, to host rich history and has since inspired history and geography lessons in schools.
The museum was declared a national monument in 1945, but opened its doors to the public in 1965.
“This month marks 100 years of existence of this archaeological site that is just another classroom for thousands of learners across the country who visit,” Lilian Amwada, the museum’s curator said.
And while the museum has been a source of knowledge on early humans, the number of visitors touring the site has been low, a move which has also seen a raft of initiatives in place to boost the numbers.
“We have carried out renovations and also initiated talent programmes for children in a bid to make the young learners visit the museum more for key lessons,” Ms Amwada said.
Hyrax, is part of the part of the critical, geologically rich areas in Rift Valley that provides tales of historical footprints left behind by Early Man.
It also boasts of a rich history of volcanic activities and information on the formation of the Rift Valley.
The site, is also part of patches of archaeological sites that makes Kenya and especially the Rift Valley a hotbed of archaeological discoveries alongside Kariandusi Archeological site in Gilgil.
Particularly, Hyrax hills museum is named after hyraxes that lived in the rocks within and is famous for keeping the history of Sirikwa people who are believed to have been assimilated with the Maasai community.
The museum, has since been an archaeological research area and reference point for pre-historical investigations.
It is also believed to be the first Acheulian site to be discovered in the region.
Records from the museum however reveal low visitation despite the critical role in education sector with the bulk of visitors being learners.
In 2016, Hyrax Hills National Museum recorded 21,781 visitors of whom 17,667 were learners from primary, secondary and institutions of higher learning.
In 2018, the museum generated Sh1.6 million while in 2019, total revenues amounted Sh1.7 million.
The same year, the museum generated Sh1.8 million and the following year, the revenues dropped slightly to Sh1.6 million with over 23,000 visitors making to the museum.
Primary and secondary school learners mostly visit the museum with records showing that 12,169 learners from primary and secondary school visited the museum.
5,498 students from colleges and universities visited the museum the same year.
Locals visiting the museum are mostly couples visiting for nature trails.
With charges as low as Sh100 for an adult local citizen and Sh50 for a child charged in these sites, locals still miss out with visitors barely making to 30,000 in a year.
The Hyrax hills was proclaimed a national monument in 1945 and opened to public in 1965 but despite the significance it has, it has lost two and a half acres of its over 50 acres of land to squatters.
According to the National Lands Commission Nakuru County coordinator Frank Kimbelekenya, part of the land has been grabbed.
Covid-19 has given a new lease of life to an old song about social distancing.
Micah Maritim (pictured) the singer who composed the song 18 years ago, is also basking in new-found glory.
In the 10-minute song, Maritim warns about a certain incurable disease, urging his listeners to literally run to the hills for safety.
“Don’t let anyone touch you/ even when you are in bed sleeping/ Don’t brush shoulders with anyone even when you are walking around/ Don’t shake hands with anyone; and why should you? do you know that the person has come from or touched....?” Goes part of the chorus.
The 62-year-old singer from Bomet County is known for his social commentary.
He said he composed the uncharacteristically lengthy song in 2002.
“At the time, I was in Eldoret and television channels were awash with reports of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which had broken out in China and was spreading to other countries,” Maritim said.
“From the scary news clip I saw medics in protective gear attending to patients, and outside, police officers were chasing people off the streets. It was then that I decided to compose a song about this phenomenon.”
He says that he did not even sit down to write lyrics to the song titled “SARS”.
Maritim started singing in 1981 and has a repertoire of over 100.
He says he just entered the studio and “went with the flow”.
“What scared me was China’s directive outlawing spitting. I dreaded what would happen in Kenya if SARS got here, considering that members of the Kalenjin community have a habit of spitting all over the place,” Maritim said.
Though the song got considerable airtime, Maritim says he is surprised by the renewed interest in the song in the face of Covid-19.
The singer blasted Kenyans for disregarding the government directives on containment of Covid-19.
“The world managed to beat SARS and Ebola by adhering to prescribed safety measures. Here, we are just dancing with death,” he said.
When asked whether he was living up to his own message of staying safe as per his message in the song, he said: “My brother, have you spotted me in the streets lately? I have confined myself to my house as a matter of fact.”
Maritim argued that according to him there is no difference between SARS and Covid-19.
“It is the same disease, just diffident names. You just look at the symptoms and the origins and it’s the same thing.
“During SARS people were advised to practice social distancing and those infected were quarantined.
“We were also told to wash our hands and cover our mouths while coughing. Aren’t we now being told the same things?” he said.
The only difference he said is that people are now being asked to wear gloves for protection.
Maritim said since Covid-19 knocked the dust off his song, someone who was listening to it for the first time accused him of “bringing” the disease to Kenya.
“I did not ‘call’ the disease. I have never travelled to China. I just did a song to educate them to practice social distancing whenever the world is ravaged by a disease whose cure is not known,” he said, and called on Kenyans to heed the government’s directive on social distancing.
“If the government directs that there should be no handshaking, why should we defy such a simple order? Can’t we just salute like military officers and everyone goes his or her way. Why do we want to kill each other with foolishness?” he posed.
The mark of a great book is often its ability to provoke robust debates and force readers to confront uncomfortable content.
Kenyan, Christian, Queer by the academic Adriaan Van Klinken provides a way to imagine a future continent where members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community can exercise their rights to dignity, voice, agency, space and health without fear of stigma, harassment and worse.
The author is a leading voice in LGBTI studies, with a special focus on the role of religion, in particular African Christianity.
In Kenyan, Christian, Queer he presents an ethnographic study of the Kenyan queer community, one that is creating space for its own church and queer theology in a homophobic social, religious and political environment.
Van Klinken wades into a controversial subject to document an array of queer creative practices. In doing so, he advances LGBTI studies.
This eloquently written book bravely pushes boundaries.
It is remarkable in style and clarity but also brings out the author’s own vulnerabilities, strengths and compassion as an HIV positive gay scholar and activist.
I have known and worked with him for a long time, and this book marks a shift from abstract and academic writing to a creative documentary about the very personal lives of real people. It straddles the gap between academia and LGBTI activism.
The book is also a departure from despair and crippling homophobia.
It records the experiences of people who refuse to be hopeless victims: people with hope and urgency, who navigate between resistance and human flourishing, creating more space for community and affirmation.
It allows its subjects to tell their own stories.
The book examines four cases: activism through art, such as the works of the late Binyavanga Wainaina; music by the gay gospel artiste George Barasa; the Stories of Our Lives anthology of short films; and the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church in Nairobi.
In each of these, the author shows how LGBTI actors have reclaimed visibility and engaged Christian beliefs, texts and symbols.
The use of case studies allows for rich and in-depth examinations of the ways in which the LGBTI community in Nairobi is reclaiming social, political, cultural, spiritual and artistic spaces.
Wainaina took on Christian clergy and homophobes, calling them out for their hypocrisy, in particular Pentecostal Christianity.
He made this a personal struggle in which he came out as gay and used his body as a site for resistance, vulnerability, acceptance and rejection.
His activism gave impetus to the LGBTI community in Kenya and further afield and his death continued to provoke debates about LGBTI issues.
The video of the song Same Love (Remix) by Art Attack caused huge excitement in the Kenyan artistic and social scene.
The song is about LGBTI struggles, gender equality and civil liberties.
Yet the song serves as a space for political and theological activism.
It serves as a beautiful cultural expression of African queer politics – and was promptly banned by Kenya’s Film Control Board.
The song crossed social, theological and cultural boundaries and focused attention on the theology of radical and non-normative love.
Rap music has long been used as a space for protest and activism.
Stories of Our Lives by the Nest, a Nairobi-based arts collective, is a collection of personal stories based on interviews with ordinary gay people.
Like Same Love, it was promptly banned by the film board, a body that has frequently frustrated Kenya’s creativity in the guise of protecting the nation’s moral fabric.
The more the film is banned, the more it is downloaded.
It addresses themes such as identity, love, sex, faith and spirituality, stories that capture the diversity of contemporary Kenyan queer lives and their day-to-day experiences.
Personal stories are not just authentic, they are also empowering and affirming. They give voice and impetus to communities in struggle.
The last case study is that of the Cosmopolitan Affirming Church, a social and spiritual space where members of the LGBTI community can practise their faith in community with each other.
It is a safe space to create gay and radical theologies; a space for acceptance and love.
It is a space where faith and radical love and sexuality meet.
Van Klinken identifies with the struggles of his research subjects but was able to maintain some distance when writing about them.
This is the kind of book I will read again and again as a straight, Christian, female academic and commentator.
I will happily share it not just with my students and library but also with those who would like to better understand these contested lives and spaces.
Many spiritual leaders need to read it to understand that LGBTI communities are creating their own spaces of worship where they find love and acceptance of their humanity as children of God.
This book evokes many feelings but also forces one to confront one’s own uninformed biases.
It’s a good read for those who often shout the loudest, without sufficient understanding of LGBTI lives.
Mike Rua (pictured), the self-proclaimed king of Mugithi, says he lives for the vulgar.
Rua, who has built his popularity in the music industry by spitting lyrics that raise more than eyebrows on stage, says he cannot change his style of music.
He says his attempt to tone down has seen him clash with his fans.
He now says he will take it a notch higher and his new composition will be even more lewd.
He recalls how in 2012, during a music tour in Dubai, police were called on him on allegations that he was impersonating Mike Rua.
After a two-hour performance at an event attended by hundreds of Kenyans in the diaspora, Rua was accosted by the police.
A fan had complained that the man who performed was not Rua.
Police told him that the Rua the fans knew and the Rua who had performed that night were two different people.
They felt they had not received a good dose of his music after he decided to tone down his wordings.
The same message has been told by his fans in Nairobi who have asked him to go back to the original Rua – the man who spits venom on stage.
The Kikuyu benga artiste is, however, bidding good bye to performing songs composed by other musicians.
“This is what my fans want. I have to give them what they demand for otherwise I will be out of business,” he says.
He says he has in the past found himself brushing shoulders with the police over copyright infringement.
Rua has risen to fame by remixing compositions by other musicians, which he twists to make almost a new composition.
He says remixing will now be a thing of the past.
He has hit the studio to record new songs, including one titled Kiarie, which is already out.
And true to his spirit and motto, he has spiced up the new album with a tinge of vulgarities.
In an interview with the Saturday Standard at his Syokimau home, Rua says media houses had at first almost shunned the composition on the basis that it was lewd.
But things changed when the album, which is complete with a video, became a hit on social media and is now popularly played in many vernacular FM radio stations.
Rua says ‘Kiarie’, which in Kikuyu means wide, is based on his real life experience.
It is the story of a young man, struggling to make it in life and ends up cohabiting with a sugar mummy.
And the sugar mummy at times confuses him (Rua) with Kiarie.
But this is not all about the song as is expected of Rua.
He tantalises the composition with a hidden message of his love life to the sugar mummy and there in fits the hidden message of ‘Kiarie’.
The composition leaves it to the listener to decode which ‘Kiarie’ he is referring to.
Apart from Rua, other upcoming Kikuyu musicians such as Samuel Ndirangu, alias Samido, are giving the veterans a run for their money.
Samido is famed for his songs Wendo wi Cama (love is sweet) and Murata wa Ngai (Friend of God), which have been topping the FM airwaves.
He did Wendo wi Cama together with Joys wa Mama.
Jose Gatutura is another sensation.
The musical star of the Machete hit maker has been rising with every new release.
Among his prominent songs are Tuirio twega (good food), Mwari wa Muthamaki (Daughter of a king) and Haha ni Gute (this is vanity).
USIU-Africa and Kenya Film Commission (KFC) have signed a five-year agreement to boost film studies.
The Memorandum of Understanding is aimed at making Kenya a first-class provider of screen entertainment for local, regional and international markets.
To this end the university commits to provide quality and relevant training.
In the agreement, the two institutions will work together to build capacity through organising film classes, workshops, seminars, film boot camps, short courses, projects and programmes.
The two institutions will also market the Kalasha International Film and TV Festivals to increase market penetration and visibility for Kenyan content at international film markets.
USIU-Africa Vice Chancellor Paul Zeleza said the partnership will position both institutions as resource centres for local broadcasters, media, film and communication researchers and scholars as USIU-Africa will be able to offer mentorship programmes for students interested in film.
“We will conduct film industry research and collect data, which will enable us to develop short courses tailor-made for industry practitioners for certification,” said Prof Zeleza.
Kenya Film Commission Chief Executive Officer Timothy Owase said the State corporation will continue to source and negotiate for tax relief incentives on film and animation equipment to boost the industry growth.
“We will offer guidance on standards of excellence and advocate for the use of best practice in film production while working closely with relevant government agencies to create robust and streamlined mid-level film education that will lead to more exportation of locally-made films,” sais Owase.
Today, many people, especially Africans find it hard to identify with their cultural values and way of life as a result of embrace to modernisation and civilisation.
One man in Elgeyo Marakwet has taken it upon himself to preserve the fading culture of the Keiyo community, which is part of the Kalenjin subtribes.
Joseph Kwambai, 70, said modernisation has changed the African society from a traditional socio-economic setup to where locals have now adapted to new norms and way of life.
“Driven by the need to ensure future generations get a feeling of how Africans behaved and conducted themselves in the past, I have been collecting Keiyo relics and preserving them in a museum in Chekobei village in Keiyo south sub county for the past 20 years,” said Mr Kwambai.
Situated next to Chekobei Primary, along the Iten-Kabarnet road, the cultural centre is decked with a collection of books showing how the cultural heritages of African communities used to live and socialize in the past.
It even holds currencies in different denominations and states.
“I have several Biographies including the one of the late second President Daniel Arap Moi “the making of an African Statesman” by Andrew Morton and many others.
Books written by colonialists are also available,” he said.
Apart from the books at the Museum, other items showcased include those used in war, ceremonies, rituals, kitchen-ware and farming among others.
Even the Bible and Quran are in the center.
There is also a Keiyo homestead erected to illustrate how a family shared the rooms.
The old man was forced to travel wide and far in search of the traditional item.
“I am still collecting the items and part of history that I come across about different cultures more so the Keiyo community. Other communities should take up the initiative and ensure they preserve their cultures as a way of ensuring the coming generations will not be enslaved by the coming up of modernisation,” he opined.
The centre was then commissioned in 2006 but officially opened four years later to the public.
George Otieno’s passion for art started way back in 1988, on his first day in a primary school in Busia County, while staying with his maternal grandmother.
“The first assignment in Standard One for us was to draw a vehicle. I drew a pickup, which the teacher liked and gave me a red tick. Since then, I knew any good thing should have a red tick. That is when I knew drawing is good,” said Otieno.
In Class Five, he started using coloured pencil.
Later, he moved to Nairobi and did some causal jobs in the city’s Industrial Area as a causal labourer, though he never stopped painting, albeit for fun.
“In the year 2007 I received Sh3,000 for a paint I did for then Health Minister Charity Ngilu and Sh7,000 from a former Kenya Dairy Board managing director. I then knew art pays,” said Otieno at his art studio in Milimani Court in Obama Estate, Nairobi.
He quit the casual job, used the Sh30,000 he received after painting a picture of former President Daniel Moi to buy drawing equipment.
He then set up a small workshop and ventured into commercial art.
In 2002 when President Uhuru Kenyatta was running for presidency, Otieno saw a picture of former President Moi published in The Standard wearing a red kitenge shirt decorated with Kenya African National Union (Kanu) colours and a cockerel.
“I drew Mzee Moi and besides him put President Kenyatta. I then drew Kanu flag and wrote, “Kanu Yajenga Nchi”.
"A neighbour saw and liked it. He introduced me to a friend called Mutua, who worked with then Presidential Escort Unit. Mutua asked him to bring the painting so that he could see it,” said Otieno.
They met and Mutua introduced him to a University of Nairobi lecturer Prof Geoffrey ole Maloiy, a close friend of the late Mzee Moi, who took the painting to the President.
“Within two days, Mutua called me and said Moi liked it and had paid Sh30,000. That was the first good amount I received from art and it was like a jackpot. The joy that President Moi liked my work and paid for it inspired me a lot,” said Otieno, born in Seme, Kisumu County.
He has also sold two paintings of former US President Barrack Obama to an art collector, which fetched him Sh500,000.
However, there is a Cabinet Secretary he claims owes him Sh30,000.
He didn’t give details.
“There are two pictures I painted of former President Mwai Kibaki on a wheelchair and another in his office. They cost Sh500,000 but I was never paid,” said Otieno.
It was all glamour at the 2018 Kalasha awards ceremony held on Saturday evening at the Safari Park Hotel in Nairobi.
The red carpet event hosted by the Kenya Film Commission, in its eighth edition, featured the who’s who in the film industry, dignitaries and top Government officials.
Journalists Amina Rabar and Jeff Koinange made sure the audience was entertained with their tickling punchlines as they emceed the event.
Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru, principal secretaries Fatuma Hirsi and Jerome Ochieng, Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris and officials from the French embassy attended the function. Others included actors Charles Bukeko (Papa Shirandula), Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), Lucy Wangui and Pascal Tokodi.
Senator Gideon lauded the event for celebrating and rewarding local talent and sustaining the future of the local music industry.
The Kanu chairman also applauded the Kenya Film Commission and Kalasha for a job well done.
“We want the local film industry to set the trend and make upcoming and aspiring musicians feel like they want to be part of it in years to come. With this kind of event, Kenya could easily provide 90 per cent local content and not be boring,” said Gideon.
CS Mucheru commended the winners and requested the local Kenya Film Commission to inject new blood and life into the local film industry.
He said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration was committed to having the local film industry transform the country.
“We want to come out with a blockbuster movie to be sold in Africa, China and the rest of the world. We also want to set up a task force to ensure that we transform the local film industry by building theatres in all the 47 counties with the support of my ministry, the Nairobi senator, the Government and the media to ensure we come out with the best in terms of movies,” said Mr Mucheru.
There was also a moment of silence to pay tribute to fallen heroes among them former Vitimbi and Vioja Mahakamani actor Charles Kimani alias Masaku, former Churchill comedian Emmanuel Makori popularly known as Ayeiya and Mombasa-based actress Maureen Wanza,popularly known as Sasha.
Organisers asked Kenyans to help pay the hospital bill for actor Kone Nouhoum of Selina, who was involved in an accident a few weeks ago and is in the ICU.
Kalasha International Awards is an annual event presented by the Kenya Film Commission whose mandate is to promote a vibrant local film industry.
The initiative seeks to recognise talent in the different facets of film and TV industry by awarding those in the five original branches of filmmaking: directors, actors, writers, producers and technicians.
It was a big moment for those who bagged awards. Kenya’s film industry is growing slowly but surely, with people like Wanuri Kahiu getting recognised internationally for their work in film.
The event was sponsored by KTN, Communications Authority of Kenya, Anga Imax, Canon Kenya, French embassy, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, Buzz, Kwese Inflix, Media Council of Kenya, Movie Mtaani, Pixel, Scoop Network, Safari Park Hotel, Telcom Kenya, USIU, and Brand Kenya.
Writer King’ori Gachoka was 22 years old when he first met celebrated author Francis Imbuga.
Things were so bad for the budding writer such that he could not afford a typewriter.
His script for a play had just been rejected by a local television station because it was handwritten, and he thought this could end his dream.
At the time, Gachoka was a student at Kenyatta University where the late Prof Imbuga, then 47 years old, was his dean, in the Arts Department.
His frustrations led him to share the rejected piece with Imbuga with the aim of borrowing his typewriter.
The professor was impressed with his work and allowed him to use his valuable Olympia Traveller DeLuxe portable typewriter.
Yesterday, Gachoka, who will soon turn 47, could not hold back his tears as he parted with the typewriter, the same one that kick-started his career as well as Imbuga’s.
The typewriter will now be part of the exhibition of Imbuga’s literary works.
“I took time to prepare myself because I knew it was not going to be an easy thing. So in July and August this year, I carried the typewriter to every meeting I attended and everywhere I went,” said Gachoka.
Gachoka, who spoke during the launch of the exhibition yesterday, reminisced the days when he was struggling. He also narrated how the professor surprised him when he returned the typewriter.
“It is yours now. I gave it to you,” said Imbuga to Gachoka’s amazement.
The typing machine, though slow, is still in good working condition.
Gachoka’s first literary work, a novel titled Divided Life, which thrust him into the literature field, was produced using the type writer.
The novel saw him brush shoulders with big names in the industry such as Prof Egara Kabaji, who was present during the launch of the exhibition.
Standard Group Chief Executive Officer Orlando Lyomu, who was the chief guest, said the exhibition would give Kenyans an opportunity to interact with Imbuga’s thoughts.
He said the media requires more content and called on those with ideas on drama to come up.
“Do not shy away from partnering with us, this will help us continue mentoring talents in honour of the late Imbuga,” said Lyomu.
To promote national heritage, Lyomu said, Standard Group will continue partnering with the Kenya National Archives, as it celebrates its heritage as the oldest media group in the region.
Other guests present were Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology Vice Chancellor Fred Otieno and his Kenyatta University counterpart Paul Wainaina.
During the exhibition, Kenya National Archives will not charge the public. The exhibition will run until April 2019.
Dubbed “An Exhibition of Prof Francis Imbuga’s Literary Works”, the gallery is a package of his entire life, containing photos from his days as an actor.
Imbuga’s works have become key in the study of literature schools in Kenya, with the most famous one being Betrayal in the City.
It also has photos of his young family and those taken just before he died.
His other books include Aminata, Man of Kafira, The Burning of Rags and The Successor.
Imbuga’s works have consistently brought out issues that affect the society such as the clashes of modernity and tradition in the social organisation of African communities.
Gachoka, who spoke during the launch of the exhibition yesterday, reminisced the days when he was struggling.
He also narrated how the professor surprised him when he returned the typewriter.
Young family
Dubbed “An Exhibition of Prof Francis Imbuga’s Literary Works”, the gallery is a package of his entire life, containing photos from his days as an actor.
It also has photos of his young family and those taken just before he died.
If we want to meet the dead looking alive we turn to art, said writer Hilary Mantel.
An exhibition on the life and times of the late satirical playwright Francis Imbuga hopes to do just that.
The exhibition, which opens tomorrow at the Kenya National Archives will showcase Imbuga’s life in pictures, writings and mementos spanning from his grandparents who turned him into storyteller to fun times quaffing his favorite Tusker beer with friends at the Kenya National Theatre.
Visitors will also be able to see original hand written manuscripts of his plays penned in an immaculate handwriting that his widow Prof Mabel Imbuga is still in awe of.
“He had a very neat handwriting. He hardly made any mistakes and it’s something that really impresses me up to this day especially when I look at his first book,” she says.
While numbers are projected to grow three-fold by 2023, that still represents a small fraction of the region’s population.
Those figures make it clear that the region needs to address a major internet infrastructure shortfall.
The benefits of growing internet accessibility and access are obvious.
In 2019, in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 650 000 jobs were supported directly by the mobile ecosystem and more than 1.4-million informal jobs in 2019.
It also contributed more than US$17-billion to public funding through the course of the year.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also established that a 10% increase in mobile broadband penetration in Africa would generate an increase of 2.5% in GDP per capita.
That’s to say nothing of the benefits that better and more affordable mobile internet can have on education, healthcare, and government services.
With easily accessible internet connectivity, people can search for jobs, gain new skills, and access government services without having to travel to a physical location and potentially stand in long queues.
As we have seen, the pandemic has caused economic and social devastation and changed the way we live, work, study and socialize, bringing about an era of social distancing.
One of the most significant changes is the acceleration of digital transformation.
African policymakers have realised that access to broadband is critical for mitigating the effects of the pandemic and boosting economic recovery in the post-Covid era.
With changes in people’s behaviours and mindsets, broadband will also continue to provide opportunities for African countries to leapfrog obstacles to sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development.
Of course, the responsibility to create access doesn’t lie with government alone.
Corporates also have a role to play.
At Huawei, we recognise this and have backed a number of initiatives that aim to help grow access in areas where it’s needed most
In July last year, for example, we launched the DigiSchool project in partnership with a local operator and a non-profit organisation.
As response to the call to ensure that all South African school children can read fluently for meaning, the programme aims to connect more than 100 urban and rural primary schools to broadband internet.
Additionally, we’ve rolled out DigiTrucks in several African countries, which enable everyone from students to entrepreneurs to learn how to use computers and connect with the digital world.
Earlier this year, we also announced a partnership with Ghanaian operators to build more than 2000 base stations in remote areas of that country to connect the unconnected.
From a healthcare perspective, Lifebank, a pioneering Nigerian startup delivers blood and other essential medical supplies to hospitals aided with broadband connections.
By keeping the startup and its riders connected, we can ensure that hospitals get urgent supplies when they are needed.
These kinds of projects, however, only serve to illustrate how much need for accessible, affordable broadband there really is across Sub-Saharan Africa.
They represent a glimpse at the kind of access that everyone should have and which players across society should look to provide.
For more than a decade, the United Nations has recognised that the internet is a catalyst for sustainable development.
As the events of the past year or so have shown, however, far too many people are unable to enjoy those rights because they lack access and connectivity.
We will all benefit from widening access and bridging this divide.
There is no question that it should be a major priority for governments, corporates, and civil society players alike and that it should be an ongoing one.

Te Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) has stepped up its push to recover Sh385 million from a businessman it accuses of siphoning the money from the County Government of Mandera.
In submissions filed before the High Court, ARA claims that Ali Abdi Ibrahim cannot explain the source of the Sh385 million found in his two accounts and that the investigations have revealed the money was acquired from three companies that traded with the county government.
State counsel Jennifer Gitiri representing the agency argued that an analysis of Ibrahim’s accounts showed a systematic pattern of money laundering where some of the amounts were deposited in cash while others were wired from other banks.
“The amounts are proceeds of crime that must be forfeited to the state. He has failed to prove how and why the suspicious cash transactions were deposited in his account. He cannot even show evidence of any business he transacted with the county government of Mandera,” said Gitiri.
According to ARA, the huge amounts are suspected to have been stolen from the county government of Mandera and deposited to Ibrahim’s accounts to conceal the source when he has no legitimate businesses to generate the total amount.
Ms Gitiri submitted that the cash was being deposited in his account by unknown people and even after being summoned to explain, he could not tell where the money came from.
She said some of the cash deposit were made in tranches of below Sh1 million to avoid raising suspicion and that records at the Kenya Revenue Authority showed that he did not pay any taxes to prove he was trading with the county government.
“Without any evidence to substantiate the source of his funds, we are left with only one conclusion that they are proceeds of crime. His defence that he was sub-contracted by other companies to do construction work are baseless and lies meant to hoodwink the court,” said Gitiri.
Equity Group has recorded after tax profit of Sh8.7billion in the first quarter of 2021 compared to Sh5.3billion same period last year, the lender said on Wednesday.
The result is a 64 per cent jump from last year same period performance.
Interest income grew by 32 per cent while non-funded income grew by 30 per cent to contribute 42 per cent of total income.
Regional subsidiaries registered resilience and robust growth to contribute 40 per cent of total deposits and total assets and 23 per cent of profit before tax with Rwanda and Uganda delivering above cost of capital returns.
The Group registered a balance sheet expansion of 54 per cent to reach Sh1.07 trillion driven by a 58 per cent growth in customer deposits underpinned by Sh140 billion shareholders’ funds.
A liquid balance sheet with Sh500 billion of cash, cash equivalents and government securities reflect the agility to redeploy funding seamlessly as the economies recover from the adverse impact of the Covid-19 multi-crisis.
“Our strategy; purpose-first, inclusivity, affordability, reach, agility and quality have proven resilient and sustainable” said Dr James Mwangi, the Equity Group CEO while releasing the first quarter of 2021 financial results. “Purpose has proved profitable” he added.
During the multi-crisis year, Equity focused on social impact investment in health investing Sh1.7 billion in social response to society, forgoing Sh1.5 billion in waived mobile transaction fees, waiving Sh1.2 billion in loan rescheduling fees and accommodating Sh171 billon (or 31 per cent) of the loan book for up to 3 years of principal and interest repayment breaks to enable businesses to survive.
“We kept the lights of the economies we operate in on, supported businesses to repurpose, retool and recover by supporting livelihoods of our customers during the crisis”, said Dr Mwangi.
He added, “We have adopted a two-pronged strategy of being offensive and defensive. We strengthened our capital buffers by retaining profits and withholding dividend payouts, took long-term loan facilities that strengthened our liquidity buffers, supported host communities and our clients to mitigate the impact of the crisis on them by waiving fees and rescheduling their loans to match loan repayments to new cashflow patterns."
Internally, we focused on risk mitigation and management in a challenging environment, enhanced our NPL coverage through provisions and sought collaboration with development financial institutions on credit and risk sharing guarantees.
We evolved our organization structure through strong governance focus on risk management, diversity of skills and competencies to enhance our succession planning and mitigation of key person risks”, added Dr Mwangi.
Operationally, the Group focused on generating and growing non-funded income, treasury efficiency, geographical expansion and business diversification, business transformation through innovation and digitization, balance sheet optimization and agility, asset quality and risk mitigation while pursuing efficiencies and brand development through social impact investment underscoring the performance of the Group.
Of the 31 per cent of the loan book, or Sh171 billion Covid-19 accommodated or rescheduled loan book, Sh59 billion has resumed repayment with Sh 5 billion fully repaid and Sh3 billion behind schedule in repayment. Sh66 billion is expected to resume repayment within six months by 30th September 2021.
Embu and Garissa counties have drastically increased their revenue collection from 2013/14 Financial Year, Commission of Revenue Allocation (CRA) said on Wednesday.
According to CRA, Embu and Garissa have grown Own Revenue Source by 254 and 202 per cent respectively. From the same analysis, 15 counties including Tana River, West Pokot, Lamu, Kirinyaga, Mombasa, Nandi, Kiambu, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Laikipia, Taita Taveta, Marsabit, Makueni, Kakamega, Tharaka-Nithi and Nyandarua more than doubled their revenue over the first six years of devolution.
Speaking on the sidelines of Counties Own Source of Revenue report launch in Nairobi, CRA commissioner Dr Irene Koech also noted a decline in revenue collection in Busia, Wajir, Homa Bay and Mandera counties.
Nairobi County on the other side, although raising the highest own source revenue has grown by less than one per cent in the first six years of devolution.
The commissioner however noted that the county has a potential to finance 40 per cent of its budget.
Narok County collects more than one billion shillings annually similar to city counties.
Notable is Samburu County that has surpassed its estimated potential while Isiolo, Laikipia and Baringo are among the counties that collect more than 40 per cent of their estimated revenue potential.
The potential is based on a study conducted by the National Treasury in 2018 which projected that the counties OSR potential is at Sh172 billion per annum.
“County government’s main own-source revenue streams are business permits, property-related revenue and vehicle parking fees,” she says.
“Agriculture- dominated counties are disadvantaged by the narrowness of their significant revenue stream cess, which accounts for only 3 per cent of total county collections.”
Primary revenue streams for county governments are property-related revenue, business permits and vehicle parking fees.
In 2016-17 the three sources accounted for more than 40 per cent of the total own-source revenue for county governments. Specifically, property-related revenue contributed 14 per cent, business permits contributed 15 per cent, and vehicle parking fees contributed 12 per cent.
The report assessed the relationship of county economic activities and county own-source revenue. Diversification in economic activities was found to relate with high revenue collection.
Diversification in economic activities was found to relate with high revenue collection.
The study also found that forty-one counties are raising less than 40 per cent of their estimated revenue potential, while six counties collect between 50 and 88 per cent of their estimated revenue potential.
Samburu collects 127 per cent of the estimated potential for the county.
Assessing county revenue streams, it was found out that Cess is immaterial as a proportion of total own-source revenue raising only 3 per cent.
In counties that are predominantly agricultural, Cess collection explains the low revenue performance of these counties.
Hospital fees contribute 11 per cent to the overall county own-source revenue while Natural Resource contributes 6 per cent.
On the issue of county financing its budget, urban and peri-urban counties were found to finance their budget more than rural counties.
Finally, it was found out that majority of counties that collect low revenue have agriculture as the main economic activity.
“These counties collect less than Sh200 million annually on average, while counties that have more diverse economic activities collect more own-sources. Notably, revenue management of game parks by county governments confer a comparative advantage to county own-source revenue.”
The most dreaded question during job interviews is a game-changer depending on your response.
Your response will either leave you excited or disappointed and most candidates describe it as a landmine question.
And it is usually; why did you leave your previous job?
Here is where you make the blunder as a job seeker.
Kate Vobic, a media personality who advertises in a business-oriented magazine in Nakuru, stated that an interviewee “gave a breakdown of a bad relationship with his former manager and a bit of anecdotal history of what happened to culminate to his resignation," she says.
According to her, the potential recruit had his CV right and did well in the interview until the landmine question popped up, and he let his resentment of his former boss show.
Crown Paints Plc will use the Sh711.80 million being raised via the rights issue to salvage its subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, which the paint and coating firm revealed are struggling with debt.
Just a year after the company wrote off Sh653 million it had invested in its subsidiaries in Uganda and Tanzania, the Nairobi Security Exchange (NSE) listed firm has now turned to its shareholders for more capital.
The company did write off Sh374 million for Crown Paints Tanzania and Sh278 million for Regal Paints, its Uganda subsidiary.
The rights issue will see shareholders of the company allowed to purchase additional shares.
On May 7, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) approved the company's request to raise Sh711.81 million by issuing 71,181,000 new ordinary shares.
Then, CMA noted that the money was meant to bring financial flexibility to the company and assist it in navigating the tough business environment brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
"The rights issue is to bring the company’s indebtedness to a more sustainable level and to position it to take advantage of its long-term growth opportunities and gain market share in the East African Region,” said Crown Paints in a cautionary statement signed by Company Secretary Conrad Nyukuri.
Mr Nyukuri said while the company’s parent firm in Kenya is sound, the performance of its subsidiaries – Crown Paints Tanzania Ltd, Regal Paints Uganda, and Crown Paints Rwanda Ltd) has over the past few years remained depressed.
“(This is) due to the adverse competitive environment that has led to the company supporting the subsidiaries financially,” he said.
The firm, in a statement, also warned that despite the enhanced regional integration in the East African Community, there remained challenges in the respective paint makers' markets, thereby negatively impacting the financial performance of the subsidiaries.
The notice added that the company is in contact with the NSE regarding obtaining approval and once issued, it will be promptly uploaded on its website.
“The shareholders of the company and the public are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the firm,” it added.
Crown Paints Plc opened a depot in Tanzania in 2012 before entering the market in 2014.
The plan, as revealed by the paint maker then was to pump in Sh360 million targeting a 50 per cent market share in the country for premium paint.
In Rwanda, the company invested Sh250 million on its entry into the market in February 2015.
The firm intends to raise Sh711.810 million before expenses.
As of May 25, the company’s share price at NSE hit Sh40.
The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has admitted KOA Save Africa Limited and Moneto Ventures Limited to the Regulatory Sandbox.
The two firms will test their innovations in a live capital market environment, in compliance with the CMA Regulatory Sandbox Policy Guidance Notes (PGN), in line with the commitment to develop and deepen the capital markets by facilitating the deployment of financial technology (fintech).
KOA Save Africa Limited has been admitted to the Regulatory Sandbox to test KOA App.
The innovation seeks to help retail investors to easily, conveniently, and affordably, save and invest in the capital markets.
KOA App is accessible to iOS and Android mobile users.
The fully digital mobile application has the capacity to embed several collective investment schemes focusing on money market funds. KOA Save Africa will test its application for a period of six months.
The Authority has so far admitted nine firms. CMA recently published a report on the milestones it has achieved in the Regulatory Sandbox since its launch in March 2019.
In Mid-May, the Capital Markets Authority approved Safaricom’s mobile investment product dubbed Mali.
Mali is an investment-led application that will allow retail investors to save and invest in securities from their mobile phones.
The product is one of Safaricom’s key pillars as it divests from traditional income streams such as voice and moves into digital financial services.
Safaricom Chief Executive Peter Ndegwa last week said the firm was awaiting for approval from the regulators before commercially launching the mobile investment product.
“Mali is currently waiting on decisions from our regulators and we continue engaging them,” Ndegwa said following the company’s investor briefing.
As such, we cannot comment on its progress as these conversations are ongoing.
The move brings the telco a step closer to launching the product that could disrupt retail investing at the Nairobi bourse.
The need to get a Covid-19 vaccine certificate before you travel to any African country or abroad could become a reality over the next 12 months.
BlueBird Aviation General Manager Hussein Mohammed however projects that it would take a little longer for African airlines to fly across borders due to low vaccination rates across the continent.
“If most of the people were vaccinated, it makes it easier for airlines because you have sufficient passenger load that is free to travel. The downside is the adoption of the Covid Vaccine passport worldwide,” he said.
“We cannot act unilaterally. Kenya cannot say we require all passengers to have a Covid-19 passport while Rwanda, UK or Australia don’t require it, then what we will have is that passengers will avoid your airline and go to an airline that will accept Covid-ve test results.”
He said developed nations such as the US have already achieved 70 per cent vaccination of the adult population - who have received their first dose of the vaccine while close to 40 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated.
The aviation boss said introducing Covid-ve vaccine passports in such jurisdictions is possible compared to Kenya or Africa where many people are yet to get vaccinated.
Here is a situation that will take 12 months or more for 70 per cent of the adult population to be fully vaccinated.
"We have to be able to be comparable to developed countries. Until we reach such a time when we are comparable to these developed countries, honestly, the Covid Passport is not yet an option for most of Africa,” he noted.
Mr Mohammed sees a combination requiring passengers to produce Covid-19 certificates showing that they are fully vaccinated and those with Covid-ve results before boarding a flight.
“I see that for the next 12 months and probably beyond, that there might be a consensus among people in the aviation industry worldwide agreeing on a specific Covid passport requirement for all travels,” said Mohammed.
The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has raised alarm over an increase in excisable products with counterfeit stamps in the market.
Kenya Association of Manufacturers lists cigarettes containing tobacco substitutes, wines and other alcoholic beverages obtained by fermentation of fruits as some of the excisable goods.
Others include mineral water, fruit juices, cosmetics and beauty products, and compounded spirits of alcoholic strengths exceeding 10 per cent.
“The public is forewarned that having excisable goods affixed with counterfeit excise stamps is an offence, consequences, if found, shall be confiscation, seizure and destruction of the goods by the commissioner,” KRA said in a statement.
“A person who contravenes the provisions of the law shall also be upon conviction subjected to a fine not exceeding Sh5 million or imprisonment to a term not exceeding three years.”
KRA also warned that the means of conveyance used to carry such goods is liable for forfeiture as provided under section 211 of the East African Community Customs Management Act 2004.
The taxman has ordered parking attendants in Nairobi to photograph number plates of vehicles whose owners have failed to pay parking fees.
The decision is prompted by the rising number of motorists disputing penalties imposed for failure to pay parking fees.
“To address these complaints, parking attendants in county uniform will henceforth photograph the number plates of non-compliant motor vehicles for reference purposes in case of disputes.”
KRA has also banned the physical VIP parking stickers replacing them with a system where a list of all vehicles that qualify for VIP parking have been uploaded into the Nairobi Revenue System (NRS) parking system.
The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) took over the collection of revenue in Nairobi County last year following an agreement signed between the then-governor Mike Sonko and President Uhuru Kenyatta.
“According to Article 5.5 of the Deed of Transfer of Function from the Nairobi City County Government to the National Government gazette, February 25, 2020, and per section 160 of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012...the Nairobi City County Government appoints the Kenya Revenue Authority as the principal-agent for overall revenue collection for all county revenue for twenty-four months, with effect from March 16, 2020” read part of the Gazette Notice signed by Finance Executive Allan Igambi.
Former Controller of Budget Agnes Odhiambo had proposed that counties contract KRA as their revenue collection agents.
“Counties are collecting less revenue than their potential, and this is because of poor systems and leakages,” she said in August 2019.
Artificial intelligence won't replace investment managers, but it could improve returns
It shouldn’t be news to anyone that artificial intelligence (AI) is developing rapidly and drastically reshaping our future.
Yet what the average pension-contributing individual might not have thought about is how this development will affect the management of his or her pensions and savings in the years ahead.
How might AI affect pensions and savings?
Asset and wealth management firms are working on ways to use AI to improve their investment decisions and to extract insights from historical data, which should increase efficiency, accuracy and compliance.
Other services, like robo-advisory, are also taking off.
With the global AI asset management market size expected to be worth almost USD13.5 billion within the next six years, it’s clearly a booming part of the business.
The development of technology in finance and computer-aided algorithms has also contributed to rising interest in low-cost, rules-based, quantitatively-oriented passive investment strategies.
Over the last five years, such strategies have grown by about USD2 trillion while traditional active management strategies declined by roughly the same amount.
Traditional market capitalization-weighted indices – like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETF) – have also grown over the last five years.
This has been aided by minimal costs and strong performance due to the extended bull market.
However, these indices are now being rivalled by other weighting systems that deploy technology to deliver better outcomes and mitigate risks.
For example, as stakeholders increasingly focus on the harmful role of carbon in global warming and the importance of other ESG-related issues in mitigating portfolio and social risks, asset owners are using technology to adjust market capitalization-weighted benchmarks.
In this way, we expect the role of AI in index investing will have a knock-on effect of improving asset owner and asset manager decisions, focusing them on working with portfolio companies over longer time horizons and supporting companies that, for instance, need to transition away from poor carbon outcomes.
We further expect that this will lead asset owners to engage more transparently with their constituents (for example, pensioners or retail clients) to explain why such decisions are optimal.
AI will gradually play a greater role in critically assessing human judgements in investment decision-making frameworks, to moderate or counter short-term behavioural biases or even to make judgements without human input.
This will mean a streamlined ability to predict what will happen and the best course of action for financial forecasting.
This is an improvement on a currently very manual process that suffers from inherent human biases.
Could AI displace investment managers? We don’t think so.
For AI to be successful in any of this, AI still needs humans.
What are some of the ethical considerations?
Firms will need to invest in experts to monitor the AI and ensure it functions and make adjustments when needed
This means that investment decisions will still be largely reliant on individual judgement and common patterns of biases, much like they have for the past 20 years.
Using AI in investment management also creates new risks and challenges.
A model is only as good as the data you put into it – so model opacity and data integrity matter.
And questions about the ethics in justifying or bounding AI investment decisions will also need to be answered, as well as issues surrounding the regulation of AI systems, the risks of heightened pro-cyclical investment activity and the current lack of a monitoring framework, as AI plays an ever-increasing role in the investment decision-making process.
These questions matter because of the need to maintain and improve the level of trust and confidence in investment management and the broader financial system in general.
This is partially achieved by explaining transparently how ethical and social responsibility factors can be included in the investment decision-making process at the portfolio, strategic and regulatory levels, so that AI can be developed with proper balance.
At the same time, trust and confidence can only be gained if frameworks are developed to control pro-cyclical investment activity, monitor AI decision-making impacts in financial markets, and enforce the role of human interaction in the investment-management process to oversee and communicate decisions (whether by human or AI).
What should we be doing about these questions?
In order to allow for these positive developments, we need to identify the key stakeholders to manage and encourage positive AI development in the investment management process.
These include regulators, asset owners, asset managers, custodians, investment consultants, legal experts and representatives of retail investors.
We need to bring stakeholders together to agree upon an appropriate framework of ethical inputs, regulation and monitoring systems for AI.
Regardless of regulation and monitoring systems, asset managers also need to take it on themselves to address some of these issues in their existing investment process.
We are ultimately optimistic that properly managed AI will support human judgement in managing pensions and savings – and maybe even improve your returns! – by reinforcing best practices and mitigating known biases.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has directed the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) to partner with relevant State agencies to standardise their products for the export market.
The president, who was speaking during the official re-opening of KMC in Athi River, Machakos County yesterday, said he was optimistic of the meat products reaching the European market.
“We have done it before when Kenyan meat and meat products were sold worldwide and I believe once again meat products should join the growing list of food items that we export to the rest of the world,” he said.
The Head of State said he expects the country’s beef exports to also hit the Middle East as well as emerging markets, where the population is growing and consumers have more purchasing power.
“The Africa continental free trade arrangement coming into force provides an opportunity that should benefit the livestock sector by harnessing the entire supply chain in the meat industry,” he said.
The Head of State said the livestock sector’s potential extends to hides and skin, which informed his administration’s push to breathe life into the tannery industry.
The president, while lauding the positive changes at the commission since its transfer to the Ministry of Defence, said time was ripe for KMC to reclaim its role in the country’s economy.
He said interest from Kenya Prisons, National Youth Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, and police training college contracting KMC for their supplies was a sign of the renewed trust in the commission.
KMC, which was initially under the Ministry of Agriculture, was in September 2020 transferred to the Ministry of Defence.
While the move has been contested in court, President Kenyatta yesterday defended the decision albeit with a lot of care.
“Past administration has made efforts to jumpstart KMC, but for reasons which are known never succeeded and a lot of public funds went astray,” he said.
He noted the transfer had eased payments to farmers — some who had gone for four years without compensation after supplying animals.
The commission plans to pay farmers within 72 hours.
“The commission’s business reorganisation plan has kicked off in earnest with offsetting debts to all farmers,” said Defence Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma.
President Uhuru calls on Kenya Meat Commission to pay farmers within 72 hours after delivery
President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on the new management of the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) to ensure livestock farmers are paid within 72 hours of animal delivery to the facility.
Speaking when he officially relaunched the Athi-River based facility the president said KMC has the potential to play a significant role in Kenya’s economy.
He challenged the facility to not only focus on meeting meat demand locally but plan on exporting the surplus to Europe, Middle East and Africa.
“I don’t want to see KMC slipping back to olden days when farmers were paid after four years or not paid, maintain the payment period at 72 hours,” said Uhuru.
“As we focus on the European and Middle East markets, let us also focus on Africa where the population is growing and consumers growingly have better purchasing power,” he added also noting the new African Continental Free Trade Area offers better opportunities.
The State-owned meat processor operated below capacity before the takeover facing challenges that included the unreliable supply of raw material and an ageing plant, which slowed down its operations.
Kenya Meat Commission was transferred to the Ministry of Defence from the Ministry of Agriculture following an order by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
The processor has also grappled with poor performance since the 1960s because of political interference, and loss of the European Union market due to animal diseases.
Last month, the Kenya Defence Forces called on stakeholders and livestock farmers to submit comments on the transfer of ministerial responsibilities, the comments submission window ended on May 12.
On Monday the president hailed the military for work in rehabilitating the commission saying that the force has spent half of the previous budget in KMC rehabilitation.
In June this year, the Prison department, Kenya Wildlife Service, Police force, National Youth Service are expected to be major customers of the commission after the KDF.
40 new privacy standards approved as cybercrime cases soar 50 per cent
The fight against growing cases of cybercrime on Monday got a boost with the approval of new 40 standards directed at safeguarding consumer privacy.
According to the Communications Authority of Kenya, cybercrime incidences rose by over 50 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year to 56.2 million from 35.1 million threats reported in the previous quarter.
Of note, malware and application attacks continued to rank highly among the factors that have contributed to the surge in cyber-security challenges.
On Monday, the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) said it has approved forty (40) new standards to be used by auditors, managers and management teams, trainers and assessors in the ICT to enhance information and cybersecurity and safeguard consumer privacy.
The new standards outline various techniques and methods for securing corporate information by an individual or managers charged with the responsibility of ensuring institutional data is safe.
Consumers are increasingly adopting digital technology, the data generated creates both an opportunity for enterprises to improve customer engagement and a responsibility to keep it safe.
"The new guidelines provide a robust system to fight against cybersecurity threats, breach of privacy and other information security measures to ensure that Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity (CIA) of information is maintained during the creation, usage, storage and transfer of information,” says Bernard Njiraini, Managing Director, KEBS.
The standards also stipulate a framework for ensuring privacy in information and communication technology (ICT) systems that store and process personally identifiable information (PII).
Key among the approved standards include guidelines for information security management systems auditing, code of practice for electronic discovery, vulnerability handling process, online privacy notices and consent, cloud service metering and billing modes.
Others include the competence requirements for information security testers, the framework of trust for processing of multi-sourced data.
The World Economic Forum Report 2017 places technology threats in the top five societal and economic risks by likelihood and scale of impact, next to weapons of mass destruction.
The public sector continues to dominate as the primary target of cyberattacks followed by financial services.
Globally, 40 per cent of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that experience data breach due to cybersecurity attacks are likely to close within a year.
The efforts are the latest in the fight against cybercrime.
It comes few weeks after the United Kingdom listed Kenya among countries in Africa to benefit from Sh3.3 billion cyberwar chest.
The money targets supporting national cyber response units, advising on consumer safety awareness online and setting up a joint Interpol cyber hub that will help nations mount joint operation on cybercriminals.
The United Kingdom (UK) through its Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab noted with concern the rising number of criminals that target online consumers and disrupting ease of doing business in the modern world.
As part of the new approach to bring down cybercriminals, the UK jointly with INTERPOL, is setting up a new cyber operations hub in Africa working across Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Rwanda to support joint operations against cyber-crime.
“We are working with like-minded partners, to make sure that the international order that governs cyber is fit for purpose,” he said.
“We want to see international law respected in cyberspace, just as we would anywhere else. And we need to show how the rules apply to these changes in technology, the changes in threats, and the systemic attempts to render the internet a lawless space.”
The Kenya Bankers Association (KBA), a lobby group for local banks has noted a significant shift in bank customer preferences for digital services which, according to the association’s Customer Satisfaction Survey of 2020, stood at 43 per cent.
"While the banking industry's digital resilience has continued to promote continuity in the financial services sector, rising cases of fraud need to be addressed further through consumer education", says Habil Olaka, Chief Executive Officer, KBA.
"Monitoring fraud trends is critical as it enables stakeholders to identify awareness gaps and ensure the security of consumer monies is guaranteed," he said.
A local airline will offer cheap transport services between Nairobi and Kisumu.
The 748 Air Services will make trips twice daily between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and Kisumu International Airport.
The airline’s Managing Director Moses Mwangi and Chairman Ahmed Jibril said passengers on the route would pay Sh10,700 for a return ticket.
“We want to connect important domestic business and leisure locations in Kenya - Nairobi, Kisumu, Kakamega, and its environs,” said Mr Jibril.
Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o officiated the launch of the 748 Air direct flight to Kisumu.
The 748 Air joins Kenya Airways, Fly540 and Safari Link, the airliners that fly daily to Kisumu.
The route that serves travelers to western Kenya is key in promotion of tourism and business in the region.
The move by 748 Air comes barely days after it reverted daily flights from Nairobi’s Wilson Airport to the Masai Mara.
Nyong’o urged airliners flying the Kisumu route to reduce fare to attract more clients.
The launch comes as Kisumu prepares to host Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1.
“We are committed to promoting high level of safety and quality performance to meet national and international standards,” said Jibril.
He also said their services include delivery of cargo to remote destinations, adding the flights offer safe transportation of passenger delegations.
Maersk, the Denmark-based shipping giant, says it is ready to deploy regular vessels to Lamu Port if required.
In a statement issued by Africa Communications Manager Kerry Rosser, the firm, which on Thursday sent the first ship, mv Cap Carmel to Lamu Port, said it did so to support the inauguration of the first berth.
The vessel arrived Thursday morning, signalling the operationalisation of the first of Lamu Port South Sudan Transport (Lapsset) project components.
The same company is expected to deploy Mv Seago Bremen Haven as a show of support.
“As Maersk, the solutions and services we offer are centred around our customers’ needs and once a regular call at Lamu is required by our customers, we will then introduce this. We look forward to serving our customers and Eastern Africa people now and well into the future,” said Carl Lorenz, Maersk Eastern Africa managing director.
Two weeks ago, Mr Lorenz told a stakeholders’ meeting at the Lamu Port that his firm would deploy the first vessel to the new facility.
“Maersk is honoured to have a maiden call at the Lamu Port as part of the inauguration and is poised to support our customers in their future growth within Kenya,” he said.
In 1978, Maersk said it supported Mombasa Port with a maiden vessel call and has done it again at the Lamu Port.
In a statement, Maersk noted that for over three decades, it has been providing ocean liner services to and from Kenya.
“Maersk considers Kenya an important partner and fully supports the Kenyan government’s endeavours in the development of shipping, maritime, ports and logistics, effectively contributing to the growth of the economy,” he said.
According to the shipping company, Lamu will serve as a gateway to Eastern Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia when the port will be fully operational.
The other Lapsset projects yet to be implemented are international airports, railway line, highway, resort cities, oil pipeline and an oil refinery.
In March 2012, former President Mwai Kibaki performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the Lapsset project at the present Lamu Port.
The first cargo ship Alianco offloads containers at the Lamu Port after President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the port last week.
The government will have the authority to restrict Kenyans’ access to certain websites if the new law that could stoke up opposition from anti-censorship advocates sails through.
According to proposals in the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Bill, 2021, the government can classify certain websites as inaccessible from Kenya and recommend their access be blocked.
The Bill which was submitted to the National Assembly last week further proposes a Sh20 million fine or 25-year prison sentence for the possession or distribution of pornographic material.
“The principal object of this Bill is to amend the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, No. 5 of 2018 to provide for the prohibition against the sharing of pornography through the Internet,” notes the amendments in the Bill proposed by Garissa MP Adan Duale.
“The Bill also seeks to provide an additional function of the National Computer and Cybercrimes Coordination Committee which is to recommend websites that may be rendered inaccessible within the country.”
The amendments come months after the Court of Appeal struck out a petition to suspend 26 controversial sections in the law enacted in 2018.
The Bloggers Association of Kenya, Law Society of Kenya, Article 19 and Kenya Union of Journalists sought a stay of execution until an appeal against the law heard.
In an affidavit to support their case, the Law Society of Kenya Chief Executive Mercy Wambua cites cases where specific individuals had been arrested under the law accused of disseminating false information in respect to Covid-19 related deaths.
“The arrest, arraignment and prosecution for Covid-19 related publications under the statute is likely to have a chilling effect," stated Ms Wambua in her affidavit.
“Bloggers, activists, journalists and whistleblowers will be discouraged from publishing information on a suspected violation of the Ministry of Health Covid-19 guidelines - with grave public health consequences.”
However, the government has defended the law noting that criminalisation of the acts described is an exercise of the State’s duty to care to its citizenry.
“Increased access to the internet and exposure to online risks and insecurity associated with cyberspace is a pressing concern not just in Kenya but the world over,” said Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai in an affidavit.
The law further criminalises the spreading of information the State deems as radicalising in nature.
If approved, it would give the State more control over blocking of content by online users.
Plans are underway to construct a 181-kilometer dual carriageway between Rironi in Limuru and Mau Summit, Nakuru.
A joint team from Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Nakuru County engineers and physical planners made a tour of the much-awaited highway.
It was revealed that a toll station will be set up at Gilgil Weigh Bridge and another at Salgaa centre.
Engineer Kefa Seda, the project manager, said the county will be required to share its traffic circulation so that it is integrated in the highway construction.
Manufacturers can only get Value Added Tax (VAT) refunds on unsold stock.
This follows a High Court ruling against a petition by three drug manufacturers.
High Court Judge Weldon Korir, while dismissing the petition, noted that the manufacturers had not indicated the unsold stock on which they claimed a refund of VAT input tax.
Previously known as sales tax, VAT is levied at consumption at a maximum rate of 16 per cent.
“They merely indicated figures which may have included sold stock and this may be unfair and unjust enrichment on their part since the inclusion of sold stock in the figures would mean that the petitioners would benefit by getting input tax relief from the first respondent - Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) - for tax already passed on to consumers,” said Justice Korir in his May 31 ruling.
Refunding VAT paid for raw materials has been a subject of numerous litigation between the taxman and taxpayers, with the government allocating Sh10 billion for the payment of “verified” VAT refund claims.
Universal Corporation Ltd, Elys Chemical Industries Ltd and Dawa Ltd had on December 5, 2017, petitioned the court to declare that they were entitled to VAT refunds, which they had paid for the raw materials bought for their supplies that had until September 2015 had been tax-exempt.
A tax-exempt item is not part of any tax calculations, which is why the manufacturers could not claim input tax.
If a good or business is “exempt”, the government doesn’t tax the sale of the good, but producers cannot claim a credit for the VAT they pay on inputs to produce it.
For a zero-rated good, the government does not tax its sale, but allows credits for the value-added paid on inputs.
However, the Finance Act of 2015 moved these supplies from a tax-exempt status to zero-rated.
A section of the VAT Act, 2013 stipulated that wherein future legislation the exempt supplies become taxable after a person had incurred input VAT, the person could claim VAT as long as the claim is lodged within three months from the date the exempt supply become zero-rated.
“Parliament was clear that it did not want taxpayers to recover reliefs from supplies that had already been made and which were previously exempt supplies,” said Justice Korir.
It is noted that zero-rated products are cheaper for consumers since the suppliers are allowed to claim the cost of input tax and not pass it to consumers as is the case with exempt supplies.
KRA had rejected the petitioners’ claim because they lodged it outside of the right period, which is three months since the law took effect on June 15, 2015.
Only unsold stock qualifies for VAT refunds, says court
One of the biggest lies is that the only way for Africans to develop is to burn huge amounts of fossil fuel.
But this dirty energy accounts for more than 80 per cent of planet-heating greenhouse gases.
We have, and can take a different path to prosperity, thanks to our abundance of wind and solar potential.
If we do not, the UN warns, we will be on track to produce far more oil than can fit within the Paris Climate goals. Big Oil’s promises are but snake oil.
The end result will be stranded assets and climate destruction; not prosperity.
Not surprisingly, those with vested interests in profiting from this climate pollution have given the go-ahead to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), which cuts through the east African backcountry, from Western Uganda to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port in Tanga, almost 1,500km away.
The UNEP Production Gap report has shown that the production of coal, oil, and gas must decrease by 6 per cent per year globally.
A new pipeline is not consistent with such a trend.
The same cast of rich foreigner bankers is using the tired script and predictable narrative which claims that their profit motive and the interests of ordinary Africans are aligned.
What a lie! In the case of EACOP, French company Total and China National Offshore Corporation, are among the international financiers keen on profiting from Africa’s climate catastrophe.
It’s good to see pressure from concerned citizens, and many in the Fridays for Future youth movement, being brought to bear on financial institutions to stop financing new fossil fuel projects.
Banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out to categorically state that they would not participate in financing EACOP.
Lenders like the African Development Bank have made it a policy to only bankroll renewables and other green projects.
This would suggest momentum is starting to shift, but it needs to move much quicker if we are going to prevent dangerous climate change.
Concerted efforts by groups like deCOALonize through initiatives such as Save Lamu have rallied actors in climate action to make a stand against fossil fuels, leading to the stoppage of a proposed coal-fired plant in the UNESCO world heritage site off the Kenyan coast in Lamu.
These efforts should be sustained globally to shine the light on the risk posed by continued exploration and expansion of fossil fuel projects.
We should not let ourselves to be held hostage by Big Oil but rather pursue a new approach that places a premium on human development and sustainable projects that are clean and green.
Humanity is faced with a global crisis that calls for solidarity and adoption of a model that is in service of people and the planet, rather than corporate profits.
Initiatives like the call for a Fossil Fuels Non-Proliferation Treaty are timely and crucial in the global race to zero emissions.
It is encouraging to note that Nobel Prize laureates from all over the world, as well as scientists, joined forces ahead of the recent climate summit held by US President Joe Biden to express their support for climate action and phasing out of fossil fuels to preserve our planet.
The continued pursuit of fossil fuels exposes us to a global calamity that puts human security at risk.
Yet we have an abundance of renewable energy resources on the continent and the opportunity to leapfrog the dirty development path to a new model that is founded on clean energy.
Solar power alone can today meet the world’s global energy demands if it could be harnessed correctly, as it is estimated that the amount of radiation from the sun that reaches the earth in one year is sufficient to meet our energy demands for 7,000 to 8,000 years at the current rate of consumption.
What is needed is commitment and leadership.
Global leaders have the power and moral responsibility to take bold actions and address the climate crisis facing us.
Now is the time to end new expansion of fossil fuel production and invest in a transformational plan to ensure 100 per cent access to renewable energy across Africa.
Now is the time for developed countries to put their money where their mouth is by honouring a commitment to mobilise at least Sh10 trillion (US$ 100 billion) annually to fund the mitigation and other climate change costs in the developing world.
After all, Africa is responsible for less than 4 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
We have seen the world mustering resources and efforts to ward off the global threat of the Covid-19 pandemic.
We saw the world come together to stop an arms race through the non-proliferation treaty of nuclear weapons.
It is now time for another treaty to save the world by switching off the fossil fuel era.
It’s digital all the way or you will be taken out of the game
I recently stumbled upon an old photo showing a long and meandering queue of taxpayers outside Times Tower, Nairobi, waiting to submit their annual tax returns.
Although the photo is not dated, it could have been years back before the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) automated filing of tax returns.
The long queue could have meant two things.
It was either the last day or a few days to end of June when submission of annual tax returns falls due.
The situation in that photo got me wondering, what would have happened if submission of annual tax returns was still manual at this time when physical engagements have been restricted as part of the Covid-19 containment measures?
Would this have called for taxpayers to line up at KRA offices in shifts to submit their tax returns?
How safe would this have been for the taxpayers and KRA staff?
Thankfully, the iTax system is in place.
iTax is a self-service system that enables taxpayers to conduct tax business such as personal identification number (PIN) registration, tax payment, ledger maintenance, application for tax compliance certificates and waiver application, among others.
Taxpayers can do all these from the comfort of their homes or offices.
The iTax system is especially handy at this moment when taxpayers are filing their 2020 annual tax returns.
It minimises physical engagements which go a long way in helping flatten the curve.
Safaricom CEO, Peter Ndegwa holds the 2020 Global Mobile (GLOMO) Award, awarded to Safaricom by Global Systems for Mobile Communications Associations (GSMA) in recognition of Safaricom's outstanding contribution to the mobile industry.
Safaricom can now tap into the lucrative Ethiopian market after the country awarded an operating licence to a consortium that is led by the Kenyan telco.
This paves the way for the company’s expansion into Ethiopia, which has massive opportunities for growth owing to its over 112 million population.
This comes following a decision by the Ethiopian government to award the bid for a second nationwide telecommunication licence to a consortium that includes Safaricom and parent companies Vodacom Group of South Africa and Vodafone Group of UK.
“The Ministry of Finance and the Ethiopian Communications Authority warmly welcome the award of one new telecommunication licence to the Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a private consortium of Safaricom (Kenya), Vodafone Group (UK), Vodacom Group (South Africa), DCD Group (UK) and Sumitomo Corporation (Japan) and Development Finance Cooperation (DFC) today,” said the country’s minister of finance in a statement yesterday.
According to senior government officials who spoke to news agencies, the consortium placed a USD850 million (Sh85 billion) bid to bag the licence.
MTN International, backed by China, offered USD600 million.
The Safaricom consortium pledged to invest another Sh800 billion over the next 10 years to roll out telecommunication services.
“Global Partnership for Ethiopia is a consortium of reputable telecom companies providing service to over 750 million customers all over the world and committed to create new jobs, support the economy through introduction of new and efficient services,” said Ethiopia Communications Authority (ECA) Director General Balcha Reba.
“I am also very pleased the consortium will invest $8 billion over the next ten years.”
A customer holds a 3G prepaid sim card after buying the service from an Ethio-Telecom shop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
The decision by ECA comes less than a month after the state regulator received two bids for two licences to roll out nationwide operations under the new market structure.
Securing the bid further puts Safaricom ahead of regional competitors MTN that bid for the licence alongside state-run Ethio Telecom.
“With over $8 billion total investment, this will be the single largest foreign direct investment into Ethiopia to date,” said Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
Our desire to take Ethiopia fully digital is on track.
Global service providers have been waiting in anticipation for the liberalisation of Ethiopia’s telecommunications market that began more than three years ago when the Council of Ministers agreed to partial privatisation of Ethio Telecom and the issuance of two other operating licences.
Ethio Telecom had 50.7 million subscribers as at January 2021, including 23.5 million data and internet users as well as 309,000 and 981,000 fixed broadband and fixed service subscribers respectively.
While inviting bids at the end of last year, ECA said service providers needed to comply with strict technical and financial qualifications to demonstrate the company had the capacity to manage a licence of its scale.
“Under these licences, service providers will have the right to provide any telecommunication service, including voice, text and data using any technology whether fixed or wireless anywhere within Ethiopia and to send and receive telecommunications to and from outside Ethiopia,” said the authority in its call for bids.
The winning consortium will be allowed an initial licence term of at least 15 years with the possibility of renewal.
“In addition, the licences will provide each of the licensees the right to obtain access to scarce resources such as radio frequency spectrum, numbering and addressing resources and rights of way with considerations to the time frame to be allotted to the incumbent operator to complete frequency re-farming activities,” said ECA.
Safaricom first announced it was eying entry into the Ethiopian market in 2017 but efforts to enter the market on its own over the past four years made little headway.
The consortium allows the firm to leverage on the resources of its parent company to roll out its suite of products that have proven hugely successful in the Kenyan market.
According to Safaricom’s latest financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded Sh289 billion in revenue from M-Pesa Global, a 54 per cent increase compared to Sh164.7 billion recorded in 2019.
M-Pesa Global was created following a reorganisation that saw Safaricom and Vodacom acquire full control of the mobile money brand.
The suspects are said to have promised to help the job seekers to secure jobs with, among other organisations, the National Police Service, National Intelligence Service (NIS), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), and other government parastatals.
Police in Nairobi are searching for a senior prisons officer implicated in a Sh200 million fake jobs racket.
Two suspects have been arrested and are helping the DCI with investigations.
The officer is said to have conned hundreds of desperate job seekers of their hard-earned cash, in the pretext that they could help them secure jobs in Government.
DCI chief George Kinoti said the senior Prisons officer had been conducting the con game for the last 10 months.
On Friday, officers from the DCI headquarters raided the suspect's home in Nairobi and recovered hundreds of fake job offer letters.
Also recovered from the house of the suspect are fake dollars amounting to Sh2.4 million.
Kinoti said the racket also involved other junior officers, including a driver.
The driver is said to have pocketed Sh5.7 million from unsuspecting job seekers, who were required to pay between Sh300,000 and Sh400,000 to secure jobs.
The suspects are said to have promised to help the job seekers secure jobs with, among other organisations, the National Police Service, National Intelligence Service (NIS), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and other government parastatals.
Kinoti said one victim, a woman, was from Kiambu.
She claims to have been conned of Sh800,000 and promised that her three children would secure jobs at the National Health Insurance Fund, Nairobi Metropolitan Services and the Kenya Ports Authority.
The woman however reported the matter to the police after the contacts failed to respond to her calls and claimed that the job offers had been affected by Covid-19 restrictions.
Kinoti said the complainant filed a report with the police in January and investigations began.
Another group of victims who had paid huge amounts of cash to secure jobs were treated to drama when they were taken to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a familiarisation tour.
During the visit to JKIA, close to 60 victims were taken around what they were made to believe would be their new workstation.
They also received a lecture from a person alleged to be from the human resource department.
They were then directed to report to their new work station March 18, 2021.
However, that would be the last time they heard from the person who helped them secure their jobs.
“Dejected victims have since been trooping to our headquarters to file reports detailing how they unbelievably fell for the tricksters machinations," Kinoti said on Twitter.
One crisp morning five years ago, armed with Sh500, 29-year old Nelson Mandela embarked on a fashion design journey.
He was new in the city and was excited about taking a gamble.
He crossed fingers and, like a South African namesake, took a leap into the unknown, armed with faith and confidence.
Mandela walked into Gikomba market and bought two pairs of shoes each at Sh250.
When he came back to the Central Business district, he sold the shoes at Sh4,500 a pair.
He was only two years old in Nairobi but seemed like he had identified a niche for himself.
He was completing his supply chain management course at Kenya Institute of Management, but here was his heart falling for fashion.
And the shoes kicked it off perfectly, literally.
Buoyed by the returns, Mandela, who later joined a fashion school, started buying and selling shoes to make profits.
It was in the process of selling that he found excited clients asking him what outfits could match the shoes.
It was time to climb a step higher on the ladder.
Mandela seized the opportunity and ventured into cloth production.
Now, he owns Logical Clothing, a production house in Kimathi Street’s Eagle House where people order for classy, tailor made outfits.
“This is what I wanted from the outset. I started selling shoes and in 2017 and now dealing with clothing. I pursued procurement in college, which I have never used in the field. My drive to make it in the clothing industry has driven me this far,” says the young entrepreneur, crisp in a suit he has made himself.
His suits, which is what he majorly deals in, are priced between Sh13,500 and Sh150,000.
When a customer orders, he takes two weeks to work on the order and deliver.
However, it takes longer with mass orders.
“Some of these suits incur huge production costs. A suit I sold for Sh65,000 cost me around Sh50,000 to produce.”
Mandela, who specialises in corporate suits, wedding suits, events outfits, Ankara dresses for ladies, bridal dresses, khaki pants, and who also sells shoes and shirts, says that one of the most important things that every tailor should have is a production house.
“People want a physical location where they can visit to see what is happening and can launch complaints. It gives them confidence in the business.”
He has employed three tailors, one delivery person and an office messenger, and plans to create a bigger empire going into the future.
“I came to Nairobi in 2014 and by the time I started this business, I was still very green in the city. I started off with Sh500. It was a gamble, but worthwhile. Since, I believe in myself and in every venture I pursue,” says the entrepreneur.
“I have a son and I do not want him to be ravaged by the misery poverty took me through.” Mandela says that he stands out because he is customer-centric.
In my company, we are all about meeting the deadline and expectations of the customer.
I believe in customer satisfaction, which leads to referrals.
A satisfied customer will pass the good news to another potential one, creating a chain.
We sell quality clothes; we do not edit photos to promote our brand.
Unlike many tailors, he is careful with customers’ money.
A running joke in this country goes that unless one supervises his tailor and carries weapons that is threatening enough, the tailor will never deliver.
“This industry requires discipline. Customers give us money in advance and if one is not disciplined, you will spend the money and end up grappling with unfinished clothes when delivery time comes.”
Among many other dignitaries that Mandela has dressed include Migori Governor Okoth Obado, Uriri MP Mike Ogolla, CIC Insurance Group General manager Jack Kionga, Natalie Mukundane (Executive Chairperson at African Youth Commission), King Kaka and the whole Kaka Empire and a lot of MCAs.
Some of the challenges he has to weather include dealing with rogue customers, but he has learnt to handle them.
Sometimes I face clients who do not want to pay.
Some complain about small details they feel do not please them and want to default payment.
However, we strike a dialogue and are able to reach a solution.
His role model is Robert Pauley III, famously known as The Wealth Guy, a New York City fashion designer who Mandela describes as a very talented and smart man.
Has he ever wanted to quit?
In 2018, things were not going well as I was so hard pressed that I wanted to go back to my village in Uriri.
I remember I posted a photo of my son on social media around that time.
A person from my home village texted me, telling me how big a role model I was to a lot of people.
Suddenly, I felt some kind of motivation. Someone had just confessed that I was an inspiration to them.
Which role model gets frustrated and goes home to sulk?
He says that he realised that they were so many people who admired him and quitting would frustrate more than just himself.
I stayed put in the city.
Ethiopia's telecommunications regulator awarded one operating licence to a consortium led by Kenya's Safaricom and Japan's Sumitomo, Brook Taye, a senior adviser at the Finance Ministry, said on Saturday.
The consortium which includes Safaricom’s parent companies Vodacom and Vodafone, and the British development finance agency CDC Group, paid Sh91.9 billion for the licence, Brook said.
They edged out MTN International Mauritius, a subsidiary of South Africa's MTN Group which had offered Sh64.9 billion for the contract.
The two were the only companies to successfully bid for the licence.
Nine other companies had expressed interest in the auction.
The firms are Orange, Snail Mobile, Etisalat, Axian, Telkom SA, Saudi Telecom Company, Electromecha International Projects, Kandu Global Communications and Liquid Telecom.
The nine are said to have dropped their interests in the latter stages of the process alleging lack of transparency and the fees the Ethiopian government was asking from them.
In the bid requirements, the government wanted the telecommunication companies to build their own network infrastructure such as towers.
Africa's second-most populous country is hoping that the opening of one of the world's last major closed telecoms markets will create millions of online job opportunities.
As the licence fee, the consortium plans to invest up to Sh919.7 billion in infrastructure among other areas, Brook said, adding that it was expected to create between 1 and 1.5 million jobs.
The two will secure full operating licences, but will not be allowed to operate mobile phone-based financial services, government officials said last year.
The operator will begin with 4G services, Brook said.
We will soon open a bid for the remaining licence, said Balcha Reba, director-general of the Ethiopian Communications Authority.
Balcha said MTN's offer was deemed too low.
Businesses that previously depended on walk-in traffic or window shopping to make their money have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Thanks to technology and the Internet, online shopping has become the lifeline for many businesses.
To avoid contracting coronavirus, many Kenyans have resorted to shopping online and goods are delivered at their doorsteps.
“Shopping patterns changed when Covid came, clients were skeptical about shopping online,” says Brenda Mugambi, an online entrepreneur.
She says clients were mostly worried about their safety - whether it was safe to shop for clothes.
“This was a blow to my business,” Ms Mugambi says.
The fashion retailer, who runs an online shop called Starsjoaillere, started her business in 2015.
“When restrictions were eased in the country, I saw a different trend again. I think it is because people could go out again. There was an increase in demand,” she says.
In addition, many clients work from home.
Operating online, she says, has eased the shopping experience for most of her clients as they can easily get what they want from the comfort of their couches.
She compares sales from the previous years before Covid: “Business was doing well prior to Covid, there was however an adverse effect when Covid came.”
There was high demand before the pandemic but “our clients have lost jobs, others had pay cuts which in turn affected our revenues.”
“Starsjoaillere ensures customers are satisfied by maintaining proper channels of communication, seamless and speedy delivery of orders and quality products that suit their needs,” adds Mugambi.
And like other digital businesses, online retailers are faced with technological challenges.
“We have clients who are still trying to adjust to the digital space. Some also question our authenticity as a business because we do not have a physical location,” Mugambi says.
Many people are also not connected to the internet, therefore their product marketing cannot reach everyone.
Mugambi’s desire to cater for the needs of the modern woman inspired her to start the business.
“I saw a gap in the market, it was a challenge to find exciting and affordable shops that would suit the modern woman,” she says.
In 2019, a third-year student pursuing a course in biotechnology started an online shop; Thrift With Dola, with Sh3,000.
Viola Dola adds to the list of other online retailers who sell second-hand clothes.
Washed, ironed, folded to ensure the edges pop out, a little perfume if necessary; that is what sets a physical ‘mtumba’ and an online shop apart.
From the same source, the only difference is how it is delivered.
“My shop deals in official pants, mom jeans, corduroy pants, joggers, cargo pants, tops and blazers,” says Ms Dola.
She says online selling was convenient as she could not run a full-time business, and therefore saw no need to pay rent for a shop.
Dola enjoys the rush of getting new products to restock her shop. “I go to the market in the wee hours to ensure I get the best for my customers.
“I go home, wash them, iron, decorate and take pictures to upload on my Instagram account, which is my shop,” she says.
The first few weeks after Covid were tough for her because of the ban on the importation of second-hand clothes.
“People were not buying clothes because they were working from home,” Dola says. Most of her clients, however, were students.
“The purchases were great before Covid, and I moved to online when the pandemic came, and then gradually sales started improving. Going digital was a survival mechanism for me.”
Dola can tell that her clients are satisfied from the feedback she gets, though the favoured way of shopping is still going to the physical shop and trying out clothes.
“Some people don’t know their body sizes, hence they can’t buy online,” she says.
An ICT survey conducted in 2016 by Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and the Communication Authority of Kenya established that 39 per cent of private businesses engage in e-commerce.

On the Saturday of December 12, 2002, I was part of the sea of humanity that took over the entire of Eastlands from the airport, the Central Business District and Uhuru Park.
There was an aura of change on the country’s top leadership.
The current president was the ruling party’s presidential candidate.
The captain of the Opposition had been injured on a road accident days earlier and flown to the UK for specialised treatment.
And he was returning home for the ballot that would end the 40-year-era of the independence party.
At that time, nobody worried much that the captain was injured because around him was a robust team.
The climax of the day was a chaotic rally at Uhuru Park late into the evening.
The import of my discussion today is from the speech of the then vice captain, the late Michael Kijana Wamalwa.
In his wisdom, he had captured the essence of the moment with these words: “For a great leader to realise his greatness, he must stand on the shoulders of other great leaders.”
This statement sums ups the workings of an economic system. The economic growth that we measure under the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a sum total of several independent variables interacting under the directive of top leadership in the country.
Extractive political institutions destroy the genius of economic forces to organise the national endowments, talents and the reward system to generate the desired economic outcomes.
In the eyes of the late Wamalwa, for an economy to redistribute the national wealth equitably, then policy and political leaders must not only focus on the parts of the economy but also their interactions as a whole.
In the current regime, big infrastructure projects have been highlighted as the pillars of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy.
Unfortunately, a legacy is not something that you can do projects towards, but the outcome of several daily activities happening across all government sections and departments.
Empirical evidence on economic development identify investments in physical capital, human capital, technological progress, natural resources and property rights, and political stability as drivers of economic growth.
On the other hand, government consumption spending, political and social instability, trade barriers and socialism reduce economic growth.
If these are the drivers and inhibitors of growth, how then do we appraise the preoccupation with the legacy projects?
All sectors matter individually and collectively.
Investments in physical capital include machinery, tools and building that enhance workers productivity.
It is unacceptable that the economy is heavily reliant of subsistence farming using equipment of the agrarian era.
This implies that the country has failed to leverage on modern productive capacities to exploit her labour force.
Human capital refers to the combination of education, health and other non-physical assets of the nation’s workers to enhance their productivity.
Relevant education that impacts economic growth is both formal and informal.
