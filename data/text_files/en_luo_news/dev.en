Formal education is measured through public spending to finance learning institutions and time students spend in formal schooling.
There is a positive relation between the number of years students spend in school and the economic growth of a country.
The informal education is considered from the competencies that a country’s workforce acquires from the workplace.
According to World Bank, Kenya’s spending on education as a ratio of the GDP was 3.93 per cent in 1971, 7.3 per cent in 2005 and 5.3 per cent in 2018.
While this is higher than the sub-Saharan Africa average, the return on investments is lost with the higher levels of unemployment or underemployment.
The economy is heavily dependent on imports and predominantly informal that it misses out on the informal education economic benefits.
On health, in 2018 Kenya spent a paltry 5.17 per cent of her GDP compared to the world average of 9.85 per cent.
This would imply that in addition to the national disease burden, Kenya’s workforce productivity would be significantly compromised due to health-related complications.
The genius of technological progress is the return on investments in education and health.
The knowledge acquired is meant to stir innovation and creativity among the population.
Government spending in research and development is an important element in measuring a country’s ability to create and innovate.
Unfortunately, our public expenditure in research and development has remained below 0.8 per cent compared to an average of about four per cent by South Korea, one of the world’s highest investor in this variable.
Technology transforms resources into improved final products.
While there is no doubt that Kenya is well endowed with very many creative minds, our political institutions and national leadership have failed miserably to harness, coordinate, protect and commercialise these innovations.
It is the obligation of the government to establish an enabling environment to allow the most talented to thrive.
Unfortunately, our political leadership promotes cronyism, mediocrity and a toxic business environment through punitive tax regimes and poorly thought out macroeconomic policies.
In any case, it is economic hogwash to talk of huge infrastructural investments if they are not designed and built by our own engineers and designers, and majority of the supplies are not sourced from within the economy.
On natural resources, we have not been endowed with non-renewal resources.
But we have plenty of renewable resources.
The world has significantly shifted into Green Growth and Circular Economic models.
This calls upon our policy makers to make a deliberate effort to integrate green energies into our building technologies.
It demands that green energy should be our primary source at both industrial and household levels.
Our waste management system must be turned into frontier industries of the 21st century.
Relevant green technologies on waste management already exist.
On the final question of property rights and political stability we score probably three out of 10 at best.
It is an open secret that it is difficult to trust the authenticity of government documents on properties.
Citizens too have no shame copying and commercialising others’ innovations without rights.
An economy whose leaders cannot assure the sanctity of property rights nor guarantee protection of innovations of its citizens is doomed ab initio.
No investor or creator will want to put all their energy and soul into such a system.
With hindsight from models of effective economic structures, the late Michael Kijana Wamalwa had this in mind: That for the king to be great, then he must surround himself with fine and polished men and women in their own fields of expertise.
That model of leadership abhors sycophancy and mediocrity not only in the politics of the day, but also in the management of the economy.
To reboot the economy, we must not focus on sectors at expense of others
Unfair tax regimes are costing the world’s largest economies up to Sh3.2 trillion ($32 billion) from the global big tech firms, Action Aid has said.
The money is enough to have every person in the world given two doses of Covid-19 vaccine, said the organisation, which focuses on the eradication of poverty.
Action Aid said in a statement that tech firms such as Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon should be made to remit tax according to the profit they make in each country they operate.
“Tech giants Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet have extensive market activity across the world and have racked up billions in profits during the pandemic,” the statement said.
“If global corporate tax systems were fair, governments could increase their tax revenue and fund better health systems to end the pandemic and start the recovery.”
Action Aid said if this is done, in just one year Sh3.2 billion would be collected from the five tech firms alone.
“$32 billion would cover vaccine doses only, not the full costs of the vaccine rollout. This figure merely offers a sense of the scale of resources involved in taxing big tech companies,” it said.
Some of these tech giants have, through corporate social responsibility, contributed to the fight against Covid-19, led by Microsoft founder Bill Gates through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
In the recent surge of cases in India, Microsoft through Oxfam India and Unicef crowd-funded Sh300 million to support the country’s response.
“Tax revenue from tech giants with economic presence in the global south is even more crucial for much-needed investment in public services, such as healthcare and education, which have been decimated by the pandemic,” said Action
Absa Bank Kenya has reported a 24 per cent increase in profit after tax to Sh2.4 billion for the first quarter ending March 31, 2021, compared to a similar period last year.
The performance was mainly driven by growth in interest income, particularly in the small and medium enterprises segment as the bank continued to support businesses to recover from the impact of Covid-19.
All the lender’s business units remained profitable and resilient, registering growth on key lines with all businesses registering growth year-on-year, Absa Bank Kenya Managing Director Jeremy Awori (pictured) said in a statement yesterday.
“In confronting the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been greatly inspired by the ingenuity and undying determination espoused by our fellow Kenyans to rise above the storm and keep going,” he said.
Total income grew by two per cent to Sh8.8 billion, mainly driven by the growth of interest income, which was up six per cent year-on-year on the back of increased lending.
Costs dropped by 0ne percent compared to a similar period of 2020.
Net customer loans went up eight per cent to close at Sh218 billion as customer deposits also grew by a similar marginto Sh257 billion.
The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is expected to collect Sh279 billion in two months to meet its target for the financial year.
This translates to an average monthly collection of Sh139 billion in the months of May and June, a huge task for a taxman that managed to net a monthly average of Sh119 billion between July 2020 and April this year.
Data from the National Treasury shows that KRA collected Sh1.19 trillion by end of April against a target of Sh1.47 trillion for the 12-month fiscal period to June.
This leaves it with a difference of Sh279.1 billion, which is to be filled in the remaining two months, a failure to which the government will have to borrow more or cut spending.
According to a Sh256 billion, three-year programme that the government has with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kenya is expected to cut spending rather than increase borrowing in case tax collection underperforms.
“During this period, in case of any tax shortfall that would compromise the achievement of the primary deficit…the authorities are committed to identifying expenditure offsets,” said the IMF in a report, noting that depending on the extent and nature of the shortfall, the country could also be forced to look at additional tax measures.
Tax revenue performance has been negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, first recorded in the country in March last year.
A lot of businesses have shut down even as workers have lost their sources of livelihood, leading to less tax collection.
In the 10 months to April 2021, total expenditure was Sh2.16 trillion against a budget of Sh2.94 trillion.
During the period, ministries spent Sh826 billion on recurrent expenditure including salaries and other administrative costs against projected spending of Sh1.08 trillion.
Consolidated Fund Services (CFS), which includes first-charge expenditures such as payment of interest on debts, pensions and salaries to constitutional officer holders, took up Sh841.1 billion against a target of Sh1.07 trillion.
A big chunk of the money was spent on the payment of debt. For every Sh100 that the government collected in taxes in the 10 months of the financial year, Sh64 went to paying the debt.
Development spending took up Sh258.2 billion, or just 64 per cent of a budget of Sh401.4 billion. Seven State agencies had not received a single shilling from the Exchequer by end of April.
Counties, which have also complained about a delay in disbursement of funds, had received Sh239.8 billion against a total allocation of Sh383.6 billion inclusive of conditional grants.
Other than revenue from taxes and ministerial fees, the National Treasury receipts also included external and domestic loans.

The government has proposed to allocate Trade and Industrialisation ministry Sh6.8 billion in the 2021/2022 financial year, inline with the Big Four Agenda.
The Big Four Agenda is part of President Uhuru Kenyatta legacy projects.
According a report by the National Assembly committee on trade and industrialisation, this figure is proposed by the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani in the next budget, to be unveiled early next month.
Of this amount, Sh2.2 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh3.7 billion is for development expenditure.
An analysis by the committee states that the key outputs for the coming financial year and medium term period will be promotion of industrial development and investments, standards and business incubation, development of Athi River textile hub and Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
The department is also expected to modernise the foundry plant at Numerical Machining Complex (NMC), a one-stop-shop centre for investment facilitation, modernisation of Rivatex machinery and cotton extension subsidy and provision of credit to MSMEs.
Others will be construction and equipping of industrial research laboratories in Nairobi and upgrading and completion of stalled infrastructural projects at KITI.
The committee chaired by Adan Haji also oversees the state department of cooperatives, state department for trade and enterprise development, state department for cooperatives and the National Treasury.
In the next financial year and over the medium term, the state department for cooperatives will implement one programme - co-operative development and management.
Key targeted outputs include registration of SACCOs, rehabilitation of Coffee Cooperatives, restructuring the Kenya Farmers Association and a Co-operative share trading platform.
The single programme in the 2021/2022 Financial Year also includes increasing coffee production, value addition technologies adopted by co-operatives, modernisation of new KCC processing plant and completion of Co-operative Management Information System (CMIS).
The submitted budget estimates is proposing to allocate the cooperative department Sh1.6 billion of which Sh1.2 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh374.6 million is for development expenditure.
In an analysis seen by Standard, the state department for trade and enterprise plans to implement one programme in the coming financial year under which it will enhance trade development and promotion.
The key targeted outputs include completion of negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement between Kenya and the US as well as Kenya and UK.
The department will also focus on seizure and destruction of counterfeit goods, promotion of domestic trade and entrepreneurship through construction and completion of CIDC and operationalisation of Kenya National Multi-Commodities Exchange Limited (KOMEX) trading platform.
“The submitted estimates for the financial year 2021/22 is proposing to allocate state department for trade and enterprise Sh3.3 billion of which Sh2.1 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh1.2 billion is for development expenditure,” read an analysis from the committee.
The budget estimates have been prepared against a background of a recovering global economy from effects of the outbreak and rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is still uncertainty on when Kenya and the entire world will contain the pandemic, however, there are expectations of a vaccine powered economic recovery with continued reopening of economies.
In the FY 2021/22 revenue collection including Appropriation-in-Aid (AIA) is projected to increase to Sh2 trillion (16.4 per cent of GDP) up from the estimated Sh1.8 trillion (16.6 per cent of GDP) in the FY 2020/21.

The ACEA Buyer-Seller Platform aims to connect agribusiness players from the East Africa Community.
An online agribusiness market to help farmers in the East Africa Community sell agricultural produce has been unveiled.
Agribusiness Confederation of East Africa (ACEA) has launched the online agribusiness market to help sellers in the region find markets for their green produce.
Dubbed the ACEA Buyer-Seller Platform, it aims to connect agribusiness players in the agriculture value chains from the East Africa Community.
East African countries produce a lot of agricultural products but the challenge remains market for these products.
Through the platform which is free to register, farmers are able to market their products to all potential clients, such as wholesalers, importers, exporters and supermarkets around the region that already use the platform and exchange contacts for further business transactions.
ACEA is the regional apex body for private sector associations and federations in the agribusiness sector.
It is the main voice and representative of the private sector agribusiness stakeholders in the East African Business Council.
Speaking from Rwanda in an event launched virtually in Nairobi, Robert Rukundu Chairperson of Agricultural Exporters Association of Rwanda said the country produces a lot of agricultural produce but lack information on markets.
“The platform will offer us good opportunity to penetrate markets as we share information regarding which markets for which product,” he explained.
He said ACEA will not interfere or get involved in the logistics, business transactions between buyers and the sellers who connect through the platform.
Victoria Sekitoleko, from the Uganda business community, said though local farmers have produced plenty of agricultural produce, lack of market has forced them to sell through brokers who offer poor prices.
“Ugandans are happy with the formation of the platform. They will do even better when they have the system,” she said.
Dr Kevit Desai, Principal Secretary, State Department of East African Community, lauded the platform saying it is a remarkable step towards digitisation of intra-regional trade.
He challenged the stakeholders as they launch the portal, is important to reflect on the status of the agricultural sector and the underlying factors that have impeded regional trade such as low-level agricultural activities, extension systems, inadequate value addition and declining soil utility.
“We need to influence the formulation and implementation of policies and strategies for the improvement of agriculture value chains, and promote common interests of individual agriculture businesses in the East region,” he said.
The PS added that to improve intra-regional trade, in the agricultural sector there is a need for data.
The stakeholders reiterated that the greatest struggle is revolutionising a traditional sector through new technologies.
Fortunately, the new generations of agriprenuers are helping this narrative, as they are open to innovative platforms and applications.
Dr Bimal Kantaria, Chairman, Agribusiness Confederation of East Africa and Agriculture Sector Network (ASNET) lauded the platform saying it will bridge the gap between the buyers and sellers.
“...coming together, trying to reduce duplication within the region and focus on agriculture and agribusiness might help increase banking investments in agriculture sector,” he said.
Jacqueline Mukindi, from Tanzania, said they are happy to formalise agribusiness trade in the East African region.
“The millions of Tanzanians engaged in farming are excited about the new platform as it will help in regional agriculture trade,” she said.
Rajan Shah, from the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, said the platform will put farmers and buyers into direct contact with each other, removing the middleman.
“The middleman has been filling the gaps of inefficiencies, but putting buyer and seller together is going to bring in more price transparency,” he said.
Rajan explained that when the buyer and seller are in direct contact there is better communication of the expectation of the product quality and the standardization.
He is optimistic the ACEA Buyer-Seller Platform will trigger players like banks and insurance companies to play effective roles in unlocking capital.
Peter Mathuke, Secretary-General, East African Community who was the Chief guest praised stakeholders behind the portal saying they are critical in influencing business policy at regional level.
“Article 105, of the treaty clearly provides for a scope of cooperation and promotion of agriculture within East African Community. It calls for partner states and players to come up together and coordinate and come up with a clear framework on how to promote agriculture in East Africa. And this is what you are doing as ACEA,” he said.
Mathuke highlighted that an important pillar for a very successful seller-buyer platform is to ensure there is two-way communication between those participating communities.
“The communication should be clear in terms of what is required and specifications. But also respect for those who are providing services from those producing and consuming,” he said.
He challenged ACEA stakeholders to consider applying for observer status within the East African Community that will give them a better platform to engage with all the policymakers.
RBA Chief Executive Officer Dr Nzomo Mutuku: Kenya has a very good retirement benefits regulatory framework that provides a safe environment for saving for retirement
The Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA) is celebrating 20 years at a time when Kenya’s Pension Industry growth is on an upward trajectory with pension assets hitting Kshs 1.4trn as of December 2020 up from less than sh100bn two decades ago.
The Authority’s target is to grow assets to Kshs 2.4trn and expand pension coverage to 30 per cent of the labour force by 2024 from the current 22 per cent and 10 percent in 2000.
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, pension schemes, just like other sectors of the economy, experienced challenges.
Employers shut down operations, retrenched staff or sent them on unpaid leave.
Some employers, though still operating, were forced to temporarily suspend their contributions to pension schemes.
Investments by pension schemes were affected due to the high volatility in the capital markets.
Meetings such as scheme Annual General Meetings had to be postponed or shifted to online channels.
It is through the Authority’s implementation of strong risk management measures that ensured pension schemes sustained their operations and the impacts were minimised.
We are now confident that as the pandemic eases the industry will bounce back stronger than before and allow the affected pension scheme members to continue growing their kitties.
One key lesson that we must never forget from the pandemic is the need to prepare for emergencies and retirement since no one knows when their income can be cut off.
When Covid-19 struck and some workers found themselves suddenly retrenched, those who had earlier been saving for retirement had a critical cushion that they could count on.
Those who had not been saving were in a truly desperate situation.
Whether formally employed or self-employed, anyone earning an income can join a pension scheme and start saving towards their retirement.
The Authority has licensed over 35 individual pension plans to cater for the self-employed and workers whose employers have not established pension schemes.
Specifically, the Authority is targeting to have more people in the informal sector join pension schemes.
In our 2019-2024 strategic plan, we have outlined the strategies we will use to achieve this goal and the key entails the design of products suitable for the informal sector and leveraging on technology to make them accessible to all Kenyans.
Already individual pension schemes have rolled out products that allow seamless saving through mobile phones with flexible entry and exit for members to fit the lifestyle and taste of informal sector entrepreneurs and workers.
Over the two decades of RBA’s existence, the number of pension industry service providers has increased.
The industry now has 31 administrators, 24 fund managers, 11 custodians and more than 50 fully qualified actuaries.
Some of the remarkable changes the Authority has overseen across the 20 years include the introduction of individual pension schemes for the self-employed and those in the informal sector; umbrella pension schemes for employers; post-retirement medical fund to cater for medical needs after retirement; income drawdowns (before this retirees could only take lump-sum amounts or annuities) and use of pension funds in mortgages (initially, assigning 60 percent of pension funds to access mortgage and now use of 40 per cent of these funds to directly buy a house).
Additionally, the guidelines issued by RBA have aided industry players to operate under clear rules.
These include good governance, treating customers fairly, scheme expenses, income draw-down and post-retirement medical fund guidelines.
I want to assure the public that Kenya has a very good retirement benefits regulatory framework that provides a safe environment for saving for retirement.
The checks and balances that ensure good governance in the industry support its growth.
Trustees, custodians, fund managers, administrators and RBA all have their roles and the rules they must observe are clearly spelt out.
The reforms we have carried out in the industry over the two decades have been positive with the latest being the rules on mortgages that now allows pension scheme members to use up to 40 percent or Kshs 7.0 million of their pension savings to purchase a residential house.
With the enactment of this amendment and the regulations, pension schemes - through their trustees - have until September 2021 to amend scheme documentation accordingly to facilitate members enjoy this benefit.
We expect many Kenyans who belong to retirement schemes to seize the opportunity and use their pension savings to buy homes as part of securing a comfortable life in retirement.
With the secure regulatory framework under the 20-year-old RBA, the introduction of new schemes easily accessible to the informal sector, the tax incentives given by the Government for saving through retirement benefits schemes, great value additions such as post-retirement medical and mortgage access and learning from the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic there is no reason why any Kenyan should not be saving for retirement.
A former banker fired by his employer over an allegation that he caused it to lose Sh140 million has been awarded Sh17 million.
John Wanjohi had worked for the National Bank of Kenya for 29 years before he was kicked out in 1999.
He had joined the bank on March 11, 1970 as a clerk and rose through the ranks to a branch manager.
He was summarily dismissed following an allegation that he caused the bank to lose Sh140 million between 2007 and 2009.
Aggrieved, Wanjohi sued NBK arguing that he was a victim of a witch-hunt.
He claimed the bank’s management was hell-bent to get rid of its old staff and he was a victim.
“I was dismissed without notice in an exercise that was malicious and purely meant to save the defendant financial expenses,” he testified.
Labour Court Judge Nduma Nderi found that he was not given a chance to rebut the allegations, adding that the bank had an option to retire him and pay his pension but did not.
According to the judge, the loss allegation was false.
He noted that it was an embarrassment for a senior employee to be unceremoniously kicked out after diligently serving the bank for 29 years.
According to Nderi, Wanjohi suffered financial loss being the effect of the sacking, developed diabetes due to stress and suffered loss and damage associated with the sudden loss of income and non-payment of pension dues that had accrued over a 29-year period.
The bank had accused Wanjohi of, among others, deliberately making false and misleading returns and records of transactions involving the bank and third parties.
Maana Lifestyle Supermarket attendant arranges bread at Luanda town in Vihiga on April 11, 2020.
Bakers have criticised the government’s move to introduce value-added tax (VAT) on bread and its products.
The Bakers Association of Kenya (Bake) says the tax is inhumane, considering the economic downturn the sector has suffered since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year.
It argues that introducing the tax will deny majority of Kenyans access to quality food.
“The introduction of 16 per cent VAT on this commodity will further increase the average price of a 400g loaf of bread by approximately Sh8, making it unaffordable to the majority of Kenyans,” said Bake in a letter to the National Treasury.
This will be in violation of the fundamental right to affordable food.
The planned tax comes a few months after manufacturers increased the price of bread by Sh5 following a jump in global wheat prices.
The price of bread has remained stable over the years due to zero-rating on tax, with manufacturers competing for the small margins buoyed by economies of scale.
The government, however, argues that it needs to find ways to support its 2021-2022 budget.
Treasury has estimated that it will borrow about Sh1.5 trillion by July.
However, most of the revenue-collection measures highlighted in the Finance Bill, 2021 are generally aimed at deepening the tax bracket rather than widening it.
The key targets are fuel, alcoholic drinks, betting, cigarettes and financial transactions, with bread and milk formula slapped with 16 per cent VAT.
Kenya Power and Lighting Company's technical team at KPLC Huruma Sub-station, Nairobi.
Kenya Power (KPLC) is set to lay off employees in a planned turnaround strategy that also seeks to push more staff from offices to the field in a bid to align its resources with its needs.
The company is searching for a consultancy firm to develop a comprehensive transformation strategy and, once it is approved by the board, assist in its implementation.
Among the areas of focus by the consultant, Kenya Power said, would be a strategy on a gradual reduction in its workforce.
The firm currently employs over 10,000 people.
“The transformation strategy will be focused on the value creation levers and will comprise of… phased reduction in workforce to ensure KPLC remains competitive and provides the right levels of service, and bring this into line with best benchmarks in Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Kenya Power in a document published on its website.
The electricity distributor recently experienced a reduction in employees to 10,479 in the financial year to June 2020, from a high of 11,295 in 2017.
It has also been undertaking a restructuring, which has seen it deploy “extra workforce drawn from office-based staff countywide to enhance our field presence”.
This is aimed at enabling a focus to customers as well as seal revenue leaks attributed to different factors, including illegal connections.
Increasing field staff is expected to help the firm in its new county-focused strategy, in which it has transformed counties into business units.
Kenya Power said the consultant will factor in the ongoing efforts to turn around the company in the transformation strategy.
Other areas that the strategy seeks to address include the government’s Last Mile Connectivity Project, which has to an extent been a drain to the firm.
The project, which has been pushing universal electricity access and hooks up homes to power as long as they are within a 600-metre radius from a transformer, has in the past been partly blamed for the company’s financial woes.
Kenya Power now hopes the consultancy can develop a strategy that will “resolve the financing of ongoing rollout and maintenance of last-mile electrification” including how to “immediately ring-fence and take off-balance-sheet if possible”.
It also said another role for the consultant will be to come up with a strategy for the renegotiation of power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The PPAs with power producers have been a key concern for the company, with many of them requiring payment even when the producers have not fed power to the electricity grid.
The structure of the agreements are such a concern, particularly their impact on the cost of power, that President Uhuru Kenyatta recently formed a task force to look into the contracts.
Kenya Power also hopes the transformation strategy will chart a way to reduce electricity losses to between 10 and 12 per cent.
System losses have been on the rise, standing at 23.5 per cent in the year to June 2020 from 18.7 per cent in June 2017.
Reprieve for Lake Basin Mall suspects after court suspends trial
Several accused persons in the Sh4.1 billion Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) Mall scandal got a reprieve after the High Court temporarily stopped their prosecution.
Justice James Wakiaga ruled that directors of Erdemann Properties Ltd which was contracted to construct the LBDA Mall in Kisumu had made a strong case against their prosecution to warrant the orders suspending the trial.
“I find that the applicants have established grounds for grant of the order to stop the trial based on the evidence they have submitted. The court will be failing in its constitutional mandate of protecting the rights of the applicants if it does not stop the prosecution,” ruled Wakiaga.
Although the orders were issued following an application by Erdemann Properties Ltd and its directors Zeyun Yang and Zhang Jing, it will also apply to their 17 co-accused whose trial will also be suspended.
The accused include Bobasi MP Innocent Momanyi, former Kisumu County Assembly Speaker Onyango Oloo and former LBDA Managing Director Peter Abok.
Others are LBDA Board of Directors George Odawa, Anthony Kiprono, David Oyosi, John Mango, John Onyango, Boniface Simba, William Omoding, Jimmy Nabwera, Alex Mukabwa, Mary Micheka, Kennedy Musebe, Michael Obora, Joash Odhiambo, Dennis Mulaa and Josiah Okumu.
Justice Wakiaga ruled that the company’s directors had proved that their prosecution is illegal given that their involvement in the LBDA Mall was a contractual agreement approved by the Attorney General that should not warrant criminal prosecution.
“The issue at the end of the day would be as to whether they are being prosecuted as a result of their demand for settlement of their dues and whether the government is using the prosecution to frustrate them from seeking the contractual amount,” Wakiaga said.
Zeyun and Zhang challenged the prosecution arguing that the charges were illegal and meant to intimidate and stop them from pursuing their balance owed.
Through lawyer Wilfred Lusi, they argued that they had delivered the complete Mall which had already been put to commercial use and were surprised when the prosecution recommended the charges when they demanded the payments.
“The charges against the directors were actuated by the desire to punish them for pursuing what they had worked for. They were legally awarded the tender after a successful bid, and nothing in the contract suggests they were engaged in corruption,” said Lusi.
According to Lusi, the issues which formed the basis of charging the company directors should have been referred to arbitration as was provided in the contract.
He added that the AG had also rendered a legal opinion on the validity of the contract which authorised the payment of the sums and prove that there was no fraud involved.
Justice Wakiaga agreed with the submissions, ruling that it will be unfair to continue with the trial when the directors had raised valid questions about their prosecution which should be determined first before the corruption case proceeds.
The directors alongside the other suspects were last year charged with several counts of conspiracy, with the prosecution’s case being that they conspired to defraud public funds by inflating the cost of constructing the mall from Sh2.4 billion to Sh4.1 billion.
Eight out of 10 German businesses in Kenya have cited travel restrictions as the major negative effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Due to this, 70 per cent of them said depressed demand was the greatest risks to their economic development, according to a survey by the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce for Eastern Africa (AHK), a business lobby.
The Covid-19 pandemic has reduced economic activities owing to the containment measures that have been implemented by various governments to curb the spread of the disease.
Nonetheless, a good number of the businesses, 45 per cent, were satisfied with their current situation even as a third described their position as good.
The survey was conducted in the first weeks of April.
Maren Diale-Schellschmidt, a delegate of the lobby, said the numbers showed how the German businesses in Kenya are set for successful operation.
“German companies are here to stay and even grow their business further. What is especially encouraging is that we notice less mention of shortage of skilled workers as a hindering factor,” said Diale-Schellschmidt.
German Ambassador to Kenya Annett Guenther said the recent German investments in pharmaceutical, manufacturing, insurance and after-sale service centres are signs of increased interest in Kenya.
The interest, she added, was despite the strains brought on businesses by the coronavirus pandemic.
“The German government accompanies these efforts by German businesses with a co-operation that aims at improving the business environment in Kenya as well as the employability of Kenyan youths in TVET (technical and vocational education and training) centres of excellence,” Ms Guenther said.
Allianz, an insurer, is the latest German company to enter the Kenyan market after it completed the purchase of a 66 per cent stake in Jubilee General Insurance Kenya from the parent company Jubilee Holdings, which will retain a 34 per cent stake.
In the survey, 36 per cent of the firms cited cancellation of orders as a concern while 33 per cent listed problems in the supply chain.
Most of the companies do not expect the Kenyan economy to return to the pre-Covid-19 level until next year.
About 49 per cent said they expect the recovery to happen in 2022 and 36 per cent later.
Only nine per cent expect the economy to recover in 2021, and six per cent do not expect a full recovery at all.
This week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reviewed downwards Kenya’s economic outlook to 6.3 per cent from 7.6 per cent, citing the continuing effects of the pandemic.
“IMF staff now project the economy to expand by 6.3 per cent in 2021. The coronavirus shock has unfortunately also reversed some of the poverty reduction gains Kenya achieved in recent years and debt remains elevated,” said the leader of the IMF delegation to Kenya, Mary Goodman.
Safaricom paid Sh28.2 billion in commissions to M-Pesa agents last year, up from Sh23.8 billion that it paid in 2019.
The company last year recorded Sh82.5 billion in M-Pesa revenue, two per cent lower than the Sh84 billion made in 2019, with the firm attributing this drop to the waiver of fees on cash transfers and Lipa Na M-Pesa transactions of below Sh1,000.
The telco said the first half of the financial year saw an increase in activity on the M-Pesa system as customers took advantage of the free transfers and Lipa na M-Pesa transactions.
“Total M-Pesa transaction value grew 58 per cent year-on-year to Sh22.04 trillion, while the volume of transactions grew 29.8 per cent year to 11.68 billion,” said the firm in its latest financial results.
Overall, person-to-person transfers rose by 36 per cent from Sh2.6 trillion at the end of December 2019 to Sh3.6 trillion last year, with deposits and withdrawals standing at Sh3.7 trillion and Sh2 trillion respectively.
Deputy President William Ruto interacting with professionals, political and business leaders from Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia and Vihiga counties during a consultation meeting at his Karen Office, Nairobi.
Deputy President William Ruto will retreat to the Coast for two days to champion his economic empowerment blueprint.
The DP is expected to meet local leaders and professionals alongside his economic strategists in a hotel in the afternoon before they go into plenary.
This comes after Dr Ruto held a similar meeting at his Karen residence, Nairobi, yesterday, where he hosted Western leaders and professionals led by Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali.
Ruto’s tour of the Coast comes a day after he skipped the official launch of the Lamu Port by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
He is scheduled to issue his address at 3pm before the meeting transitions to plenary discussions ahead of a joint communique to be issued tomorrow.
"The DP will be in the Coast region for two days to meet with the leaders and professionals on their economic empowerment agenda. He will be accompanied by economic experts led by David Ndii," said the DP's Director of Communication Emmanuel Talam.
He added," He will wind up on Saturday and deliver a joint communique with the region's leadership."
A section of Coast lawmakers recently deliberated on key projects they expect to present to the DP.
The leaders identified investing in the special economic zones, the blue economy, mining, housing projects as well as the thorny issue of job opportunities at Mombasa port.
In attendance were MPs Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Mohammed Ali (Nyali), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), Khatib Mwashetani (Lungalunga), Faisel Baidel (Msambweni), Benjamin Tayari (Kinango), Senators Anwar Loitiptip (Lamu) and former Senator Hassan Omar, among others.
The agenda of such forums has revolved around politics and the economy, with the DP making a case for what he has termed a “bottom-up” approach.
Ruto's charm offensive has seen him meet leaders from Kajiado County, Mt Kenya and Western.
Yesterday, the DP met stakeholders from Bungoma, Busia and Kakamega counties at his Karen residence.
The meeting that brought together business professionals and politicians was convened by Washiali.
Others who attended the meeting were Daniel Wanyama (Webuye West MP), John Waluke (Sirisia) and former Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa.
“The reason I requested this meeting was because I wanted to explain myself to you and to persuade you that I have a plan worth implementing. That plan is not complete and I want it enriched by you people,” Ruto said.
Mr Washiali said the meeting discussed the economic interests of the Western region with a view to incorporate it into Ruto’s overall manifesto.
Top on the agenda, he said, was improving economic activities such as farming, Jua Kali and boda boda industries.
“Our farmers have been working hard over the years and yet they have nothing to show for it,” he said, adding that the respective counties would work through committees to identify their different priorities.
He added, "Our agenda will be the creation of wealth, jobs and opportunities as well as supporting enterprises and decriminalising the business environment. A deliberate government intervention that will put resources in small businesses will be the focal point of the bottom-up approach of our economic model."
Washiali said the DP gave them two weeks to come up with a paper to help him formulate a blueprint for the economic development of Western.
“Let us commit ourselves to an implementation plan so that we stop a government that is government for the sake of government,” Ruto told the leaders.
Last Friday, Ruto ally Eliud Owalo convened a meeting of Nyanza leaders to craft the economic strategy of the region.
They said their strategy will form the basis of their negotiations with other presidential hopefuls ahead of 2022.
Mr Owalo said anyone seeking the support of the region will have to enter into a pre-election economic pact with them.
Those who attended the meeting include former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, former Rongo MP Dalmas Otieno and former Rangwe MP Martin Ogindo.
KPA slashes rates by half to lure importers to Lamu Port
Ships and importers at the Lamu Port will now pay half of the cost they incur at the port of Mombasa.
In the new tariffs published by the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in a bid to lure traders to use Lamu port, stevedoring charges have also been reduced by 40 per cent.
Stevedoring is the loading or offloading of cargo from the ship.
In a notice signed by KPA acting Managing Director Salim Rashid that was released on Thursday, the loading and unloading of motor vehicles will cost 40 per cent less.
Shore handling and wharfage services, which involve loading and discharging of domestic and transit cargo, will also attract a 40 per cent discount.
Goods dropped at Lamu by big ships before they are transported to other small ports will enjoy a 30 per cent free storage period.
"A 20-foot container will be charged Sh920 (USD10) from 31-60th day while 40ft container will attract Sh1,840 (USD20),” reads the tariff notice which indicated that transit cargo will enjoy a 30-day free period.
Thereafter, a 20ft container and 40ft container will attract Sh3,680 (USD40) and Sh7,360 (USD80) respectively.
Domestic cargo will enjoy 15 free storage days. Between the 16th and 18th day, USD30 will be charged for a 20ft container while a 40ft container will attract USD 60.
Containers staying for 27 to 35 days will attract USD40 and USD80 for 20ft and 40ft containers respectively. Thereafter, importers will pay ShSh4,140 (USD45) and Sh8,280 (USD90) for 20ft and 40ft containers respectively.
Imports and committed export empty containers will enjoy a 15-day free storage period and thereafter will attract Sh1,380 (USD15) and Sh2,070 (USD22.5) for 20ft and 40ft respectively.
Domestic motor vehicle will enjoy 15 days free storage period while transit and transhipment will enjoy 15 days and 30 day free storage period respectively.
KRA has installed both the Integrated Customs Management System (iCMS) and Simba Systems to ensure the 24-hour clearance.
KRA chairman Francis Muthaura said they will also give highly concessionary rate in a bid to attract business to the new facility.
He said paperless customs clearance will ensure the decision-making process is quick, transparent and simplified thereby reducing the time and cost of doing business.
Lamu Port has officially opened for business after President Uhuru Kenyatta Thursday unveiled its first berth promising to launch two other berths before the end of this year.
The transhipment port targets to link Kenya to South Sudan, Ethiopia and the middle belt of Africa.
“I am hopeful that before the end of the year in October we will invite regional leaders and other stakeholders for the full launch of the port after completion of the second berth in July and the third berth in October,” said the President.
“This project will open up opportunities in trade, tourism and create jobs not only in Lamu County but across the country,” he said.
The President challenged the Lamu County government to be aggressive in looking for investors to provide facilities such as houses that would complement the project.
He promised to improve the road network in the area.
The President expressed optimism that the new port will inspire Turkana Oil investors on State commitment to improving infrastructure.
The country’s second commercial port after Mombasa received its first ship on Thursday, a milestone for the corridor, which has ambitions of being a key gateway for eastern and central Africa.
The corridor has a short term target of serving Ethiopia and South Sudan.
While there is optimism that the port will bring about the renewal of Lamu, there are concerns about the degree of connectivity between the county and the rest of the country.
The corridor itself is expected to have roads, rail and pipelines connecting the port to the hinterland, going as deep into the region as South Sudan and Addis Ababa.
“The Lapsset Corridor is primed to be the most competitive corridor in the region,” said Lapsset Authority in a statement, adding that currently there are options for businesses using Lamu Port to evacuate or bring cargo to the port.
It added that there are a number of critical roads that are currently being constructed, which will significantly improve access to the port.
These are expected to lure businesses importing and exporting to and from South Sudan and Ethiopia.
Currently, Lamu Port connects to Ethiopia through a 1,425km road – the Lamu-Garsen-Garissa-Kilimambogo-Isiolo-Moyale (Ethiopia border) route, of which 1,075km is paved, while the balance is under construction and expected to be complete in the course of this year.
The authority said this journey would reduce to 832km once a number of roads such as the Lamu-Garissa road are completed.
It is also the case for South Sudan, which though Lamu offers a much shorter route compared to using Port Sudan, over 2,700km from Juba, a poor road network might hamper access to Lamu Port.
Parliament has backed Treasury’s plans to exempt Kenya Airways (KQ) from paying minimum tax in a move that offers a reprieve to the loss-making firm.
The tax became effective January this year and firms are required to pay it or normal corporate tax, whichever is higher and whether making profit or loss.
The National Assembly’s Committee on Delegated Legislation attributed KQ’s exemption to the devastating effect that Covid-19 has had on the global aviation industry.
This, they noted, hurt “the already ailing company that made a loss of Sh36.2 billion."
The committee said “the minimum tax will render KQ’s operations unsustainable”.
In March this year, National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani exempted the carrier from paying minimum tax, charged at one per cent minimum tax on revenues.
The notice was taken to parliament and referred to the Committee on Delegated Legislation, which has recommended that KQ be exempt from paying the tax.
“The Committee recommends that the House approves the said statutory instrument (regulations) in accordance with section 13(2) of the Income Tax Act,” said the report by the committee.
The report is among the issues that were up for consideration during the parliament’s special sitting yesterday.
The committee said it had considered the key role played by the carrier in supporting economic sectors such as “marketing of Kenya as a tourism destination, trade facilitation job creation among others”.
“It is prudent to grant the exemption from minimum tax to support the firm continue its operations until its returns to profitability,” said the committee chaired by William Kassait.
The Co-operative Bank of Kenya (Coop Bank) has posted a reduced profit of Sh3.46 billion in the first quarter of this year owing to the negative effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
This represents a drop of 3.6 per cent compared to a profit after tax of Sh3.59 billion that the lender made in the first three months of 2020.
The lender put aside a big chunk of its revenue as insurance against possible defaults.
“The group prudentially increased loan-loss provisions to Sh2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021 in appreciation of the challenges that businesses and households continue to face due to the economic effects of the pandemic,” said Co-operative Bank Chief Executive Officer Gideon Muriuki.
This even as Moody’s, a global rating agency, affirmed the listed lender’s B2 rating citing “solid capital levels.”
In the three months of this year, the lender recorded increased revenues from its lending activities with its net interest income growing by over a third from Sh7.5 billion to Sh9.8 billion.
The lender’s total revenue - interest and non-interest income - grew by 15 per cent to Sh14.4 billion from Sh12.5 billion, a sign that despite the ravages of the pandemic, a good number of the borrowers were able to service their loans.
Meta Electric General Manager Mr Brian Chege (R), showcases the electric charging car features for the T3 Van to Neo Kenya CEO Mr Douglas Kuria (L) during the launch of Kenya's first electric van held on April 29, 2021, at the Apex Business Park in Nairobi.
It is getting increasingly clear that the future of the automobile industry is in electric vehicles - at least before flying cars take over.
Countries such as the United Kingdom are already in the race to get rid of petrol and diesel-powered cars by 2030 to reduce pollution levels.
Such moves by big economies leave Kenya helpless in the decision to go electric, yet the adoption of electric vehicles is dragging.
“It is a chicken and egg situation where for us to have infrastructure on charging electric cars, we have to have vehicles on the road; and for us to have vehicles on the road we need to have infrastructure around charging,” says Brian Chege, general manager of Meta Electric, a machinery dealership.
Meta Electric is one of the firms seeking to speed up adoption of electric vehicles. The firm in November last year imported two BYD T3 electric vans, one which has been leased to transport company Neo Kenya Mpya to be used for parcel delivery.
“The main purpose of the venture is to help businesses save money by reducing their operating costs through replacing their petrol or diesel vehicles with electric,” said Mr Chege.
“We are looking at trucks, buses, public service vehicle buses, matatus and in the near future we hope to replace all of Nairobi vehicles with electric ones.”
Chege said there is a substantial interest from businesses to adopt electric vehicles, especially from firms dealing with fast-moving consumer goods.
“If you are able to give a solution that is 80 per cent cheaper, and runs on clean energy and also helps sustain the environment it is definitely a win-win for us,” he said.
The low maintenance and operating cost is the key selling point of electric automobiles, whether motorcycles or vehicles.
For example, Chege says for every 100 kilometres an electric vehicle will cost Sh300 while one running on petrol or diesel will dent the pocket by Sh1,400.
Electric motorcycles cut the cost by 90 per cent compared to the conventional ones, according to Ecobodaa Chief Executive Victor Kimosop.
It costs between Sh1,500 and Sh3,000 to service a petrol bike, which is done every two weeks, he said.
“We realised compared to petrol-powered bikes, we save 30 per cent daily on fuel and up to 90 per cent in three months for services,” said Mr Kimosop.
Ecobodaa was started in March 2020 and has been monitoring the reception of the bikes in preparation for commercial launch this year.
Kimosop said they target a business partnership with Kibera Bodaboda Association and an unnamed transport firm on food delivery.
The lithium ion battery fitted in the bike has a range of 60 to 75 kilometres on full charge while the battery in the T3 BYD electric van can run between 250 and 300 kilometres.
This short range is the downside that could make potential buyers get cold feet.
Once the battery is depleted it has to be recharged, which takes longer compared to the about five-minute stop at the petrol station.
The least time one can take to charge the T3 BYD van is one-and-a-half hours using direct current (DC) but eight hours using alternating current (AC). For a business, eight hours is a whole day, which may limit the profit one can make.
Chege said if one chooses to use DC, a converter is needed to adjust voltage level from AC current to DC. This costs about Sh100,000.
These dynamics raise the question on how the vehicles will be used not only for carrying consumer goods but also in large sectors such as matatus.
Kimosop said this has already been addressed through battery swapping, considering this is the most expensive part of the bike.
“The biker pays a fee and we exchange his battery for a fully-charged one. It takes five hours to charge,” he said.
“The battery is the most expensive part of the bike and we do not want to give the biker the headache of replacing it every three years as this costs Sh70,000.”
Neo Kenya Mpya CEO Douglas Kuria is optimistic that they will adopt electric buses, but he is not going “all money in” at the moment.
He says the reason behind using the BYD T3 van is not necessarily to maximise profits but to get knowledge on how electric vehicles work.
Neo Kenya Mpya manages over 170 matatus plying Nairobi, Machakos and Kiambu counties, and also has courier services.
“We are starting with this vehicle for courier services. We want to have electric buses too, so this is for us to have the knowledge and gain experience,” Mr Kuria said.
“We feel towards 2024 we need to have partnerships like this towards what we want to achieve.”
He, however, would not say when the company will go fully electric.
“Even the first world countries have not really fully replaced theirs (for electric), that is why we have a research and improvement arm, ‘Transport for Tomorrow’ purposed to drive our logistics to a different level.”
Kuria said the idea of converting their buses to electric is also not viable.
“When it comes to technology we do not want to have a barrier on what it (technology) can do, but we believe the best way around it is to have a new bus that is fully electric rather than a conversion,” he said.
Electric motoring has been on Kenyan roads for some years now, though in the form of hybrid cars.
A hybrid car is powered by both fuel and electricity. It is fitted with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine for diesel and petrol use.
These two work together interchangeably depending on how much power the car needs at the time.
But in an electric car, the vehicle is fully powered by electric motors.
The recent bilateral talks between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Tanzanian Counterpart Suluhu Hassan that eased cross border maize trade has seen a drastic drop in the produce prices.
Farmers in North Rift region claimed yesterday that there is an influx of maize grains from the Eastern Africa Community region that had seen a reduction in prices from Sh2,800 per 90 kg bag last month to Sh2,300 currently.
The cereals producers who held a meeting in Eldoret now want the Government to consider increasing allocations to Agriculture ahead of the National budgetary estimates expected to be jointly released next month in within the EAC member states.
They want the sector to be allocated at least 10 per cent of the national budget saying the gesture, would create an equal level playing ground in agribusiness within EAC member countries.
Farmers representatives including Uasin Gishu large scale farmers Thomas Korgoren, Barnabas Kibos, Kimutai Kolum and Kenya Farmers Association Director Kipkorir Menjo said an improved allocation to agriculture would assist address high cost of inputs, ease taxation of farm implements and machinery hence lowering operational costs.
They said high agricultural production costs in the country was disadvantaging farmers from achieving good returns compared to their counterparts in the region who sell produce at lower prices.
The farmers said producing a 90 kg bag of maize in Kenya costs on average Sh2,800 hence by selling at Sh2,300 in the market amounts to a loss and that most farmers had been discouraged from venturing into agri-business.
“We have realised challenges in the agriculture sector due to underfunding in the National budget estimates. The cost of fuel, fertiliser, transport have gone up while taxes are still high. We urge the Government to consider increasing the budget for agriculture and also zero-rate taxes for inputs,” said Menjo.
He added: “The Government should create a conducive environment to enable local farmers to be competitive and reap from cross border trade that was recently harmonised by President Uhuru and Suluhu.”
Kolum urged MPs in agricultural regions to press for additional allocations to the Agriculture ministry to ease high cost of inputs.
Comarco Tag boat towing barge carrying two Rubber Tyred Gantley cranes under Kenya Revenue Authority mobile scanner spotted at the Likoni Ferry Channel on Monday, 17 May 2021, while leaving the port of Mombasa to the port of Lamu.
The towing tag will be cruising at a speed of 5 to 6 knots and is expected to arrive on Tuesday early afternoon. President Uhuru Kenyatta will commission the new Lamu Port on 20th May 2021.
Lamu Port starts operations with the arrival of two vessels - Mv Cap Carmel and Mv Seago Bremerhavel.
Both ships will arrive from Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam ports and dock at the new harbour today (Thursday).
President Uhuru Kenyatta will lead government officials and players in the maritime industry in commissioning the first berth as minimal operations start.
This signals the start of commercial activity at the Lamu Port, known for its deep and long berths that can accommodate big ships.
The port has opened up a whole new transport corridor.
The two vessels, owned and operated by Maersk Shipping and Logistics, the world’s largest shipping line, will be carrying avocados and an assortment of goods.
Tucked in the Manda Bay area, Lamu port is part of the ambitious Lamu South Sudan Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) corridor.
It is expected to transform regional economies through increased trade and regional inter-connectivity spanning South Sudan and landlocked Ethiopia.
Captain Godfrey Namadoa, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) senior marine pilot who has been overseeing shipment of cargo-handling equipment from the Port of Mombasa to Lamu, is upbeat about the project.
“It is a port expected to grow transshipment cargo owing to its capacity to handle bigger vessels that can drop cargo there for redistribution by smaller ships to ports around the region such as Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam,” he said.
“Already established global transshipment and maritime hubs such as the Port of Salalah in Oman and the Port of Durban in South Africa have taken interest in Lamu.’’
The port’s berths are 400 metres long and are designed to handle 30,000 Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) for general cargo and 100,000 DWT of container cargo.
This compares to Mombasa Port whose berths are less than 350 metres long and 15 metres deep. Big ships cannot pass through the Mombasa shipping channel.
Once complete, the port will have 32 berths.
It will be the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.
Already a number of firms in the maritime industry have indicated their readiness to move to Lamu.
Skyline Shipping and Logistics Company is one of the firms intending to set up base.
Toyota Kenya has already built showrooms along the road to the new port.
Mombasa’s Premier Hospital is opening a branch in Lamu Island.
The offices of the governor and county commissioner have been moved from Lamu Island to Mokowe.
Solomon Wao, the Skyline Shipping and Logistics managing director, said Lamu Port is the new investment hub and the company is eager to start operations there.
The Kenya Ships Agents Association (KSAA) said the port will complement Mombasa Port.
Vice chair Sylvester Kututa said the port will open up Northern Kenya.
Lamu Port aims to serve Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan.
The number of super-rich individuals in Kenya is one of the fastest-growing in the world.
These are the people who have created remarkable successful businesses or had lucrative careers and investments.
It is predicted that the number of millionaires will grow by 80 per cent over the next 10 years, with 7,500 new millionaires set to be created.
While many factors play a role in the making of a successful business person, learning some of the secrets of successful CEOs locally and internationally, will lift the trajectory of your career and speed your progress in business:
“Television is not real life. In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.” - Bill Gates
What we watch on television or social media make entrepreneurship look like an easy and exciting journey.
Don’t get caught up in the narrative around self-employment.
It’s going to take a lot of discipline to make your dreams a reality.
“Work like there is someone working 24 hours a day to take it all away from you.”- Mark Cuban
Billionaire Mark Cuban is the owner of Dallas Mavericks.
Yet he still wakes up early and stays up late working.
We are constantly told not to compare ourselves with others or to only be in competition with ourselves.
In reality, it is easier said than done. Cuban offers this hack, because if your success could be taken by someone else, wouldn’t you double down to earn what’s yours and protect everything you’ve worked so hard for?
That is the mogul’s answer to what makes for a successful business.
This is not about selflessness but self-discovery.
When Oprah asserted that she’d “only do shows that were in alignment with [her] truth,” she became truly successful.
She references best-selling author Gary Zukav, who believes that you have to be aware of what you’re good at and what you’re therefore meant to do.
That’s what you’re in service of.
“Don’t bother to have a plan at all. All that stuff about planning -- throw that out.”- Eric Schmidt, former CEO and current executive chairman of Google
“It seems to me that it’s all about opportunity and making your own luck. You study the most successful people, and they work hard and they take advantage of opportunities that come that they don’t know are going to happen to them. You cannot plan innovation, you cannot plan invention. All you can do is try very hard to be in the right place and be ready,” he says.
“Focus. Do your work as if it is your last because word of mouth referrals are powerful.”- Emmanuel Jambo, photographer.
Try to constantly reinvent yourself.
“Things change and as such, it is critical to constantly evolve, keep up with new trends, in my case with style and fashion. By focusing on your craft, you could be keeping revenue flowing, and be more productive with your time,” he says.
“Draw a vision board and next to it a process map.”- Caroline Kinoti, fashion designer
In every decision you make on how you spend your time and resources, keep checking whether you are still on the right path.
If you do this, you will remain unstoppable.
“Remember to keep it simple for example, I use sticky notes, write it in my own way and paste them on my dressing mirror. This way I see them every morning. When I accomplish one, I pull it out,” she says.
Create a realistic and achievable vision for your business, one that translates into actual growth.
“Whatever ideas give you sleepless nights is something you need to do.” TerryAnne Chebet, entrepreneur
My idea for Keyara Botanicals began as a dream but I would wake up in the middle of the night with ideas on how I wanted the product to look, what names I was considering for my products, or what solutions I wanted to create for skincare issues.
“Until today, everything I give my time to, whether consulting in communications, public relations or moderating a gig, these are things that I am passionate about, and I do with excellence, because I enjoy them,” she says.
Did you know that only half of new businesses survive for the first five years? That’s grim, right?
The statistics might be even worse - a Bloomberg research found out that of every 10 businesses, eight will fail within the first 18 months.
Many people who are attracted to the glamour of entrepreneurship tend to dismiss the reality of business failure.
But while positive thinking is commendable, ignoring the possibility of failure won’t make it go away. On the contrary, overlooking and ignoring the harsh realities of business ownership is a sure-fire way to become just another statistic.
If you want your start-up to have a real shot at success, there are definitely some things you should be doing, and other things that you shouldn’t be doing.
Take note of common reasons small businesses fail and do your best to ensure you don’t make the same mistakes.
Failure to deliver any real value
All successful businesses have one thing in common – they prioritise providing real value to their customers/clients.
What makes your business unique, what sets it apart from its competitors?
If you don’t have a real answer to this question, your business might be heading towards failure.
If your sole goal as an entrepreneur is to get rich quick, you will quickly find yourself at a dead end. Instead, think of how you can offer value to your target audience.
For example, everyone can open a barbershop and hire a few skilled barbers.
But the entrepreneur who thinks carefully about the kind of services that their clientele might require in that particular barbershop will have an edge over the competition.
Take a good look at the industry and determine what sets your business apart from its competition.
How do you conduct business differently?
What are others doing better than you?
With this in mind, develop a unique, customised service package that presents a strong value proposition.
Make sure that your brand messaging, identity, logo, colours and all visible aesthetics are in tandem with your unique value proposition.
Investing in value might be quite costly at the outset, but it will pay off handsomely.
As an entrepreneur, you have a team of employees looking up to you as their leader.
As you deal with business challenges, you must learn how to manage the people around you, share your vision with them, and draw the best from them.
Many newcomers in entrepreneurship are overwhelmed by leadership expectations, which can lead to business failure.
If you have partners or a leadership team, disagreements about how to run the business might also spell doom.
Arguing with each other publicly, or giving staff contradictory instructions is not likely to inspire trust and motivate your team.
In addition, when you have challenges that require decisiveness, you will be caught up in arguments instead of resolving the issues before they cause significant damage.
The effects of bad leadership will trickle down all the levels of your organisation, including financial management, employee morale, and productivity.
Once your business’ productivity starts to suffer, failure is sure to follow.
If you are not confident about your leadership skills, don’t panic.
You can develop the skills needed through engaging the right mentors, enrolling for business leadership training, and conducting research on how successful business leaders have handled similar situations.
Unprofitable business model
You might have a good business idea, and all the best intentions and determination to succeed, but if you have an unprofitable business model, you won’t have a sustainable revenue stream.
An unprofitable business model might mean that you either break even or make losses
There are many reasons that can make your business unprofitable including setting your prices too low, too much overhead costs, failure to optimise conversions, and poor customer retention.
When setting up your business model, think about building an effective sales funnel that maximises conversions and helps in customer retention.
Building a sales funnel requires you to consider your target audience, set up a system to analyse their behaviour, come up with a strategy to capture their attention, and create nurturing campaigns to maintain your connection.
Poor financial management
One of the leading causes of small business failure is poor financial management. In fact, 82 per cent of business failure is rooted in poor cash management, according to a US bank study.
Poor financial management can have you lock up a large sum of your business capital in fixed assets, which might lead to cash flow problems later on. For your business operations to run smoothly, you need to have enough money as working capital.
Other than bad cash flow management, financial management woes come from poor budgeting and bookkeeping, insufficient tax preparation, and failing to seek professional advice when needed.
Understandably, most people going into business don’t have the accounting skills required to manage a business’ cash flow, taxes, expenses, and other financial issues.
But to have a successful business, you have to know where every penny comes from, where it goes, and how it is helping your business achieve its goals.
This is why it is important to pay for professional accounting services.
If you are really strapped for cash, you can also manage your own finances through professional business accounting software – remember to log in all the financial transactions to generate accurate financial statements.
Job searching can be very time-consuming and exhausting. It is a journey that may take days or even months depending on the jobs available.

You should also state your achievements which will set you apart from the other applicants.
Identify job adverts that fit your role requirements.
Then make sure you meet most of the requirements before applying.
Align your CV with the requirements of the job advert.
Don’t just sit around after a single application.
Keep on applying for jobs that fit your role requirement.
You can always follow up with the organization if you don’t receive a response after two weeks.
As you search for jobs, it is important to network.
Let your friends, colleagues, family and social media contacts know that you are open to new opportunities.
Attend career fairs and talks since most prospective employers are always watching.
Hopefully, your previous steps have been successful and a job is around the corner.
Prepare well for your interview.
Ensure your clothing is in sync with the dress code of the organization.
Know your CV inside out and have some questions to ask the panelists during the interview.
Once you have received the job offer, do some research on what they offer for similar roles and be clear on what you will and will not accept.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) has blacklisted Kenyan firm Mactebac Contractors and its Director Joram Opala for three years over fraud in a Sh1 billion project.
In a statement issued yesterday, AfDB Group said Mactebec Contractors and its affiliates will be barred from participating in projects financed by the lender as well as other banks until the firm and its director undergo an integrity compliance programme.
“An investigation conducted by the Bank’s Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that Mactebac Contractors Ltd and Opala engaged in fraudulent practices during a tender for the construction works for Malaba Water and Sanitation Project under the Kenya Towns Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Program in Kenya,” said AfDB in its statement.
Joram Opala Otieno at the Milimani Anti-corruption Court in August 2020.
In 2019, the Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency, the project's implementing agency sought a contractor to build 22.5 kilometres of piping, a new water treatment plant, rehabilitation of an existing plant, staff houses and storage tanks.
The project was meant to support the development of water supply infrastructure in 19 towns and sanitation infrastructure in 17 towns.
Last year, Opala, his brother and sister-in-law were charged alongside Migori Governor Okoth Obado and 12 others over graft in county contracts.
At the expiry of the debarment, Mactebac Contractors will only be eligible to participate in bank group-financed projects by implementing an integrity compliance programme.
The firm and its affiliates will also be barred from participating in projects financed by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the American Development Bank.
In February this year, AfDB banned Global Interjapan Kenya Ltd for engaging in fraud in a five-year Sh6.3 billion project.
A company associated with politician Cyrus Jirongo has suffered a major setback after the Court of Appeal declined to freeze South Sudan government accounts over Sh5 billion dispute.
After the High Court lifted the orders barring the Salva Kiir-led Government from transferring the contested money from National Commercial Bank of Africa (NCBA) and Stanbic Bank, Jirongo’s firm, Yu Sung Construction Limited appealed hoping to reinstate the orders.
However, Court of Appeal judges Daniel Musinga, Patrick Kiage and Gatembu Kairu dismissed the application noting that Yu Sung had not proved that if the court rules in its favour, South Sudan is not capable of paying.
“Will the intended appeal be rendered nugatory unless the orders sought are granted? We think not. The first respondent (South Sudan Attorney General) is the official representative of a sovereign State, which has an embassy in Kenya. It has not been alleged that if the appeal is successful the Republic of South Sudan shall be incapable of satisfying the decree that may be issued,” the judges ruled.
At the same time, the court observed that it is unclear whether the money held in the two banks in the name of The Bank of South Sudan is owned by the State or can be handed to a creditor in the event of a default.
According to the judges, the bank is autonomous from the South Sudan government.
“The end result is that this application is dismissed and the interim orders that we granted on March 16, 2021, are hereby vacated. The costs of the application shall be in the appeal,” they continued.
The case stems from a decision given by the High Court.
Justice Joseph Sergon had initially directed that the Salva Kiir-led Government should not transfer the contested money from NCBA and Stanbic.
Justice Sergon issued the orders four days after Justice Saidi Chitembwe lifted the orders which froze the two accounts.
According to Justice Sergon, the orders by Justice Chitembwe and Justice Jaden Thuranira appear to be conflicting with each other.
Justice Thuranira extended orders freezing South Sudan accounts to February 25, 2021.
“The matter be mentioned on February 25, 2021, before the presiding judge civil division for directions. The interim orders are hereby extended till February 25, 2021,” Justice Thuranira directed.
However, Justice Chitembwe in a separate ruling found that the orders in favour of Yu Sung had lapsed on February 10, 2021, adding that South Sudan was at liberty to operate its accounts.
“The second and third respondents (NCBA and Stanbic) having been served with the orders of February 10, 2021, should comply with those orders and allow the Government of South Sudan to operate its account freely,” Justice Chitembwe ruled on February 26.
He directed that the file be again placed before Justice Mbogholi Msagha who is the presiding judge and that the registry should forward any application filed by any party before March 4, 2021, to him to deal with it.
Aggrieved by Justice Chitembwe’s orders, Yu Sung filed another application on February 28, 2021, asking the court to suspend the same as it moved to the Court of Appeal.
Justice Sergon agreed to give them 14 days and suspended Justice Chitembwe’s orders.
In view of the facts that various judges have issued orders which appear to be in conflict, I think the court best placed to determine an application such as the one before this court is the Court of Appeal.
“An order for stay of execution of the order issued by Justice Chitembwe to last for 14 days pending filing a formal application seeking for a stay of execution pending appeal before Court of Appeal,” he ruled on March 2.
At the heart of the case is a deal to construct Dr John Garang memorial military academy and which Yusung is demanding for its pound of flesh from a consent signed before the East Africa Court of Justice(EACJ) while South Sudan claims that the firm never honored its end of the bargain and therefore should not be paid.
At the EACJ, Yusung had asked the court to force South Sudan pay USD 46 million (Sh 5.3 billion) which has accrued over time.
It also sought orders to force the country to export crude oil cargo which is equivalent to constructing the military academy and another one to construct Natinga Warehouses to a company in the United Emirates.
The proceeds, according to the company would be held in a joint account between South Sudan’s defense ministry and Appolo Advocates to ensure prompt payments.
On November 26, 2020, they allegedly got into a deal to have the money paid in five instalments.
Yusung went to court, seeking to attach South Sudan accounts saying that it had learned Exim Bank had wired some USD 250 million (USD 27 billion).
Yusung’s director, Omeke, in his affidavit filed before the court argues that the consent recorded before the regional court cannot be contested.
It flashed a disobedience flag to argue that South Sudan does not enjoy immunity.
“There is no immunity of any nature whatsoever that has been pleaded or established and none is available in relation to commercial transactions entered into by the state,” Omeke argues.
The President Salva Kiir Mayardit-led government in its reply to the case says that the case amounts to stealing from South Sudan’s citizens as the projects cited never barely started.
It also asserts that the attached accounts are non-commercial and allowing Yusung to have the money would be equivalent to denying South Sudan citizens 3.12 per cent of their budget.
In its reply, the government claims that the orders by the court have grounded its operations, adding that it is aiding a money-laundering plot.
To support its case, it filed affidavits by a senior military officer Brigadier General Dau Duur, its first undersecretary, ministry of finance and planning Garang Majak Bol.
Making sound decisions is a skill that paralyses.
And for an entrepreneur, delays can be the difference between clinching a deal or sinking.
We talk to four business leaders who give some insights into the ‘dos and don’ts’ of the decision-making process.
Slow decision-making is costly.
Key matters affecting companies have big implications on business but the time to consider them and give a firm direction is usually short.
The consequences of procrastination requires a lot of time and resources to correct.
In addition, many decisions have implications to third parties who need timely information for them to plan.
One of the best decisions we ever made was to invest and create our in-house building and construction subsidiary managed by qualified technical personnel.
This ensures quality control and reduces on overall construction costs
I highly regret a decision to have our growth and expansion business model based on large debt financing, easily accessible from banks.
This created a challenge in managing the debt.
My advice? Keep company debt levels to a minimum and base expansion on internally generated revenues, organic growth and savings.
Some senior company decision-makers shy away from making them because they want to avoid taking responsibility for risky or negative outcomes.
However, when you hold a position of responsibility in a company, one of the expectations of that office is timely decision making.
Before making an important decision, I do all the relevant consultation both internally and with external experts.
This helps me understand the various scenarios or implications of the decision, both short term, medium-term and long term.
Major decisions must be well informed to ensure you achieve the desired results and minimise potential risks or challenges.
Lee Karuri, executive chair of Resorts and Cities, a real estate development and hospitality company in Kenya.
The best decision I ever made was getting into entrepreneurship at a young age.
By that one decision, I have created wealth, a decent livelihood, skills transfer and upgrading as well as a quality work experience for many.
Procrastinating on decision-making is a vice.
Everyone in authority needs to make quick decisions to shape the direction of the team.
Procrastination means putting everyone else in limbo and is viewed negatively by subordinates who are inconvenienced and irritated by lack of clarity.
Procrastination kills respect, diminishes esteem and strips your team of the confidence they have in you.
Before making a decision, get all the facts you need.
Then improve your understanding of the facts by talking to knowledgeable people or researching.
Also, observe the dynamics of the external environment.
Then make the best decision you can, all facts considered.
I don’t regret any decision I have made as it is from failure that we learn and grow from but I do wish I had decisively and intentionally ring-fenced personal time from the get-go.
If I was to do it all over again, I wouldn’t work all hours as I now know that quality relationships with oneself, family and friends should be prioritised.
Joanne Mwangi Yelbert is the founder and CEO of PMS Group Africa, an integrated marketing communications company.
People shy away from making decisions because of fear of making the wrong one.
It is however better to take a position and be wrong rather than sit it out and fail by default.
We often regret decisions or actions we failed to take rather than those we take only to later realise we need to adjust for success.
One of the best business decisions I ever made was about staff welfare.
With the current economic climate, many organisations have implemented hiring freezes.
Kenyatta University is no different.
My department had less than 50 per cent of the necessary manpower and that made for a dangerously understaffed department.
Therefore, I made the decision to document the state of the department and how we could not effectively continue to deliver services.
The comprehensive report put into focus how understaffed we were.
As a result, the department was given additional staff members and things have definitely made a turnaround .
Delays in decision-making lead to a vacuum.
Delays and procrastination in decision-making is an open invitation for others to usurp your authority due to the vacuum you have created.
It is far better to be decisive on a matter than to delay due to indecision.
After all, no one can know every possible outcome of the decisions we make.
The best we can do is to make the best decision with the information available.
Dr Victor Mwongera is the non-executive chair of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund and head of Mechanical Engineering department at Kenyatta University.
One decision I regret is when I once delegated a lot of responsibility to an officer which resulted in poor decisions that required months to correct.
Correcting meant performing a crisis management and staff encouragement process.
I have since learned that delegation is not always the magical solution to any problem.
Delegate roles with clear job descriptions, expected outcomes and deliverables.
I strongly believe in having a mentor, someone who has walked a similar journey with me.
Therefore, even when I know I am doing the right thing, I still rely on my mentor when making a major decision to get an objective assessment of my thought process.
One of the best decisions I ever made was to transfer all our business platforms online over eight years ago, transforming the company into a digital marketing agency.
When the pandemic hit, we were already in a good position for business continuity.
We successfully took part in the first virtual tourism expo where we were recognised by 53 countries and awarded among the Top 10 virtual event companies in 2020.
Procrastinate and lose the deal.
Before making an important decision, I meditate, pause and trust my intuition.
If you are in authority, procrastinating in making a decision affects the company as well as the people around you.
You are in charge and must make some immediate and thorough decisions.
At times, you cannot be diplomatic but downright straightforward because when opportunities come knocking and you fail to act fast, someone else may steal your tomorrow.
With today’s cutthroat competition, you need to be on top of your game.
I cannot point out a specific decision I regret but I make room where my team and I agree to disagree.
This is a stepping stone towards growth and change.
Many are afraid to make decisions because they are worried about the outcome.
There is also a lack of confidence and self-esteem.
They ponder over the question, ‘What if?’ Such insecurities may require one to seek advice or therapy to overcome.
French President Emmanuel Macron (centre) walks with Sudan's Sovereign Council Chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok before a joint news conference during the International Conference in support of Sudan at the Temporary Grand Palais in Paris.
Sudan is seeking relief on more than $50 billion (Sh5.35 trillion) in external debt, with multilateral and bilateral creditors meeting in Paris in an effort to push the process forward.
Debt relief is a crucial step for Sudan, which sits in a volatile region between the Horn of Africa and North Africa, in its attempts to recover from a deep economic crisis and reenter the global economy after decades of isolation.
Sudan’s debt totals at least Sh5.35 trillion as of the end of 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The country is still working with its creditors to reconcile its debt up to the end of last year, and officials say the final total could be as high as $60 billion (Sh6.42 trillion).
According to the IMF, $5.6 billion (Sh600 billion) is owed to multilateral organisations including itself, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).
An estimated $19 billion (Sh2.03 trillion) is owed to Paris Club creditors, of whom France, Austria, and the US are the largest.
A similar amount is owed to non-Paris Club countries, including Kuwait, Sudan’s largest creditor at $9.8 billion (Sh1.04 trillion), Saudi Arabia and China.
Finally, Sudan holds what an IMF official says is an unusually high amount of debt to commercial lenders, estimated at almost $6 billion (Sh642 billion).
As Sudan was cut off from the international system for decades, about 85 per cent of its debt is arrears - unpaid interest and penalties.
After Sudan’s removal from the US state sponsors of terrorism list in late last year, it became eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries programme, which provides debt relief for low-income nations.

Under the programme, all Sudan’s creditors will agree to restructure and forgive the debt.
The government will waive licence fees for firms that set up community networks in underserved areas of the country to accelerate Internet connectivity.
This is according to a draft policy by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA), that seeks to create a new licence category for community networks and develop financial and administrative requirements proportional to their scope and scale.
“In reaching the unconnected segments of the population, many in remote or sparsely populated, low-income areas, there is recognition by the authority that a variety of complementary strategies are needed to meet the needs for affordable communications infrastructure,” says the CA.
According to the draft, the rate of broadband connectivity is slowing down across the country, despite several firms deploying thousands of fibre optic cables in the past decade.
“In order to address rapidly rising demand, the authority is considering methods beyond the traditional model of commercial operator licensing and exclusive spectrum assignments,” the policy says.
According to the CA, 48 per cent of Kenyans, especially those living in rural areas, remain unconnected to mobile networks and an even larger number have no access to fixed broadband.
As at last year, there were only four community networks in Kenya running pilot projects.
These were TunapandaNET in Cobra, Nairobi, Lanet Umoja in Nakuru, Dunia Moja in Kilifi and Aheri in Nyanza, all sponsored by non-governmental organisations.
The networks utilise WiFi technology, leading to challenges of network congestion and signal interference.
High spectrum fees and regulatory demands on annual reporting further make it difficult for community networks without steady revenue streams.
A 15-year licence, for example, will cost a Tier-3 operator Sh200,000 initial operating fee, Sh5,000 licence application fee and annual operating fee of 0.4 per cent of annual gross turnover or Sh160,000, whichever is higher.
Operators are also required to produce an annual compliance report and meet several other conditions, both to qualify and maintain the licence.
Other barriers include the high cost of equipment linked to high import duty and custom fees on telecommunications equipment and user devices.
Under the new proposal, operators deploying within a sub-county will only pay Sh1,000 in licence application fees, Sh5,000 in initial operating licence fees and Sh5,000 in annual operating fees for a 10-year licence.
At the same time, fibre-optic network operators will be required to publish a standard price list that is transparent and non-discriminative for wholesale rates that will be charged to community network providers.
CA also hopes the policy will help create impetus for prospective service providers to make commercial use of television white spaces, the spectrum freed up by the country’s migration from analogue to digital broadcasting.
The authority says it will set up a regulatory sandbox where spectrum fees will be waived for service providers that will be invited to test technologies that can use TV white spaces.
The ongoing construction of Lanet Airport at 81 Tank Battalion Barracks-Lanet in Nakuru County.
Lanet Airport will be completed by August next year, Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) has said.
In a statement, the authority said the first phase of the Sh3 billion project was on course amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected many development projects.
“The groundbreaking for the project was done in December 2020, the site handed over to the contractor in January 2021 and the project commenced on February 23. The contract period is 18 months and the completion date set on August 22, 2021,” said KAA.
The project entails the upgrade of a 1.7-kilometre-long military runway at 81 Tank Battalion Barracks, Lanet, which is currently of gravel finish to bitumen standards.
The airbase will be a dual military-civilian facility.
The runway strip will be 150 metres wide with four taxiways and a military apron that will be able to accommodate larger and heavier commercial aircrafts such as Beechcraft 1900.
During an inspection tour on Tuesday by Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui, accompanied by Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri, KAA revealed that the Sh400 million first phase of the project was 5 per cent complete.
“The government has allocated Sh406,761,591 for the first phase. An advance payment of Sh39,418,827 has been made. The project is currently at 5.5 per cent. The contractor has mobilized the required resources including human capital,” KAA said in a statement.
Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna led the County Development Implementation Coordination Committee (CDICC) in an inspection tour of the project.
Due to limited civilian access to the project site within the military facility, speculation has been rife that the project was yet to take off.
“There have been questions over the progress of this project and we assure the residents that everything is on track. The contractor has devised ways to continue undertaking it safely in regards to Covid-19,” said Kinyanjui.
The governor noted that the project has a high potential for taxpayers as they will recoup funds invested in the project through the tourism and horticultural sub-sectors which thrive in the county.
“This dream was conceived over 20 years ago and for the first time, we have seen a commitment by the government in financial allocation and implementation. The investment shall not be in vain considering the potential of our county and the Rift region,” said Kinyanjui.
Residents around the barracks are set to benefit from the project which is set to have tarmac roads leading to the airport for easier access.
They each contributed Sh500 every week from the menial jobs they did
After completing their studies at the university, seven graduates from Ebubole village in Mumias East Central Sub County, Kakamega County found themselves in a tight corner.
Tired of being seen as a burden by their family, they combined forces and formed Terry Agri-centre, a self-help group and started table banking in 2018.
Others are Josephine Wanzala, Isaac Lumbasi and Wycliffe Lubale.
The seven friends include James Ndege, a graduate from Kenyatta University in Dryland Agriculture and Enterprise Development, Nicholas Ambembe with a degree in General Agriculture from Egerton University, Rose Okello with a degree in Statistics and Programming and Penninah Ocholla with a degree in Finance.
To start off, they each contributed Sh500 every week from the menial jobs they did and after 10 months, they had saved a total of Sh140, 000.
Luckily, along the way Rose, Nicholas and Penninah secured well-paying jobs and used their payslips to secure a loan of Sh250, 000 each totalling to Sh750, 000.
“We used the money to buy two pieces of land in Kakamega Central and Mumias East at a cost of Sh500, 000 and Sh350, 000 respectively. The plots were half an acre each. After securing the plots, we decided to try a hand in poultry farming as we shared a common passion in the same,” says Ndege.
Although they were from different areas, Ndege says they made sure that they had a get-together meeting every weekend to strategise.
They agreed to start a joint poultry project in January 2019.
Ndege, who now manages the project given his rich background in agriculture, says they put up a makeshift structure in Ebubole village in Mumias East where they had bought one of the plots and started with 250-improved Kienyeji chicken that was two weeks old.
“We bought the chicks from Engokho poultry farm in Bungoma at a cost of Sh150 per chick totalling to Sh37, 500. After three months, we sold them to leading hotels in Kakamega and Mumias towns at a cost of Sh450 each and got Sh112, 500,” explains Ndege.
According to Ndege, they used the money to buy 1,000-day-old chicks at Sh100 each and the balance used to buy feeds. The birds were all layers.
They also took part of their savings and bought additional 500-day-old chicks and this one they kept specifically for meat.
They sold most of the birds for events like weddings, funerals and birthday parties, though this attracted low-profit margins.
First tough months
To boost the survival of the birds, they follow a strict vaccination schedule.
“On day one, we gave the chicks Marex vaccine and at seven days old, we administered gumboro vaccine and on day 14 we gave them the Newcastle vaccine. At three weeks we repeated Gumboro and then Newcastle vaccine at week four,” says Ndege.
“The first five months is not a walk in the park. You spend from your pocket. Our savings were almost drying up but when they started hatching eggs, we got relief as we used part of the money to buy feeds”.
For the first seven days, they fed the chicks on starter mash and changed to chick mash then to growers mash when they were two months.
They changed to layers mash when they started seeing the first eggs in September 2019.
“We would collect between 700 and 820 eggs daily totalling about 19,200 eggs a month. We would hatch three-quarters of the eggs and the balance we sold it to the locals at Sh25 each since they were fertilised eggs,” says Ndege.
Terry Agri Centre now has almost 4,000 birds in different stages.
When Covid-19 pandemic struck, hotels were closed and the government applied breaks on events like weddings and birthday parties as well as restricting the number of people who should attend funerals.
According to Isaac Lumbasi, to remain afloat, they went back to the drawing board and started using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram to market their products.
Lumbasi says they also had to change tactic and ventured big time into the chick hatching business.
“It’s expensive to rear chicken until maturity and yet there is no market. During the pandemic, we discovered that chick hatching was a lucrative business. We have three incubators with a hatching capacity of 528 eggs meaning every month, we hatch more than 1,500 chicks,” said Lumbasi.
On value addition, Lumbasi says they also started slaughtering the birds and sell it to the locals in pieces.
Wycliffe Lubale says they also grow sukuma wiki, Amaranth, Nightshade and pumpkins, which they feed on the birds and sell it to the locals.
The team has stationed their headquarters in Kakamega and also offer extension services to farmers in Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia counties.
So far, the biggest challenge they face is the high cost of feeds and electricity especially for the hatching of chicks.
The government is keen on concluding negotiations for the free trade agreement with the United States, President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Tuesday.
Talks on free trade agreements began in 2018 following a meeting between President Uhuru and former US President Donald Trump.
However, it was not until July 8 last year that both countries announced the formal launch of talks, with July 31 this year set as the deadline for putting pen to paper on the deal.
In April this year, US Trade Representative Amb Katherine Tai said further negotiations have to align to President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda, which could further delay the agreement.
While underscoring the importance of the private sector in Kenya's economic growth and job creation, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya is keen on concluding negotiations for the free trade agreement with the US.
He said more partnerships between Kenyan and American Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will help unlock the huge trade potential that exists between the two nations.
The President invited American SMEs to invest more in the country by entering into mutually beneficial arrangements with their Kenyan counterparts, adding that the enterprises are the backbone of Kenya's vibrant economy.
“This is where the real opportunity lies. This is not to say that we are telling the big boys not to come in, they are already here. The big corporates are already here.”
“But they don’t have the capacity to propel inclusive growth as the small and medium enterprises that have a much greater capacity of affecting lives and changing the livelihoods at the grassroots level,” he said.
He spoke during a virtual US Chamber of Commerce Global Leaders’ Forum on Economic Recovery.
He invited American enterprises to set shop in Kenya saying the country provides a ready market for US products, and has an expanding economy supported by an innovative and highly skilled young labour force that is ready to absorb American investments and technology.
“I believe this is a mutually beneficial relationship that offers investment opportunities with great returns for American companies while at the same time offering job opportunities to Kenyans,” the President said.
On the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), he said the multilateral trade arrangement had consolidated Africa's market of over one billion people into one basket making the continent an attractive investment destination for American businesses.
Conceptualised in 2012, AfCFTA officially kicked off last January 1, with the 55 member states expected to begin trading under the agreement.
According to a new World Bank study, AfCFTA could also help lift 4.4 million Kenyans out of poverty, with the country emerging among the top beneficiaries of the ambitious trade pact.
“Under the AfCFTA scenario, real income would increase by seven per cent by 2035, relative to the baseline for the Africa region - a sizable gain,” senior World Bank economists Caroline Freund and Albert Zeufack said in the study.
In monetary terms, the gains represent around $445 billion (Sh45 trillion) in Africa by 2035, while the rest of the world is expected to record an increase of $76 billion (Sh7.6 trillion) in real income.
“The gains are unevenly distributed across the Africa region,” explains the study.
“At the very high end are Côte d’Ivoire with gains of 13 per cent and Zimbabwe with gains of 12 per cent, followed by Kenya, Namibia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania at more than 10 per cent.”
Imagine you are a consultant in the organisational behaviour space and you have been hired by a corporate to fix what has been described to you as a “broken HR system”.
The firm has been struggling with a high staff turnover with many employees barely lasting two years.
An audit of the departing employees shows that they were making lateral moves.
Internal retention panels and taskforces had come up with what was believed to be innovative incentives to retain employees but even with these, the needle barely moved.
The CEO and HR honcho concluded that maybe the involvement of an impartial, detached outsider would not only help diagnose but also fix the malaise.
Pre-engagement review of documents from the client suggests that everyone is taking this problem seriously.
Management has initiated talent retention bonuses for star performers. There is an elaborate coaching and career guidance programme in place.
The organisation has a powerful mission to solve societal problems, something that should appeal to young, ambitious employees.
So why are employees not staying?
This is so puzzling that you decide to consult an old colleague, a veteran who also teaches at a local university.
You send a brief of your understanding of the problem to help her appreciate the challenge.
After a while, she calls back with what turns out to be a stunning response.
I am surprised you think that the HR system at that place is broken.
There is no such thing as dysfunction in any organisation, each is aligned to achieve the results it currently gets.
“This is the myth that drives many change initiatives to the ground; that an organisation needs change because it is broken. No way. Any social system is the way it is because some people in the system want it that way, irrespective of what they may say. What you see as broken works for someone or some people in the system…your job is not to fix a broken system but to identify who the system is working for and who it is not,” she said.
Kakuzi PLC has pledged to invest more than Sh400 million to boost avocado production.
Speaking during the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) listed firms 93rd Annual General Meeting held virtually, Kakuzi PLC Chairman Nicholas Ng'ang'a said the firm will this year invest more than Sh400 million in capital expenditures (CAPEX) while focusing on upscaling its smallholder operations value to complement its production capacities and boost the global positioning of Kenyan avocados.
"It's critical that the markets only receive good quality fruits from Kenya, and to achieve this, building knowledge of the market requirements amongst farmers is very important," Mr Ng'anga said.
He added that the firm is also exploring value addition opportunities in a number of these crops and hope that further exciting opportunities to diversify the income stream.
Strategically the company with a 2,500 strong workforce, he said, continues to invest in developing its core crops of avocado, macadamia, forestry and cattle and experimenting with the new blueberry venture.
"The markets for Kakuzi's avocados remained solid, despite the almost complete closure of the food retail sector across our main markets. We expect that there will be some recovery in 2021, but this is not guaranteed. To mitigate this, we continue to trade with our traditional buyers as well as some key new players across 14 different countries," Ng'ang'a said.
At the AGM, the firm's shareholders unanimously voted for Sh18 dividends per share, representing a 28.5 per cent growth from the Sh14 dividends paid out the previous year.
"The global market is responding positively to Kenyan avocados due to their high potential to provide good quality fruits but, we must work tirelessly to secure this market," Ng'ang'a said.
The company he added has secured lucrative markets for Kenyan agriproducts such as avocados and macadamia and will continue adopting a shared prosperity approach by integrating smallholders.
The company has also thrived despite the ravaging effects of the pandemic on the economy.
"I am pleased to report that the pandemic did not force us to lay off any staff member. Infact our employee numbers increased, and we managed to honour our Collective Bargaining Agreement commitment with the Kenya Plantations and Agricultural Union to further increase wages," he said.
Three UK-based supermarket chains, last year suspended the purchase of avocados from the Murang’a agribusiness firm following human rights abuse claims by 85 individuals.
Kakuzi PLC is now focusing on agricultural production expansion and diversification projects for its macadamia, blueberry, livestock and commercial forestry business lines.
Safaricom CEO, PeterNdegwa (centre), with, Cabinet Secretary ICT Joe Mucheru and Acting Director General Mercy Wanjau during the launch of the 5G network at the Micheal Joseph Centre.
The capital markets regulator has approved Safaricom’s mobile investment product dubbed Mali.
In its latest report on the progress of various investment solutions in its regulatory framework, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) said the collective investment scheme (CIS) developed in partnership with fund manager Genghis Capital could pose significant regulatory challenges.
“The firm initially requested to be admitted in the sandbox for three months but subsequently requested for an extension of this period to ensure wider reach of customers,” explained the CMA in its report in part.
“The firm completed running the tests and exited the sandbox and was authorised to roll out the product on a commercial scale.”
Other firms admitted into the regulatory sandbox include Pezesha Africa, Innova Ltd, the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation, Pyypl Group, Belrium Kenya Ltd and Four Front Management.
The regulatory sandbox allows live testing of innovations under a less onerous regulatory regime and is expected to attract fintech companies and capital markets licensees such as stockbrokers, fund managers, investment advisors and CIS to test the application of technology on financial services.
Safaricom Chief Executive Peter Ndegwa last week said the firm was awaiting for approval from the regulators before commercially launching the mobile investment product.
CMA further raised concern that the massive numbers of investors involved could demand a review of the rules of conducting annual general meetings for the unitholders.
CMA further says a large number of test subjects (50,000 investors) needed to successfully test the product was beyond the sandbox risk appetite.
The approval means it now awaits a decision from other regulators such as the Central Bank of Kenya before it can roll out to market.
CMA also raised concern that some of the new investment products set for introduction in Kenya’s securities exchange are too complex for the current regulatory environment.
According to CMA, several investment products including fintech and mobile investment products in various stages of testing require oversight from multiple regulatory agencies, due to their scale in the financial sector.
“Some of the applications we have received for admission into the Regulatory Sandbox are cross-cutting and have aspects where different regulators need to be engaged,” said CMA in its report.
CMA launched the regulatory sandbox in March 2019 and invited firms to develop and test new solutions.
Since then, 24 applications have been received and seven admitted to the sandbox.
Firms experimenting with blockchain technology and mobile investment products lead the pack.
Dock Workers Union General Secretary Simon Sang (right) and executive board member Julius Nyandiko.
Candidates for the Dock Workers Union (DWU) general secretary post yesterday took a swipe at each other as the campaigns for the May 20 elections hit the homestretch.
As some candidates called for the postponement of the polls, General Secretary Simon Sang cancelled an earlier arrangement to have the County Labour Officer run the polls.
In a letter dated May 8, Sang said the last DWU National Executive Committee re-defined the role of the returning officer, saying the labour officer can oversee the election but not run it.
He said the polls would now be conducted by an election board as directed by the registrar of trade unions.
“The election board under the chairmanship of Martin Oindo, you need to work with them as a team. His team will do logistical matters in full, which you are not privy to such as developing voting registers, identifying polling stations, and conducting an election,” said Sang.
He added that election clerks would be sourced from Kenya Ports Authority (KPA).
This has drawn both criticism and support from the other candidates.
Yesterday, Omar Masumbuko, a candidate for the GS post, criticised Sang for “trying to change the rules in the middle of the game”.
“The team lead by Sang has failed workers. It is during his reign that workers lost overtime allowances and he also failed to push for workers’ pay raise,” said Masumbuko.
Since last year, KPA has been restricting the overtime allowance to 30 per cent of monthly salaries, hence reducing the port workers’ take-home package.
Sang, however, said the issue of overtime would be addressed after the Collective Bargain Agreement (CBA) is signed on May 16 by the union.
The CBA gives the over 4,400 unionisable staff a 10 per cent pay rise to be backdated to 16 months.
The Salary and Remuneration Commission has, however, raised an objection saying KPA’s cash flow cannot sustain the pay rise.
Another aspirant, Harry Arigi, said elections should be postponed because they coincide with the May 20 official launch of the Lamu Port.
He said some of the union members will be busy.
“Several union members who are eligible to vote will be engaged in Lamu. We need all members to participate in this important exercise,” said Arigi.
Other aspirants are former head of container operations at the port Edward Opiyo and Mikindani MCA, who is also former chief shop steward Renson Thoya, Abubakar Mohamed, Said Chande, Alphaeus Aluoch, Jorum Kiilu, Ezra Okong’o and Fatuma Mbule.
Majengo Warrah, Siyat Abdullahi, Moses Abebe, Kanga Maganga, Athman Athman, Mohamed Mabanda, Mohamed Ibrahim and Adenan Ondieki are also eyeing the seat.
Meanwhile, all the KPA employees interested in the DWU seats have taken leave to participate in the election, and in case they are defeated they will still have their jobs.
Masumbuko, a Shop Steward Council Secretary who works in logistics, confirmed that he had taken leave to campaign.
“Sang has failed to protect the workers from exploitation. He has been unable to address the issue of workers’ overtime payment,” Masumbuko said.
But Sang dismissed Masumbuko’s claims, saying he had fought many battles to improve the welfare of KPA workers.
He said since he took over the DWU leadership the workers have been the best-paid employees in the country.
The union boss insisted that he was fighting to have the CBA registered and fully implemented, adding, “I want to concentrate and not engage in petty claims from my opponents”.
“I have not been campaigning because I want to make sure the CBA award of 10 per cent salary increment for my members is paid,” said Sang.
James Nyabando, a banana retailer at Moitunya in Nyamira County checks out one of the bunches for sale in his make-shift shed.
Banana farmers from Kenya are set for good business from export of the product to South Korea.
Seated on a wooden bench near his makeshift shed at the roadside along the Kisii-Nyamira-Kericho Highway, James Nyabando patiently waits for someone to buy his bunches of green bananas.
Since morning, he has sold only one bunch.
His prices range from Sh700 for the biggest bunch weighing around 60kg to around Sh300 for the medium-sized one weighing around 30kg.
Most of the customers who buy his cooking type bananas are motorists on transit from or to Kisii, Nyamira or Kericho towns.
He is not a farmer himself but he buys from growers and resells at a profit margin.
“This is not a bad business venture because I make a good margin. But today business is slow,” Nyabando tells The Standard.
One of his main suppliers of the banana is Lukas Moganda from Moitunya Village, about 50 metres from Nyabando’s roadside shed.
Moganda has a total of over 800 stems of green bananas in his half-acre farmland.
On average, he can harvest up to 50 bunches every week, which he sells to local retailers like Nyabando and some brokers who transport produce to Nairobi where there is a richer market.
But his biggest challenge is the low prices the produce fetches due to low market and exploitation from brokers.
Farm prices for the biggest bunch that can weigh around 70kg range from Sh600 to Sh700 while for the small type weighing around 30kg can go for as little as Sh250.
On his farm, Moganda grows the Ng’ombe variety of bananas, besides the Gros Michel type which are the commonest cultivars of green bananas in the region.
The prices are almost similar across Nyamira and Kisii Counties where banana farmers mostly sell their produce at near throw-away prices
For example, Moganda’s story is not any different from that of Evans Onsinyo, a farmer from Suneka Bogiakumu whose two-acre banana plantain has not given him good cash returns due to the declining market.
But even with the underlying challenges the two farmers and many others could be facing, there is a glimmer of hope for them in the international market after the Korean Republic opened up a fresh market for Kenya’s green bananas and broccoli.
According to the letter from the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development to the Council of Governors, counties have been challenged to take up the market opportunity for their farmers who grow the products.
The Ministry, in its communication to the governors, banana export volumes were still dismal and there was a need for enhanced efforts to have all counties interested in the business to do a quick follow-up on certification.
“For acquisition of phytosanitary conformity certifIcates (certification requirement on any farm produce meant for the export market), you are advised to refer any interested counties to the Managing Director of the Kenya Plants Health Inspectorate Services (Kephis),” the letter read in part.
Such opening is a great blessing for local farmers like Moganda who otherwise were on a verge of losing hope on the crop due to lack of marketability.
David Orori, a chief officer for trade at Nyamira County says the opportunity has reignited a fresh need to increase the production of bananas and even ventures into broccoli farming.
“We have no justification why our farmers should not grab the opportunity. However, we now have to draw a major focus on sensitising them on the production of quality produces that can pass the international certification standard,” Orori says.
The country has an estimated annual production of 1.1 million metric tonnes of green bananas where an estimated 390,000 small-scale farmers play a larger part in the production, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) 2014 report titled Food Loss Assessments.
Of the total production of bananas in the country, 60 per cent of it all is the green bananas that are mainly for cooking while the 40 per cent is the dessert variety according to Techno Serve(TNS).
While Meru County is taking lead in the production of bananas at around 40 per cent, followed by Kirinyaga and Tharaka Nithi counties at 21 and 19 per cent respectively.
A FAO report shows that Kisii, Nyamira, Bungoma and Kakamega counties are the largest producers of green bananas which are now being sought after in the newly opened market in South Korea.
The three leaders in banana production mainly venture into dessert bananas.
With the fresh prospects, Kenya joins the league of top African exporters of bananas behind Cote d’Ivoire and Cameroon.
FAO’s Banana Market Review report indicated that in 2019 alone, Cote d’Ivoire exported a total of 411,000 tonnes of bananas with Cameroon also selling a total of 167,000 tonnes outside its borders.
Kenya on its part exported a total of 100 tonnes for two years: 2016 and 2017.
Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo while welcoming the news of the prospective banana market said the Lake Region, Western and South Rift counties are going to be the greatest beneficiaries.
This is after the completion of a Sh7 billion investment of an international agricultural industrial park in the county.
How Kenyans borrowed to survive Covid-19 pandemic
The Covid-19 pandemic pushed Kenyans to borrow for survival as the disease destabilised the country’s economy, with thousands losing their livelihoods.
An analysis by Financial Standard on data on the demand for credit from 2019 to March this year shows loans to individuals and households went up by 14 per cent.
This compares to the pre-Covid-19 era when many Kenyans were able to comfortably meet their daily needs.
The data is contained in the Central Bank of Kenya Credit Officer Survey report, which shows in March 2019, the demand for personal and household loans stood at 39 per cent, the same as in 2018.
This figure, however, shot up to 43 per cent in December 2019 and 53 per cent in March last year, a 14 per cent increase.
The figures are based on responses from senior credit officers in registered commercial banks.
In the March 2020 report, 38 lenders and one mortgage finance company participated in the survey.
In the report, loans to the trade sector came in second after individual and household loans at 46 per cent followed by manufacturing at 31 per cent.
The survey covered 11 sectors of the economy.
This saw gross loans rise by 2.62 per cent from Sh2.774 billion in December 2019 to Sh2.847 billion in March 2020.
“The growth in gross loans was mainly due to increased advances in the manufacturing, trade, personal/household and tourism, restaurant and hotel sectors,” reads the Credit Officer Survey Report for March 2020.
“The increased demand in the two sectors is attributed to increased demand for consumer goods and services.”
Consumer goods are products or utilities considered basic for a particular household.
They may include clothes, electronics and even food.
The rise in the percentage of credit advanced to individuals and households, explained Samuel Nyandemo, a lecturer of Economics at The University of Nairobi, was in reaction to the impact of Covid-19 on the economy.
“When Covid-19 came, many peoples’ incomes were seen to be melting,” he said.
Dr Nyandiemo said since businesses were not bringing in profit as expected, many people were forced to take loans to survive.
“The incomes were dwindling so they had to cushion themselves from the devastating effects of Covid-19, leading to them taking loans,” he said.
This percentage of credit advanced to households and individuals, however, dropped to 31 per cent, according to the June 2020 Credit Officer Survey report, before shooting up again in September to 45 per cent.
And while the figure remained at 45 per cent of total loans as of March this year, it was still higher compared to the same period in 2019 before Covid-19 struck.
After it became apparent that the pandemic was not a passing cloud as may had thought, lending institutions became wary of advancing credit, especially the kind that had no collateral.
According to the September last year report, credit standards remained unchanged in seven economic sectors and were tightened in four sectors, including personal and household segments.
The others are tourism, transport and communication, and real estate.
Tightened credit is the unavailability of loans for the purpose it’s being borrowed for. It may be due to new conditions set by a financial institution or regulator or the dynamics of the market.
“Tightening of credit standards in the four sectors is attributed to the effects of Covid-19 pandemic,” reads the CBK report.
The report also notes that the expectation regarding general economic activity and removal of interest rate capping also contributed to the tightened credit in the various sectors.
Owing to the fact that most personal and household loans are unsecured, Nyandemo said defaults are more likely, which explains the tightening in lending.
“We will see a high degree of defaults because the economy has been affected with a lot of uncertainties given that we are told of another spike of the disease in July,” he said.
In the September 2020 survey, 69 per cent of credit officers listed personal and household loans among the leading Non-Performing Loans (NPL), which came third after tourism and hotels (72 per cent), transport and communication (72 per cent), and real estate (67 per cent).
This was a 30 per cent rise compared to 2019.
“During the quarter under review, the respondents indicated that the level of NPLs remained unchanged in five economic sectors and increased in six sectors namely: trade, tourism, building and construction, personal and household, and transport and communication,” reads the September last year report.
This rise in the percentage of NPLs for household and personal use while linked to the general sluggish growth of the economy during the pandemic references the employment rates in the country, which dropped sharply as a result of banks becoming wary of lending as most of the laons are unsecured.
The Short-term Impact of the Covid-19 Shock on Employment in Formal Firms in Kenya (PEDL) report published by Private Enterprise Development in March shows that by April 2020, overall employment in the formal sector dropped by 16 per cent.
The data was sourced from analysing tax returns of private corporations and partnerships filing tax returns for their employees.
Anyone who has been following Kenya’s budgets over the last few years will recall headlines each year saying that the country has set its largest-ever budget.
The upcoming 2021/22 fiscal year is no exception, with Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani announcing a budget of Sh3.6 trillion – yes, the biggest ever! A little over Sh2 trillion will come from government revenues, with approximately Sh1.8 trillion of this from tax revenues.
The balance will be borrowed – another common feature of the last few years.
This year’s budget comes amidst an economic crisis brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the inherent assumption that the pandemic will come to an end before the start of the next financial year.
Given surges in infections that are being seen globally, and indeed in Kenya, this assumption may well be the deal-breaker.
The Ministry of Health has already said that Kenya may see another wave of infections in July, fuelled by the Indian variant.
This could result in more lockdowns with the associated impact on the economy and indeed revenue collections. T
he lack of vaccines is an issue that the government must address as a matter of great urgency if the country is to get through the pandemic without further economic woes.
While deficits in government budgets are not uncommon, Kenya seems to be annually widening the gap between expenditure and revenues.
If one applies this model to their household budget, the upshot will almost certainly be bankruptcy.
What is actually required is curtailing recurring government expenditures, which is something that the government has acknowledged in the past with proposed austerity measures.
The reality is that Kenya has not succeeded in doing this, and the pressure on revenue collection is exacerbated.
When you add to the high level of wastage and corruption we are witnessing, the deficit will almost certainly continue to widen.
The responsibility for tax collection and enforcement lies with the Kenya Revenue Authority better (KRA).
There is no doubt that the authority has improved significantly in this task since it was set up in 1995.
The taxman estimates that 4.4 million tax returns were filed by June 30 last year, up from 3.6 million in the previous year.
While this is a significant improvement, when compared to the country’s population, this number of returns seems unusually low.
The increase in the number of tax returns, is to a large extent, due to the online reporting system, iTax, and a major push by KRA through taxpayer education.
There is no doubt that the online system has made filing tax returns significantly easier and gone are the large queues of people witnessed at Times Tower on deadline day.
That said, there is still much to be done to make filing returns a seamless and painless exercise.
System downtime during filing periods is something that all of us will have experienced, although, in typical Kenyan fashion, we inevitably wait until the last day to file our returns as we do with most things!
The spreadsheet that one uses to file a return is by no means the simplest to use. One key issue seems to be that taxpayers are not alerted to changes in the model until they try to upload a return.
The spreadsheet does not allow one to make it more relevant to their sources of income – in essence, it is too rigid and inflexible. KRA should be able to rectify this without too much effort.
Last year was unusual in that different rates of tax were applicable in the first quarter as compared to the rest of the year.
This followed the Covid-19 relief measures that were introduced in April 2020.
There was much debate about whether the changes were meant to apply for the whole year or whether some form of apportionment was needed.
In the end, the decision was made for apportionment.
One can argue about what the correct treatment should be, but the issue was how long it took for the decision to be made and, indeed, to amend the iTax system.
The age-old notion has always been that the more complex and difficult it is to file a tax return, the more likely it will be that taxpayers simply won’t file their returns.
While the issue with the system has been resolved, there is an inherent administrative issue here that must be addressed.
KRA has to be significantly more proactive in dealing with changes in rates and law to ensure the least inconvenience to taxpayers.
The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has facilitated the admission of seven firms in the CMA Regulatory Sandbox since its launch in March 2019.
This follows the approval of the Regulatory Sandbox Policy Guidance Note (Regulatory Sandbox PGN) in March 2019.
The firms admitted into the Regulatory Sandbox are Pezesha Africa, Innova Limited, Genghis Capital Limited, the Central Depository and Settlement Corporation (CDSC), Pyypl Group Limited, Belrium Kenya Limited and Four Front Management.
The regulator on Monday said it has received 24 applications in robo-advisory, blockchain technology, tokenization of real estate, providing access to global stocks, crowdfunding platforms, Electronic Know Your Customer platform, Screen-Based Security Lending and Borrowing platform, Regtech solutions and Data Analytics.
”The Authority’s commitment to the introduction of the sandbox is aligned to the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP, 2014-2023) which identites technological innovation as one of the five centres of excellence of the Kenyan capital markets,’’ said Wyckliffe Shamiah
He observed that CMA’s keen interest is to proactively review its supervisory and regulatory model to take into consideration the fast-changing environment across the capital markets’ product and services design, infrastructure, and supervision.
“CMA has been at the forefront of implementing initiatives to stimulate and support the growth of FinTech and innovation within Kenya’s capital markets. In line with its facilitative role, the Authority seeks to provide a conducive regulatory environment for the deployment of innovative FinTech and business models that have the potential to deepen capital markets in Kenya,’’ he added.
The report covers some of the key milestones achieved including SMEs benefitting from funding through the crowdfunding platform operated by Pezesha Limited.
It also covers the key lessons the sandbox review committee has learnt, opportunities identified so far and how these will be entrenched to make the future sandbox engagements better.
The Authority has also gathered insights to inform the development of a facilitative regulatory framework for Fintechs.
Green SME financing receives additional Sh2.1 billion
african Guarantee Fund on Monday received a capital increase of Sh2.145 billion (USD 20 million) from the Danish Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) to facilitate green SME financing in Africa.
The capital increase is partially financed by the Danish Government, as part of the Danish “COVID-19 Development Assistance” package.
Including the additional Sh2.1 billion, the total Danish investment in AGF amounts to Sh7.7 billion.
The capital increment into the African Guarantee Fund will increase the Fund’s capacity to unlock financing for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Africa. SMEs in the continent have experienced a deterioration in their creditworthiness as a result of the economic impact of Covid-19.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa 2020 survey reports business closure, lack of operational cashflow and a drop in demand as the top challenges facing African SMEs as a result of the pandemic.
“The initial Danish capital injection into the African Guarantee Fund not only generated economic and social impact but also helped to attract more capital from other Development Finance Institutions,” said AGF’s CEO, Jules Ngankam.
“With this capital increment, our capacity to offer more green guarantees to financial institutions is enhanced and will facilitate sustainable financing for green transition in Africa,” he said
“Private SMEs are vital for creating and safeguarding decent jobs in Africa, but they face huge challenges in the Covid-19 crisis. We are confident that our investment will attract other investors to exploit the proven potential of SMEs in Africa,” said IFU’s CEO, Torben Huss
The ban on logging in public forests three years ago has had mixed results, environmentalists say.
The Environment Ministry in 2018 imposed a nationwide ban on timber harvesting in all public and community forests to allow reassessment and rationalisation of the entire forest sector in the country following calls to save the main water towers.
But while it has helped improve forest cover, it has also seen the prices of timber more than double as traders cash in on increased demand amid a biting shortage.
According to Earth Journalism Network, an Internews and Internews Europe project, more than 100,000 hectares of the Mau Forest had been destroyed as of the year 2000.
And according to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), up to 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex’s 416,000 hectares were destroyed between 1990 and 2001.
Environmentalists also claim the initiative has not done much in boosting forest cover but has instead created a shortage that has, in turn, led to unchecked cutting down of trees in private farmlands to fill the gap.
Initially, the State had planned to improve forest cover by 10 per cent by 2022, a target that now seems out of reach.
The Environment Ministry last year said Sh48 billion is needed to implement the strategy, with Environment and Forestry Principal Secretary Chris Kiptoo lamenting the lack of financial support from the National Treasury.
Other stakeholders say the ban has nearly doubled the demand for timber products, making Kenya a net importer of wood from countries such as Malawi, Uganda, Congo and Tanzania.
Kinoro David, a Nairobi-based timber trader who imports timber from Malawi through Tanzania, said it takes him over one week to get the cargo into the country.
“There is high demand for timber driven by the construction sector and furniture business. It is, however, a struggle to get the product following the ban; local private farms which provided an option cannot meet the demand, forcing us to rely on imports from neighbouring countries,” said Mr Kinoro.
“Before the 2018 ban, we sold a board foot (bf) for Sh40, but the price has more than doubled to Sh100. The time taken to get the product to the Kenyan market is another issue, making the business cumbersome.”
Most of the imported timber includes pine, cypress and mahogany.
Uganda, Malawi, and Tanzania are the key source markets for pine and cypress, while mahogany is mainly sourced from Congo.
The National Alliance of Community Forest Association Secretary Gerald Ngatia noted that since the implementation of the logging ban, tea factories, schools and other institutions dependent on public forests for wood products have been affected greatly.
“Public forests produce the bulk of wood used locally. We are seeing massive harvesting of trees going on in private farms to fill the supply gap, which is still not enough,” said Mr Ngatia.
“Saw millers, who depended on public forests, are facing the auctioneers’ hammer.”
The government imposed a moratorium on logging in public and community forests in 2018.
The ministry of environment has implemented the ban in phases.
Initially, it started as a three-month ban before it was increased to six months and later one year.
Last November, Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko partially lifted the logging ban in public and community forests.
The move was to allow for harvesting and disposal of mature and over-mature forest plantations for an area not exceeding 5,000 hectares.
“Having considered the recommendations of both the Board of Management of Kenya Forest Service..., the government has decided that the moratorium on logging in public and community forests shall continue but varied and or modified to allow for harvesting and disposal of mature forest plantations,” said Tobiko.
He said the harvesting and disposal would be oversighted by a multi-agency team.
Despite the partial lifting of the ban, Timber Manufacturers Association (TMA) say the industry is still bleeding from the government’s directive, with many saw millers forced to close shop amid piling debts.
TMA Communications Secretary Clement Nyoro said the industry directly employs 50,000 people and relies on government forests for timber.
He said the move had left mature trees set for harvest to rot away.
He added that the industry injected close to Sh500 million annually into the economies of such towns as Njoro, Elburgon, Molo and Timboroa, which have now been left desolate.
Kenya has a forest cover of 7.4 per cent of its land area compared to 12 per cent 50 years ago.
The ban restricted the extraction of timber from the forests to give KFS more time to implement measures to protect forests.
Kebs wants all thermal guns re-calibrated
The standards body has asked owners of thermal guns (non-contact infrared thermometer) to re-calibrate them to improve the accuracy of their readings.
The gadgets are used to check temperatures in public places and hospitals in the fight against Covid-19.
Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) said the re-calibration ought to take into account any ‘drift’ or low change in the response of a gauge - in the course of their use.
This has been occasioned by instances of faulty readings of these devices which are now mandatory in all public spaces for screening possible Covid-19 cases.
Drifting on measurement gadgets occurs as part of the ageing process of some of the components of the device or changes in the environment among them humidity or temperatures.
Any temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius is considered above normal, hence a suspected Covid-19 case.
Josephat Bangi, who heads the metrology department at the Kenya Bureau of Standards, said one sign that the thermal gun needs to be re-calibrated is when it becomes ‘erratic’ when giving readings.
“People have their temperature taken and it turns out to be not as expected or not specific,” he explained.
When you notice your thermal gun is erratic, and it gives erratic measurements, then it could be time for it to be re-calibrated.
Bangi says while some thermal guns have an upper limit reading of 42 degrees Celsius, some can go to 50.
“Some are also affected by magnetism,” he said.
Sometimes, he noted, depends on the manufacturer’s instructions.
“What is recommended depends on the frequency of use. There are places where thermo guns measure small populations, maybe you have five people in your institution while there are other organisations where the number of people being measured in a day is so huge and the thermo gun is so busy the whole day,” he explained.
Some manufacturers would recommend after a year but there are no uniform timelines as this depends on the frequency of use.
While Kenya’s history is replete with economic blueprints ranging from Vision 2030 to the Big Four Agenda, there has not been clear articulation of the principles guiding the collection of revenue to fund the country’s growth plans.
And as Kenyans find themselves facing a mountain of debt and its attendant high taxation policies that touch on everything from bread to infant milk, the anger is palpable.
Now more than ever, there is a great need to have a new tax policy that outlines the principles that will guide the Kenyan economy into prosperity.
Ideas around taxation principles have been floated by various thinkers over the last few centuries.
Adam Smith wrote in the Wealth of Nations that “…the economic incomes of private people are of three main types: rent, wages and profit. Ordinary taxpayers will ultimately pay their taxes from at least one of these revenue sources.”
In his mind, Smith must have classified the entire economy into the three factors of production of land, labour and enterprise.
His ideas have been enriched over time and today we also include the fourth factor of production which is capital - whose income is in the form of interest.
In many ways, these four factors of production might be compared to the four legs of a table that give it stability and balance.
They are the four building blocks of the economy – emphasising one at the expense of others creates an imbalance and generates instability across the entire system.
Of all the four factors of production, it is the entrepreneur who has borne the brunt of over taxation.
From the introduction of the digital service tax targeting online businesses to the increase in VAT on fuel products, and now with the controversial minimum tax laws, the catalogue of obstacles facing the business community is alarming.
All this while, the Covid pandemic is ravaging the economy, leaving many jobless and contributing to a very restless environment.
Whereas many might hope that the full reopening of the economy will help mitigate this harsh environment, there is a wave of discontentment across the country that calls for a fundamental transformation of our economic model into one that values and promotes enterprise and innovation.
In sharp contrast, the factor of production associated with capital appears to have been spared from the harsh taxation regime evident in the other areas.
The Treasury proposal to remove the excise tax of 20 per cent on bank loans will lessen the tax load in the banking sector by up to Sh7 billion annually.
There was a promise that this could see banks reducing loan costs, but these claims have been impeached by evidence on the ground pointing to the contrary.
Such examples reinforce a narrative that Kenya’s economic model is anchored on punishing enterprise but rewarding capital.
In the final analysis, a sense of balance and stability can only be achieved through a new tax policy that equally draws from all the factors of production.
Through a spirit of shared responsibility, Kenya can be able to raise enough tax revenue without one party feeling overburdened.
A song released about 14 years ago by the group Boomba Clan, titled ‘African Timer’ talked about how Africans rarely keep time.
But all over Kenya, the motorbikes, popularly known as bodaboda, have been an antidote to the ‘lateness syndrome’.
Due to their speed and convenience, the bikes have seen their popularity skyrocket, even earning their way into ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Bolt.
One thing, though, is weighing down this transport sub-sector: the cost of fuel.
John Njeru has been in the bodaboda business in Nairobi’s central business district for the past six years and he says he has experienced a sharp rise in fuel costs.
“Back in 2015 when I was starting off my business, I would use Sh200 worth of petrol for a whole day. Today my fuel cost ranges Sh500 to Sh1,000,” he says.
Fuel consumed by the motorbikes varies with how large the engine is; more powerful engines will consume more.
“Brands such as TVS, Boxer and SkyGo consume more petrol compared to other motorbikes,” says Njeru.
“The high consumers hold an advantage, especially here in Nairobi CBD where we do deliveries of heavy products, which need more power.”
Joseph Gikaru is a young man who joined the bodaboda industry two years ago.
He says after the recent reopening of the economy, more people are commuting and he is ferrying more customers, yet his profits have not improved.
“My bike consumes more since I do more trips but fuel cost is quite high, keeping my profits at the same level,” he says.
I used to buy Sh400 worth of petrol for a day, now I use Sh600.
The traffic gridlock in Nairobi has also contributed to higher bodaboda usage.
It is a critical balance between cost of transport and convenience.
But with many people’s disposable income reducing from the impact of Covid-19, Gikaru has observed that a good number of commuters would rather wait in traffic in a matatu than take a bodaboda, which is costlier.
Chacha Nyaigoti Bichiang'a Personal Financial expert and Coach.
He is also the author of the book Mastering your money.
The subject of money is emotive and controversial, especially among Africans.
It is the number one cause of conflicts in families and institutions.
The big question however is: Why do many people experience many problems with money?
Personal financial coach Chacha Nyaigoti Bichiang’a argues that the main root cause of financial problems is lack of financial mastery and literacy.
A past survey conducted by the World Bank showed that many people around the world are financially illiterate but the numbers are high in low-income countries.
The study adds that low level of financial literacy has led to adverse financial outcomes.
Even so, society is still struggling to come to terms with the myths and misconceptions people have about the concept of money, which emanates from the way they were brought up.
“The way we were brought up when young, relating with parents, school system, religious groups, and mass media are all agents of socialisation that have made us develop certain beliefs about money,” said Bichiang’a, a personal financial coach and author of mastering your money.
To take stock of the evidence, Kenya has well-trained financial experts yet it has a lot of controversies concerning money.
Talk of money-laundering, high debts and poor economic growth that forces investors to rethink their plans.
This has something to do with poor financial management.
Churches have fallen victim of disintegration due to the impact brought about by money.
For a long time, money has been defined as a medium of exchange.
However, over the years, money has undergone a transformation.
Right from barter trade, metallic coins such as silver and gold, to paper money.
Now we are talking about digital currencies that can also be referred to as e-money.
We can now conduct business using electronic means such as electronic funds transfer- M-Pesa, and even pay our bills using digital money.
The other form of currency, which has been introduced in the country, but has not been fully accepted is Cryptocurrency.
A good example is Bitcoin which even the Central Bank of Kenya has not allowed for widespread use.
Money therefore can be said to be more than a medium of exchange but a store of value.
This means that with Sh1000, you can decide to buy shares at the Nairobi Securities Exchange.
“You simply store the value of money in the shares. So, when you buy 100 shares of Safaricom using Sh1,000, that means the value of your money is in the shares that you have bought,” said Bichiang’a.
According to Bichiang’a, money can also be an idea.
For one to make money, one needs to come up with an idea which can generate money.
And this is where creativity kicks in.
Wealth can be determined by how much one is able to generate.
He said even M-Pesa money transfer platform itself was an idea which has made Safaricom one of the biggest companies in East and Central Africa.
“By coming up with an idea, it means the idea can now fade and earn income which can then be stored in properties or in valuable means of owning wealth,” Bichiang’a said.
Motorists using super petrol will have to dig deeper into their pockets after the government increased the price of the fuel by Sh3.56 per litre, pushing the cost to Sh126.37 in Nairobi.
Users of diesel and kerosene were, however, spared the hike with the cost of the two products remaining unchanged for the third consecutive month.
In its latest price guideline released yesterday, the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) also restored the margins for oil marketing companies, which had been slashed last month in a move to cushion Kenyans from a price increase.
“In the period under review, the price for super petrol increases by Sh3.56 per litre while that of diesel and kerosene remains unchanged,” said Epra in a statement signed by acting director-general Daniel Kiptoo.
Diesel, heavily used by transporters and manufacturers, will sell at Sh107.66 in Nairobi while kerosene, a lighting and cooking fuel largely for the poor, will retail at Sh97.85 in the capital.
The hike in the price of petrol came despite a drop in the cost of crude oil in April, when the products that will be consumed in the country over the May-June pricing cycle were procured.
Epra may, however, have factored in the costs associated with the price stabilisation in April and that spared consumers higher prices.
At Sh126.37 per litre, petrol will be retailing at its highest since September 2018 when it reached Sh127.8 per litre after the government introduced 16 per cent value-added tax (VAT) on fuel.
The high prices were short-lived, though, as the government reduced the VAT rate to eight per cent after yielding to public outcry.
When it retained April-May prices at the same level as March, Epra and the Petroleum ministry had brokered a deal with the oil marketing companies to slash their margins, but later be compensated by the National Treasury.
The companies took a Sh4.44 cut per litre of petrol.
The cut was less on kerosene at Sh3.47 and diesel at Sh2.28 per litre.
In all, it is estimated that the total amount taken from the marketers last month was Sh1.34 billion.
While Treasury refunded the oil marketers the Sh1.34 billion, there was an extra cost of Sh0.50 per litre of fuel, said to be the administrative cost of processing and disbursing the compensation to the oil firms.
The amount was to be passed to the consumer and recovered over the May-June pricing cycle.
The fee was due to four companies that imported fuel under the Open Tender System (OTS), who were charged with disbursing the refunds from Treasury.
The marketers and the Petroleum ministry officials had at an April 15 meeting agreed that the Sh0.50 per litre was a prudent cost incurred in the delivery of petroleum products to Kenyans.
OTS is a Petroleum Ministry supervised system that pools the fuel needs of the oil firms and the marketers that bid to import at low prices get the job.

In air of fanfare and celebration reigned at Kenyatta International Convection Centre on Saturday evening when two renowned American music groups performed.
Enthusiastic audience sang along to timeless classics by American rhythm and blues maestros Blackstreet and SWV (Sisters With Voices).
The two groups gave a spectacular performance that evoked a sense of nostalgia for the 1990's music.
Performing for the very first time in Kenya the SWV trio of Coco, Lelee and Tamar set the mood with their popular song Weak in beautifully choreographed dance moves reminiscing the Kenyan disco scene of the 1990s.
Clad in baseball tops in green, blue and silver with golden sprinkles, the girlsdefied age with their dance moves.
One could easily mistake them for the youthful musicians such as Beyonce or Lady Gaga
The trio sat perched on high stools as they rendered yet another classic hit, Rain which could not have come at a better time when Nairobi experienced rain after a long dry spell.
Coco, the eldest of the three who has a grandchild poked fun at a couple who had earlier on proposed live on stage.
"I heard someone proposed here this evening. You are getting into a whole lot of trouble," she said.
The girls' serenading vocals were a reminder that all is not lost for soul music lovers.
The Valentines themed night got even better when Blackstreet came on stage to dish out red roses to ladies who attended the show.
That gesture fired up the show by quartet of Chauncey Black, Dave Hollister, Mark Middleton and Terrel Philips.
The four rocked the house with pure display of energy with amazingly original renditions of their hits including Don't Leave Me as the crowd sang and danced along.
Then they brought in Money Can't Buy Me Love that had an air of paradox given that the many couples dancing next to the stage had to part with a whooping Sh25,000 per ticket for the night.
Out of this Sh1,000 went to a famine relief fund.
Their depth, passion, and substance that made this group top the charts throughout the nineties were best manifested in their rendition of No Diggity.
But credit went to the youthful section of the crowd who seemed at ease with the songs and effortlessly sang along just like the older generation of soul music lovers.
It showed just how versatile and dynamic the so-called generation-X is that they will go for any good music, age notwithstanding.
By bringing the two American greats on the same night, KICC made the night worth every dime paid, including a five-course dinner by Sarova Hotels.
But the show started a slightly late, with SWV hitting the stage around 11.30pm.
The show was supposed to have started an hour and half earlier and with performances by Kenyan curtain-raisers.
Some members of SWV also seemed to be affected by the huge amounts of smokescreens on stage.
According to records, SWV that was formed in early 1990's by close friends of Coco, Lelee and Tamara and had sold 25 million copies of music by 2015.
"I met some fine men by the name of Sauti Sol and I wanna say I love them so much," announced Coco at the beginning of the show hinting at a possible future collaboration with Kenya's most sensational music group.
Blackstreet's Black said they were happy to perform in Kenya and that the show had rekindled their resolve to continue creating new music.
On her hospital bed at the Kenyatta National Hospital in January 2015, gospel artiste Peace Mulu nearly lost hope in life after breaking her legs in an accident.
Visits by her fans kept her desire to live.
Hit songs such as ‘Ombea Adui Yako’ catapulted her to national fame but despite the many years spent in the music industry, she had nothing much to show for it.
She was still not making enough money and her hospital bill had piled to Sh870,000.
Among her visitors at her hospital bed was a man who introduced himself as Bob from Liberty Afrika, who ‘offered’ to pay the bill.
“I declined but in March, he came to my house accompanied by a lady called Olive and said they had been sent by their boss to promote four of my songs in exchange for money,” she recalls.
“I had a bill of almost a million shillings in hospital and here was someone who had a cheque of Sh450,000 and was telling me he could pay me Sh150,000 per song only if I sign a piece of paper. I agreed without thinking twice,” she says.
Unknown to her, she had just signed off the rights and ownership of the songs to Liberty Afrika.
The company would, without informing her, upload them to Safaricom’s Skiza Tunes platform in what is shaping up to be one of the biggest disputes in the music industry.
Started 10 years before Ms Mulu’s accident in 2005, Skiza Tunes is a Caller Ring Back Tone (CRBT) owned by Safaricom that allows users to select a song that would entertain them as they wait for their call to be picked.
Users dial *811# to download the songs and it costs just 75 cents per tune per day which is renewed automatically at midnight.
On the face of it, this looks like little money for subscribers.
But with more than 10,000 songs for users to download and at least 5,000 artistes signed to the platform, this translates to millions of shillings.
In May last year, the company announced it had released Sh152 million to Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) and Premium Rate Service Providers (PRSPs) for payment to artistes whose music had been downloaded on the platforms since July 2015.
Safaricom usually pays on a monthly basis but the money had been accumulating for 10 months due to a court order.
To cushion itself from having to deal with each artiste whose content is made available for download, Safaricom outsourced content acquisition by signing Content Provision Agreements’ with PRSPs.
The PRSPs receive content from producers, code it and upload on the platform and in return, Safaricom pays the PRSPs whose role is to distribute the proceeds among content producers.
This decision made when Skiza Tunes presented a new revenue stream for artists in the early days of the local pop music industry ran on auto pilot for a while.
“I gave out my rights without knowing how much my music was worth. After all I was getting Sh50,000 every three months but now I believe I was defrauded,” says Lydia Joy Kairimu, the composer of the song ‘Mungu Najua Haujanisahau’.
Very few content owners were interested in knowing how much money was being made from their material as there was no data being provided about downloads.
Desperate to make money when music was still not paying very well, many artistes, including Elizabeth Nyambere, simply gave rights to their songs away in exchange for cash.
In 2011 when she was still a struggling artiste, she heard that she could make money from her songs through ring back tunes and the offer she was given by Liberty Afrika sounded like music to her ears.
“I was desperate. They told me they could promote my songs for one year and gave me Sh400,000,” she recalls.
A scrutiny of the contract by, however, shows she gave up rights for her songs for five years.
“The term of this agreement continues for a period of five years upon whose lapse it will be deemed to have been automatically renewed unless wither party issues a twelve months prior notice of intention not to renew the agreement upon the lapse of five years,” says the contract.
Joan Wairimu claims she gave out the rights of her songs without knowing their true worth and now wants them back.
“Even if you are a mad man do you want to say you can sell your song for just a million shillings when it is making millions in a month,” she asks. It is disputes like the one between Ms Nyambere and Liberty Afrika that would in time prove costly to Safaricom by exposing the company to legal disputes.
Safaricom’s maintains it is an infrastructure provider that enables rights owners and their licensees to avail their music to end users and would like the issue resolved.
“We would like to see all the parties involved in this dispute- the artistes, CMOs and CSPs- to seek clarity on the matter and settle on a payment structure amicable to all,” the mobile operator’s Chief Executive Bob Collymore told The Standard on Sunday.
He maintained the company is committed to work with all stakeholders so that everyone is satisfied.
“Our hope is that the progressive gains made so far for artists will lead to desired reforms and harmonisation of the industry for the benefit of all stakeholders,” he said.
But after learning from its mistakes due to the case, Safaricom in 2014 began meeting stakeholders in order to find a middle ground.
In August 2015, a new system was devised where three CMOs; Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK), Kenya Association of Music Producers (KAMP) and Performers Rights Organisation of Kenya (PRISK) would collect royalties on behalf of artistes instead of PRSKs, which had been accused of exploiting artists.
The idea was to ensure everyone who is involved in the production of content, including sound engineers, producers and composers, got a share of the cake.
The CMOs who were also legally mandated were to ensure that everyone who claims rights to a song was paid and also insulate Safaricom.
Soon after, PRSPs Liberty Afrika and Expedia Management rushed to the Constitutional Court arguing that the authorisation of CMOs to collect money on behalf of artists was unconstitutional.
Justice Mumbi Ngugi in a ruling delivered on May 4 ruled that, “There was nothing in the law that stops the CMOs from collecting and paying all artists including non-members.”
She also ordered MCSK to make available to all artists logs showing how much their music had earned.
However, even before the ink had dried on her ruling, two artists Mercy Munee and Lydia Nyiva filed a case at the Malindi High Court saying they were not members of any CMO and were not intending to join one.
In November 11, Justice Said Chitembwe nullified Section 30A of the Copyright Act which authorises CMOs to collect payments on behalf of owners of copyrights in the nature of performing and producing rights, contradicting Justice Ngugi’s orders and forcing Safaricom back to paying artists through PRSP’s.
Nevertheless, data obtained by The Standard on Sunday on how the distribution of the money made from the Skiza Tunes platform is done in shocking.
Artists, who are the composers and rightfully the owners of the content receive the least.
For instance in three months between March to May of last year, Liberty Afrika, a PRSP which Ms Kamuri is signed to, received Sh1,724,355.39 from Safaricom which it was to share with her after deducting its own fees.
Then from July 2015 to February 2016, Sh4,561,756.06 was paid out to Liberty Africa while only Sh13,473 went directly to her bank account. She is angry. “There is completely no transparency. We are living in shanties in Kangemi while people are eating on our money pretending they are assisting us sell our music,” says Ms Kamuri.
The data indicates that what went to Ms Kamuri’s bank account after all the deductions was just Sh28,831.48.
Such exasperation would boil over on April 16 last year when MCSK led artistes in a peaceful demonstration demanding they get paid all the monies owed to them.
Meanwhile after the order by the court which prompted MCSK to release logs showing how much money artists were making from downloads of their content, 14 musicians filed a case against the society, saying it had has refused to release their dues.
Through lawyer Gikunda Miriti, the musicians claim Safaricom had paid them their monies but MCSK was withholding holding it.
Expedia Management Limited has declined to respond to our questions on the matter but Charles Mwalimu, a lawyer, says the artists failed to exercise due diligence when they entered into the contracts.
Also enjoined in the case was Expedia, which court papers said had changed its name from Liberty Africa limited.
“There is a general lack of disseminating information to artists when they sign any deal and because most of them are broke, when they get their first offer they rush into signing,” he says.
“Most contracts are designed by lawyers and it would be prudent if you discuss any deal you get with a lawyer before putting pen to paper,” he says.
And although The Standard on Sunday is not at liberty to comment on the matter since it is still in court, we have established that Expedia has been dangling money to the artists by asking them to withdraw from any disputes they have with the company.
“I wish to state that I have no dispute with both Liberty Afrika and Expedia Management and would like my name to be removed from the case,” says one of the affidavits which we have seen.
One of those approached is Mulu and Mary Wanjiru, who is popularly known as ‘Shiro Wa GP.’
“Four months ago, they called me telling me to meet them since they had realised I have a new song but I told them I was selling it to Cellulant (another PRSP),” says Shiro wa GP.
“I agreed to meet them but when we met, they brought along a document for me to sign claiming it was a contract. I didn’t sign it,” she says.
For Mulu, she was issued a cheque of Sh371,903 on January 11 on condition that she signs the affidavit.
But as the push and pull over the amount of money artists are making on what was supposed to be an alternative revenue stream continues, a majority have been left to be millionaires on paper but paupers in reality.
It is evident that many more may not even be knowing whether their music is on the platform or if they are making money at all.
Henry Waweru, who claims his songs have made Sh1.5 million in the last three months, wants the ring back tunes withdrawn altogether.
“I am just a millionaire on paper,” he says. “You know even if an artist becomes broke, he can’t go to work at a construction site or sell maize because he has a name.
There was even a day I was asking God why he gave me this talent because people who sell maize on the road are making more money,” he says.
Jacob Boniface Maina (JB Maina), a Kikuyu secular singer received Sh15.5 million as compensation in an out of court settlement in 2014 from Safaricom after he won a case he had filed claiming his songs were being sold on the Skiza platform without his knowledge.
Back in the 90s when you were interested in a girl and wanted to put your best foot forward, one of the classical lyrics to drop was “I’m So Into You” or better still “You’re the One.”
Or if a girl wants to dump you and you’re still into her, “Before I Let You Go” was spot on.
The lyrical geniuses behind these all-time favourite R&B songs are American trio — Sisters With Voices popularly known as SWV and boy band Blackstreet Boys.
To crown this month of love, the stars are in Kenya for a much-hyped post Valentine’s gig.
The group came last night, and will headline the event dubbed Valentines Throwback Concert at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi tonight.
The two world-renowned groups landed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at around 9.30pm on Thursday.
Clearly exhausted from the long flight, the team posed for a few photos with fans before they were whisked away and driven to their hotel.
The event has been organised by KICC as a Valentine’s treat for Kenyan fans.
Entry fee at the gate is Sh5,000 while VIP tickets go for Sh15,000.
Even though millenials may not connect with these stars, back in the 90s, the likes of SWV and Blackstreet Boys were one of the all time favourite R&B stars.
Blackstreet Boys known for the “No Diggitty” hit was founded in 1991 by Teddy Riley (formerly of Guy – a American hip hop group) and Chauncey Hannibal also known as C.
Black. After the disbandment of Guy in 1991, Riley came up with the idea to start a new group featuring himself.
Originally, the group was to be named Stonestreet, but it was combined with Chauncey’s nickname, Black.
When the group settled on the name Blackstreet, it featured Teddy Riley, Chauncey Hannibal, Levi Little and Joseph Stonestreet.
SWV on the other hand, a two-time Grammy Award–nominated vocal trio, was formed in 1990 by Cheryl “Coko” Gamble, Tamara “Taj” Johnson and Leanne “Lelee” Lyons as a gospel group.
Like all bands, it underwent other changes along the way.
With time, SWV grew to become one of the world’s most successful R&B groups of the 1990s.
The trio released their debut studio album titled ‘It’s About Time’ on October 27, 1992.
Some of their favourite hits include ‘Weak’, ‘Right Here/Human Nature,’ ‘I’m So into You’ and ‘You’re the One.’
The group disbanded in 1998 to pursue solo projects but reunited in 2005. As of 2015, the trio had sold more than 25 million records, making them one of the world’s best-selling girl groups of all time.
SWV’s first single, ‘Right Here,’ was released in mid-1992, hitting number 13 on the R&B charts.
It was certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.
South African artist Percy Maimela stumbled upon his talent by chance, when some salt crystals spilled on the floor of the shop where he worked and as he tried to collect them he realized they formed shapes that he now turns into portraits.
His latest inspiration is former U.S. President Barack Obama.
"You can just take small stones and make something that no one ever thought of," he told Reuters in the capital Pretoria.
"Even salt companies, they wouldn't say salt is just for food anymore," he said, crouching over his portrait of Obama on his dining room floor.
The 31-year-old applies glue to cloth and then sprinkles table salt to sketch the portrait. Some of the famous faces he has drawn include global icon Nelson Mandela. Often, he'll chance his luck with passers by.
"I'll just carry just a black cloth and a bag of salt, then you can just come and give me 300 rand ($23) and then I'll just sketch your face, quick," he said. "And for you it's a memory and you'll never get that anywhere else."
Maimela - who quit his job at a retail store last year to pursue his craft - said he has loved art since he was a child but could never afford professional training.
Getting started on a commissioned piece of work requires a tiny investment of less than 50 US cents for salt and a little extra for glue.
He said he can sell a piece for about $30.
Maimela, who also works in pencil, has not been able to get any of his work shown in galleries and relies on the Internet to generate interest in his work.
"Being an artist in total is not easy, because not everyone understand art and then not everyone is willing to buy art. But everyone is willing to buy something that's provoking to their feelings," Maimela said.
Renowned South African novelist and apartheid critic Peter Abrahams is dead.
Abrahams, whose novel, Mine Boy, was a set book in Kenya in the late 90s, was found lying in a pool of blood in his house in Jamaica Thursday.
Jamaican police sources said initial investigations indicated the journalist and radio commentator may have fallen off his wheelchair but the large pool of blood found at the scene of his death triggered a foul-play theory.
He was 97.
Last year, his house was broken into four times, necessitating installation of an alarm, police said.
Abrahams was among the first African writers to gain international acclaim, alongside fellow anti-apartheid writers such as Alex La Guma.
In Mine Boy, he writes about the harsh treatment of mine workers and race relations in Apartheid South Africa, matter that simmers in the country's politics to date.
Abrahams's personal encounter with racism is best captured by the fact that his mixed-race wife, with whom he had three children, regretted marrying a black man.
Born Peter Henry Abrahams Deras on March 3, 1919 in Johannesburg to an Ethiopian father and a coloured mother, Abrahams left South Africa in 1939 after he was charged with treason.
He settled in Britain, where he worked as a journalist, writing for The Daily Worker, The Observer in England, and the The New York Herald Tribune in the US.
In London he met Pan-Africanists such as Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame Nkurumah.
From London he was exiled in Jamaica, where he has lived till his death.
"I visited Peter Abrahams in his house in Jamaica. He had just reclaimed rights for his Mine Boy and A Wreath for Udomo from the African Writers Series and I took them up," East African Educational Publishers Chairman, Dr Henry Chakava told The Standard.
His other works include Dark Testament, Song of the City, The Path of Thunder, Wild Conquest, Return to Goli, Tell Freedom, A Night of Their Own, The Island is Now and The View From Koyaba.
Djibouti port poses a great challenge to the success of newly commissioned port because of its close proximity to Ethiopia.
Yesterday, East African Community and Regional Development Cabinet Secretary Adan Mohammed said a team of experts has been assembled to market Lamu in Ethiopia.
He said the State was also keen to have a different body other than Kenya Ports Authority to run the port amid reports that global terminal operators were keen to run the facility.
“The team will aggressively market Lamu in Ethiopia. We are keen to get the Southern Ethiopian market. We know the threat posed by Djibouti,” said Adan.
Reports indicate that the Government was also open to allow major global powers to establish military bases in Lamu just like the case in Djibouti.
"It is about 900 kilometers from Djibouti Port to Addis Ababa compared to 1,279 kilometers from Lamu Port," said Adan, adding that the government had also prioritised the construction of the roads.
Currently, the road from Lamu to Garsen is complete, Garsen-Hole-Garissa road is about 83 per cent complete and Garissa to Modogashe is also complete.
“Modogashe to Isiolo is yet to start but it will start soon but Isiolo to Moyale is complete,” said Adan, adding that Kenya and Ethiopia have already established a common border post at Moyale.
“We want to attract big ships (Panamax ships) to drop cargo in Lamu before small ships transport it to Mombasa, Dar, Salala and Somali ports. Very many shipping lines have shown interest to use Lamu,” he said.
This means that Kenya is focusing on the transshipment business putting it in direct competition with the ports of Djibouti and Durban in South Africa.
KPA has already offered generous promotional offers to the shipping lines and shippers keen to use Lamu Port.
In the new tariffs, stevedoring charges have been reduced by 40 per cent. Stevedoring is the loading or offloading of cargo from the ship.
Shore handling and wharfage services will also attract a 40 per cent discount.
Meanwhile, goods dropped at Lamu by big ships before they are transported to other small ports will enjoy a 30 per cent free storage period.
Domestic cargo will enjoy free storage for 15 days.
Between 16th and 18th, Sh3,250 ($30) will be charged for a 20ft container while a 40ft container will attract Sh6,495 ($60).
“We will offer even more generous tariffs to attract cargo,” said Adan, while addressing the press in Mombasa days after President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the first berth of the Lamu Port.
Kenya has declined an application by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to increase flights from Dubai to Nairobi, and vice versa.
In a move seen to protect the national carrier Kenya Airways, Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said the government had resolved to deny Emirates unrestricted flights from the two cities.
Currently, Emirates makes 14 trips per week from Dubai to Nairobi and vice versa. But combined; trips from all airlines hailing from the UAE, including Etihad and Qatar Airways, are 28 per week.
The CS who was appearing before a Senate committee explained that his decision was aimed at protecting national interests given that the current air services agreement between the two countries was “one-sided and favoured Emirates”.
“The request by Emirates for us to allow them more frequencies will not be allowed. As long as I am the CS I will not allow it. The aviation business between Dubai and Nairobi is one sided and favours Emirates,” stated Macharia when he appeared before the Senate Roads and Transport committee.
The Senator Kimani Wamatangi-led committee was probing the alleged breach of an air services deal signed in 2002 and trade imbalance between Kenya and UAE following a statement sought by Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni).
Macharia explained that the seating capacity of Emirates, Etihad and Qatar was 15,400 against Kenya Airways’ 5,510.
Secondly, he said, the number of passengers had gone down since Covid-19 set in, translating to reduced income for Kenya.
“The three airlines benefit from subsidies but we do not. This means they are able to subsidise their seat fares which we cannot do to match them. They can almost fly for nothing because they are heavily subsidised.
National Bank of Kenya (NBK) has reported Sh184 million in profit after tax for the first quarter ending March 31, 2021.
This was a 19 per cent growth compared to a similar period last year, driven by increased income from loan interest and foreign exchange trading, and lower loan loss provisions.
NBK Managing Director Paul Russo said the quarter was marked by pockets of slow recovery from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic following the gradual reopening of the economy after a period of subdued activity.
“Having received a boost in Tier 2 Capital from the KCB Group, we are now well-positioned to continue growing the business and supporting our customers to weather effects of the pandemic," he said in a statement.
"Further, the capital injection enhances our compliance with regulatory ratios.”
KCB Group injected $30 million (Sh3.2 billion) in additional debt capital to NBK in April to enhance the bank’s capital buffers.
During the quarter, net interest income grew by five per cent from the previous year to stand at Sh1.9 billion.
The bank said interest income grew by 11 per cent to Sh2.7 billion due to increased volumes of loans and advances as well as sustained recoveries.
There was also a 28 per cent growth in interest paid on increased customer deposits, from transactions on the revamped digital channels.
Total operating costs during the quarter remained relatively flat at Sh2.09 billion, compared to Sh2.11 billion over a similar period in 2020.
This was despite increased investments in enhanced cybersecurity measures and revamp of the core banking system.
“We remain optimistic about prospects for this year in our efforts to turnaround the bank and deliver value for our customers," Mr Russo said.
"As economic activity picks up, the bank’s enhanced capital position puts us in good stead to help our customers walk the path to recovery after the slowdown due to the pandemic."
On the balance sheet side, total assets grew by 14 per cent to Sh114 billion, majorly from net loans and advances, which were up 20 per cent to Sh58 billion.
This was also supported by increased customer deposits which grew by eight per cent to Sh99 billion due to increased flows among existing clients and new accounts in corporate and retail franchises of the bank.
Kenya is set to receive Sh80 billion (USD750 million) from World Bank and Sh43.8 billion (USD410 million) from International Monetary Fund (IMF) by end of June as it eyes debt repayment extension from its external lenders.
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) on Thursday said Kenya is keen on debt repayment extension from its external lenders to help stabilise the economy from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Speaking at a post-Monetary Policy Committee meeting CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge did not disclose the exact amount of money Kenya would save from such arrangement only saying that the savings from any such arrangement will depend on the duration of the extension.
“Yes, Kenya is keen on any debt repayment extension, such arrangement will free up resources to be channeled to other purposes in the direction of helping the economy recover,” he said.
The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) is helping poor countries concentrate their resources on fighting the pandemic and safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of millions of the most vulnerable people.
Since it took effect on May 1, 2020, the initiative has delivered about Sh544.7b ($5 billion) in relief to more than 40 eligible countries.
In January, a club of rich countries (Paris Club) agreed to Kenya’s request for debt relief which will see the country save will save Sh17.1 billion.
The informal group of official creditors agreed to offer Kenya debt relief following the country’s application under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which is run under the auspices of the G20, a group of 20 wealthy nations.
Noting that Kenya was eligible to benefit from the G20’s DSSI, the Paris Club agreed to freeze Kenya’s debt repayment from January to the end of June.
Some of the club’s members that participated in the DSSI include France, Germany, Canada, Denmark, South Korea, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Japan, and the United States.
Kenya will save the most amount of money from Italy, which it was supposed to repay Sh4.5 billion during the six months, followed by Japan at Sh4.4 billion.
The other member of the club that was supposed to get the third-highest payout from Kenya is France, which was to receive Sh3.9 billion from the country’s coffers. Germany was to get Sh1.82 billion and Belgium Sh1 billion.
In March this year, African governments rooted for the extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) until at least the end of 2021.
The move will free up an additional Sh871.6 billion ($8 billion) for recovery in 2021 and providing much-needed liquidity to respond to the Covid-19 crisis.
World Bank President David Malpass in April said extending the debt payment freeze through year-end would save even more money that countries could use to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support their economies, Malpass told reporters, but gave no specific estimate.
KCB has introduced a discounted financing facility to boost KCB MSME customers whose operations have been adversely affected by Covid-19.
Micro, small and medium enterprises experiencing disrupted cash flows will be able to access both secured and unsecured financing for acquisition of trading assets and working capital to support business activities and preserve jobs by strengthening their resilience in the long- run.
The facility has also been discounted to cushion the MSMEs from the negative effects of Covid-19.
We are working hard to impel economic recovery with a focus on business enterprises.
"This facility will enable these MSMEs to restart and rebuild as the pandemic-related restrictions continue to be lifted and recovery persists,” Said Annastacia Kimtai, Director Retail, KCB Bank Kenya.
These business enterprises are the lifeblood of our economy; we are going the extra mile to ensure they are adequately financed to weather these testing times and contribute to economic recovery and growth.
The beneficiaries will receive financing solutions ranging between Sh100,000 to Sh5 million and payable within 36 months.
The business must be a KCB bank account holder and must have been in existence for at least six months.
MSMEs who take up the facility will also receive non-financial services in terms of advisory provisions and training sessions on how to navigate through the prevailing market disruptions.
We recognize the potential MSMEs have on the economic growth in Kenya and that is why the Bank takes a keen interest to support the sector.
"We have been working with the county governments to provide facilities to enterprises and cooperative societies whose businesses have been affected by the slowdown in business operations.” Annastacia noted.
“So far we have partnered with Laikipia and Kiambu County governments.” She said.
In October 2020, KCB also received approval for US$150 million, from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as a lead syndicator, to support the growth of the Bank’s sustainable climate finance portfolio and scale-up lending to micro, small and medium enterprises including women-owned businesses.
The credit line has been contributing to the economic growth of the Kenyan economy by helping develop green lending and creating employment, especially for women-owned businesses.
KCB also has a wide range of SME loan products which include long term and short-term SME loans, temporary and permanent overdraft facilities, learning institutions loans, and dealer & Mpesa loans.
KCB also extends Asset-based finance facilities and Insurance Premium Financing.
Interested parties should walk into any KCB branch and will be assisted by any KCB Relationship manager throughout the application process.
or the first time in almost two decades, World Rally Championship (WRC) is coming back to Kenya in June bringing fortunes to the country, especially the hospitality sector.
Kenya will be the only country in Africa to host one of the 12-events circuit of WRC 2021 taking place across the globe between January and November, with Kenya hosting the sixth event.
The event governed and organised by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) will take place in Naivasha between June 24 and June 27.
WRC Safari Rally Chief Executive Officer Phineas Kimathi met with Governor Lee Kinyanjui and deliberated on the ongoing preparations.
“This sporting activity with over 5,000 guests will pump over Sh6 billion in our economy. This injection will trickle down to the lowest of businesses in the area around where the event will take place,” said Kimathi.
Kimathi who also chairs the Kenya Motor Sports Federation (KMSF) said the preparations were on top gear lauding President Uhuru Kenyatta for engaging FIA to bring back the world event to Kenya.
“Only two countries outside Europe, Kenya and Japan, are hosting the event. We are glad the President took the initiative of pushing to have the event come back to Kenya after nineteen years,” said Kimathi.
Governor Kinyanjui described the event as a shot in the arm for the hospitality industry which has been on its knees since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country last year.
“This will be a big win for our hotels most of which are nearly fully booked for the days during which the event will take place,” said Kinyanjui.
The governor added that the event will rekindle the fun Kenyans were treated with during the Easter holidays every year up to 2002 when the last event was held in the country.
“We expect it to be fun and involving as we witness this global event again. Our young children only hear of the great memories we had and they now have an opportunity to experience it,” he said.
He urged tours and travel companies to capitalise on the event and come up with packages that will encourage the visitors to tour various tourist attraction sites in the county.
“Nakuru is one of the most scenic counties. The area selected has Eburru Mountains, conservancies, lakes and parks with excellent hospitality facilities. Stakeholders in the sector should not let go of this opportunity,” said Kinyanjui, adding that all precautions had been put in place to curb spread of Covid-19.
Monaco hosted the first event in January followed by Finland in February, Croatia in April and Portugal in May.
Italy will host the event early next month.
The event will later proceed to Estonia, Belgium, Greece, Finland, Spain and end in Japan on November 14.
Flimsy shacks of tin and ply have given way to sleek, painted houses - small, clean and leak-free - in Bangkok’s biggest slum, creating model homes and a blueprint for city development.
That is if community leader Surawat Krabsomboon and other residents can defeat plans to bulldoze much of Klong Toey slum and make way for the sort of gentrification transforming the Thai capital.
“We were living in broken houses and were unable to afford to repair the houses,” Mr Krabsomboon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from his home in the city’s oldest slum.
“But we did not want to live like that, we wanted better homes, better amenities,” said the 29-year-old Thai, making the case for thousands more micro homes to replace the dilapidation that has mushroomed without design over decades.
“These houses have allowed us to remain here, and relieved the burden of residents when they had to stay home during the lockdown and could not go out.”
Klong Toey’s slum, an area of about one square mile in the heart of the city, is home to nearly 100,000 people, mostly rural migrants from northern Thailand, many of whom came to the city decades ago for jobs at the nearby Bangkok port.
They stayed on even as those jobs dried up and the area around them boomed with plush malls and high-rise blocks.
Krabsomboon had tried many times to fix their housing - the shacks are like saunas in summer and leak rain in the monsoon.
Now, with help from a charitable foundation and a top Bangkok architect, dozens of residents have new homes where their tired shacks once leaned - with sturdy steel frames, insulated roofs and fire-resistant floors of fibre cement board.
The micro homes, funded by the Charoen Pokphand Foundation, have helped residents brave the pandemic, and could be a model for the larger planned redevelopment of the slum, said Surawat.
But the Port Authority of Thailand, which owns much of the land on which residents built their shacks illegally, wants to clear the slum to make way for office and commercial blocks, tourist spots and a modern transport and logistics hub.
About 12,000 households must relocate - either to a new high-rise complex nearby, to plots about 30 kilometres away, or take a cash compensation and move elsewhere, authorities say.
The plan is opposed by residents who say their lives and livelihoods will be affected, and that the small flats on offer will not suit large families, or people with shops or chickens that roam the narrow alleyways.
Most residents work in construction, as street vendors and as motorbike taxi riders ferrying people around the city of about eight million, and say they need to stay local to earn.
“Development is needed, better homes and living conditions are needed, but they must first listen to the community and their needs,” said Prateep Ungsongtham, founder of the Duang Prateep Foundation that runs a charitable school in Klong Toey.
“If the redevelopment happens without that, then this community will disappear and this will become just like any other expensive neighbourhood in Bangkok with no place for the poor people who serve the city,” she said.
Across Bangkok, informal settlements have been torn down and vendors removed from streets in a push to beautify the city and create parks and walkways for tourists and wealthier residents.
Prateep and other campaigners have opposed the city’s policy of resettlement, which they say separates the poor from their social networks and limits their ability to make a living.
In Klong Toey, where residents have resisted previous eviction attempts, many homes lack running water and sit cheek by jowl with open drains and trash heaps in alleys that are too narrow for garbage trucks.
While the neighbourhood was relatively untouched by the coronavirus pandemic last year, a recent surge across the country has seen hundreds get sick in Klong Toey.
The school of the built environment is composed of physical planners, architects, quantity surveyors, construction managers, engineers, interior designers and valuers.
All these professionals are trained to perform certain tasks at different levels and their roles are well-differentiated though expected to work together to provide a beautiful output.
For instance, a comprehensive development requiring a master plan should be such that a physical planner becomes the lead of a project team during preparation of the plan for purposes of organising and activating land uses on site.
This includes issuing the land use guidelines and regulations required in using the space efficiently and effectively together with the building standards to be adopted in the project process till completion.
The architect should then take the prepared master plan and, in consultation with the planner, develop appropriate building and landscape designs that befit the land use distribution as anticipated by the master plan.
At the stage where the master plan is finalised and approved for implementation, the titling or ownership procedures for the development is preconceived, which becomes another process led by planners, land surveyors and the lawyers.
The preparation of building designs goes hand in hand with the structural engineering and infrastructure designs prepared by the project engineers.
The quantity surveyor then comes in to value and cost the building designs under the bill of quantities.
When all is set for construction and implementation of the project, the architect, project engineers and land surveyors set out the ground for actual construction works.
During construction, the focal point day-by-day professionals would ideally be the construction managers who have synthesised the prepared building designs while the architects take up the supervisory role while periodically consulting with the physical planner to check on consistencies with the master plan.
Once construction is complete, the interior designers are commissioned to develop designs to expected quality.
Finally, valuers pick up the project for marketing and management on behalf of developers.
The summarised method above details out a systematic approach to a project in which all professionals do what they are trained to do.
This is the three-letter word that is in vogue among rental property owners.
It certainly decides how soon your houses are occupied.
If a building is new, or has a newish look, then it is a key selling point.
“People want new houses. I do not know why,” says Urban Landlords and Tenants Association Secretary General Ephraim Murigo.
It seems that Nairobi residents no longer get wooed by utilities such as water round the clock, reliable electricity or type of house.
Even before the paint dries or the contractor collects his tools, it is not a surprise to find the house already occupied.
And almost every advert of a property for sale or rent will scream ‘new’, which means it is a factor that always works in the business.
“Brand new beautiful bedsitters now letting in Lower Kabete,” reads an ad by one of the realtors in the city, where the units are renting at Sh13,500 per month.
While Mr Murigo lists security, availability of water and modern finishing as some of the reasons that attract a tenant to a new apartment or flat, he admits that it is a phenomenon that is yet to be clearly understood.
He says it has become a trend that if a house is done today, in just two weeks, it is already fully booked.
Sometimes the houses are booked even before they are completed.
“Why? Because they believe that the person doing the finishing will be mindful of how properly the house will be finished,” he says. “In my view, that is why people like new flats.”
This is what also attracts Robert Otieno whenever he is hunting for a house.
The Umoja resident says while old townhouses or flats may have the basic amenities such as water and power, new apartments have new designs.
“Some of these old houses do not have master bedroom ensuite, for example,” he says.
Samuel Tiriongo, director of research and policy at Kenya Bankers Association, which does quarterly reports on real estate, agrees.
“An apartment block that was built many years ago did not factor in things like open kitchen or space…nowadays we see apartments with detached servant quarters,” he says.
He says the additions make the houses attractive.
It is also the reason behind the government’s housing agenda that has seen some of the old houses being marked for demolition so that modern apartment blocks are put up.
Buxton Estate in Mombasa County and Old Ngara Estate in Nairobi are some that will be replaced in an extensive urban renewal project in the two counties.
Another trend, says Dr Tiriongo, is that there is an upward surge for new apartments in high-end areas such as Kileleshwa where high-rise buildings were not common.
He, however, says there is a limit on what makes the apartment attractive.
“If you beyond four storeys, you will see lesser demand,” he says.
People want to live together but if it goes beyond a certain limit in terms of numbers (of occupants), you start to lose that interest.
The government has been cracking its head over the years to find a solution to the housing deficit, currently estimated at two million units by UN-Habitat.
It’s against this backdrop that housing sits at the core of the Big Four Agenda under which the State plans to deliver 500,000 units by next year through the affordable housing programme that covers major urban areas across the country.
This will entail the use of affordable and environment-friendly building materials and efficient construction technologies.
Naftali Nyabuto, a technology expert and chief executive of M-Zawadi, argues that Kenyans should not sit back waiting for the government to deliver the affordable housing dream but embrace what technology offers.
He says technology such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the future of owning homes as it breaks the cost barrier on construction.
“The solution to the housing problem should not be left to the government alone, modern technologies such as AI and blockchain offer practical alternatives to the crisis by aiding individuals easily build dream homes through installments,” he says.
Through a pool of software developers, Mr Nyabuto has come up with software known as Nyumba Mkononi, which links aspiring homeowners to the whole construction value chain.
The network includes companies dealing with cement, roofing and steel, tile and interior, blocks, ballast and sand providers, contractors, architects, labourers and installers.
Using advanced AI, Nyumba Mkononi can approximate the number of materials needed to build a particular house and give a purchase plan right from a mobile phone.
The concept uses blockchain technology and what Nyabuto calls „distributed databases” to create visibility, tracing and a secure system that brings together partners across the construction market.
“We have created an ecosystem of interdependence and we are at the centre of it using next-generation technologies,” he says.
“We believe that starting to construct a house on your phone by purchasing materials in most affordable units, regular reminders on targets not only activates your creative subconscious which will start generating creative ideas to achieve your goal but also programmes your brain to more readily perceive and recognise the resources you will need to achieve your dreams,” says Nyabuto.
A task force on blockchain formed by the government in 2019 said in its report that the new technology has the potential to deliver affordable housing under the Big Four Agenda.
“Previous attempts to provide affordable housing failed when the rich, through corruption, denied poor people access to the allocations of new housing,” said the task force led by Bitange Ndemo.
“This will not happen in future since the State Department of Housing has committed to using blockchain for allocation and financial management of affordable housing.”
“Blockchain in combination with AI will lower transaction costs through smart contracts,” it added.
According to a 2015 World Economic Forum survey of 800 executives and information and communications technology sector experts, 57.9 per cent of the respondents believe that 10 per cent of the global GDP information will be stored on blockchain technology by 2025.
“Until recently, blockchain was known more as the technology powering Bitcoin,” says Deloitte in a report on blockchain in commercial real estate.
“The industry players now realise that blockchain-based smart contracts can play a much larger role in commercial real estate (CRE), potentially transforming core CRE operations such as property transactions (purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management).”
What will happen to Nairobi, the place of cool waters, when every blade of grass is replaced by concrete?
Will we have a New York-esque skyline to marvel at or have a jungle where sanitation is poorer, crime higher, cost of living at stratospheric highs and air pollution threatening life?
In 2009, the city had a population of 3.14 million.
But by 2019 when Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) went out for the census, the population had soared to 4.4 million.
More than 1.26 million people had come into the city through migration, mainly from the countryside, or by birth. But households told an even more interesting story.
In 2009 there were 985,016 households - defined by KNBS as a person or group of persons who reside in the same homestead or compound, but not necessarily in the same dwelling unit, have same cooking arrangements, and are answerable to one household head.
By 2019, there were 1.507 million households in the city.
That was an increase of more than half a million in just 10 years. More households increase the need for houses, both commercial and residential.
Planners will have a lot to do, with Nairobi now attracting more expatriates to add to the swelling numbers of locals coming into the capital.
The World Population Review says Nairobi’s 2021 population is estimated at 4,922,192.
“In 1950, the population of Nairobi was 137,456. Nairobi has grown tremendously since 2015, at a 3.96 per cent annual change,” it says.
“These population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanisation Prospects and represent the urban agglomeration of Nairobi, which typically includes Nairobi’s population in addition to adjacent suburban areas.”
It is expected that the population will be at 8.5 million by 2035, almost twice the current population.
These are results of extrapolations, it is anyone’s guess how many households there will be, and how many more buildings the city will have to hold.
“The current government’s aggressive infrastructure upgrade will position Nairobi as a preferred investment destination, which will lead to increased urban migration into the city,” says Rhino Mabati Chief Executive Andrew Muriungi.
“As the mega infrastructure upgrades continue, the County Government of Nairobi needs to come up with an elaborate sustainable land use plan to ensure developments factor in green zoning similar to what you would find in Singapore and Dubai.”
A World Bank publication, Africa’s Cities: Opening Doors to the World says the continent’s cities are not economically dense or efficient. They are crowded and unlivable. “Most urban residents are packed into low-rise, informal settlements without adequate infrastructure or access to basic services,” the report says.
“In Nairobi, the current patterns of informal land use in centrally located settlements impose an economic loss of over $1.8 billion (Sh194 billion),” it adds, noting that people are clustering in downtown locations.
Mizizi Homes Chief Executive George Mburu says the solution lies in proper planning.
“What I can ask of the government is to set aside some areas to plant trees, like we have Karura Forest, and developers and people contracting to leave room for green areas and tree planting to avoid degradation of the environment,” he says.
As much as there is need for more houses, he believes there should be proper planning to avoid mushrooming of shanties. The population increase points to this likelihood in the very near future, if not well managed.
Parts of Nairobi’s Eastlands are densely populated, and empty into the downtown CBD, which is equally overcrowded.
“These patterns reflect broader dysfunctionalities in land markets as well as limited investments in transport infrastructure, limiting the choices that people can make on where to live and how to access jobs,” say the World Bank report.
Mr Muriungi says the population growth might be slowed by the attractiveness of county towns following devolution.
“We have seen a shift in city to county migration due to devolution that has created job opportunities within counties where land is affordable and easily available,” he says.
Manufacturing can move people from Nairobi, which is slowly ceding power as the centre of production.
“It’s also key to know markets are bottoming out. Economic habits are shifting to on-the-go economy,” says Muriungi.
Manufacturing, which creates a significant number of jobs and located mostly in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, has been disrupted by smaller players.
Smaller manufacturing plants in the counties mean that you can make your own animal feeds in your county and beat large-scale manufacturers because of transport and knowledge of the local market.
With this shift expected to continue we are likely to see the push for housing moving to the counties to support housing for factory workers, for industrial buildings and other supporting services such as IT and training and material supply,” Muriungi says.
In the future, as population rises, it is almost inevitable there will be a lot of constructions in the city even with migration into counties, but we might not get a New York.
First off, the World Bank report indicates that Kenya’s buildings are not as valuable as buildings in America.
“The value of urban building stocks is much lower in Africa than in Central America. The value per square kilometre in the four African cities studied ranges between $2.7 million (in Kigali) and $15.6 million (in Nairobi),” read the Africa Cities report.
The government sometimes decides to acquire private land without necessarily asking the owners if they are willing to give it up.
This is called compulsory acquisition.
If the government wants to build a roadway that passes through your parcel of land, they will seize the land and compensate you.
The same will happen if there is a mineral deposit in your land. You will not cash in on those gold reserves, it all belongs to the State.
And if a public purpose facility is to come up, such as for defence, stadia, schools and hospitals, the government always gets its way.
It has been speculated that influential people buy parcels of land that the government wants to acquire, or property near such places, and await a windfall once the State comes calling.
In a series of government projects in 2020, which included the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) corridor project, the government parted with billions of shilling in compensating people who lost their land through compulsory acquisition.
For the SGR, it was estimated that the government would have paid more than Sh50 billion by the time disputes over compensation were resolved.
The compensation for the Mombasa-Nairobi section was estimated at Sh33 billion, equivalent to 10 per cent of the total project of Sh327 billion cost.
Other projects such as the Western Bypass and James Gichuru Junction-Rironi upgrade, which are nearing completion, have compensated landowners for hiving off their property.
The James Gichuru Junction-Rironi road passes through a densely populated section of Nairobi and Kiambu, and the compensation runs into millions of shillings.
“Some of the property owners were compensated for undeveloped open land but many other got extra for the property having residential houses, commercial developments, and even trees,” explained Stephen Njuguna, a land agent in Kikuyu.
“For most of the area along the highway, the rate of compensation averaged Sh60 million per acre. The value of developments was calculated, then 15 per cent of the total added as disturbance cost.”
The actual landowners, who relinquish their parcels to the government, arguably enjoy less benefits compared to their neighbours who stay put because the value of the property rises.
Granted, compensation is not done on speculative estimates but the market value of the land at the time of issuance of notice of interest by the government.
When the State takes over land and develops it, the value of nearby property increases.
Chapter 295 of the Land Acquisition Act says of the compulsory acquisition: “The acquisition of the land is necessary in the interests of defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public health, town and country planning or the development or utilisation of any property in such manner as to promote the public benefit.”
Any of these developments raises the profile of an area, and thus the attractiveness to investors and new settlers.
Not even community land is immune to compulsory acquisition.
The National Land Commission (NLC) decides on the compensation to be made to a landowner when a piece of land is deemed perfect for public use.
“The NLC decides which valuers to use, often using their internal valuers or from the valuation department in the Ministry of Lands,” says Dr Mwenda Makathimo, a land expert and licensed valuer.
In rare cases, where the capacity in the NLC is not sufficient, they engage private valuers.
The NLC is expected to make regulations for just, fair and prompt compensation.
“People cannot be compensated below the market value,” notes Dr Makathimo. “The rules are gazetted.”
While one Latin maxim on land ownership and administration states that anything that is permanently attached to the land belongs to the land and thus to the owner of the land, in most countries, the mineral resources are controlled by the holder of the radical title, the government.
In the United States, mineral resources belong to the landowner.
Conservative Commonwealth states are among those in which natural resources, such as minerals, are exploited by the government for the public good.
“The reasoning is that the mineral occurs naturally and has the potential to benefit the public. It makes sense; if oil is to be drilled in someone’s piece of land, we have to realise that it could have cut across many people’s pieces of land enroute to that specific parcel, so why should the owner of the parcel benefit alone?” says Makathimo.
No parcel can survive without the collective, and so a naturally occurring resource benefits a whole community.
If the government acquires land for mining, the owner will most likely get less than the value of the mineral because the land will be billed at the market value.
Where land is acquired compulsorily, the Act says, full and fair compensation shall be paid promptly to all persons interested in the land.
“The commissioner shall appoint a date, not earlier than 30 days and not later than 12 months after the publication of the notice of intention to acquire, for the holding of an inquiry for the hearing of claims to compensation by persons interested in the land, and shall cause notice of the inquiry to be published in the Gazette at least fifteen days before the inquiry; and serve a copy of the notice on every person who appears to him to be interested or who claims to be interested in the land,” reads the Act.
The scramble for land around areas that are being compulsorily acquired by the government is probably one of the most ingenious moves by speculators.
They wish to benefit indirectly, land prices rising because neighbouring land has changed hands and the government is developing it or starting businesses as settlements increase.
Land prices shoot up around areas where roads are coming up, for example, as the opening up of hinterlands raises the profile of property with investors circling.
Businesses sprout, and the economic viability of some previously moribund land increases.
The same happens in the case of a mine. As workers come into work, the price of land in the surrounding areas rises.
The secret to one selling land at prime prices may just lie in the government’s decision to take over nearby land through compulsory acquisition.
The government, and your neighbour, might be the difference between you owning land worth a few million, or hundreds of millions.
Makathimo says compensation is done with the legally approved land use.
If the land is supposed to be agricultural and the owner has made it commercial, they shall not be compensated for the commercial use.
“Disturbance is accounted for, capped at about 15 per cent of the market value. Owners are also compensated for the loss of income and profit,” he says.
Valuation could be done for a full parcel of land even when not all of it is taken up - a severance effect is taken into account and what is lost compensated
for. In such cases, the reduction of productivity of the remaining parcel of land is what gets compensated.
Also, the injurious effect is compensated, such as when a house is cut into half. One is compensated for the development they made on the land and the rights they would have exercised on it.
“Compulsory acquisition is inherently disruptive. Even when compensation is generous and procedures are generally fair and efficient, the displacement of people from established homes, businesses and communities will still entail significant human costs,” says the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.
“Where the process is designed or implemented poorly, the economic, social and political costs may be enormous. Attention to the procedures of compulsory acquisition is critical if a government’s exercise of compulsory acquisition is to be efficient, fair, and legitimate.”
After the award (compensation) has been made, the Commissioner of Land takes possession of the land by serving a notice to every person interested in the land that possession of the land and the title to the land will vest in the government.
The government, however, is keen not to pay an ‘exaggerated’ amount for land that has only been improved because the owners anticipated the acquisition.
If the land was used for illegal activity, its value takes a hit.
“In assessing the market value, the effect of any express or implied condition of title or law which restricts the use to which the land concerned may be put shall be taken into account,” the Land Acquisition Act says.
“If the market value of land has been increased, or is currently increased the increase shall be disregarded: an increase because of an improvement made by the owner or his predecessor in the title within two years before the date of publication in the Gazette of the notice of intention to acquire the land unless it is proved that the improvement was made bona fide and not in contemplation of proceedings for the acquisition of the land.”
Valuers will calculate the sales of comparable parcels in a neighborhood and can estimate the value of a parcel of land.
NLC says if the award is not accepted, or if there is a dispute about who is entitled to compensation, the amount of compensation is paid into a special compensation account held by the commission.
The value of your land might be at the mercy of your neighbour, and the government.
If that neighbour’s land is taken by the government because he struck gold, then you might just have struck gold yourself, and might sell for a much higher price.
Local construction firms continue to feel sidelined as major infrastructure projects are taken by foreign companies.
The firms have decried the stringent measures they have to follow before being awarded work while the same laws are not binding to foreign contractors.
Institute of Quantity Surveyors of Kenya (IQSK) President James Munene said during a media briefing in Nairobi on Tuesday that the impact of foreign contractors in the country should be assessed.
He said even though the foreign firms have delivered on their construction timelines, local companies have been left on the periphery due to the uneven ground.
“We are calling on the Government to strongly consider putting in place measures to ensure that in as much as we are allowing foreign players to practice in the local scene, we are doing so in a manner that benefits the local construction industry and local practitioners as well,” Mr Munene said.
According to the National Construction Authority (NCA) 2014 regulations, certain work is exclusively reserved for local contractors as opposed to open bidding, which attracts all interested bidders.
Foreign contractors, according to the law, are only eligible to register for a NCA-1 contract (a building contract above Sh500 million) whereas local contractors can register for all categories of contracts.
Foreign firms are also required to make applications to NCA before undertaking works classified under category 1.
Such applications are to be accompanied by an undertaking in writing that they would adhere to sub-contract 30 per cent of the project value to local persons or firms and transfer technical skills not available locally to construction firms adhering to NCA guidelines.
IQSK, however, says subcontracting has seen local firms being sidelined in major infrastructure projects that are ongoing.
It argues that the even though the regulations are clear, their implementations has been left at the discretion of foreign firms who often ignore them.
“What is required is sustainable projects to necessitate active involvement of local contractors,” Munene said.
“Such developments would solve most of the problems; for instance, there would be reduced capital outflows, and local firms would be forced to improve their capacity.”
The argument by surveyors comes three years after a report commissioned by the Competition Authority of Kenya (CAK) showed that local construction firms are disadvantaged compared to foreign companies.
According to the report, most local firms constantly felt left out on bigger projects with foreign firms failing to sub-contract them, hence minimising the potential growth of local companies.
“The challenge with these regulations is that they are not binding on the part of the foreign firms. The foreign firms may win tenders individually and it is up to them to then seek a local partnering firm afterward,” said the report.
CAK also highlighted that even though the law was enacted to boost the capacity of local firms, they have nothing to show for it years after its passage.
“The local firms may not get their fair share of the agreement. Most local firms are assigned just segments of the project and hence may not really benefit from the skills transfer initiative,” said the report.
According to the 2020 Economic Survey, the construction sector registered a growth of 6.4 per cent in 2019 compared to growth of 6.9 per cent in 2018.
The number of people employed in private construction works increased from 1.6 million in 2018 to 1.7 million in 2019, the survey indicated.
However, the country saw a decline in cement consumption from 59.4 million tonnes in 2018 to 59.3 million in 2019, while loans advanced to the sector saw a jump from Sh1.4 billion in 2018 to Sh1.5 billion in 2019.
Similarly, labour cost recorded an increase of 4.5 per cent in 2019 compared to 5.3 per cent in 2018.
In 2018, the government spent Sh154.5 billion but it increased its expenditure on roads by 10 per cent, translating to Sh 169.9 billion in 2019.
Kenyan banks may be swimming out of the Covid-19 storm with most of them now recording a rise in net profits in the first quarter of 2021.
Equity Bank’s net profits rose by 64 per cent in the period between January and March at the back of increased income even as the listed lender controlled the growth of expenses.
The bank made a profit after tax of Sh8.7 billion in the period under review compared to Sh5.5 billion that it posted in the first quarter of 2020.
Equity outshone its closest rival KCB which made a profit after tax of Sh6.37, an increase of 1.7 per cent from Sh6.26 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
Equity Group Chief Executive Officer James Mwangi noted that the performance was largely due to the lender's prudence which saw them push a lot of their business to Treasury and non-funded income even as their provisioning costs went down.
As a result, Equity’s total income grew by 31 per cent to Sh25.5 billion compared to costs which increased by eight per cent.
“The sustainability of that profitability comes from the top line. The fact you could have topline growing at 31 per cent, 32 per cent, then shows sustainable profitability going forward,” said Mwangi in an interview with The Standard after the investor briefing.
He noted that the dynamism of the Kenyan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) markets - Equity’s first and second-largest markets, means that revenues continue growing exponentially as they can be deployed quickly.
Equity boss said the costs will continue to shrink as the bank unlocks the synergies in DRC and reduction in units cost is driven by the very rapid growth that DRC is experiencing.
Equity recently unveiled its newest subsidiary in DRC, BCDC Equity.
"The group adopted a prudent approach last year and decided to take the hit on using IFRS 9 computation of the lifetime risk of the book that was existing last year. And that why you don’t see any additional provisioning for the book that we adopted at the beginning of the year,” said Mwangi.
KCB Chief Executive Joshua Oigara said the growth in profitability was due to the cost-saving initiatives and increase in net interest income.
“The economic environment marginally improved in the quarter although uncertainties from the pandemic remain a big risk to the outlook,” said Oigara in a statement, adding that waiver of fees on mobile lending affected non-funded income which remained subdued.
KCB's group total income grew at a slower rate to Sh23 billion from Sh22.9 billion. Interest income increased to 21.9 billion from 20.2 billion in the period under review.
KCB’s total costs also remained flat from last year closing at Sh11.1 billion.
Compared to Equity whose ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans was at 11 per cent, KCB’s was at an elevated level of 14.8 per cent compared to 11.1 per cent last year.
NCBA Bank’s net profit also increased by 74 per cent to Sh2.8 billion compared to Sh1.6 in the first quarter of 2020, helped by massive growth in digital loans.
NCBA disbursed Sh134 billion during this period.
“We are immensely proud of our strong financial results during the first quarter, NCBA Group has demonstrated the ability to tightly balance strong credit discipline with its commitment to support its customers during this period,” said NCBA Group Managing Director John Gachora.
The livid operators claim there is an increased number of quack players who have invaded the sector and are eating into their revenue without following regulations.
The couriers link the growing appetite in the business to the rapid uptake of e-commerce services in the country and movement restrictions due to the effects of Covid-19, which have seen some passenger vehicles converted into cargo buses.
Some of the operators who talked to Shipping and Logistics said unlicensed players have tilted the business environment by offering below-market courier service rates, impacting negatively on the bottom line of genuine operators.
“We are witnessing an improvement in secure logistics business fuelled primarily by the aggressive uptake of e-commerce in the country. This is attracting more people in the industry,” averred Lawrence Okello, G4S Chief Executive Officer, Kenya.
“Our competitive edge remains a wider network spanning the whole country. This has enabled well-established courier entities to offer the last mile connection, which is on a higher demand by e-commerce clients.”
According to Okello, couriers mostly transport books, spare parts for telecom companies, pharmaceuticals and warehouse storage facilities.
Glovo General Manager Priscilla Muhiu said the rapid uptake of e-commerce in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu boosted couriers last year with the trend continuing in 2021.
“The most important e-commerce enablers are the ability to access financial services, digital payment channels and digital infrastructure. These enablers are starting to take hold across. Cash may remain the dominant payment instrument for now, but we are seeing signs that this will eventually change,” she said.
According to Omar Salim, a manager at Mash East Africa, the problem of unregulated operators and the effects of Covid-19 over the past year have proved a challenge to the courier industry.
However, he said traditional operators find a lifeline in their established networks both upcountry and across the region.
“The new development is hurting the industry, we are currently operating at half the capacity,” he said.
Halim Sadia, a senior clerk at the Coast Bus, said the expansive network built over a period of time and corporate clients have been a lifeline to the regulated courier providers.
After the restriction of movement, which grounded a number of vehicles, the passenger service vehicles (PSVs) that ferried passengers into and out of the city devised ways to remain afloat.
One of the creative ways was to turn their vehicles into cargo carriers.
But Communications Authority (CA) acting director-general Mercy Wanjau said such a venture was illegal.
“Some PSVs and e-commerce market platforms have taken advantage of the coronavirus to offer courier services without being licensed,” she said.
She added that any person who will be caught engaging in the service illegally will be charged in accordance with Section 49 of the authorities Act.
The Act slaps an offender with a Sh300,000 fine or an imprisonment term not exceeding one year.
CA warned that it will revoke courier licences of 21 service providers, locking out several bus companies.
The number of letters sent in 2019-20 financial year dropped to 32.2 million from 47.1 million recorded in the 2018-2019 financial year.
During the fourth Quarter of 2019/20, the volume of international incoming letters dropped by 35.2 per cent to 1.7 million from 2.6 million posted in the previous quarter.
Banks are slowly getting on track after a tough year in 2020 due to the adverse effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
During 2020, most banks recorded a drop in profit as the effects of the virus forced many of them to devise ways of cushioning customers including temporary suspension of loan repayment and slashing of transaction fees.
Equity Group, NCBA and KCB Group on Wednesday exuded confidence of a better future going by the results for the first quarter of 2021.
According to NCBA Group Managing Director John Gachora, “the results reflect strong underlying performance across all areas of our business and a slowly improving economy”.
NCBA reported a net profit of Sh2.84 billion in the first three months of this year, which is a 74 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.
“We are proud of our strong financial results during the first quarter, NCBA Group has demonstrated the ability to tightly balance strong credit discipline with its commitment to support its customers during this period,” said Gachora.
“We view 2021, as our transition year following the finalisation of the merger and consolidation of all entities, systems and processes of CBA Group and NIC Group across the region in 2020.”
NCBA’s net interest income recorded a 20 per cent increase year on year due to growth in interest income from treasury investments and a reduction in interest expense following the retirement of NCBA Group’s medium term note in the third quarter of 2020.
The overall effect was that, operating income in the period closed at Sh11.8 Billion representing 8 per cent growth against prior year performance.
Equity Group saw its profit after tax increase to Sh8.7 billion, a 64 per cent jump.
“We have returned strong quarter one results in a challenging environment amidst the multi-faceted Covid-19 crisis of health, economic disruption, and humanitarian challenges, giving hope of resilience and recovery,” said James Mwangi, Equity Group Chief Executive Officer.
During the multi-crisis year, Equity focused on social impact investment in health investing Sh1.7 billion in social response to society, forgoing Sh1.5 billion in waived mobile transaction fees, waiving Sh1.2 billion in loan rescheduling fees and accommodating Sh171 billon (or 31 per cent) of the loan book for up to 3 years of principal and interest repayment breaks to enable businesses to survive.
“We kept the lights of the economies we operate in on, supported businesses to repurpose, retool and recover by supporting livelihoods of our customers during the crisis”, said Mwangi.
Equity’s interest income grew by 32 per cent while non-funded income grew by 30 per cent to contribute 42 per cent of total income.
KCB Group recorded a net profit of Sh6.37 billion, a 1.7 per cent increase from Sh6.26 billion same period last year.
A young man from the US by the name Thornton Oxnand arrived at the Toyota corporate headquarters in Nagoya Japan some time in 1992.
Armed with an MBA and MA in Japan Studies, Oxnand was eager to put both to good use and was promptly assigned a month-long orientation in the Toyota factory assembly line.
Being a quick learner, he easily mastered the Toyota production system and emerged with basic knowledge of standardised work and lean manufacturing which prompted him to moved to another department as a supply analyst.
After a while Oxnand felt he was being underutilised and was keen to have his boss review and enrich his responsibilities.
“I know I am capable of more,” he thought to himself as he approached his boss to request for more work.
A month or two passed and the young American employee made another request to his boss for more work, but to no avail.
Finally, on his third attempt, the boss explained: “We exposed you to the principles of Toyota Production System. We gave you a small starting assignment. You must determine the rest. You must tell me what needs to be done, not the other way round. You must dig your own job.”
The message from Oxnand’s boss was simple: he had been given the foundation and the platform to build on and now it was up to determine how much value he would add to the organisation by finding real problems that he could use his skills and knowledge and experience to solve.
Rather than wait to be told what to do, today more than ever, organisations need employees who will dig their own jobs, who will innovate at their own initiative rather than sit around and wait to be told what to do.
As the push for cleaner energy intensifies, more and more companies around the globe are distancing themselves from funding unclean energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants.
The move comes at a time when coal, responsible for immense atmospheric pollution, is increasingly becoming unpopular even among Western countries, some of which industrialised using the energy source.
“We will no longer finance new coal-fired power plants except where there is an existing commitment anywhere in the world,” announced Standard Chartered Bank in September 2018.
“We have taken the decision after detailed consultation with a range of stakeholders. This announcement is part of our updated position statement on power generation. Here for good means saying no to coal.”
But despite the growing opposition to the development of new coal-fired power plants, Kenya has been pushing to add the energy source to its electricity generation mix, with the Sh200 billion Lamu coal power plant being its flagship project towards this end.
There are also plans for coal mining in the Mui Basin in Kitui County, which has been dogged by numerous delays due to the politicisation of the project.
Besides Stanchart Bank, other companies that have withdrawn funding for coal projects, including the Lamu coal project include China’s ICBC Bank, one of the largest in the world, which was to lend about half of the Sh200 billion required to build the Lamu coal plant that would produce 1,050 megawatts (MW) of power on completion.
