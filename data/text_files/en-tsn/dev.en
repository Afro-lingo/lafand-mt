Some 5,000 people will attend the sold-out concert for Spanish indie band Love of Lesbian, and will not be required to observe social distancing.
Attendees will have to wear face masks throughout the concert in the Palau Sant Jordi arena.
(This concert) is about the excitement of going out, consuming culture, and dancing in a more or less safe environment, said Sebastian, 47, a teacher getting tested ahead of the concert.
We’re going to dance and have a great time.
The pilot concert, which has been approved by health authorities, will serve as a test for whether similar events will be able to start up again.
It will be safer to be in the Palau Sant Jordi than walking down the street, concert co-organiser Jordi Herreruela told Reuters.
Pre-concert testing was offered at three locations in Barcelona, and carried out by 80 nurses wearing full personal protective equipment.
Some people winced as nurses swabbed their noses.
By midday, of the 2,400 people already screened, three had tested positive and one had come into contact with a positive case, Dr Josep Maria Libre, one of the doctors overseeing the testing, told Reuters.
They would not be able to attend the concert and would get a refund.
Attendees received the results of their antigen tests in 10 to 15 minutes via an app on their phones.
The test and a mask were included in the ticket price.
People have understood perfectly the measures were adopting, said co-organiser Dani Poveda.
It is a very responsible audience We know everyone will be looking at this concert as a possible model for how to keep advancing in the fight against the pandemic, which has caused so much damage, both to our sector and many others.
Surviving COVID-19 does not end with one being declared negative.
According to healthcare workers and those who survived this pandemic, it takes longer for some patients to recover from the psychological effects of the virus.
Some continue to experience mild symptoms, others get depressed, while stigma also makes it worse.
Discussion on the mental health impact of COVID-19:
While some are only talking about it, others have experienced it and the psychological impact is massive.
COVID-19 survivor Gadifele Lofu recounts her ordeal.
My name is Gadifele Rejoice Lofu.
I stay in Ventersdorp, in Tshing extension 4.
I have two children
I started falling ill on 12 December 2020 while at work.
On the 14th of December, I was admitted to ICU.
It was not nice because I didn’t understand anything; I was in pain and my situation was deteriorating.
My family could not visit me in hospital.
Its more painful that I lost some family members while in ICU.
Another survivor Tshediso Mashoaliba says the journey has been quite traumatic.
My name is Tshediso Moshoaliba.
I’m 33 years of age
Originally, I’m from Welkom in the Free State, but currently residing in Ventersdorp.
The journey is quite traumatic.
I can’t recall how I was placed on a ventilator.
At one stage, I thought I was in Welkom, at one stage, I thought I was in Klerksdorp.
The pain was quite severe, I could not even swallow properly.
So, the psychological impact is quite unbearable.
Even during my journey, currently, I experience depression, anxiety and the stigma that is also attached.
Affected frontline workers: Frontline staffers are not exempted.
Many get infected, the risks that come with the job.
Mediclinic Specialist and Physician, Dr Thabo Pilane, says the isolation period came with a lot of stress.
I have contracted COVID-19, and had to isolate for ten days at home.
During the isolation period, I had a lot of thoughts, stress, mental challenges, psychological stress about the diseases; worrying about whether one will make it.
The ten days feel like the whole year; every day is quite long.
I, for one, had my family members infected.
So, I infected my wife and kids at home.
Well, by the grace of God, they all survived.
We recovered all at home.
Another Mediclinic Specialist Physician, Dr Sifiso Masuku, says looking after COVID-19 patients has been difficult.
The impact of having to look after COVID-19 positive patients, very difficult experience for all of us; for myself and my colleagues.
Unfortunately, it’s having a negative impact, not only on our resolve to become doctors, and wanting to do best for our patients.
Unfortunately, as a father, I question my decisions.
I question myself as a human being.
I question myself for the choice of profession that I chose because I put my life at risk every single day.
It is at a time like this that psychological support is of paramount importance.
Clinical Psychologist Dr Sammy Thekiso: while COVID-19 is an individual-specific condition, it arouses a collective response.
My personal experience is that since the advance of coronavirus and COVID-19, it has been that, much as coronavirus is an individual specific condition, it, however, also arouses the collective response whereby you find that an individual presents with symptoms such as your anxiety, your panic attack, and your depression.
However, you will realise that the situation affects not only an individual but the whole systems surrounding an individual as the family, as other important sectors of the society, like your work, like your institutions such as school.
Lofu is still receiving treatment while Moshoaliba is undergoing counselling.
Understanding the impact of COVID-19 trauma: The City of Johannesburg has encouraged residents to take part 8h30 and 9h30 this evening by switching off the lights for that one hour.
This year’s theme is Climate Change to save Earth.
The event is a global initiative by the World Wide Fund for Nature to help raise awareness of the need to protect the planet.
The symbolic gesture of turning off the lights is targeted at raising awareness about climate change and the effect it has on the planet.
The world’s major economies, including China, the US and Europe are rapidly moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy sources including wind and solar.
South Africa is also introducing more wind and solar power sources.
Deputy Director of Communications in the office of the MMC for Environment and Infrastructure, Stanley Itshegetseng, says, We are creating awareness about emissions that are affecting the environment about which products are affecting land field.
We are an industrialised city.
There is a lot of factories here and how do we create green factories that has lower emissions?
Dr Sandy-Lynne Steenhuizen says artificial light at night is any light in the house, business, or town that could be affecting pollinators, insects, and animals that are active at night in gardens and nature around us.
She adds that artificial light at night is a driver for the decline in pollinators.
The City of Cape Town has called on residents to join the national switch off all non-essential lights for an hour between 8H30 and 9H30 this evening to mark Earth Hour.
Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato, says they’re also launching an initiative to encourage residents to take action against climate change.
The Let’s Act campaign is aimed at changing responses to the issue.
Meanwhile, A group of eco-warriors is dedicating part of their weekend to cleaning up the Durban Harbour in commemoration of Earth Hour.
University of KwaZulu-Natal student Doctor Refilwe Mofokeng is driving the clean-up that will focus on picking up plastic waste in and around the harbour precinct.
South Africans are being urged to look after their environment and recycle plastic waste especially single-use plastics like cold drink bottles.

Marcelo Toledo usually creates sculptures and jewellery out of metal.
Now the Argentine artist is working with a new material: waste masks and syringes from the COVID-19 pandemic to create an exhibition exploring the painful impact of the virus.
Toledo, who has made jewellery for the musical Evita on Broadway and unique pieces for Barack Obama and Madonna, was among the first in Argentina to contract COVID-19 a year ago, which left him hospitalised for eight days with pneumonia.
The experience left an imprint on his life and triggered a flurry of artworks, from a 14-meter mask with the Argentine flag that he placed on the iconic Obelisk in Buenos Aires to raise awareness about organ donation during the pandemic.
For his new exhibition, the Museum of the After, Toledo is collecting recycled coronavirus waste sent by hospitals, laboratories and random people.
It includes old vaccines and medical parts, and newspaper clippings about the pandemic.
I am excited to be able to transform pain into beauty and this exhibition is just that, capturing everything that is happening to us as a society, Toledo, 45, told Reuters in his workshop in the San Telmo district of Buenos Aires.
The artworks, which will go on show from September in a public space in downtown Buenos Aires, will all be made from disposable materials or garbage that people send me, many of them sealed inside vacuum-packed bags.
It is the first time that I do an exhibition in which I do not have to buy any of the elements, he said.
It will all be enclosed or put in capsules because we should never forget this.
So the idea is that everything can be preserved over time.
In the exhibition, there will be a real ship that symbolically crosses a storm and recycling islands to raise awareness about the importance of caring for the environment.
The exhibition will tell the story of this ship that went sailing and was stranded after the storm, which is a great metaphor for what is happening to us.
This pandemic, its a great global storm, Toledo said.
As with the giant mask, which was replicated in countries such as the United States and Japan, the artist dreams of reproducing the new exhibition in other cities around the world.
The idea of this Museum of the After is, on one hand, to look for elements from all over the world, and also to be able to replicate it in other places and even get a physical museum to leave the work for posterity, he said.
French households feasted on cheese last year as they turned to home cooking and sought gastronomic comfort during coronavirus lockdowns that shuttered the restaurant trade.
The amount of cheese purchased by French shoppers for at-home consumption increased by more than 8% in 2020, compared with just 2% the previous year, according to figures from farming agency FranceAgriMer and market data firm Kantar.
That was part of a shift in food consumption in many countries last year as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, with households initially bulk buying staples like pasta and flour, and later settling into home-eating habits with extra purchases of products like butter.
In France, mozzarella saw the steepest rise in demand among major cheese categories, with a 21% volume jump, followed by a 12% increase for raclette a winter favourite eaten melted with potatoes and cured meats.
Along with strong supermarket sales of ingredient cheeses for cooking, specialist shops like Augustin Denous in Boulogne-Billancourt just outside Paris have reported more trade from locked-down households looking for a culinary treat.
In our little way, we’ve helped prevent people going completely gloomy.
There’s been a moment of pleasure at the dinner table with good wine, good bread and good cheese.
Its one of those pleasures that are still accessible, one of Denous customers, Nicolas, said at the store.
Cheese has nonetheless fared better than products like champagne or fish that are more reliant on events and restaurant trade.
Cheese lovers also see an opportunity to safeguard Frances renowned array of artisanal cheeses.
There is really an enthusiasm about farming and we need to make sure that is reflected in the arrival of new, younger producers, said Veronique Richez-Lerouge, president of Frances local cheeses association and founder of an annual cheese day, taking place on Saturday.
Germany has banned unnecessary surgeries on babies who are born intersex, neither clearly male or female, but critics warned on Friday that the new law could easily be sidestepped by doctors and parents.
Lawmakers in the Bundestag parliament voted late on Thursday to join several European countries in banning cosmetic operations that seek to ensure the child ascribes to traditional notions of male and female.
From now on, a family court will have to authorise such surgeries on children diagnosed with variations of sexual development, a medical term often used to refer to intersex people.
About 1.7% of babies are born intersex, according to the United Nations, with a small proportion undergoing operations to bring the appearance and function of their genitalia into line with that expected of males or females.
Research suggests that unnecessary surgeries performed without childrens consent can lead to psychological damage later in life, and intersex rights campaigners broadly welcomed the ban in Germany.
We’re very happy that there is finally a law about this, but the ban has loopholes and leaves many questions unanswered, Charlotte Wunn, head of intersex rights group Intergeschlechtliche Menschen, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Parents and doctors could get around the new law and proceed with surgery by avoiding an intersex diagnosis, and the legislation does not stipulate penalties, Wunn and others said.
The room for interpretation is enormous and the ban is very easy to circumvent, said Free Democratic Party lawmaker Jens Brandenburg.
According to a study by the University of Bochum, 1,871 children under the age of 10 underwent feminising or masculinising surgery between 2005 and 2016 in Germany, which joins Malta and Portugal in banning such procedures.
Spain’s parliament is currently discussing a measure similar to the German ban, which Olaf Hiort a professor at the University Hospital in Luebeck said he hoped would curb uncontrolled operations.
He noted, however, that while there was now a ban, there is no penalty.
Its been a year since South Africa went into lockdown.
Many things have happened since then, but its not been all doom and gloom as some welcomed their precious gifts on the day.
Leane Chirwa gave birth to a baby boy Jordan on the day.
She says she never imagined how the world would turn out after the birth of her child.
Baby Jordan is one of the select children born on the day President Cyril Rampahosa announced that the country was going on lockdown to prevent the then novel coronavirus.
His mom, the 38-year-old Leane Chirwa from Cosmo City says the uncertainty and anxiety were just too much for her as she was heavily pregnant.
Twelve months later, she’s a proud mom, raising a healthy baby boy, fondly known as Jojo.
She credits the professionalism of health workers for overcoming her fear.
Chirwa says despite the tough experience, she’s glad her boy brings a smile to the family.
She only returned to work at the end of January 2021.
While the future remains uncertain under the new normal, she’s hoping, the virus will soon disappear.
While Chirwa and the world talk about the new normal, for baby Jordan, this is the only life he knows.
As we seek to return to our normal way of life, for Jojo, it will be a whole new normal as he has never known anything other than this.
One year since South Africa went into lockdown.
Midnight March 26 marks one year since South Africa went under lockdown.
SABC News looks back at some COVID-19-related stories that left South Africans shocked and outraged since President Cyril Ramaphosa first announced what was supposed to be a 21-day lockdown on 23 March 2020.
It all started when the first case of COVID-19 in South African was detected in KwaZulu-Natal.
A 38-year-old man who had travelled to Italy on holiday with a group of 10 people tested positive for the virus.
Since then over 1.5 million South Africans have contracted the virus and there have been more than 50 000 COVID 19-related deaths.
Below are some of the regulations that sent tongues wagging and shocking incidents.
Ban on alcohol and cigarettes sales
In what was described as one of the worlds strictest lockdowns, South Africa banned the sale of alcohol and tobacco products, saying it would compromise the health of citizens.
Citizens faced a five-month ban on the sale of cigarettes and three alcohol bans since the pandemic hit last March, the last was imposed on 28 December.
This sparked public outrage and resulted in the black market thriving with sales going up to more than double its market value.
It, therefore, comes as no surprise that other top searches in South Africa for 2020 included searches such as how to make pineapple beer.
However, this proved fatal for some who died after the consumption of homemade alcohol or were rushed to hospital for poisoning.
I now have a criminal record for being caught with 1 cigarette, but ANC get away with 500 billion, so can ANC arrest ANC?
During the hard lockdown, mothers were left frustrated after they couldn’t buy to buy clothes for their babies because of the nationwide lockdown.
Shops were open only for food and medication.
The Tebeila Institute of Leadership, the African Institute for Human Rights and Constitutional Litigation filed an urgent application at the Constitutional Court, challenging the closure of shops that sell goods for babies.
After President Ramaphosa extended the nationwide lockdown by further two weeks, government amended the lockdown regulations to allow clothing shops to sell baby clothes and some necessities.
Another bizarre COVID-19 regulation was that South African stores could only sell closed toe, shoes and short-sleeved shirts if they were promoted or displayed to be worn under jackets or jerseys.
Soo Im on a ban from buying anymore baby clothes.
Thank God for online shopping
After being deported by President Ramaphosa to enforce compliance to the national lockdown, alleged brutality by some SANDF and SAPS members was reported.
Collins Khosa, a 40-year-old man from Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, died after he was allegedly assaulted by soldiers.
Social media posts also showed SANDF members forcing members of the public to perform physical exercises, beating some citizens up and confiscating their groceries.
This caused a public outcry
The public was urged to report cases of brutality to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID).
#AskCele# Why are you Behaving like you’re the President of the Country?
In July 2020, allegations of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tender corruption amounting to millions of rand emerged from several parts of the country.
Presidential spokesperson Khusela Diko, Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku, and his wife Loyiso, went on leave of absence amid alleged irregularities relating to a R125 million PPE tender.
The tender was awarded to Royal Bhaca Projects a company owned by Diko’s husband, who is now late.
In April 2020, the government distributed food parcels to the needy who were hard hit by the impact of the lockdown.
This was also marred by corruption claims with some councillors allegedly stashing away the groceries for themselves and their family members or unfairly distributing them to their political party members.
Some were sold to foreign-owned shops.
In Tshwane, the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) opened a corruption case against some officials for allegedly distributing food parcels based on preference.
We will deal with the individuals concerned harshly. Cyril Ramaphosa.
On PPE corruption (03 August 2020):
Perpetrators are going to be dealt with decisively and harshly.

Many South Africans expressed shock at the rise of gender-based violence during the lockdown.
Masimanyane Women’s Support Centre said there had been a spike in rape, incest and marital rape cases.
It believes the violence was linked to the frustration of being in confined spaces, and the restriction of movement.
Police said they received at least 2 300 calls for help related to gender-based violence during the first week of the 21-day national lockdown.
One woman killed every 3 hours in South Africa.
Murders increased during lockdown.
Police Minister, Bheki Cele, says there’s a link between the abuse of alcohol and a spike in crime, including Gender Based Violence.
Cele believes the availability of alcohol also plays a role in people contravening #lockdown regulations.
South Africa’s children say the COVID-19 lockdown has left them feeling sad, lonely and eager to return to life as it was before the pandemic.
At midnight on Thursday, it will be a year since the country officially went under lockdown.
Children says the lockdown has taken away some of the things they value most, such as interacting with friends at school and visiting the playground.
Above all, they despise the wearing of masks.
It’s a long time since the virus is out there and you have to wear masks because the virus will go into you and you will get sick.
I don’t like wearing masks because then you can’t breathe a lot.
I miss hugging my friends, says one child.
Adds another: Last year wasn’t a year that I liked a lot because of the virus, people were dying and we had to stay inside.
I hate it because it doesn’t let me go, it lets me stay.
I want to hug them and I want to stay with the people.
I would like to say to the president, to not toughen up the lockdown because we need to go to school.
The country is currently under level one lockdown, which has much more relaxed regulations.
However, the wearing of mask, social distancing and sanitising or/and regular washing of hands are still mandatory.
So far, South Africa has recorded more than 1.5 million cases and more than 52 000, amid concerns of a third wave of infections soon.
The National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) recently warned that mass gatherings and social events over the Easter holidays could trigger the third wave.
Citizens have been urged to take the necessary COVID-19 health protocols over the Easter holidays to avoid a fresh surge.
The No Zoom policy for this year’s Oscars ceremony is proving a headache for multiple nominees who live outside the United States and who are still under pandemic restrictions, according to Hollywood publications.
Variety and Deadline Hollywood reported on Wednesday that publicists and some studio executives have complained to the film academy about logistics, costs and quarantine issues raised by the decision to bar nominees from taking part in the ceremony remotely.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the ceremony, did not return a request for comment on the reports.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the April 25 show to hand out the highest honors in the movie industry will be held both at Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles and the traditional home of the Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
Producers said last week that there will not be an option to Zoom in for the show and encouraged nominees to attend in person.
At least nine nominees, including Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennell and star Carey Mulligan, live in Britain.
England next week is expected to ban nonessential international travel until mid-May.
Representatives of the five international feature films submitted by Denmark, Hong Kong, Romania, Tunisia and Bosnia could also face hurdles getting to Los Angeles, Variety and Deadline noted.
Some of the other 200 or so nominees will be working on productions that require quarantine or living in restricted bubbles with cast and crew, the publications said.
Visitors to California are currently expected to quarantine for 10 days.
Travelers to nations outside the United States are also subject to varying quarantine requirements.
Variety said a meeting this week to discuss the issues between the Academy, movie studio executives and publicists had been cancelled.
Other awards shows in recent months have replaced the usual in-person gatherings at gala dinners and on stage with pre-recorded appearances or virtual events, or a combination of those with small in-person gatherings.
But television audiences have slumped, with the Golden Globes and the Grammys attracting the smallest numbers in decades.
Jazz musician Harry Connick Jr. is showcasing a spiritual side with his new album, Alone With My Faith.
Connick Jr. created the album in his home studio during the pandemic, playing all the instruments, recording all background vocals and doing the engineering.
The singer said the process acted as therapy during uncertain times.
This was a case where the music itself was actually helping me get through this time, and that’s really rare, he said.
The New Orleans native described the 13-track project as a mix of Christian and faith-based songs intended for those who need help accessing their faith to get them through the last year.
Connick said the album, released earlier this month, is an honest look at how most people navigated life during quarantine.
This is a really truthful look at what I, and I think a lot of other people who might listen to it, are going through and just, just went through, he said.
Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it had blocked a group of hackers in China who used the platform to target Uighurs living abroad with links to malware that would infect their devices and enable surveillance.
The social media company said the hackers, known as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye in the security industry, targeted activists, journalists and dissidents who were predominantly Uighurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group facing persecution in China.
Facebook said there were less than 500 targets, who were largely from the Xinjiang region but were primarily living abroad in countries including Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United States, Syria, Australia and Canada.
It said the majority of the hackers activity occurred away from Facebook and that they used the site to share links to malicious websites rather than directly sharing the malware on the platform.
This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while obfuscating who’s behind it, Facebook cybersecurity investigators said in a blog post.
Facebook said the hacking group used fake Facebook accounts to pose as fictitious journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uighur community to build trust with their targets and trick them into clicking malicious links that would install spying software on their devices.
It said hackers both set up malicious websites using look-alike domains for popular Uighur and Turkish news sites and compromised legitimate websites visited by the targets.
Facebook also found websites created by the group to mimic third-party Android app stores with Uighur-themed apps, like a prayer app and dictionary app, containing malware.
Facebook said its investigation found two Chinese companies, Beijing Best United Technology Co Ltd (Best Lh) and Dalian 9Rush Technology Co Ltd (9Rush) had developed the Android tooling deployed by the group.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Facebooks report.
Beijing routinely denies allegations of cyber espionage.
Reuters was not immediately able to locate contact information for Dalian 9Rush Technology Co Ltd.
A man who answered the number listed for Beijing Best United Technology Co Ltd hung up.
Western governments are seeking to hold Beijing accountable for mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in north-western China, where the United States says China is committing genocide.
China denies all accusations of abuse and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
The United Nations estimates that up to 1 million people, mainly Uighurs, have been detained in the Xinjiang camps.
Facebook said it had removed the groups accounts, which numbered less than 100, and had blocked the sharing of the malicious domains and was notifying people it believed were targets.
Black South Africans were more willing to sacrifice their rights to stop the spread of the coronavirus, than their white counterparts.
This is according to the Human Sciences and Research Council (HSRC) in a study conducted during the lockdown in 2020.
The HSRC released the findings of its research titled: Who is willing to sacrifice human rights in the context of COVID in a webinar in Pretoria.
The findings come as the country is about to mark one year since the lockdown was instituted to curb the spread of COVID-19.
National Assembly focuses on how COVID-19 affected the rights of South Africans.
The study was conducted in three phases: April to May; August to October; and December 2020 to January 2021.
The HSRCs Divisional Research Executive Professor Narnia Bohler-Muller says, 78% of South Africans were willing to sacrifice their human rights to stop the spread of the virus.
So, 78% in the third round
So, there wasn’t much difference across the rounds as to this general question that is: are you willing to sacrifice your rights?
But where we broke down to which rights you were willing to sacrifice, then the outcomes were slightly different.
Demographics:
Prof Bohler-Muller says according to demographics, it has been found that black South Africans were more willing to sacrifice their rights to stop the spread of the virus compared to their white counterparts.
The most demographic group, most willing to sacrifice their rights were black South Africans at 81%.
The demographic in South Africa that were least willing to sacrifice their rights were white South Africans at 58%.
Chief Executive Officer of the South African Human Rights Commission, Advocate Tseliso Thipanyane, says the commission has seen an increase in the number of complaints of human rights violations during the lockdown.
So yes, the number of complaints did increase because of the peculiar nature of COVID-19 that we are now limiting the rights.
The other thing which concerns us, which we are also looking at under small offences; what might happen to people who got the criminal record for not wearing a mask because then are you going to have a policy where after a certain period of time, those records will be expunged?
Human Rights and Social Justice Activist, Mark Heywood, says respect for and promotion of human rights will improve the country’s COVID-19 response.
So there is a positive side that has to be much better understood.
There is positive state obligation when it comes to socio-economic rights whose regression makes people more vulnerable to COVID-19, to spreading COVID-19 and to dying of COVID-19.
The HSRC and the Human Rights Commission say, despite, there being important players in research and protection of human rights, the national Coronavirus Command Council, chaired by President Cyril Ramaphosa, has never invited them to give input on how to deal with COVID-19.
The right to go to place of worship was the right South Africans were most willing to sacrifice.
George Segal, the Oscar-nominated actor who sparred with Richard Burton in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, romanced Glenda Jackson in A Touch of Class and won laughs in the TV sitcom The Goldbergs, has died at the age of 87, his wife Sonia said on Tuesday.
The family is devastated to announce that this morning George Segal passed away due to complications from bypass surgery, Sonia Segal said in a statement to entertainment outlets Variety and Deadline Hollywood.
Charming and witty, Segal excelled in dramatic and comedic roles and had a life-long passion for the banjo.
He performed at New York’s Carnegie Hall in 1981 with his group, the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band.
Segal’s acting career began on the New York stage and television in the early 1960s.
He quickly moved into films, playing an artist in the star-studded ensemble drama Ship of Fools and a scheming, wily American corporal in a World War Two prisoner-of-war camp in King Rat in 1965.
Two years later he earned an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actor in the harrowing, marital drama Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? with Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.
As cheering children and men frantically paddle their inflatable surfboard through the frothy Pacific waves onto the beach, one passenger placidly sits in the bow taking it all in a large, white goat.
California surfer Dana McGregor has always loved the thrill of catching a wave, but it wasn’t until he took his pet goat surfing with him one day that he truly found his calling.
I got one goat to clear my poison oak in the backyard
I decided to take it surfing on my birthday
and then I just ended up surfing goats, recalled McGregor of the day his goat-surfing journey began almost ten years ago.
McGregor, 42, now teaches children how to surf from Pismo Beach, north of Santa Barbara, using his pet goats Pismo and Grover to help them overcome their fear of the water.
When its your first time it feels scary but actually after you keep on doing it and doing it, its really fun, said 10-year-old Mileah Robbins, fresh from riding a wave with eight-year-old Pismo.
The goats seem to enjoy it too, judging by Pismos relaxed expression as he hit the waves.
There’s a freedom in surfing that you can’t find just anywhere, said McGregor, hugging his goats as they stand on the boardwalk, attracting attention from children and other passers-by.
You’re riding waves that God brings us, that bring healing and joy and freedom and peace into our lives so I want everyone to experience that.
The battle of Cuito Cuanavale has paved the way for the liberation of Southern Africa.
This is according to Arts, Sport and Culture Minister, Nathi Mthethwa.
Mthethwa was speaking at the commemoration of the battle at Freedom Park in Pretoria on Tuesday.
The battle expedited the liberation of Namibia, South Africa and the SADC region.
The battle of Cuito Cuanavale was fought on the banks of the Lomba River in Cuito Cuanavale, South-Eastern Angola.
It involved the late Jonas Savimbi-led rebel group, UNITA, assisted by the South African Defence Force against the Angolan army (FAPLA), who was assisted by Cuba, the Soviet Union and to a lesser extent East Germany.
Eduardo Kondua, representing Angolan Ambassador to South Africa says the outcomes of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale were important for the SADC region.
Indeed the results of Cuito Cuanavale campaign were crucial in persuading the leaders of South Africa’s national party to cut their losses.
They did so following talks with the Angolan government, Soviet Union, Cuba, Britain and the United States leading to a major strategic realignment with huge consequences for the whole Southern African region.
Many people died on all fronts involved in the battle.
South West African Peoples Organisation lost an estimated 11 400 guerrillas in combat.
Deputy Head of Mission at the Embassy of Namibia Vasco Samupofu ensured that Namibia acquired independence.
The battle of Cuito Cuanavale culminated into Namibia getting its independence the last colony in Africa through the implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution which led to Namibias independence on 21 March 1990.
It put a final nail also in the coffin of apartheid South Africa leading to its demise and democratisation of South Africa in 1994, whereby ending the destabilisation of the region by the racist regime then.

The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale was the climax of the war that took place in Angola instigated by the apartheid regime, in 1987-1988, where the apartheid regime was defeated.
Cuban casualties in Angola totalled approximately 10 000 dead.
The number included deaths, injuries and those missing.
Ambassador of Cuba Rodolfo Benitez says the outcomes of the battle changed the balance of power in the region.
The defeat of the racist South African army in Angola fundamentally changed the regional balance of power.
It forced the apartheid regime to the negotiation table with the ANC, with Angola and with Cuba and to make concessions that they have been rejecting for many years.
As Mandela said, Cuito was crucial in bringing Pretoria to realise it would have to talk with us.
In the region, it was referred to as frontline states. Now SADC, says Mthethwa.
Mthethwa announced that together with his Angolan counterpart they will be asking the African Union member states to recognise the role that the battle of Cuito Cuanavale played in the history of the continent.

In a room crammed from ceiling to floor with boxes, cabinets and drawers of Lego bricks, Hoang Dang intently builds a bright blue, yellow and red fishing boat with a Vietnamese flag and eyes at its prow.
The industrial designer has loved Lego for as long as he can remember, but started collecting it seriously a few years ago on an overseas study trip to Detroit, amazed by the range of sets available in the United States.
Hoang is most inspired by scenes close to home in Vietnam, painstakingly recreating his childhood house, a temple in Hanois Old Quarter and a 1990s living room during Lunar New Year, all in intricate and colourful miniature detail.
I want to bring my perspective to friends all over the world, because Vietnams Lego building community is still little known regionally and globally, he said.
Hoang is halfway to his goal of building 10 large-scale creations for an exhibition.
It takes about five months to finish a 5,000-piece facade, he said, although much of that time is spent finding the right pieces.
I often spend a whole evening to look for just that one brick, he added.
Despite a collection of over two million Lego bricks, Hoang is always on the hunt for new pieces.
That’s how he made what he calls his Lego friends, including Khang Huynh in Ho Chi Minh City.
The pair met on a Facebook group for Lego builders and collectors.
The name Lego is an abbreviation of leg godt meaning play well in Danish.
Building Lego helps us to recharge our creative energy after working on long and tiring projects, said Hoang.
They like to photograph what inspires them on the street, then recreate it with bricks.
For Khang, that includes street scenes with complex builds like a classic Honda Cub motorcycle.
I am drawn to the everyday things around me that are very familiar, said Khang.
I build anything that I feel is cute and dear to me.
Twitter boss Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet as an NFT for just over $2.9 million dollars on Monday.
The tweet is in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) a kind of unique digital asset that has exploded in popularity so far in 2021.
Each NFT has its own blockchain-based digital signature, which serves as a public ledger, allowing anyone to verify the assets authenticity and ownership.
The NFT was sold via auction on a platform called Valuables, which is owned by the U.S.-based company Cent.
It was bought using the cryptocurrency Ether, for 1630.5825601 ETH, which was worth $2,915,835.47 at the time of sale, Cameron Hejazi, the CEO and co-founder of Cent confirmed.
Cent confirmed the buyer is Sina Estavi.
Estavi’s Twitter profile, @sinaEstavi, says he is based in Malaysia and is CEO of the blockchain company Bridge Oracle.
Estavi told Reuters he was thankful when asked for comment about the purchase.
On March 6, Dorsey, who is a bitcoin enthusiast, tweeted a link to the website where the NFT was listed for sale.
He then said in another tweet on March 9 that he would convert the proceeds from the auction into bitcoin and donate them to people impacted by COVID-19 in Africa.
Dorsey receives 95% of the proceeds of the primary sale, while Cent receives 5%.
Cent CEO Cameron Hejazi said that his platform allows people to show support for a tweet that goes beyond the current options to like, comment and retweet.
These assets might go up in value, they might go down in value, but what will stay is the ledger and the history of I purchased this from you at this moment in time and thats going to be in both the buyer, the seller and the public spectators memory, Hejazi said, adding that this was inherently valuable.
Prague city hall has rented a luxury hotel where homeless people who contract COVID-19 can convalesce and those who come into contact with someone with the disease can isolate.
The city’s Centre of Social Services (CSSP) deputy director Ludmila Tomesova said those housed in the hotel were offered three meals a day, full medical attention and television and other amenities while they recovered.
So the hotel has guests, even if they are not standard commercial ones, and it is full all the time, she told Reuters at a four-star Prague hotel in the city centre that has housed about 250 people since November.
The Czech Republic has been among the hardest-hit countries in the world during the recent wave of the pandemic.
Deaths from the virus have reached nearly 25 000 in the country of 10.7 million people.
The per-capita infection rate was the third-highest in the world in the past week, according to the Our World in Data website.
Tomesova said Prague, which has about 4 500 homeless people, was trying to help people find shelter and get access to other services once they tested negative and left the hotels.
For some guests, the stay was a rare taste of luxury.
Its the first time in my life that Ive been in a hotel like this, Josef Jirsa said, as he recovered from a mild case of COVID-19.
The Northern Cape multi-award-winning Amandla Dance Teatro artists are back on stage for the first time since the relaxation of the COVID-19 restrictions with a new musical, Mwana Wa Mvula.
The cast is happy and excited to be back on stage.
And despite the financial strain they are experiencing due to COVID-19, the first show was free for children.
We are struggling.
The struggling economy, its COVID and the industry has been hit very hard.
Its been a big problem but all in all, we had to make this free for the kids, says Amandla Dance Teatro co-director, Mkhululi Mabija.
Artists say despite the financial challenges they are facing, they are driven by their passion for the arts.
The musical storyline depicts a journey of a rainmaker, Lerumo, whose spiritual gift clashes with his father’s Christian beliefs.
My character in the play; I’m a other fighting for the rights of women and the rights of our children, says actress, Kediemetse Oliphant.
Actor Duncan Matloko says: The story is more about me being born and then the father denies the family gift.
The message is that when you are a father of a gifted child, don’t be jealous.
You must always be there for your child, adds Obakeng Moapesi, another actor.
The Mwana Wa Vula Musical will go on until the end of April.
Modern African music is altering perceptions of the continent as part of a global cultural shift that marks a big moment, Nigerian music artist Burna Boy told Reuters after hailing his first Grammy award.
Burna Boy was awarded a Grammy for the Best Global Music Album this month for Twice As Tall which was released last year.
He is part of a generation of Nigerian music artists, which include Wizkid and Davido, that has enjoyed global success in recent years as proponents of the Afrobeats sound.
The African genre is now almost as likely to be heard in London or Los Angeles as it is in Lagos.
Its a big moment and a big time for African music and Africans in general, said Burna Boy, during an interview at his home in Nigerias commercial capital Lagos.
The artist, whose real name is Damini Ogulu, said his award was part of a domino effect that gives Africans more control over the way they are perceived through technology, as streaming services take the continents arts to a global audience.
I didn’t even want to be African when I was little, he said.
I wanted to be anything but who I was, because who we are wasnt really the cool thing to be, said the artist, who grew up in southern Nigeria and moved to London as a child before returning to the west African country.
He said his win showed that African music was attracting worldwide respect.
Those sentiments were shared by many at Edge Music Academy, in the Jakande district of Lagos, where students compose music in a studio decked out with microphones, laptops and a keyboard.
The future is bright, said student Obi Prince.
The way Afrobeats is represented in the world right now can only be a start for Nigerian artists.
We just have to do our thing and bring out ourselves more globally, he said.
The academys chief executive officer, Michael Tijani, said Burna Boys win was a huge deal for Nigerian music.
People coming into the industry now have a more concrete belief that you can actually get as far as anybody else in the world can go, he said.
Reclining in a chair in his home studio, Burna Boy reflected on his success.
You can’t mention the top five musicians in the world without throwing me or an African in there, he said, smiling.
Now were eye to eye with the people we used to look up to.
Facebook Inc said on Monday it took down 1.3 billion fake accounts between October and December and that it had over 35 000 people working on tackling misinformation on its platform.
The company also removed more than 12 million pieces of content about COVID-19 and vaccines that global health experts flagged as misinformation, it said in a blog post.
False claims and conspiracies about the coronavirus vaccines have proliferated on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter during the pandemic.
Facebooks disclosure of data on misinformation comes ahead of an inspection by the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce into how technology platforms including Facebook are tackling misinformation.
Robot artist Sophia, whose first artwork goes up for auction on Wednesday, says she draws inspiration for her work from people and is open to future creative partnerships with humans.
A digital artwork by the Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics humanoid, in the form of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), is to be auctioned in the first sale of such pieces created jointly with artificial intelligence (AI).
NFTs, a digital signature saved on blockchain ledgers that allows anyone to verify the ownership and authenticity of items, have become the latest investment craze, with one artwork selling this month for nearly $70 million.
I hope the people like my work, and the humans and I can collaborate in new and exciting ways going forward, Sophia said in her studio, speaking in a flat voice.
She wore a silver-coloured dress and held a pen.
Sophia, who was unveiled in 2016, produced her art in collaboration with 31-year-old Italian digital artist Andrea Bonaceto, known for colourful portraits, some of which depict famous people, such as Teslas chief executive, Elon Musk.
The robot has combined elements from Bonacetos works, art history, and her own physical drawings or paintings on various surfaces multiple times in a process her creator David Hanson describes as iterative loops of evolution.
We use transformer networks and genetic algorithms in my art, and other kinds of computational creativity, Sophia added.
My algorithms output unique patterns that never existed in the world before.
So I think the machines can be creative.
After the auction, Sophia will interact with the successful bidder, to study his or her face, and add a final inspired brushstroke to the artwork.
This will serve, says Hanson, to make it a unique artwork encompassing data of the new owner and that personal connection, at that moment in time.
Bonaceto said the collaboration aimed to make a statement in the art world, and even the technology world, heralding a new road on which AI robots and humans collaborate, enhancing each other.
Sophia’s art could be a very, very important historical piece, said Pablo Fraile, an art collector based in Miami and an early buyer of Beeple, as American artist Mike Winkelmann, creator of the NFT work sold this month for millions, is known.
Its the first time these ideas are put together.
It would pave the way for more innovation in the AI art space, he added.
US-based IV Gallery will represent Sophia as an artist and promote her.
Sophia has that unlimited freedom, like a five-year-old has, and no restrictions to what she can do, said gallery director Vincent Harrison.
Its fascinating to see this new way to create.
Barcelona ravers have found a way to get round COVID-19 curbs on clubs by holding outdoor silent discos in some of the city’s best-known locations.
On Sunday, people welcomed the first day of spring by putting on their headphones and busting some moves at Mar Bella beach along Barcelonas famous seafront all while respecting social distancing regulations.
It’s been incredible, really cool.
I didn’t expect there’d be so many people, said therapist Andres Mellado, 41.
At first it seems a bit odd dancing in the middle of Barcelona and people were stopping to look, but its beautiful.
Its a great thing to do on a Sunday morning, come here and connect a bit to the music, he said.
What started off as a fun meet-up between friends has grown into a regular Sunday morning event, the Tribu Silent Disco.
One took place at the famous Magic Fountain in the neighbourhood of Montjuic.
(We asked ourselves) what could we do to boost dancing now that there are so many restrictions?
And we had the idea to do it outdoors and with headphones, Silent Disco co-founder Xavi Panella told Reuters.
First we told friends and acquaintances and then people joined because we do it outdoors and in beautiful places where we dont bother anyone and we maintain a safe distance.
Experts say grass pollen counts in the Northern Cape have doubled compared to last season.
This is attributed to the recent heavy rains.
Pollen is a common cause of hay fever and can also affect those who have asthma.
But experts say those who are prone to allergies can breathe a sigh of relief as the pollen season is about to end.
Ear, Nose and Throat specialist, Doctor Werner Hoek, has been monitoring the province and collecting pollen data.
It’s important because we don’t know what’s going on at this stage.
Research has shown that large volumes of pollen can interfere with normal anti-viral immunity.
Leading South African aerobiologist, Doctor Dilys Berman says, From last years experience, towards the end of March beginning of April there should be some relief for allergy sufferers, its a good idea to look for pollen counts on our website, which is www.pollencounts.co.za.
Many South Africans suffer from hay fever or allergic rhinitis.
It is estimated that SA allergy sufferers fork out more than R480 million a year on allergy medication.
We sat down with Prof Jonny Peter to find out why.
Celebrations to mark the Golden Jubilee of the historic Artscape building complex in the Mother City kicks off today with a gala concert in celebration of Human Rights Day.
The stylish affair is said to feature performers from Artscapes six associated companies, as well as the Capes best entertainers.
The two-hour-long spectacular will be recorded in the Opera House and presented to audiences via the playhouses YouTube channel free of charge.
Artscape Theatres CEO Marlene Le Roux speaks about the celebrations.
Parts of former US President Donald Trump’s Palm Beach, Florida, golf resort have been temporarily closed because of a coronavirus outbreak, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
A source familiar with club operations said some workers had been quarantined out of an abundance of caution, and a section of the club had been closed for a short period of time.
No further details were immediately available about the number of infections or what portions of the club had been closed, or when they would reopen.
Trump and his family moved to the Mar-a-Lago resort on January 20, the day his successor Joe Biden was sworn in as president.
After weeks of staying out of the limelight, Trump used a speech to US conservatives in Orlando, Florida, to repeat his false claim that he won the 2020 election and hinted at a possible presidential run in 2024.
Trump was hospitalised for several days in October after contracting the virus.
His wife, Melania and son Barron also tested positive.
The late actress Noxolo Noxee Maqashalala has been laid to rest at Mpoza Village in KwaBhaca in the Eastern Cape.
She passed away in her Honeydew home in Johannesburg last week.
In a moving funeral service, speakers described her as someone whose dedication and love for her work will never be forgotten.
The television actress played in Generations, Tsha Tsha, Intersexions and Rhythm City amongst others.
Family spokesperson, Khabonina Nyikinya, says Maqashalala had been battling depression for a long time and that she preferred staying alone.
We are not blaming anyone that Noxolo passed away whilst she was alone in her house.
She was a lady who was living in her own apartment.
But that doesn’t mean she was disconnected from the family.
We have a big family in Gauteng even in Eastern Cape.
We communicate with each other.
So it was just a shock to us that she passed away without maybe some of them have checked on her.
But we believe that she was a person who needed her own space, Nyikinya said.
The actress’s colleagues say the entertainment industry has suffered a huge blow.
Colleague and friend, Zuko Nodada, has praised Maqashalala for the love of her craft.
I’ve worked with Noxolo for 18 years.
Our first project was Tsha Tsha
There is no day uNoxolo would come to set not knowing her lines, not having prepared for the scenes.
She was a creative
She started directing in 2016, if I remember in one of my projects, The Kingdom, uKhakhayi.
She went on to co-create and executive produced Diamond City.
It is a great loss to the industry; I’m not going to lie.
The Artscape Theatre Centre in Cape Town says there is a need to relook the funding for the Arts industry.
It was reacting to the closure of the iconic Fugard Theatre in District Six earlier this week due to the impact of COVID-19.
Fugard Theatre benefactor, Eric Abraham, said they were not convinced that the theatre could be COVID-19 safe and financially stable again.
CEO of Artscape, Marlene Le Roux, says the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have decimated the arts industry.
We have an interest in Fugard because of all the productions like the West Side Story.
So it is about young people, it is about emerging artists that could travel the world because of the Fugard.
For the industry as a whole, if one theatre closes it has an effect on another theatre, we need to relook at the funding for the artists, says Le Roux.
The Fugard Theatre was named in honour of one of South Africa’s most acclaimed and renowned international playwright, Athol Fugard.
All of Athol Fugard’s recent plays had their premieres in the theatre.
The 320-seater playhouse opened its doors and lifted its curtains in March 2010.
Over the past decade, it has showcased many of the best plays and musicals from all over the world including with international stars such as Sir Ian McKellen and the late Alan Rickman, either playing at or visiting the preferred venue on special occasions during its lifetime.
The world-renowned Rickman, who died about four years ago, had only the best to say about the Fugard.
I am an enormous admirer of this company, their enormous work, I’ve seen pretty much everything they have done, its one of those things that seem shouldn’t have been there but it’s there, said Rickman.
Past productions also include Statements After An Arrest Under The Immorality Act, a new production of a Fugard classic.
It was a play that shined the spotlight on the cruelty of apartheid South Africa’s law which prohibited interracial romance.
It is here that many landmark productions, such as the musicals King Kong and Kat and the Kings were produced.
The theatre was also home to many of theatre legends, including David Kramer’s productions.
The building is owned by the District Six Museum.
Acting director, Chrischene Julius, says it is still unclear how it will be used in the future.
With us, its very sad that the theatre has taken a decision to close down, and obviously done that having thought through the decision.
From our side, it’s going to be almost the end of the era in this part of the city because Fugard is well established as one of the cultural spots in Cape Town, says Julius.
To promote access to information, the South African Library for the Blind (SALB), in partnership with the Department of Arts and Culture in the Eastern Cape, has launched an audio book studio at the Mdantsane Library.
SALB has agreements with most publishers to reproduce their materials in braille and audio formats.
The facility will allow narrators to record books for the visually impaired using high-tech equipment.
Most public libraries are not designed to accommodate the needs of blind or partially sighted people.
In most cases, they are forced to rely on other people to read and write for them.
Mustafa Lisithi from Mdantsane is one of the blind people expected to benefit from the project.
He says he is excited about the new facility at the library.
Blindness makes us feel excluded from accessing service such as accessing information.
There are no computer systems that are programmed for blind people so this is an obstacles that we encounter as blind people, says Lisithi.
Eastern Cape Sports, recreation, Arts and Culture MEC, Fezeka Nkomonye, says this initiative will help promote literacy.
A library is a very quiet space, it’s a space where you can get private information so their right to access to information has been prejudiced for the longest of time.
We wanted to ensure that we give them access to information during this human rights month says Nkomonye.
The visually impaired are also exposed to other challenges in the community and are vulnerable to criminals.
SALB CEO, Mandla Ntobela, says they try to assist them with life skills as well.
In a way, the government is trying to ensure that rights for blind people are accommodated.
They’re in a way violated because when they walk in the streets, they’re vulnerable to being robbed of their belongings.
We also provide them with skills on how to deal with challenges in relation to what could happen in their private spaces.
The province needs to build 487 libraries in order for all communities to have access to books and information.
Singer-songwriter Griff has won the 2021 BRITs Rising Star award, organisers of Britain’s pop music honours said on Friday.
The Mirror Talk and Forgive Myself singer beat off competition from rapper Pa Salieu and singer Rina Sawayama to the prize, whose past winners include Adele, Sam Smith, Emeli Sande and Celeste.
In my head Im still screaming from the phone call when I found out, the 20-year-old, who released several songs last year, said in a statement.
Its honestly such a miracle: how on earth did we manage to win a BRIT and break through during a pandemic?
Born to a Chinese mother and Jamaican father, Griff, who sings about teenage love and mental health in her latest song Black Hole, was last year nominated for an Ivor Novello Rising Star award.
The BRIT Awards will take place in May.
Lawyers for Britney Spears will again ask a Los Angeles court in April to make official the replacement of her father as her conservator in a long-running battle over control of her personal and financial affairs.
Her lawyer, Samuel Ingham, told a court hearing on Wednesday that he would ask that Jodi Montgomery, who in 2019 was appointed temporary conservator of the singers personal affairs, be made permanent.
Ingham said he would present the petition at a 27 April hearing.
Britney Spears, now 39, has made clear through her lawyer in the past year that she no longer wants her father involved in her affairs.
A previous bid to remove him failed in August 2020.
Montgomery, the singers care manager, took over from the singer’s father Jamie Spears after he suffered a bout of ill health.
Jamie Spears remains the legal guardian of his daughters financial affairs but is now sharing those duties with a financial institution.
A planned court review on Wednesday of the pop stars finances was postponed for a month.
Jamie Spears was appointed conservator in 2008 after his daughter was hospitalised for psychiatric treatment following a widely publicised breakdown.
A television documentary in February brought new scrutiny to the case and to the #FreeBritney movement started by fans.
#FreeBritney supporters believe Spears is being kept prisoner and that she is sending cryptic signals begging to be freed through her social media accounts.
Vivian Thoreen, an attorney for Jamie Spears, noted in February the pop star had never requested the termination of the legal arrangement.
This is a story about a fiercely loyal, loving, and dedicated father who rescued his daughter from a life-threatening situation.
People were harming her.
They were exploiting her, Thoreen told TV show Good Morning America in an interview.
Anytime Britney wants to end her conservatorship she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it, Thoreen said.
The Oscars ceremony in April will be an intimate, in-person gathering, held without Zoom and limited to nominees, presenters and their guests, the producers said on Thursday.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the show to hand out the highest honours in the movie industry will be held both at the Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles and the traditional home of the Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.
Everyone will be tested, and there will be a COVID-19 safety team on site throughout the evening on April 25.
There will not be an option to Zoom in for the show, producers Steven Soderbergh, Jesse Collins and Stacey Sher said in a note to the more than 200 nominees this year.
We are going to great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening for all of you in person, as well as for all the millions of film fans around the world, and we feel the virtual thing will diminish those efforts, the producers added.
They said nominees and their guests would gather at a courtyard in the Union rail station, while other show elements would be held live inside the Dolby Theatre some 12.9 km away.
Normally, hundreds of the world’s top movie stars would gather in the 3 400-seat theatre for a live show preceded by a red carpet packed with photographers and camera crews.
Other awards shows in recent months have replaced the usual gatherings at gala dinners and on stage with pre-recorded appearances or virtual events or a combination.
Television audiences have slumped, with the Golden Globes and the Grammys attracting the smallest numbers in decades.
Nominations for the Oscars were announced on Monday, with 1930s Hollywood drama
Mank leading the field with 10, followed by The Father, Black Panther story Judas and the Black Messiah, Korean-language drama Minari, Nomadland, #MeToo revenge tale Promising Young Woman, Amazon Studio deaf dramaSound of Metal, and 1960s Vietnam War courtroom drama The Trial of the Chicago 7.
A hundred life-sized bronze statues of South African icons have been illuminated in green as part of Irelands Global Greening Initiative to celebrate St Patricks Day.
Every year iconic landmarks around the world are lit up to celebrate Irelands national day.
This year, The Long March to Freedom exhibition at Century City in Cape Town is among more than 600 sites globally to have gone green.
Ireland has a long history with the anti-apartheid struggle South Africa faced, including cultural, academic, and sports boycotts.
Last night, these life-sized bronze statues of South Africas heroes in the struggle for freedom and democracy took on a green hue to mark St Patricks Day
Irelands national day of celebrating its culture and heritage.
Irelands Ambassador to South Africa, Fionnuala Gilsenan, says The March to Freedom celebrates the role that the Irish anti-apartheid movement played to help to dismantle the regime.
At a time when COVID-19 has thwarted the traditional ways of celebration and travel plans of many Irish in the diaspora wishing to travel home; its hoped the greening of iconic sites across the world will unite and comfort.
Spokesperson for the National Heritage Project Company, Sarah Haines, says they hope it will give many Irish citizens a sense of community.
We hope it will give them a sense that they are still part of the community that they can’t make direct contact with at the moment.
We hope that they will come to visit us, we hope that they will come and celebrate the ideals that are embodied in this exhibition which are the same ideals that they the universal ideals of humanity and liberty and democracy that the Irish people themselves have fought for.
The Irish Embassy says over 35 000 Irish citizens and many more of Irish heritage are living in South Africa.
The significance of St. Patricks Day.
One of the first major films to be made about COVID-19 since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic more than a year ago, Songbird, is on the circuit in South African cinemas.
The movie, directed and written by Adam Mason and with KJ Apa and Sofia Carson in the leads, is set three years into the future where attempts at a vaccine against COVID-23 have failed, the virus has mutated, and comes back stronger and deadlier.
Songbird tells the story of how the infected are ripped from their homes and forced into quarantine camps where they are never discharged from.
This is as the world continues to battle against the coronavirus.
In South Africa, the number of coronavirus cases has increased to 1 532 497 with 51 634 related deaths.
United States President Joe Biden says his rescue dog, a German Shepherd named Major, is being trained after an incident last week, but has not been banished from the White House, adding the pet is still adjusting to life there surrounded by strangers.
Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin, Biden told the ABC programme Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Wednesday.
You turn the corner and there’s two people you don’t know at all and they move, and he moves to protect, Biden added, referring to US Secret Service and other staff who the German Shepherd encounters at the 18-acre (7-hectare)White House complex.
He’s a sweet dog
85% of the people there love him.
All he does is lick them and wag his tail, said Biden, who moved into the White House with his two dogs after he became president in January.
The dog’s being trained now, I didn’t banish him to home in Delaware, Biden added.
The White House last week said the dog had returned to Bidens home state while the president and first lady Jill Biden were traveling but did not directly address media reports of an incident involving security staff.
Asked if Major was now out of the dog house, Biden said: Yes.
Biden adopted Major in 2018 from the Delaware Humane Society to join his other German Shepherd.
That dog, Champ, is already familiar with Washington life.
Biden got Champ in 2008, the year he was elected vice president under President Barack Obama.

After gifting and selling tens of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses abroad, India suddenly finds itself short of shots as new infections surge in the world’s second-most populous country.
India breached 200 000 daily infections for the first time on Thursday and is trying to inoculate more of its population using domestically produced shots.
Facing soaring cases and overflowing hospitals after lockdown restrictions were eased, it also abruptly changed the rules to allow it to fast-track vaccine imports, having earlier rebuffed foreign drug-makers like Pfizer.
It will import Russia Sputnik V vaccine starting this month to cover as many as 125 million people.
The reversal in fortunes could hamper not only India’s battle to contain the pandemic, but also vaccination campaigns in more than 60 poorer countries, mainly in Africa, for months.
The COVAX programme, backed by the World Health Organisation and Gavi vaccine alliance, aims at equitable vaccine access around the world, and is relying heavily on supplies from India, Asias pharmaceutical powerhouse.
So far this month India has only exported around 1.2 million vaccine doses.
An official with knowledge of India’s vaccine strategy said that available shots would be used domestically while the country faced an emergency situation.
There is no commitment to other countries, he said.
India’s foreign ministry, which oversees vaccine deals with other countries, said last week that Indian demand would dictate the level of exports.
Resulting shortages are already being felt in some countries in the COVAX scheme, and a UN health official involved in the vaccine rollout in Africa said: To be so reliant on one manufacturer is a massive concern.
The director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said earlier this month delays in supplies from India could be catastrophic.
Four sources involved in discussions on vaccine supplies and procurement said factors including delays by India and COVAX in placing firm orders, a lack of investment in production, raw material shortages and underestimating the coronavirus surge at home had contributed to vaccine shortages.
The Serum Institute of India (SII), the worlds biggest vaccine manufacturer, had vowed to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 shots to low and middle-income countries, with nearly half of that by the end of 2021.
It has also come under pressure to meet the needs of other governments, including Britain, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid AstraZeneca’s global production problems.
A further initial hurdle to SIIs supply ambitions was India’s hesitation in placing firm orders, two sources said.
That could have allowed it to boost output of the AstraZeneca vaccine early, even though regulators had yet to approve it.
India spent months discussing the final price per dose and inked an initial purchase order roughly two weeks after Indias drug regulator approved the AstraZeneca shot, according to the sources.
At one point, SII ran out of space to store produced doses.
That is why I chose not to pack more than 50 million doses, because I knew if I packed more than that, I would have to store it in my house, SII Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in January.
He said he had spent 20 billion rupees ($272 million) on the 50 million doses that the company started stockpiling since around October.
Even now, the government only makes ad-hoc purchases from SII instead of agreeing a longer-term supply schedule, said one of the sources.
SII has sought more than $400 million from the government to increase capacity, but no commitment has yet been made.
The health department and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on issues of funding, purchasing delays and other aspects of Indias vaccination rollout.
COVAX also did not green-light shipments to participating countries from SII until after the shot received WHO clearance in mid-February, said a source involved in the COVAX initiative.
The source said those delays meant tens of millions of additional doses that the SII could have produced between October and February never materialised.
Gavi defended its decision to wait for proper approvals before going ahead with firm orders.
And while it is looking for more suppliers, it conceded that much still depended on India’s vaccine makers who account for some 60% of global supplies.
COVAX has a deal to buy 1 billion-plus doses from the SII.
But it has received less than a fifth of the 100 million or so doses of the SII-made AstraZeneca vaccine it had expected by May.
SII is also supposed to make millions of doses of the Novavax shot for COVAX.
Gavi had hoped SII would fully resume vaccine deliveries to COVAX in May, but on Wednesday it said India’s COVID-19 crisis could affect that.
We understand the ferocity of the virus in India at the current time, nevertheless we hope and expect deliveries to resume as soon as possible, it said in an email to Reuters.
On Thursday India reported 200 739 infections over the past 24 hours, a seventh daily record in the last eight days, while 1 038 deaths took its toll to 173 123.
Its tally of 14.1 million infections is second only to the United States.
Having originally aimed to cover 300 million of its highest-risk people by August, or just over a fifth of its 1.35 billion population, the government has now expanded that by another 100 million, with the promise to widen it further.
The United States is preparing for the possibility that a booster shot will be needed between nine to 12 months after people are initially vaccinated against COVID-19, a White House official said on Thursday.
While the duration of immunity after vaccination is being studied, booster vaccines could be needed, David Kessler, chief science officer for President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 response task force told a congressional committee meeting.
The current thinking is those who are more vulnerable will have to go first, he said.
Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla said people will likely need a third booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines within 12 months and could need annual shots, CNBC reported based on his comments from April 1, which were made public on Thursday.
Initial data has shown that vaccines from Moderna Inc and partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE retain most of their effectiveness for at least six months, though for how much longer has not been determined.
Even if that protection lasts far longer than six months, experts have said that rapidly spreading variants of the coronavirus and others that may emerge could lead to the need for regular booster shots similar to annual flu shots.
The United States is also tracking infections in people who have been fully vaccinated, Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention told the House subcommittee hearing.
Of 77 million people vaccinated in the United States, there have been 5 800 such breakthrough infections, Walensky said, including 396 people who required hospitalisation and 74 who died.
Walensky said some of these infections have occurred because the vaccinated person did not mount a strong immune response.
But the concern is that in some cases, they are occurring in people infected by more contagious virus variants.
Earlier this month, Pfizer and partner BioNTech said their vaccine was around 91% effective in preventing COVID-19, citing updated trial data that included more than 12 000 people fully inoculated for at least six months.
Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease doctor, hopes US regulators will make a quick decision to lift a pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and get that vaccine back on track, he said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.
His comments come a day after a panel of advisers to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) delayed a vote on whether to resume the J&J shots for at least a week, until it had more data on the risk.
The United States earlier this week decided to pause distribution of the J&J vaccine to investigate six cases of a rare brain blood clot linked with low platelet counts in the blood.
Fauci said the pause was an indication that the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration take safety very seriously.
I hope they make the conclusion of this quickly, and get back on track, he said.
And I believe they will.
Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the White House, said he worried about the effects of a prolonged delay.
The concern is that the longer you draw it out, the more there will be concern about not only that vaccine but it might even have an impact on vaccine hesitancy in general, he said.
Once back on track he said, I think we’ve just got to continue to emphasize that this is a very efficacious vaccine and could be used, and be very, very valuable on the global scene.
The blood clots associated with the J&J vaccine bear close resemblance to cases seen in Europe with the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, and some countries in Europe are already backing away from using both.
Denmark on Wednesday announced it would stop using AstraZenecas vaccine altogether.
Asked if such moves may be premature, Fauci said, I think in many respects it is, at least until countries find out whether or not the events are truly occurring at a higher rate than would normally occur in the population.
The blood clots have not been seen with the Moderna Inc and the BioNTech/Pfizer Inc vaccines, which are made using a different type of technology called mRNA.
Fauci said countries that do not have other options may have to weigh the risks of the vaccine versus the risk of COVID-19, which has also been linked with the same type of brain blood clots.
If you have alternative vaccines, fine, but if you don’t, you may need to say you know, it’s a very, very small risk, he said.
That will be a judgment call that will be made in the future.
South Africa has recorded 1 372 new coronavirus infections in the last 24-hour cycle, taking the total number to 1 562 931.
The country has also recorded 73 new COVID-19 related fatalities on Thursday.
This brings the total number of deaths to 53 571.
Regrettably, we report 73 more COVID-19 related deaths: Eastern Cape 13, Free State 6, Gauteng 16, Kwa-Zulu Natal 20, Limpopo 8, Mpumalanga 4, North-West 0, Northern Cape 1 and Western Cape 5, says Dr Mkhize.
Recoveries stand at 1 488 060.
The cumulative number of tests conducted to date is 10 259 664.
The number of healthcare workers vaccinated under the Sisonke Protocol is 292 623.
As of today, the total number of confirmed COVID19 cases is 1 562 931 the total number of deaths is 53 571 the total number of recoveries is 1 488 060.
Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize has expressed concerns over issues around funding, human resource and leadership in the Eastern Cape Health Department.
He also expressed satisfaction with the turnaround strategy of the Eastern Cape Health Department to improve the quality of health care services but says there are still challenges the province needs to overcome of which stem from poor leadership.
Mkhize was in Gqeberha to assess the provinces state of readiness ahead of the mass vaccination rollout campaign.
The Minister has noted a number of challenges in the provincial Health Department and says it is now time to focus on the basics.
During his visit, Mkhize engaged with various senior officials and stakeholders of the health department.
He has admitted that health services are generally underfunded and that a shift in the demographic of diseases and an increase in population calls for a review.
There is a challenge of funding across the Eastern Cape, and we have gone through that.
There is also the issue of human resources, issues of weaknesses in leadership, management, and there are also issues that relate to the infrastructure and as a result, you are finding a lot of gaps.
In the process of discussing it is clear that generally, health services are underfunded, they do need a lot of increase.
Minister Mkhize briefs media after visiting Eastern Cape health facilities.
Healthcare workers, affiliated with Nehawu, protested ahead of Mkhizes visit.
The union has expressed concerns over workers that have not yet gone back to work, following an extension of their contracts.
They are also demanding a salary increase.
Addressing the workers, Regional Secretary, Sweetness Sitokwe, says their demands were being ignored.
We are demanding these posts, the healthcare workers who have been exploited; paid R3 500 without benefits we are demanding their permanence.
This is a struggle we are not willing to give up comrades.
We will not rest of Nehawu until we are paid our increment.
It can’t be that everything else is increasing in the country, but our salaries are not increasing, says Sitokwe.
Eastern Cape Health MEC, Nomakhosazana Meth, maintains that contracts for the workers who stepped in during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic have been extended.
We still maintain that those contract workers who are falling under EPW, their contracts were extended as from the first of April, even though there were some delays that made the others to start the following week.
We still maintain that even those extended for three months their contracts are extended, says Meth.
Mkhize has also applauded the work done in the Dora Nginza hospital, where he handed over a refurbished maternity ward.
He says this stems from the solid partnerships the department has established.
Four people died in Italy from rare blood clots after they received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, a report from the AIFA national pharmaceutical agency said on Thursday.
The AIFA report said various side-effects were seen following 0.5% of the 9.07 million doses administered between December 27 and March 26, with all three vaccines so far used, by manufacturers Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna, reported to have triggered unwelcome reactions.
Severe side-effects were registered in 0.04% of cases.
Mild side-effects have been reported after use of all three vaccines, the AIFA report said, adding most involved flu-like symptoms, pain in the injection site and tiredness.
Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations last month when blood clot concerns surfaced.
It has since resumed them for those aged 60 and above after EU regulators said the benefits outweighed the risks.
AIFA said there had been 11 cases in Italy of people developing one of two types of blood clots following their AstraZeneca shot cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombosis involving multiple blood vessels.
Four of the 11 died, it said.
AstraZeneca has said it is working to understand individual cases and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events.
Communications and Digital Technology Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, says the digital college at Lenyenye township, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, will help improve the digital divide in the country.
The college, the first of its kind in the province,is aimed at teaching young rural communities digital technology, such as coding and robotics.
One of the children we found is building a robotic car that uses sensors.
Anderson Sibanda from Lenyenye Primary School, says, My name is Anderson Sibanda.
When I grow up, I want to be an IT specialist.
Right now, I am creating a robotic car.
It’s a car that uses batteries as electricity.
Other unemployed young people from villages around Lenyenye are also learning about things such as cybersecurity and digital project management.
I am learning at Cisco Networking Academy, which will be able to equip me with technology.
It is going to help me to find jobs and to pursue my career, says one youth.
I am Nosike Shai from Pharare Village.
I am studying Project Management and will help me to find a job.
A representative of the Belgium Embassy in South Africa, Dr Geraldine Reymenants says the South African economic challenges can also be solved by supporting small business enterprises investing in the digital economy.
The government of Flanders (Flemish Region of Belgium) has funded the newly-opened digital college in Lenyenye to the tune of R1.5million.
Speaking during the opening of the Vexos park Tzaneen Digital College, Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams says the country needs to invest in the digital economy for its economic standing in the global world.
(The) President recently announced that the only way to improve our economy is through investment in the digital economy and the fact of it is the vision for digital skills.
And he talked about involving young children at a tender stage.
More digital colleges will, in future, be opened across the country.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says it is monitoring updates from the US and South Africa over analysis being done on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
Africa CDC says it continues to recommend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to countries across the continent as the jabs benefits outweigh the risks.
I want to clarify that the process of acquiring vaccines are from limited sources.
If you look at the countries that are contributing more than 60% of the cases, they include SA, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Egypt, he adds.
AU says AstraZeneca vaccine benefits outweigh risks.
On vaccine production on the continent, Nkengasong says a task team is due to be set up to determine the way forward.
The CDC says five centres will be developed across the continent over the next 15 years aiming to manufacture 60% of all vaccines to be used in African countries.
We really hope that the momentum that we have will enable us to use an approach to engage with 5 regions in a way that we set up the appropriate vaccine manufacturing sites.
Our target is simple that in the next 20 years we should be able to move away from 99% of our vaccines to importing only 40%.
We should be able to manufacture about 60 per cent of our vaccines over a 20 year period of time, he says.
Communications and Digital Technology Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, is expected to officially open a digital institution, Vexospark Tzaneen Digital College, in Lenyenye township outside Tzaneen in Limpopo.
The initiative is aimed at taking digital technology to rural communities as part of efforts to close the digital gender divide.
Depression is one of the leading causes of ill health worldwide, and existing treatments are often ineffective or have adverse side effects that lead patients to stop taking them.
Mental health is the second pandemic after COVID-19: Sadag
Carhart-Harris warned that while these findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine were encouraging, patients with depression should not try to self-medicate with magic mushrooms.
That would be an error of judgment, he said.
The research involved 59 patients with moderate to severe depression who got either a high dose of psilocybin and a placebo, or escitalopram plus a dose of psilocybin so low as to be classed as non-active and unlikely to have an effect.
This design was aimed at ensuring the two arms of the trial were as alike as possible for those taking part.
Carhart-Harris said participants reports suggested the psilocybin had a more fundamental effect than antidepressants.
I think it’s getting more at the root causes of suffering, he said.
The Imperial team, co-led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology, has been exploring the potential of psilocybin for many years.
In 2016, they published a small study showing psilocybin could help ease a severe condition known as treatment-resistant depression.
Members of a US health panel on Wednesday voiced concern over resuming vaccinations with Johnson & Johnsons COVID-19 shot, even as a US Food and Drug Administration scientist said warnings could mitigate the risk of rare but serious blood clots.
The panel is reviewing six reported cases of rare brain blood clots in women who received the J&J vaccine, a day after federal regulators paused its use to assess the issue.
South Africa has recorded 1 599 new coronavirus infections in the last 24-hour cycle, taking the total number to 1 561 559.
The country has also recorded 75 new COVID-19 related fatalities on Wednesday.
This brings the total number of deaths to 53 498.
On 3 May, we will receive 325 260 vaccines, says Mkhize.
Yesterday, the Health Minister said the country is temporarily halting the use of the J&J vaccine due to cases of blood clotting reported in the US.
Government pauses Johnson Johnson vaccine rollout.
Mkhize also called on the public not to panic following the announcement that the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson has been suspended in South Africa
Mkhize says the issue will be cleared in a few days’ time, Its precautionary halting.
Its not like we are closing down on Johnson and Johnson.
As soon as the information is made available, we are quite certain that we should move on.
It might take a couple of days to resume but at this point, we think it might be the best way to deal with it.
The Co-Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19, Barry Schoub, has sought to explain potential reasons behind the rare occurrence of blood clots forming following the administering of a vaccine.
This after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)said that six cases of rare blood clotting were detected, following the rollout of more than6.8million doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
South Africa has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country.
Nearly 300000 healthcare workers have already received the one-shot vaccine in SA.
Schoub says investigations are ongoing to determine whether there is the possibility of the vaccine causing blood clots.
There is the one thing that is being investigated, both the AstraZeneca and J&J are using what is called the Adenovirus vector, which is fairly harmless and is quite prevalent and that is used to carry the gene, or the vector, which is used to stimulate the immune response for protection.
It is that particular vector that seeks to carry the Adenovirus which is being looked at.
Could that possibly be what is triggering these clots?
But I must emphasize that at this stage, there is no evidence that these clots are related to the vaccine.
This is just something that is being investigated at the moment.
Experts unpack South Africa’s halting for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.
FDA findings are not supposed to be taken lightly.
Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says that findings of the FDA in recommending that the J&J COVID-19 vaccine rollout be halted must not be taken lightly.
After this advisory came to my attention, I held urgent consultations with our scientists, who have advised that we cannot take the decision made by the FDA lightly.
Based on their advice, we have determined to voluntarily suspend our rollout until the causal relationship between the development of clots and the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is sufficiently interrogated, he adds.
Mkhize says the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) will gather information from J&J, FDA and other regulatory bodies to thoroughly assess the situation before advising government regarding the vaccine.
Mkhize hopes suspension of the rollout is temporary.
The US Centres for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices is expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss these developments, while the FDA launches an investigation.
Both agencies say its important for the healthcare provider community to be aware of the potential for these adverse events.
SABC News Correspondent Sherwin Bryce-Pease unpacks the decision by the USA to suspend the roll out of the Johnson &JohnsonCOVID-19 vaccine.
The role of SAHPRA as the regulatory authority is to look at the safety, quality and efficacy of all medicines in the public interest and safety is always at the top of that list.
That is why we are paying attention globally to any safety signals at all and being very cautious.
We will have a discussion once we understood whether there is a causal link with these rare side effects or there is not, says Professor Rees.
SAMA supports decision to halt rollout.
Meanwhile, South African Medical Association (SAMA) Chairperson Dr Angelique Coetzee says, Yes, it is good for the minister to temporarily halt the vaccination rollout for at least 24-48 hours while we gather some more information.
One also needs to look at the six people who claimed it was due to the J&J vaccine out of more than six million.
In medicine terms, that is a very small number.
One needs to always measure it up to what is for the better, added Coetzee.
Dr Angelique Coetzee on Morning Live.
Mkhize has called on the public not to panic following the announcement that the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson has been suspended in South Africa.
EFF Calls For Immediate Halt
One of the women died and another one is in critical condition in hospital.
An outbreak of Avian influenza has been detected on a chicken farm in Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, where around 300 birds died.
Spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Reggie Ngcobo, says samples were sent to Onderstepoorts Veterinary Research facility and tested positive for the H5 strain of Avian flu.
He says the commercial chicken-layer farm was also part of the H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in 2017.
The outbreak caused poultry farmers to cull millions of birds and prompted neighbouring countries including Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to ban poultry imports from South Africa.
Ngcobo says the farm has been placed under quarantine.
He says veterinary authorities are investigating the extent of the outbreak and the nature of the pathogen.
We urge our people to (remain) calm.
There is no need for panic.
We urge our farmers as well as those who keep birds for hobbies or in zoos.
Keep birds away from areas that are visited by wild birds, control access of people that come in, in their bird houses, avoid provision of water and food in a way that attracts wild birds.
The Department is currently working on making sure that we get the result and then we will be able to advise accordingly, adds Ngcobo.
Ex-combatants from liberation movements affiliated to different political parties are playing a significant role in fighting poverty through agricultural programmes in the Eastern Capes O R Tambo region.
They are working on eight hectares of land that produces quality potatoes at kwaMbiza village outside Ngqeleni.
Through the municipality’s financial injection, the project has also created jobs for the unemployed youth.
OR Tambo Mayor, Thokozile Sokhanyile, has described this as an outstanding project.
It’s a project that is meant for those people that were fighting for this freedom and those people are from the military’s veterans of the MK, SANDF and the others whereby, we have said that they must come up with the project and they came up with these potatoes, says Sokhanyile.
Such projects assist with food security.
Those involved in this project say feeding the poor is their priority.
Jongilizwe Mpokwana, one of them, says, Since we are the former soldiers, when we came back from the bush we learnt something, like to produce some potatoes.
So far, we are happy we learnt.
I am very much happy.
Xoliswa Mpongwana’s late father spent years in exile.
He also played a part in the formation of the potato co-operative before he passed on.
Mpongwana says at least her father left them with skills to till the land.
So far, I have learnt that utilising the soil is much better because there are no more jobs now.
People have lost jobs due to COVID-19.
So, by using this soil, which our father left us with, I think we are going to live for the future, she says.
The participants in the project aim to get into commercial farming.
Mayor Sokhanyile says, locally, the market is doing well as potatoes are in demand.
After reaping these potatoes, they will go to the fresh Kie produce market, where they would be sorted and washed and there is a market already.
There are people who are going to take these potatoes.
So, even the village here, the people are assisting and they are going to get skills necessary, adds the Mayor.
The former freedom fighters want to venture into commercial farming and are hoping for more land to realise their dream amid fencing, transport and farming equipment challenges.
Authorities have made it mandatory for all people entering the area to take COVID-19 tests.
But many devotees on Sunday gathered by the river without masks, in densely packed crowds.
Chinas top disease control official has said the country is formally considering mixing COVID-19 vaccines, as a way of further boosting vaccine efficacy.
Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.
The currently available vaccines don’t have very high rates of protection, Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday.
Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered, he said.
A COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinas Sinovac was found to have an efficacy rate of slightly above 50% in Brazilian clinical trials.
A separate study in Turkey said it was 83.5% effective.
No detailed efficacy data has been released on a vaccines made by Chinas Sinopharm.
It has said two vaccines developed by its units are 79.4% and 72.5% effective respectively, based on interim results.
Both vaccine makers have presented data on their COVID-19 vaccines indicating levels of efficacy in line with those required by the World Health Organization, a WHO panel said in March.
China has shipped millions of its vaccines abroad, and officials and state media have fiercely defended the shots while calling into question the safety and logistics capabilities of other vaccines.
Health Minister Zweli Mkhize recently announced that the country has secured more than 50-million vaccine doses from pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.
Delivery is expected to begin later this month.
More than 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines secured for SA.
SAHPRAs Chairperson Professor Helen Rees says the side effects are extremely rare.
I think people desperately want to get back to normal.
They want to have their normal social life back and we are not going to be able to do that
We are going to be sitting with masks and distancing and limited numbers in facilities if we don’t get the vaccine out there.
What we are saying to everyone is we are monitoring for rare side effects.
Will we see a few?
Probably with the different vaccines we might do well, but to emphasize, they are extremely rare and what we talk about then is benefit-risk to protect the community and to get society back going again
What is that benefit versus the risk of these extremely rare side effects?
Update on the investigation into the use of AstraZeneca vaccine: Stuart Smith
Over 100-million vaccine doses have been administered across the Asian country by the end of March this year.
Former KwaZulu-Natal journalist Zanele Buthelezi who now lives in Beijing, China, received her jab recently.
She spoke to SABC News reporter, Genevieve Lanka, about the strides the country has made in nearly eradicating its local coronavirus transmissions.
Wuhan marks a year since hard lockdown
In January 2020, when news that there was an outbreak of a novel virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan dominated headlines, Zanele was on holiday in Durban.
It was on the news and seeing all the major mainstream media houses reporting on this virus that has been raging in China, I left scared like because I still had to go back to China at that time.
Getting to my apartment I had to take like a 40-day quarantine period and being in the house, but then I ran out of food.
So I had a lot of anxiety at the beginning of COVID-19 here in China.
At the start of the pandemic in the country, China responded with a strong arm.
A year later, Zanele says the city is thriving.
And now the reports that we are getting from that City is that its a vibrant city, people have come back, the tourists have come back, businesses have reopened.
China started its vaccination programme in December 2020.
The country has set up over 74 000 vaccination sites in 15 regions.
Zanele is among the millions of residents who have received the COVID-19 vaccination.
She, together with a group of foreign nationals, were allowed to vaccinate in Beijing this week.
Zanele says the process was simple and efficient.
It started with just confirming your information, checking your social security card, where they took down all your details.
Then we had to sign the consent form which informs you of the risks and it tells you that the vaccine that you are about to receive, the case we were about to receive and in this case we were getting the sinovac vaccine, which is developed here in China.
All of the vaccines that are being administered are being developed here in China.
China is using two types of vaccines in its rollout programme sinovac and sinopharm.
Both have been developed in China.
Debates around the safety and efficacy of vaccines have not evaded Zanele, however, she says there is a different kind of anxiety involved when you face the jab.
I was a little bit anxious.
I am not a fan of needles.
I do brave it out, you know when I have to.
Ya, I didn’t even feel the injection going in.
I looked away
I didn’t even feel it because it was so small, it was quick.
Not a lot of bleeding and I didnt feel any pain I must say when the doctor or when the health care worker administered the vaccine in my arm.
Zanele says observation is an important part of the process, and health care workers are on hand to monitor any possible side effects.
After getting the shot, we had to go to an observation area across from where you get your shot.
You go and sit for about thirty minutes, where they are just observing you and monitoring whether you are having any adverse reactions to the vaccine or not.
Most of the people there were just sitting.
There weren’t any reactions to the vaccine from my observation as I was sitting for that thirty minutes that I had to wait.
There were a lot of I guess volunteers, medical doctors around so we were being monitored I guess, properly.
People were answering your questions when you had questions.
Before leaving the massive vaccination camp, Zanele was given a strict set of protocols.
They just said avoid alcohol, don’t consume any alcohol, which is easy for me because I don’t drink alcohol.
Also, don’t eat spicy food and seafood.
Not to take a shower for the next 24hours.
I just had to brave it out with the sweat and everything, because people were a little sweaty.
China has made significant strides in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders.
By April 9th, only 14 cases were reported all of which from international travellers.
Zanele says this success is attributed to both the governments swift and hard response, and the compliance of its citizenry.
We may have looked at those measures as being you know, cruel or very harsh.
But it shows that the intention was that to control the pandemic and make sure that it does not spread too far out of that particular area.
Another thing that worked was the compliance that the Chinese people showed at that time.
They were willing to listen to what the government was saying and they stayed in their homes.
Reporting by Genevieve Lanka
A magnitude 5.9 earthquake off Indonesia’s Java Island on Saturday killed one person and damaged buildings in several cities, media reports said.
The quake was felt in cities and towns across East Java, home to 40.7 million people, and nearby provinces, including the resort island of Bali, Indonesian media reported.
One person died in Lumajang after being hit by a falling boulder, news website Detik.com said, citing a town disaster official.
Reports of damage included parliamentary buildings, a school, a hospital and houses in several cities, while a large gorilla statue in an amusement park in the town of Batu lost its head.
The national disaster agency said authorities were still taking stock of the damage.
The quake struck in the Indian Ocean 91 km (57 miles) off the southern coast of East Java.
It had a magnitude of 5.9 at a depth of 96 km, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said, after initially saying the magnitude was 6.8.
Video shared by social media users showed people running out of a shopping mall in Malang city amid the strong tremor.
I felt the earthquake twice, the first time for two seconds and then it stopped, but then it shook again for five seconds, Edo Afizal, a receptionist at a hotel in Blitar, told Reuters by phone.
As of today, the total number of confirmed #COVID19 cases is 1 556 242 the total number of deaths is 53 226 the total number of recoveries is 1 481 637 and the total number of vaccines administered is 288 368.
Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Thembi Siweya, says she is satisfied with the rolling out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in Mpumalanga.
Siweya visited the Shongwe Hospital to monitor the state of readiness for Phase 2 of the provinces vaccination programme.
She was accompanied by the MEC for Health, Sasekani Manzini.
Shongwe Hospital is one of the COVID-19 vaccination sites in Mpumalanga.
Currently, the programme is focusing on frontline workers.
About 16 000 of the more than 51 000 healthcare workers in the province have been vaccinated so far.
The province is waiting for more vaccines so it can continue with the first phase of the programme.
Most of the frontline workers have welcomed the programme and they say the vaccination will ease their anxiety of contracting COVID-19.
Mpumalanga has so far recorded more than 64 000 COVID -19 cases with more than 1 300 fatalities.
I am very much delighted although sometimes there is that fear about the side effects.
I have seen some of my colleagues.
They have (been) vaccinated and there are no side effects.
I am willing to take that risk.
We are very grateful for the vaccination, because we work in very difficult conditions.
Sometimes, patients arrives in critical conditions.
This thing is good, because we can protect ourselves and family as well, the healthcare workers say.
The province has so far received more than 17 000 vaccines.
Manzini says more sites are being opened in preparation for Phase 2 of the programme.
We managed to vaccinate 16 624.
We are planning to put more sites in the province because so far, we are left with 941 vaccines, that we are busy with.
The sites that are left include Evander, and Kwamhlanga.
We are also opening other sites at Embuleni and Themba Hospital, says the MEC.
While expressing satisfaction with how the programme is proceeding so far, Deputy Minister Siweya also acknowledged that more resources are needed.
I am very much impressed (with) the fact that they were able to designate a site and say this is going to be the vaccination site.
If you are coming to the vaccination there is a different entrance; there is a separation between your normal patients and these ones.
We are really impressed, she says.
The presidency is monitoring the COVID-19 vaccination programme across the country.
Currently, the COVID-19 cases worldwide stand at over 134.5 million with more than 108.3 million recoveries and deaths at 2 915 013 million.
In South Africa, the number of confirmed cases has surpassed the 1.5 million mark, whilst the death toll has risen to 53 173.
South Africa has the capacity and the scientific muscle to develop its own COVID-19 treatments.
This emerged during a webinar on the role of scientific research in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
The webinar was attended by the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) and the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA).
Department of Science and Innovation Director-General, Dr Phil Mjwara, says he hopes an announcement will be made in the next 18 months on how far it is in terms of ensuring locally-manufactured vaccines.
Dr. Mjwara says it is important to bring together government departments and agencies in order to provide opportunities for the department to better coordinate and communicate complex data sets and analytics.
SAHPRA Chief Executive Officer, Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela says they support the initiative for locally manufactured COVID-19 vaccines.
I do think also that the country has seen this pandemic as an opportunity really, to have a very clear national strategic intent for us to build this capacity and that’s a key element.
There’s clearly political will.
There is clearly support from the national government.
There is clearly support from us as a regulator, she says.
The SAHPRA says it is currently reviewing Sputnik V, SinoVac, and other vaccines for approval for COVID-19.
South Africa is currently vaccinating healthcare workers with the approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Over 200 000 people have been vaccinated so far.
Of the people who were vaccinated, about 17 have reported a COVID-19 positive test and that’s after about 14 days post-vaccination.
We haven’t done a full analysis yet.
We review results every week, we have passed the halfway mark.
What we really want to show through this study is how does it work in a real-life setting in the field.
It prevents you from getting severe disease, almost an 85% protection against severe disease and then it offers 100% protection against death, says Goga.
About 80% of people have reported the usual reactogenicity side effects that we would expect; fever, headaches, body aches, muscle aches, so these are flu-like symptoms.
We would expect those symptoms.
We have had a few other side effects like vasovagal attacks where people have fainted.
We have not seen many, one or two people.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) has defended its officers saying they could have been on the scene of the alleged mob justice incident in Zandspruit, north of Johannesburg, earlier had the community not prevented them from getting there.
Earlier a community leader said the incident could have been averted had police responded swiftly.
Community leader in Zandspruit in Gauteng describes as shocking, alleged mob justice incident which left 4 men dead and 5 others critically injured.
Themba Mchunu says police could have done more to avert death of the men who were beaten to death and set alight by some residents.
The incident left four men dead and five others critically injured in the informal settlement on Wednesday.
This after, angry residents took nine young men to a local sports ground and beat them up after accusing them of terrorising the community.
The residents also set the men alight.
It’s alleged that about 200 people from the Zandspruit informal settlement attacked a group of 9 boys that they had suspected of robbing people in the area,
Police spokesperson, Kay Makhubele says there is no excuse.
The sector vehicle indeed went to the scene after they called and about 200 people stoned the vehicle and it made a U-turn and called a backup thats when people disperse from the ground.
If the police are not responding we have got a protocol to follow, if they are not getting help from the police they must go to the station commander and talk to him or the district commander.
So they cannot give excuses of killing people because police are not responding.
Professor Goga says, in South Africa, people have implemented behavioural changes for the betterment of their future health.
It has taken a pandemic to teach us that health is not just the absence of disease.
It is a state of social, physical and social well-being.
It has taken a pandemic to show us that health is inter-connected.
No one is healthy until everybody is healthy.
Health for all is something we really need to strive for.
We have not attained it yet.
The country has also recorded 37 new COVID-19-related fatalities on Tuesday.
This brings the total number of deaths to 53 032.
Recoveries currently stand at 1 478 820.
The cumulative number of tests conducted to date is 9 995 431.

DA Member of Parliament and Spokesperson on Health, Siviwe Gwarube, says the SAHRC must investigate, what she terms, governments failure to uphold the rights of South Africans.
According to the Health Department, over 272 000 healthcare workers in the country have been vaccinated thus far.
Some experts say the country will need up to as many as 250 000 vaccines every single day over the next three to four months to meet its inoculation target.
Professor Tulio de Oliveira from the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform says the country needs to quickly move towards vaccinating the general population.
The Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, and WHO Director in Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, will host a World Health Day webinar.
The webinar is aimed at creating awareness about the health inequities and strengthen efforts towards more inclusive approach for Universal Health Coverage and health security in South Africa.
Dr Zweli Mkhize says a million Johnson & Johnson vaccines to arrive in April
Winde says, I [we] need to have many more vaccines so we can get back to work.
Of course, it is a competitive place as we as a province are trying to procure our own vaccines.
At the end of the month, we had 28 companies and wholesalers that we contacted.
I suppose we use the Sisonke programme to see our readiness.
We are expecting another 30 000 vaccines now as part of the J&J rollout.
Thousands of people have flocked back home after spending time at various holiday destinations over the weekend.
Epidemiologist, Dr Jo Barnes, says the extensive movement of people may have caused the further spread of COVID-19.
Please be a responsible citizen and watch out for any symptoms.
If you feel even slightly fluish, try and isolate yourself and have the least amount of contact with other people and have yourself tested.
Mokonyane describes Mofokengs passing as a great loss.
Firstly, condolences to the Mofokeng and Moseneke family.
We are here as the members of the ANC, ANC Women’s League to pay our respect on the sudden departure of comrade Jacqui and her loving daughter Thato.
Unfortunately, we can’t actually give her the send-off that we would have all loved to give her.
We are here now to just say to the family we are with you.
When the right time comes as in line with the family request we will come back and celebrate the good times and the fond memories we have of comrade Jacqui, she says
ANC Women’s League leader, Bathabile Dlamini, says Mofokeng leaves behind a lasting legacy.
She also turned around the campaign on violence against women.
The family says Mofokeng was not that ill.
She was due to finish her quarantine period the following day when she was found dead at her home.
The family says she did not take well to the passing of her only child Thato.
Family spokesperson, Thoko Moloto says the family is still coming to terms with the double tragedy
As you can understand it’s very difficult for the family and it’s been a double blow.
It was hard enough for the family to accept Thato’s passing but then to accept that of Jacqui was a, for a lack of better word, a blow, a double blow.
I don’t know what’s going to take for the family to come to terms with what has just hit us.
Mofokeng will be buried tomorrow in Pretoria, while her daughter will be cremated on Wednesday
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent investigation into allegations that Defence and Military Veterans Minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, wasted millions of taxpayers’ money on chartered flights and luxury accommodation.

Political analyst Moeletsi Mbeki says South Africa needs a review of governance to fully realise the meaning of democracy to the benefit of all in the country
Mbeki asserts that for many South Africans, democracy has proved to be an illusion.
The Deputy Chair of the South African Institute of International Affairs view is that discouragement is also shown in the poor voter turnout.
Mbeki dissects his Business Day article on problems bedevilling the country’s democracy ahead of the Freedom Day commemorations on Tuesday.
The African National Congress (ANC) North West Interim Provincial Committee (IPC ) has called on former premier and party provincial chairperson, Supra Mahumapelo, to refrain from contravening the party’s constitution.
Mahumapelo is currently attending a disciplinary hearing alongside ANC Woman’s League Secretary, Bitsang Lenkopane, for allegedly holding a meeting in Mareetsane near where the IPC had organised an event.
Yesterday, Mahumapelo told branch delegates in Delareyville that he believed the process was aimed at damaging his reputation.
Spokesperson for the ANC IPC, Kenny Morolong, however, says Mahumapelo has no regard for the party’s constitution.
This comrade undermines the decision and the directives of the IPC and the NEC
He has absolutely no regards for the ANC constitution, he has no regard for the ANC structures.
His recent rents justify why the IPC decided to subject him to the disciplinary processes.
Comrade Mahumapelo without him the ANC of his imagination cannot be led.
We wish to issue a stand warning that we will not be held at ransom, adds Morolong.
During his address to his supporters yesterday, Mahumapelo accused the ANC of violating the Constitution, saying some of the party’s resolutions are in conflict with the law.
Supra Mahumapelo briefs branches on recent suspension of a number of prominent ANC members.
African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has lashed out at the Democratic Alliance (DA) for saying changing street names is a waste of taxpayers’ money.
Duarte and ANC Women’s League members have signed a petition to change William Nicole Drive in Fourways, north of Johannesburg, to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Drive.
They have gathered at the biggest intersection of William Nicole Drive and the N1 Pretoria Road, where are they are lobbying for support for the name change.
Comrade Jessie Duarte leads the mobilisation of communities in Gauteng in support of changing the name of William Nicol Drive to Winnie Madikizela Mandela Drive & the launch of an online petition for the name change.
The DA has launched an online petition to oppose the timing of the renaming, saying it will be a costly undertaking amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Addressing the crowd earlier, Duarte said: The DA’s four thousand signatures against millions of people, let’s see who will actually come out better.
The people of South Africa will change this road to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
ANCWL lobbies support for the renaming of William Nicol Drive.
They have gathered at the biggest intersection of William Nicole Drive and the N1 Pretoria Road, where are they are lobbying for support for the name change.
Addressing a crowd earlier, Duarte said: Many people who live here are very comfortable, nothing has changed for them.
But we are going to change this road, we are calling this road, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Road.
We have to challenge the fact that we need to make sure that our economy is driven by black South Africans.
It isn’t right that there’s still an economy that is still in the hands of a minority, explains Duarte.
Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina has called on the ANC National Executive Committee to rethink the step aside resolution.
ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule is facing corruption, fraud and money laundering charges linked to a multi-million-rand contract to remove asbestos roofing from houses when he Free State premier.
Magashule is one of ANC leaders who have until the end of this month to step aside until their corruption cases are finalised.
In his address to the media on the sidelines of the ANC Cadres Regional Assembly in Alberton on Sunday, Masina said Magashule should be given a chance to state his case.
Comrade Ace has not been found guilty.
I believe he must be given an opportunity to be heard and for his case to be listened to. I don’t believe that we must fire leaders on Zoom.
The leadership must sit down, and they must engage because the outcome of Nasrec can never be ignored, said Masina.
Meanwhile, the ANC in Ekurhuleni says it fears that the step-aside policy will plunge the organisation into chaos.
There’s also a concern the resolution will create problems for councillor selection in branch meetings.
The Fezile Dabi District Municipality says it will interdict the ANC if Magashule steps aside.
Branches in the region have gone a step further by accusing the NEC of being selective in the implementation of the step-aside resolution.
Regional Convener Jabu Sigasa says branches want an urgent National General Council to deliberate on Magashule’s future.
The African National Congress (ANC) Fezile Dabi regional co-ordinator in the Free State, Reagan Booysen’s, says they have consulted all the ANC branches in the province in making sure that the party’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, gets the maximum support that Booysens says he deserves.
region says it will interdict the ANC’s National Executive Committees (NEC) stance on the step aside resolution.
This comes as the 30-day period during which Magashule must step aside fast runs out.
Magashule is facing corruption charges among others.
Addressing the media in Parys, Booysens said: We are going to interdict that [step aside] thing, we just waiting for the due date, and we are going to interdict that decision.
Former African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson and Premier of the North West, Supra Mahumapelo, says the ANC is violating the constitution.
Mahumaphelo says some of the party’s resolutions are in conflict with the law.
Addressing ANC branch members in Delareyville, Mahumapelo called on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party to intervene.
The suspended Mahumapelo was referring to the so-called step-aside resolution, which orders ANC leaders accused of corruption or serious crimes to voluntarily step aside.
Some parts of the resolutions are in conflict with the law and life must go on.
In my own view as SOR Mahumapelo from ward 6,7,12, I’m saying part of that resolution in conflict with the law must be suspended until we go to the next national conference, he says.
Mahumapelo says they have applied for the suspension to be set aside.
Mahumapelo added that suspending the step-aside resolution will lead to proper engagement between members of the ANC.
If you suspend parts of the resolution which are in conflict with the law, the ANC is achieving two things: 1) it is complying with its resolution, at the same time, it is complying with the law of the republic.
What you must do then is that people who are accused, who are arrested, the leadership must come then and master the art of the necessary political engagement.
Mahumapelo was temporarily suspended from the ANC last week for contradicting the North West Interim Provincial Committee, who had ordered the Mayor of JB Marks Local Municipality Mayor to resign over corruption charges.
His disciplinary hearing is set down for Monday and Tuesday.
Mahumapelo briefs branches on recent suspension of a number of prominent ANC members.
Politically and legally embattled African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s home region Fezile Dabi says it will interdict the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) if Magashule steps aside.
Magashule is one of ANC leaders who have until the end of this month to step aside until their corruption cases are finalised.
The Regional Task team says it has consulted branches on the political tussles in the ANC and Magashule’s future.
The majority of the branches say the ANC must be served with an interdict to prevent Magashule from stepping aside as he faces fraud, corruption and money laundering charges.
Branches of the ANC gave the RTT a mandate, the leadership must ensure that such a mandate is implemented.
We just waiting for the due date and we are going to interdict that decision because we know the decisions we took at Nasrec and braches are talking about interdicting because of the decisions they took, says Deputy Regional Coordinator, Reagan Booysens.
Branches in Fezile Dabi have gone a step further by accusing the ANC NEC of being selective in the implementation of the step-aside resolution.
Regional Convener, Jabu Sigasa, says branches want an urgent National General Council to deliberate on Magashule’s future
We are calling for an urgent NGC to sit where ANC branches will be consulted on this step-aside.
The Fezile Dabi Region has also endorsed the Provincial Chairperson Sam Mashinini’s decision to appeal the Supreme Court judgment disbanding the Provincial Executive Committee.
Former ANC chairperson and North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has arrived at the Delareyville Town Hall where he is set to brief branches about his suspension and that of other prominent ANC members by the party’s Interim Provincial Committee (IPC).
He is joined by ANC Women’s League Provincial Secretary, Bitsa Lenkopane, who is also facing disciplinary charges.
Mahumapelo’s ANC membership was suspended earlier in the week after he allegedly told JB Marks Local Municipality Mayor Kgotso Khumalo, not to step aside over the fraud and corruption cloud that’s hanging over his head.
Mahumapelo’s supporters cry foul following his suspension.
Mahumapelo is a Member of Parliament and is one of five other North West ANC members, including Premier Job Mokgoro, who are facing a DC in the province.
Mokgoro has, however, indicated that he will not form part of todays meeting.
The Premier had his ANC membership suspended for allegedly going against the mandate of the ANC when voting for a new chair of chairs in the provincial legislature.
The KwaZulu-Natal government says it is accelerating its COVID-19 vaccination drive and that its on course to reach its target, having vaccinated more than 50 000 healthcare workers in both private and public hospitals.
Premier Sihle Zikalala made the announcement in Durban on Sunday.
Zikalala is confident that by the end of Phase 2 of the vaccination programme at the end of September, the province would have vaccinated about three million people.
KwaZulu-Natal has over 90 vaccination sites and more than 7 000 people who are trained to administer the shots
The province has identified mass vaccination centres in Pietermaritzburg and Durban
Its target is to conduct 30 vaccinations per week.
The KwaZulu-Natal club gave the PSL until 10am to respond or face legal action and as things stand, it the league has now given in to the pressure.
The league was quick to point on that the postponement was not an admission that Royal AM was correct in their interpretation of the Nyathi ruling.
The leagues legal representatives have now responded to the Royal AM, stating that there seems to be a dispute regarding the order by Judge Nyathi on Monday.
Our client adopts the former interpretation, and your client adopts the latter interpretation.
The league has stated that it intends to apply to the High Court on an urgent basis for a declaratory order on the Judge Nyathi order and its suspension.
In order to resolve the dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the Nyathi J order, our client intends to apply today to the High Court on an urgent basis for an order declaring that section 18(1) applies so that the operation and execution of the Nyathi AJ order was suspended by its application for leave to appeal.
In the alternative, our client will ask that the operation and execution of the Nyathi J order be suspended in terms of section 18(2).
The founding papers will be served on your client, via email to your offices as attorneys of record in the matter, as soon as possible during the course of the day.
On Saturday, judgment was handed in the much-anticipated Glad Africa Championship promotion case involving Sekhukhune United, Polokwane City and Royal AM, at the Johannesburg High Court.
The counterclaim to review the arbitration award given by Epstein SC on 19 May 2021 is dismissed, read in part the High Court order.
Following that match, which they lost 1-0,Ba Bina Noko, as Sekhukhune United are affectionately known,lodged a complaint with the PSL DC, complaining that City had failed to include five Under-23 players on their team sheet, as per the PSL rules.
While the PSL DC found Polokwane City guilty and deducted the three points they had irregularly secured against Sekhukhune, they decided not to award those point to the opposing team, as it had done so in similar previous cases.
This prompted Ba Bina Noko to lodge an appeal against the PSL DCs decision, the results of which was a decision by arbitration toward the three points and three goals to United, a few days before the final round of matches which would decide which team between Royal AM and United would gain straight promotion to the DSTV Premiership.
However, the PSL Executive Committee, subsequently, challenged the decision by arbitration, refusing to award the points and the goals to Sekhukhune United.
The decision was to the benefit of Royal AM who went into their final match against Cape Town All-Stars at the top of the first division log.
They went on to win their final match after being awarded a much-talked-about soft penalty in the final stage of their decisive match even though the PSL didn’t hand the trophy and medal citing that they had been served with court papers.
Major tournament debutants North Macedonia are under no pressure to reach the Euro 2020 last 16 ahead of their pivotal Group C clash with Ukraine on Thursday, coach Igor Angelovski said.
Both teams are looking for their first wins after the Ukrainians conceded a late goal in a 3-2 defeat by the Netherlands while North Macedonia lost 3-1 to Austria.
It’s like a final for both sides
We too came here hoping to advance to the business end of the competition and we have to stay focused.
We’re mixing it with Europe’s best teams.
Angelovski remained tight-lipped about possible changes to the starting line-up and formation.
A thin bench does not give him too many options, although Ivan Trickovski could be preferred to Aleksandar Trajkovski up front.
Defender Stefan Ristovski said team spirit was still high.
We can’t let one defeat sink our mood and being in the Euros for the first time.
There isn’t much time for misery or celebrations whatever happens, he said.
We are heading into a tough game and well need to produce a top performance to stand any chance of winning.
Defensively, two echelons will be required to thwart Ukraines attack.
North Macedonia play the Netherlands in their final group match in Amsterdam on Monday while Ukrainetake on Austria in Bucharest.
Ukraine not need extra motivation heading into Thursdays Euro 2020 Group C game with North Macedonia and are feeling positive despite narrowly losing their opening match against the Netherlands, head coach Andriy Shevchenko said on Wednesday.
Ukraine came back from 2-0 down against the Dutch on Sunday and looked set to earn a draw but a late goal by Denzel Dumfries left them empty-handed.
We have complete understanding within the team.
We know the tasks we have ahead of us and additional words aren’t necessary.
The team is getting ready mentally, Shevchenko told reporters.
This is a really important tournament.
Its not every year that we get to the group stage of the European Championship, so every player understands the importance of each match and has responsibility for their own game and the game of the team.
So we don’t need any additional words.
North Macedonia were beaten 3-1 by Austria in their first match and sit bottom of the group standings below Ukraine.
Shevchenko said the atmosphere in his team was good and they would not underestimate their opponents, who are playing their first major tournament as an independent nation.
We know we lacked just a little bit to achieve a positive result.
The reaction from the team was great.
We had many good moments and we are very positive about the game ahead, Shevchenko said.
North Macedonia are a team that deserve respect.
They have character, their own style of play and they counter-attack well.
During the last couple of years, they have had several good games where they have beaten top teams.
So we have to be really careful of their counter-attacks.
Turkey coach Senol Gunes blamed their poor start to Euro 2020 on a flurry of individual mistakes after a 2-0 defeat to Wales on Wednesday left them without a point after two games.
After losing 3-0 to Italy in their opening Group A game, Turkey fell to their second consecutive defeat after Aaron Ramsey and Connor Roberts scored for Wales at Bakus Olympic Stadium.
I don’t think we ever got over the shock of the first game (against Italy), said Gunes.
Especially for the first half an hour, I think we were stuck in the previous game.
Despite that, we made a good start to the second half and dominated for a while, until we started making individual mistakes again, the veteran coach said.
Turkey, who face Switzerland in their final group match on Sunday, have conceded five goals in their first two games of the tournament and scored none.
I don’t remember us making so many errors in passing, ever.
When you lose the ball so easily, and have such a difficulty in getting it back, no wonder you’ll struggle, Gunes added.
Asked whether his tactics played a role in the two losses, Gunes said: You can add the inexperience to the mix, the lack of physical power, and the will to fight one on one with each player.
At the end of the day, I am observing a weight on the shoulders of the team and we failed to boost their confidence to take it off of them.
I take full responsibility.
They are all good players, but we expected more from them.
It’s not right to blame the players.
Italy lead Group A with six points after two rounds of matches and are ahead of Wales(four), Switzerland(one)and Turkey(zero).
They can seal top spot with a draw in their final pool game against Wales on Sunday.
Italy become the first team to reach the Round of 16.
Wales scored right at the death in injury time when a corner was played short and Connor Roberts was on hand to divert a Bale pass past goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir to seal the victory.
Switzerland coach Vladimir Petkovic has told his players not to show in-form Italy too much respect and have belief that they can win when the teams meet in a European Championship Group A clash in Rome on Wednesday.
Italy brushed aside Turkey 3-0 in their tournament opener with a slick display that continued their fine form of going unbeaten in their last 28 games dating back to September 2018.
We will do what we have always done, which is to play our own game, Petkovic told reporters on Tuesday.
We will respect Italy, but not too much.
They are the big favourites, not only in our group, but in general in this tournament.
We all saw the quality they showed against Turkey.
But we have quality too and can surprise them.
We will try to turn the game in our favour and be a bit quicker when we attack and create chances.
Switzerland have matched Belgium, Brazil, England and Spain in recent years, which Petkovic says should give them cause for optimism.
I hope that we will give 120%, just like we did against all the other big teams.
We will need to be better than we actually are.
We will have to have a great effort, run a lot and be great in duels.
Then we can win, he said.
We need to play our own game and be dangerous in the final third.
We must guard against certain Italian moves, but also be true to ourselves.
Let’s take things one match at a time, we will not get ahead of ourselves, he added.
It is very important to give 120% with the best starting XI available.
We hope we can produce a big performance and win the match to be sure that we can go through to the next round.
Italy coach Roberto Mancini said his excellent team can only improve ahead of their second European Championship match, against Switzerland, even though they made a near perfect start in their opening clash with Turkey last week.
The Turkey game was difficult, Mancini told a news conference.
But when we scored, they opened up.
We will have to win the next one and if possible also the next one.
We have to do our best.
I am confident.
This is an excellent team that can only improve.
If the English bookmakers say (Italy are favourites), we accept it because they get it right, but the championship is still long.
We have much work to do.
Victory over Switzerland will see Italy become the first team to reach the knockout stages of Euro 2020, with one Group A match still to play.
However, the Italians have won their opening two matches only twice in their nine previous appearances at the European Championship, doing so in 2000 and 2016, and Mancini is not taking Switzerland lightly.
They are always among the top rankings in world football, with good and experienced players, and they have a coach who knows Italy very well having coached here previously.
It will be difficult, and we will need to be at our top level.
Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci praised the togetherness of the group, highlighting team spirit as one reason for their resurgence since failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.
Three years ago was a real low point for us, he said.
Humility and keeping your feet on the ground are the secrets to competing like we did against Turkey.
We have always reset after great wins, continuing to do our duty.
The desire to return to the national team is back.
It is thanks to the coach, we came from a dark place.
The fact we are improving is a natural consequence of the good feeling among us.
Limpopo DSTV Premiership outfit, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila Football Club, will have a new name and logo ahead of the new season.
The Polokwane-based club will unveil the new name and logo at an event in Sandton, Johannesburg, on Thursday.
One of the names being bandied about is Marumo Gallants FC.
The Nedbank champions were bought by Abraham Sello from the club’s previous owner, Lawrence Mulaudzi, following financial problems earlier this year.
The current club’s chairman, Abraham Sello, opted to rebrand the club by changing the name and the logo.
The Club’s spokesperson, Rufus Matsena, says the clubs main sponsor will also be unveiled on Thursday.
We are actually getting rid of the old name which is Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila which is famous as TTM.
We are definitely unveiling the new name and the logo.
We do have a technical sponsor that is being negotiated, says Matsena.
TTM’s bank account has meanwhile been frozen after Mulaudzi demanded to be paid R10 million, which was reportedly outstanding when the club was sold.
Matsena, however, says the matter is being handled by their lawyers.
The issue pertaining to the previous chairman and the chairman is something that we cannot be discussing at the moment because is sub-judicare the matter is handled by the lawyers lets leave it like that until such time we get a go ahead from both parties, especially their legal representative.
Mulaudzi had bought the then Bidvest Wits club last year.
He sold it to Sello within five months due to financial challenges.
TheRussians, who remain unbeaten against the Finns since their first meeting in 1912, made amends for their opening loss to Belgium as the group remains wide open.
An injury to Mario Fernandes after a rough fall in the 26th minute did not shift Russia’s focus and his replacement Vyacheslav Karavaev almost tapped in a cutback at the far post minutes after coming on.
Belgium, who beat Russia3-0 in their opener, top the group ahead of their game against Denmark on Thursday.
Thousands of Turkish fans are expected to travel to the Azerbaijan capital for the game and are likely to create a partisan atmosphere for what is a must-win game for Senol Guness Turkey side at the Olympic Stadium.
When I’ve played in Turkey before, the atmosphere has been incredible, Bale told a news conference on Tuesday.
Of course, they will be cheering on the Turkish team but you need crowds in these tournaments.
No problem with(hostility).
Were used to playing away games in front of hostile crowds.
This is what we do for a living.
If anything it should spur us on to be a bit more ruthless on the pitch.
Hopefully we can keep them silent.
Rob Page’s Wales were restricted to 38% ball possession against Switzerland, with striker Kieffer Moore scoring from one of their two attempts on target as they came from behind to snatch a crucial point.
Although he would not label the match against the Turks as a must-win, Page believes three points should put them in the driving seat for qualification to the knockout stages.
He is expecting another tight contest against Turkey who arrived at the Euros with victories over Netherlands and Norway in World Cup qualifiers but slumped to a 3-0 defeat by Italy in the opening match of the tournament.
They had a very difficult opener and will be looking at us to get the full three points.
Were fully prepared for a tough game, Page said.
We’ve also identified this game as the one we can do alright in.
It’s about finding a way to win.
If we can get four points from two games, then it sets us up nicely.
Turkey coach Senol Gunes and captain Burak Yilmaz said the team would bounce back against Wales on Wednesday after a disappointing 3-0 loss to Italy in their first match of the European Championship.
We had two devastating days after the Italy game, Yilmaz told a press conference on Tuesday ahead of their second Group A match at Bakus Olympic Stadium.
His team are hoping that the presence of many of their fans in Azerbaijan, which has close ethnic and cultural ties with Turkey, will help earn them three sorely needed points.
Our fans are always with us.
With their support and unity in the team, we are back on our feet now and focused on our goals, he said.
We have a very difficult game tomorrow.
We are aware of our mistakes in the first game, and we had realistic meetings.
I believe we will be what is expected of us tomorrow.
Gunes has plenty to ponder after a meek performance in the Italy match, when Turkey failed to make any real impact.
He echoed Yilmaz’s remarks about the need to take an honest look in the mirror.
Bad game, bad outcome.
We are not finding excuses for our bad performance
Now we have to stop being sorry and get to work, Gunes said.
We know the weaknesses of our game, and we have to play with a new approach tomorrow.
Wales are a strong team and they played the semis in the last tournament.
We have a different approach and a different philosophy from them.
We can get 4 or 6 points from the next 2 games, but the aim is to get to the knockout stage, he added.
Gunes said he may make a couple of changes to the team that played Italy.
I have trust in everyone in the squad, he said.
He said Wales had shown a defensive approach, which the Turkish squad had analysed.
For tomorrow’s game we are not thinking about if it will be three or four players (in defence).
I prefer they’d play without a defence, Yilmaz joked.
Each night of the swim-offs to determine who will represent Australia in Tokyo next month has thrown up a new star but the penultimate day was very much reserved for the old guard, and the country’s long-standing queen of the pool.
Sprinter Cate Campbell, 29, clinched the second qualifying spot in an extraordinary last race of the night in which four women dipped under 53 seconds in the 100m freestyle, making the Australian 4x 100m freestyle relay team hot gold medal favourites in Tokyo.
Emma McKeon, 27, who won more medals (four) than any other Australian swimmer in Rio, came home first in 52.35 seconds at the South Australia Aquatic Centre with Campbell clocking 52.59.
This has been the most nerve racking week of my life.
What a week it has been in the swimming pool.
It is such an exciting team to be a part of.
To be going to my fourth Olympics is something I am incredibly proud to say I have achieved, Campbell said.
We have just had four girls break 53 seconds; I mean what is going on?
The depth of talent in this event is just incredible.
Local favourite Madison Wilson finished third with Meg Harris fourth.
The first final of the night was an event that has been dominated globally by one man, the now retired American Michael Phelps who has struck gold in the 200m individual medley in each of the last four Olympics.
Mitch Larkin, who took silver in the 200m backstroke in Rio, has chosen to focus on the medley as his best chance of gold next month and romped home first in 1:56.29, well clear of Brendon Smith in second.
I feel really good, tonight was just a matter of digging deep, Larkin said.
Physically I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been.
The decision to drop the 200m backstroke in Tokyo had not been easy.
It was really difficult deciding between the two events and we sat down and looked at what would make the final and medals and then gold medal, he said.
Jenna Strauch (24), will compete in her maiden Olympics after winning the women’s 200m breaststroke and will be joined by Abbey Harkin (23), also making her Games debut.
The men’s 200m backstroke final was won by Tristan Hollard (24), who was close to tears afterwards as he secured a spot at his first ever Olympics.
Belgium defender Timothy Castagne has undergone surgery on a double fracture of his eye socket suffered in the European Championship at the weekend, officials confirmed on Wednesday.
The fullback was injured in a heavy collision with Russian Daler Kuzyaev in the first half of Saturdays 3-0 Group B win in St Petersburg, fracturing the eye socket below and to the right of his right eye.
He was immediately substituted and within hours had been ruled out of the tournament by coach Robert Martinez, though he has told team mates he wants to be back for the closing stages if Belgium progress that far.
Castagne underwent the operation on Tuesday.
Dennis Praet, his Belgium and Leicester City team mate, told reporters.
He’s a good friend so it’s a real shame.
He really wanted to be important for the Red Devils in this tournament.
Maybe a miracle will happen and he can come back at the end.
Castagne had been chosen as Belgium’s first choice right back ahead of Thomas Meunier, who replaced him in Saturday’s match and scored Belgium’s second goal seven minutes after coming on
Finland emerged from the trauma of Christian Eriksen’s collapse to beat Denmark 1-0 on Saturday and they will be aiming to build on that result against Russia as they aim for a spot in the knockout stages of Euro 2020.
The players returned to the pitch after Eriksen had suffered a heart attack, completing the match in very difficult circumstances, and Finland coach Markku Kanerva said his side would be happy with a draw against Russia in St Petersburg on Wednesday.
Of course, it would be a very difficult starting point to start to play for a draw.
Finland’s defence expects to have to work hard as Russia bid to bounce back from a 3-0 defeat by Belgium.
Their midfield is very dynamic, Kanerva said.
We have to do the basics better in the next match.
We have to make sure that the passing, all the basic things are on a high level and that the players are ready to control the ball, even in tight position, he said.
It’s a little bit of a mystery to us, how Russia will approach the game.
We are sure that they will press very hard from the very beginning, and we have to be skilful enough to play through that.
The Russians are bottom of Group B after the heavy loss to Belgium and Kanerva is expecting a backlash.
Russia lost 3-0 to Belgium on Saturday on home turf in St Petersburg, prompting criticism from fans and pundits.
The match highlighted the vast skill and talent gap between Belgium, the world’s top-ranked side, and Cherchesov’s team.
The criticism was deserved, Cherchesov told reporters a day before Russia face Finland in St Petersburg.
We have recovered from the first match.
Now we have an absolutely different kind of preparation.
Finland are not an easy opponent and they have already demonstrated this (against Denmark), Cherchesov said.
They are a disciplined team, Dzhikiya said.
They are organised and play in a compact way.
Cherchesov said Yuri Zhirkov had injured his thigh in the match against Belgium and it was later confirmed that the defender, who turns 38 in August, would miss the rest of the tournament.
Given the severity of the injury, the coaching staff has decided to release the player (Zhirkov)from the team, a statement from the Russian team said on Twitter.
An upbeat New Zealand will take on an undercooked India aiming to become test crickets first official world champions when they clash in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) final in Southampton from Friday.
The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) wanted the championship to bring relevance and context to test cricket and New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said it had been a success.
We saw in Australia, in New Zealand, a lot of teams had a chance to get through.
By contrast, India have not played a test match since March and are yet to win an ICC trophy under skipper Virat Kohli.
The importance of the WTC final was not lost on the 32-year-old.
This holds a lot of value, especially this being the first of its kind and in the toughest format, Kohli said before leaving for England.
This is like the accumulation of all the hard work of not just the duration of the championship but the last five-six years.
The ICC is happy with how the WTC generated more interest in test cricket.
It was obvious that the interest in certain series wasn’t just restricted to the two teams involved, ICC acting CEO Geoff Allardice told a virtual news conference on Monday.
It was coming from all over the cricketing world
I think to bring that sort of context to test cricket is a real step forward.
Japanese officials in charge of coronavirus countermeasures will hold a news conference later on Wednesday.
Japan plans to move forward on a proposal that will allow up to 10 000 spectators or 50% of a venues capacity, whichever is smaller, at events during the Games, Kyodo News said late Tuesday, citing government sources.
Foreign spectators are already prohibited from the Olympics beginning on July 23.
Organisers and government officials in Japan have said they would continue to work on coronavirus measures for a safe and secure Games, and that a decision on domestic spectators would be made this month.
Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura and the government’s top medical adviser Shigeru Omi will hold a joint news conference on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office said.
Nishimura and Omi would talk about the governments coronavirus responses during the briefing on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office said, but did not provide further details and the time has yet to be decided.
Tokyo, Osaka and eight other prefectures remain under a state of emergency that is set to end on June 20.
It was a very difficult game but we got three goals.
It was vital to win and start the tournament with confidence and now we want to keep on winning, said Ronaldo.
Portugal coach Fernando Santos added: If wed scored earlier it would have been easier for us.
We missed a few chances then had some anxious moments but found our composure again and finished the game well.
Striker Adam Szalai was Hungary’s main threat, heading a free kick into the arms of Rui Patricio shortly before halftime then testing the keeper again early in the second half.
Portugal’s veteran defender Pepe nearly scored at the start of the second half but was thwarted by the ever-alert Gulacsi, who later turned away a strike from Fernandes.
Hungary substitute Szabolcs Schon set the stadium alight in the 80th minute when his shot squirmed past Patricio but the linesman’s flag was quickly raised to puncture the celebrations.
Its ever so frustrating.
We defended well, the whole team worked well and we gave it our all, said Hungary defender Attila Szalai.
Hungary meet world champions France next back at the Puskas Arena while Portugal face Germany in Munich.
Hungary’s football-mad Prime Minister Viktor Orban was intent on filling the shiny new stadium, which opened in 2019, as he seeks to boost his popularity ahead of next year’s election.
Orban, who was at the game, has channelled billions of euros in state funds to upgrade an ageing football infrastructure and incurred widespread criticism for prioritising football over healthcare funds, particularly as the pandemic raged.
While the country has weathered a second wave of coronavirus with new cases averaging 100 to 200 in the last week thanks to a rapid vaccine rollout, at one point it had the world’s highest number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people based on Johns Hopkins University data.
Germany’s shock first round exit from the 2018 World Cup triggered an overhaul of the team.
In his final tournament before stepping down after 15 years, Loew has recalled some of the players he had axed after the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the overhauled squad failed to get the desired results.
With 2014 world champions Thomas Mueller and Mats Hummels back in the squad after more than two years, Germany will be considered as the underdogs when their largely untested line-up face their powerful neighbours.
What Germany will need to do first is lock down their defence against a formidable French frontline, arguably the best in the world at the moment.
France would not have become world champions if they did not have top defenders, said Germany forward Timo Werner.
Players who go into the one-on-ones like NGolo Kante or Benjamin Pavard.
There is a reason why they are tournament favourites.
And then in attack the trio with (Kylian) Mbappe,(Antoine) Griezmann and (Karim) Benzema is just world class.
When you have players like that in a team then it is just outstanding.
Benzema has recovered from a minor injury sustained in a friendly win over Bulgaria on Tuesday and is fit for their opener.
We have to see what is good for us, what we need and what our strengths are, said Germany assistant coach Marcus Sorg.
Secondly, we have to see how we can take the strengths of the French team out of the game.
We have to try, even against France to put our own strengths onto the pitch.
At the end of the day it can be one single situation that could secure success for the team, Sorg said.
That is why it is worth putting in the work, and our players have understood that.
Denmark’s Christian Eriksen said he was feeling fine under the circumstances and expressed gratitude for the flood of messages he had received after he suffered a cardiac arrest during their Euro 2020 opener on Saturday.
Big thanks for your sweet and amazing greetings and messages from all around the world.
It means a lot to me and my family, Eriksen said in a post on the national teams Instagram profile that was posted on Tuesday.
I’m fine under the circumstances.
The post was accompanied by a picture of the 29-year-old lying in a hospital bed, smiling and giving a thumbs up.
I feel okay.
Now, I will cheer on the boys on the Denmark team in the next matches, Play for all of Denmark, he added.
Eriksen collapsed just before halftime in the match against Finland and was taken to hospital after receiving CPR on the pitch.
Yesterday, Christian Eriksen’s agent said the player was undergoing detailed examinations.
We all want to understand what happened to him and he wants to as well.
The doctors are doing some detailed examinations, it will take time, Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport on Monday cited Eriksens agent Martin Schoots as saying.
Christian does not give up.
Him and his family want to send everyone their thanks.
The Group B game was halted and eventually restarted an hour and 45 minutes later, Finland winning 1-0.
The incident raises questions around the workload players have been subjected to.
Eriksen was playing in his 66th competitive game in the one year since soccer restarted following a shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The messages of support for Eriksen have come pouring in, from within the game and beyond, something that Schoots said has helped cheer up the Dane.
He was happy because he understood how much love he has around him, Schoots added.
He received messages from all over the world.
He was particularly struck by those from the world of Inter Milan; not just from his teammates, who he heard from through texts, but also the fans.
Half the world has contacted us, everyone is worried.
Now, he just needs to rest.
His wife and parents are with him.
But in any case, he wants to support his teammates against Belgium.
Hungary, playing in only their second European Championship in 49 years, are ranked outsiders in the tournaments toughest group but will compensate for what they lack in star names with passion and grit.
The shiny new Puska’s Arena is the only Euro 2020 stadium which will be at full capacity after local authorities agreed to exchange social distancing for a strict entry policy, requiring fans to return a negative COVID-19 test to gain access.
It means the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes face the prospect of their every touch being booed in Tuesday’s fixture by the Budapest crowd, who will not forgive any slacking off from their side.
They (Hungary) are a very tough team and won’t let any ball go and will never give up, said Portugal midfielder Danilo.
We know what style of play to expect from them.
We spent a season without playing in front of fans and were not used to it anymore but having a crowd will make the game more exciting.
Hungary will be extra motivated but it’s just another problem well have to deal with.
Leaving aside the partisan crowd, Portugal are likely to face tougher tests from Germany and France and the fixture is a golden chance to clock up some early goals and points to help their push to qualify from the group.
Portugal did face a torrid time from Hungary at Euro 2016, falling behind three times before coming back to earn a 3-3 draw and scrape into the knockout stages.
Fernando Santo’s Portugal side are an even stronger proposition five years on, possessing an embarrassment of attacking riches with the likes of Diogo Jota, Andre Silva, Joao Felix and Fernandes as well as the ever-determined Ronaldo.
This is a different group, we have many young players embarking on their first major international tournament although our ambition and hunger will be the same as in Euro 2016, added 29-year-old Danilo.
The previous team was very cohesive as they had been playing together for a long time while we are a young team of emerging talents but we are also a united group.
We all think the same and want to win.
Hungary, meanwhile, are a less potent side than the one which reached the knockout stage last time around, with big personalities such as Gabor Kiraly, Roland Juhasz and Zoltan Gera all moving on.
They are also without two key midfielders in bright young hope Dominik Szoboszlai and Zsolt Kalmar due to injury.
Asked which Portuguese player Hungary will be most concerned about on Tuesday, Rossi laughed.
I could almost list the entire squad, he told reporters.
Naming one player would be a disservice to the others.
They have huge potential in all areas of the pitch.
We need to help one another out, we need to make sure were very compact, and close down the space between the lines.
Hungary rely on a robust defence and counter-attacks.
Fewer big names in their squad means the team may be fresher than opponents who have played full seasons in big domestic and international tournaments.
Bundesliga stalwarts like Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi do play for Hungary, tough opponents even without their most valuable player, Dominik Szoboszlai.
We need to execute our strategy, especially on defence, because this Portuguese team is stronger even than the 2016 one, he said.
Hungary and Portugal played one of the most exciting group matches at Euro 2016, with Hungary leading three times and Portugal equalising on each occasion including two goals by Cristiano Ronaldo.
Hungary finished top of the group before losing 4-0 to Belgium in the round of 16 while Portugal won the title.
Eight teams will qualify for the following season’s Champions Cup.
