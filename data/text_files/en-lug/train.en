Kivejinja lost the petition and appealed in the Court of Appeal where he also lost, increasing the costs to fourty million shillings.
However, since the March 16, 2007 court ruling, Kirunda has never paid costs of the suit and has since asked for more time to be able to pay.

Nizeyimana agreed with the lawyer and gave the minister more time to pay.

It's the attempt to impose outside solutions on Africa’s internal problems that has confused our continent.
In the case of Somalia, the biggest threat to the evolution of an effective state has been the United States.
United States involvement in Somalia began with the 1991 intervention that was largely a humanitarian gesture.
However, when America shifted its mandate from humanitarian intervention to peace enforcement, it got entangled in a war with Mohammed Aideed.
This led to the death of eighteen Americans in the famous “black hawk down” battle in Mogadishu that caused a United States withdrawal.
Had America allowed Aideed to militarily capture the whole country of Somalia, Somalia would have emerged more stable and effective.
The American position was reinforced by the international humanitarian groups and their ill-informed and misguided African chorus singers.
They looked at that country’s problem from a purely humanitarian perspective and missed the vital importance of effective military control of Somalia.
I harbour a fundamental disagreement with democracy and human rights groups in Africa.
Democracy exists in stable and effective states, not in anarchy.
What Somalia needs is a military strongman with organisational ability to gather resources , bribe and persuade other military and civilian groups together.
In the mid 2000s, the Islamic Courts Union grew and spread rapidly, establishing order over large parts of the country.
However, post 11th September America was scared of anything Islamic and thus saw the Islamic Courts Union as an enemy.
It financed Ethiopia to dislodge them from power.
From the ashes of their defeat emerged the Al-Shabaab with largely terrorist intentions rather than a desire to build a strong state.
America should have worked with Islamic Courts Union to create a stable state in Somalia.
United States of America was unwilling to send in troops to hold the peace because it was not politically sellable.
It subcontracted that role to Uganda and Burundi.
Museveni, seeing an opportunity to be central to United States of America's geo-strategic interests in the region offered to send in troops.
I am reluctant to believe that Museveni was driven by a desire for peace in Somalia.
Museveni convinced me that such ill advised foreign military interventions despite being well intentioned, tend to create more problems than they solve.
In 2002, Museveni shared a speech he delivered in Zimbabwe on Uganda and Rwanda’s role in the removal of Mobutu of Zaire.
Somalia failing to become an effective state and the rise of Al-Shabaab, are a byproduct of international intervention in domestic politics.
It is also difficult to see the strategic gains for Uganda in this intervention.
However, it is strategically important for Museveni.
Ugandan troops presence in Somalia helps improve his standing in Washington DC, a factor that is vital for his domestic politics.
In fact, when he came to power, United States President Barack Obama showed a cold attitude to Museveni,
Now, with Ugandans paying with blood for American geo-strategic interests in this region, Museveni is indispensable to Obama’s plans for this region.
Because the gains from Somalia are personal to Museveni rather than national to Uganda,
I harbour a fundamental disagreement with democracy and human rights groups in Africa.
Yet we are continuously told that only a democratic order built around a consensus would bring a stable peace in Somalia.
Why we should pull out of Somalia.
Aronda Nyakairima, received a threat assessment from the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence detailing a serious threat from Allied Democratic Forces terrorists.
Nyakairima sent a flash radio message of the threat to all units of the Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces.
The next day Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence reinforced its defences at its head offices at Kitante Courts.
At all security installations around Kampala and greater Kampala, increased security measures were put in place.
At the same time, information had been given to the police to communicate to the public about an impending attack.
At some seminars and conferences, police claim to have informed listeners to be careful.
Warning signs were already well apparent by the time a group of 24 former Allied Democartic Forces combatants were met on October 8, 2008.
The former combatants, who had renounced violence to get amnesty and were retained by Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force as informers.
The meeting was a pre-emptive security measure to divert the Allied Democratic Forces.
9th October of that year, the Tripartite-Plus, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and Southern African Development Community heads of state summit in Kampala.
During the meeting, the Allied Democratic Forces were asked to submit a document of their grievances.
It was later submitted signed by one Hussein Maiga and the abovementioned Benz Tushabe.
According to contents of the meeting, the ex-Allied Democratic Forces combatants referred to in the document as “reporters” repeated their complaint.
They argued that the resettlement money they had received from the government was insufficient and that they felt forgotten.
In the document, Allied Democratic Forces reporters complained that most of their combatants who got amnesty are youths.
The document noted that dealing with these youths requires care as they are targets of continued recruitment efforts by Allied Democratic Forces.
Government should come up with a program to engage these Muslim youths in active economic activities to avoid idleness and redundancy.
Security sources say Allied Democratic Forces reporters had been trying to meet president Museveni to present him their grievances.
State House sources say they had not secured such audience by 7th November.
The last time Allied Democartic Forces had a meeting with the president was on February 03, 2004 .
At the time, the president directed that jailed Allied Democartic Forces leaders Maneno Majaliwa and Sserwanga Bukenya be released.
Because many of them work with and inside Uganda’s security organizations.
In an August 2008 internal assessment by Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force.
In the same internal assessment, Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force reported that Allied Democratic Forces intentions were elimination of their defected comrades.
The document had names of Allied Democratic Forces operatives on the run.
At the time, Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force had planned to arrest terrorists now using women to spy on targets.
Among the operations Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force had carried out was the arrest of one Seka Adam Nsubuga Mukalazi,
On August 8, 2008, they arrested Joseph Ouma and one Waskile in Busia for being connected to a suspicious number.
On August 10, 2008, Bukomeko Muhammed and Magelo Shaffik were also arrested by tracking team.
As a result of these operations, many Allied Democratic Forces combatants began to surrender to government.
Because Allied Democratic Forces was built around their religious faith.
The Allied Democratic Forces reporters inside Joint Anti-Terrorrist Taskforce and the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces became open to re-joining the terrorists as double agents.
Moreover, by the time of the bomb blasts on 7th November, there had been reports of massive recruitment by Alied Democratic Forces.
The reports also indicated that Allied Democratic Forces was transporting most of its recruits to Democratic Republic of Congo.
There were intelligence reports that Allied Democratic Forces was recruiting largely from Eastern Uganda.
New security information shows that there were suicide bombings at both Kabalagala and Lugogo.
According to police, the existence of a sliced head is often a sign of suicide bombing.
Secondly, police sources say the sliced head at Lugogo was of a Somali while the one in Kabalagala was of a Ugandan.
According to security sources, this is the first “evidence” of the coordination and alliance between Allied Democratic Forces and Al Shabaab.
Last week, Kenya arrested a Ugandan suspected to be linked with the terrorism bombings in Kampala.
Ugandan security suspects he is an Allied Democratic Forces person.
According to security sources since Allied Democratic Forces does not have a prior record in suicide bombing.
The link between the two terrorist organisations is further strengthened by the theory that Allied Democratic Forces knows Kampala very well.
As mentioned earlier, Allied Democratic Forces has internal sources within Uganda’s intelligence services especially Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force
For Al Shabaab to succeed in its operations, it needed the Allied Democratic Forces infrastructure.
As Yoweri Museveni did in Uganda in 1986.
Using financial incentives to stop Somalia from becoming an auxiliary to Al-Qaeda.
I think we should pull out our troops; not because we are afraid of Al-Shabaab, but because we are not doing Somalis any good.
The terrorrists were working in conjunction with the Somali-based, al-Shabaab militant group.
President Yoweri Museveni, all cabinet ministers, intelligence organisations and police recieved the radio message.
The Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces head offices in both Bombo and Mbuya were reinforced with barricades.
at the headquarters of the Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force in Kololo, summit view.
to help spy on their comrades they were led at the meeting by their former chief of staff, Benz Tushabe Munyangondo.
Saying that the government of Uganda and Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force had used and dumped them.
The American invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan and the events taking place in Somalia.
The meeting was organised by then chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Joshua Masaba and attended by then minister of state for security, Betty Akech.
For them to work as a team by conducting mass mobilisation campaigns to convince other Allied Democratic Forces combatants to renounce rebellion.
Allied Democartic Forces terrorists had accumulated a lot of information on the location of security organisations, especially Joint Anti Terrorist Task Force.
It was stated that the intentions of arrested Allied Democratic Forces operatives were among others elimination of security staff.
Allied Democratic Forces Infiltrated intelligence.
Yudaya Nansubuga and Mubiru Muhammad, all siblings of Ali Mubiru for their connection with Allied Democratic Forces activities on July 25, 2008.
The government’s main advantage over them was its ability to provide them with monetary incentives.
Leaking internal state intelligence within security agencies to Allied Democartic Forces and provide misleading intelligence to security organisations.
This was through Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda before crossing to Goma
Especially in Busoga where there are many Muslim living in poverty.
This must be a new tactic introduced through its work with Al Shabaab
Al Shabaab, not so much.
Gen. Aronda informed Museveni 7 days to the attacks.
Security officers comb the scene of the bomb blast at Kyadondo Rugby Club Lugogo and exterminate urban terrorist squads and those in the countryside.
The Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force team was led by a Major
At the Lugogo scene, security found a Koran next to the severed head of the suicide bomber.
Again, the Independent is withholding the numbers in order not to jeopardise police investigations.
From these leads, police suspects that the bombs were assembled in Kampala, largely but not entirely.
On July twelveth, security organisations deactivated a bomb at Makindye house.
It is not yet clear as to why the bomb did not go off on July eleventh.
However, security retrieved a Nokia one thousand two hundred eight series from the suicide jacket on which the explosive device was attached.
The simcard inside the phone was first inserted into the handset on July eighth.
Police sources told the Independent that the handset retrieved from the suicide jacket had previously used Somali telephone numbers.
This therefore was not the first time Somalia was featuring in intelligence with connections to the Allied Democratic Forces.
The ex-rebels in their two thousand eight document had clearly informed authorities of this possibe link.
The Somali numbers on the phone showed maximum integration between Al-Shabaab and Allied Democratic Forces.
However, the mobile handset used a Kenyan number between June twenty fourth and twenty eighth.
This further creates the link to some terrorists working in Kenya with a general indication of their regional reach.
The bombings took place amidst increasing Allied Democratic Forces attacks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The terrorists are now international working through Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.
Safaricom and Mobile Telephone Network numbers were involved in the bombing according to the Independent.
The Independent decided not to publish them on the advice of security officials as it would jeopardise Police investigations.
General Aronda Nyakairima, Brigadier James Mugira and Major General Kale Kayihura spearheaded the investigations.
On July seventh, Uganda sent a team to Nairobi to work with Kenyan security on how to handle the arrested terror suspects.
On June thirtieth, the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force under Criminal Millitary Intelligence killed Twaha Mohammed Kakande.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force arrested the Allied Democratic Forces collaborators in Mayuge district on July eighth.
Inspite of the security operations, security forces were unable to stop the terror attacks in Uganda on July eleventh.
According to the chief of Criminal Millitary Intelligence Brigadier James Mugira, it is not easy to fight a symmetric warfare.
Ugandan security is limited in resources.
Mugira told the independent that fighting terrorisms requires the maximum cooperation of citizens.
Mugira dismissed corruption claims by asserting that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force is well funded.
Mugira explained that people use the excuse of fighting to make money.
The security forces made an assessment on the eleventh of July to ascertain what gave the terrorists an advantage.
The Joint Intelligence Committee failed to share intelligence information.
The External Security Organisation was informed by the United States of America and South Africa but did not inform the Internal Security Organistion.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force had information about the location and telephone numbers of terrorists.
The Rapid Response Unit of the Police ascertained information on the plans of terrorists to bomb Kampala but lacked intelligence on their location.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Taskforce and the Rapid Response Unit did not share information to deter the terrorists plans.
Allied Democratic Forces cells in Kampala were cracked down as Uganda was preparing for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
The Joint Anti-terrorism Task force spear headed security organisations in infiltrating terrorists cells with a purpose of arresting and detaining.
The backbone of the terrorists was broken in two thousand seven.
The operations under Leopold Kyanda, the chief of Criminal Millitary Intelligence involved abuses and corruption.
Kyanda borrowed money at high interests rates to fund operations according to security sources.
Kyanda left the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force broke and heavily indebted.
James Mugira replaced Kyanda and aimed first at improving the image of the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force.
Mugira told his officials that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force should respect the law.
Security sources felt that although there was an improvement in security compared to the days of Kyanda, it was costly..
Mugira explained that the Joint Anti-terrorism Task force exaggerated the threat of the Allied Democratic Forces to make money.
There were reports in March two thousand ten that the Allied Democratic Forces were going to train with Al-shabaab in Somalia.
Security sources told the Independent that operatives lacked money to transport food.
By eleventh July, the Allied Democratic Forces had already built cells outside the intelligence.
Allied Democratic Forces receive money through forex bureaus and bus companies for their operations.
The Allied Democratic Forces replaced its traditional operatives that are prone to Intelligence organisations.
Salaaf Mosques were used as centres of recruitment and indoctrination.
Security assessments showed that the Allied Democratic Forces operatives resorted to using foreign telephone numbers to evade security.
The Ethiopian Village Restaurant was left in ruins after a bomb blast killed fifteen people in Kabalagala.
The New vision carried out a headline "you could die during the World Cup".
The call from New vision was clear considering the high rates of Human Immune Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, crime and road accidents in South Africa.
It was unfortunate that the message also applied to the people who converged in Kampala to watch the finals.
More than seventy six people were reportedly dead and hundreds were seriously injured.
It emerged that the terrorist attack was coordinated by Al-shabaab millitants in Somalia.
The bombs targeted Ethiopians and expatriates excluding football fans.
Al-shabaab took responsibility for the bombings in Kampala.
Commander Sheik Yusuf Issa told the Associated Press that Uganda was one of the Al-shabaab enemies afew hours after the attack.
Whatever makes Uganda cry, makes Al-shabaab happy.
If there was a link between these terror attacks, then it showed that Al-shabaab had extended their operations far beyond Somalia.
It will confirm that their leaders established threats to extend operations to Kampala and other countries with peace keeping missions to Somalia.
The Uganda People's Defence Forces tightened peace keeping operations in Somalia.
Countries which had promised to send troops are likely to be discouraged by the attacks and therefore unlikely to be part of the African Union Mission to Somalia.
Somali terrorists are linked to high profile attacks in East Africa that is, the Nineteen Ninety Eight bombings of the United States of America Embassy in Dar-es-salaam and Nairobi where over Two Hundred people died.
These attacks were also linked to Al-qaeda, the top most terror organisation in the world.
Al-shabaab attacks have had an impact on the security architecture in East Africa and Africa at large.
Ethiopian troops drove them out of Somalia in support of the United Nations backed interim government.

Sharif Ahmed, a former leader of the Islamic Courts was sworn in as the President of Somalia.
Islamic Courts vowed to topple him for betraying the country.
Al-shabaab is headed by Mohammed Abdi Godane.
Al-shabaab has always waged war against Somalia's fragile Transitional Governments forces since two thousand six.
Some Al-shabaab fighters were trained by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The United States of America's Federal Bureau of Investigations had concerns over the terror group expanding its network.
No one knows how Al-shabaab solicits funds however, Eritrea and some Arab nations have been accused of funding Al-shabaab though Asmara has continously denied the allegations.
This was around Namasuba towards the end of June.
This follows after similar incidents happened at Kyadondo Rugby Club in Lugogo and Ethiopian Restaurant in Kabalagala.
This was after midnight at Mukwano Shopping Centre in down town Kampala according to the Police.
This happened two weeks earlier which brought clarity to the security that it was to create diversion for the plans in Kampala.

The Lukwebe Abdul-Salam squad operates in Kampala and the surrounding areas.
Abdul Hakim alias Sam Kalyango squad which operates in Busia, Kampala and Kyotera but suspected to have shifted to Kenya.

The leader of Allied Democratic Forces, Jamil Mukulu has continuously supported, directed and coordinated Allied Democratic Forces operations.
Due to increased security vigilance against Allied Democratic Forces, new cells have emerged instead of the known traditional areas.
The Allied Democratic Forces has also continued sending and receiving money through Forex Bureaus and bus companies for operations.
The Allied Democratic Forces operatives have continuously acquired forged identification and travel documents.
Allied Democratic Forces Identity Documents and Local Council recommendation letters looked authentic.

In its spirited fight against terrorism, Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force has encountered a number of problems.
These are Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya from where they plan and coordinate their operations.
This means Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force's operations in pursuing them are quite very difficult.
Allied Democratic Forces have sentimental feelings.
The amnesty law until recently was being exploited, however a number of Allied Democratic Force operatives upon getting amnesty have bounced back to terror activities.
The Allied Democratic Forces has continued to use Salaaf Mosques and Luzira Prison as their indoctrination,recruitment and coordination centres,
The lapse of immigration procedures makes recruitment into Allied Democratic Forces ranks very easy.
This is an intelligence brief from Joint Anti-terrorism Taskforce to Joint Intelligence Committee regarding Allied Democratic Force ongoing and imminent activities.

Comparing this large number of lakes in the Great Lakes region, Nigeria in West Africa has only one lake, Kainji.
There is abundance of fresh water lakes and rivers that crisscross East-Central Africa, with rich volcanic soil in eastern Congo, Rwanda, and western Uganda.
Dr Kizza Besigye remarked at a campaign rally in Amolatar District that the government had leased part of Lake Kyoga to a South African society.
Many Ugandans take fresh water for granted and could not understand why “a mere lake” caused Museveni to react with such sensitivity.

Timothy Kalyegira, is the most committed of media skeptics about Rwanda and its President, Paul Kagame.
On a recent visit there, almost everyone I know and bumped into, said something about him and his “hatred of Rwanda”.
Pan Butamire credits Kalyegira with “a cynical streak” that makes him “sound ludicrous”.
Is there no reconciliation in Rwanda?
Although milder than some of the things I have heard people say about him in Kigali, these are serious accusations.
It is not the first time Kalyegira has had a go at Rwanda or its leadership.
He and I have fought several times over the years about Rwanda, a country he loves to dismiss as ordinary.
Remarkably, his first and last visit to Rwanda, he stopped in Kigali this was more than four years ago.
For example, he argues that comparison of countries such as Uganda and Rwanda amount to comparing “the normal with the dysfunctional”.
One could justifiably rate Uganda as dysfunctional, given its recent history.
At the time it seized power, the Rwanda Patriotic Front inherited a country in ruins, without money, and with no functioning state institutions.
Operations of Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force were also geared to the arrest or extermination of urban terrorist squads.
Joint Anti-terrorist Task Force arrested Seka Adam Nsubuga Mukalazi,Yudaya Nsubuga and Mubiru Muhammed for their connection to Allied Democratic Forces.

Timothy Kalyegira has been the subject of much animated discussion in Kigali.
Pascal Gahamanyi accuses Kalyegira of relying “entirely on ignorance and prejudice” and “ignoring basic information”.
He sees Rwanda admirers as hopelessly naïve and impressionable.

Just a few weeks after a devastating terrorist attack in Kampala, the African Union still convened in Uganda’s capital city to tackle our most urgent priorities.
It was inspiring to see that African heads of state continued to make time for meetings of the recently formed African Leaders Malaria Alliance.
African Leaders Malaria Alliance, a group dedicated to finding new solutions to malaria, had pledged to make real progress against the disease.
But today, the leading malaria vaccine candidate is in Phase III trials in seven countries across Africa.
So far, ten thousand infants and young children have been enrolled in this critical trial in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania.
With a malaria vaccine candidate on the horizon, now is the time to prepare for its introduction as five years can go by quickly.
Partners need to engage and we need to start thinking about how to ensure malaria vaccine reaches those who need it most who are mainly the Africa’s children.
The process could start by engaging groups like African Leaders Malaria Alliance and international organisations such as the Roll Back Malaria Partnership and the Global Fund.
For our part, Glaxo Smith Kline is doing all that it can to ensure that the price of falciparum circumsporozoite protein T-cell epitopes hepatitis B surface antigen will not be a barrier to its use.
Earlier this year, our Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty announced that Glaxo Smith Kline will sell falciparum circumsporozoite protein T-cell epitopes hepatitis B surface antigen.
Such an approach should ensure that pharmaceutical companies continue to invest in research for similar vaccines.
Glaxo Smith Kline believes in broad collaboration to advance research against diseases like malaria.
All over the world, countries, companies, Non Governmental Organisations and scientists are motivated to advance the fight against malaria.
African Leaders Malaria Alliance is a great example of what Africans can do when we work together on the highest level.
I hope African Leader Malaria Alliance and its friends gather at another African Union meeting to discuss new malaria involvement.

Let us take an example of Ingabire Victoire who has been cited by the international media as an example.
Ingabire's link to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda is well known.
Her way of thinking, as shown by her speeches both before and after her arrival in Rwanda in two thousand ten.
Her intention is to attain political power in Rwanda.
Generally, it would be difficult to make a good analysis of the Rwandan situation.
The problem arises that analysts like George Ayitty mislead the world by focusing on isolated incidents.
There is no way Rwanda would have made both political and socio-economic achievements if the people were under an oppressive regime.
Today, the overall percentage of people insured is ninty one percent.
As a result of this policy, child death rate fell from eighty six per one thousand live births in two thousand five to sixty two per one thousand in two thousand eight.

The government of Rwanda is not perfect.
Crime is high in many cities of the United States.
But that cannot make United States leaders dictators.
Foreign governments and media should give chance to Rwandans.
Let Rwandans decide who their leaders should be.
The fate of Rwandans will not be surrendered to self-appointed opposition leaders.
Rwandans have more stake in what is happening.
George Ayittey and others should come down to Rwanda and interact with Rwandans before he makes his unlikely conclusions.
Declassified intelligence file of the Lord's Resistance Army defectors fear revenge for atrocities if they leave the bush.
Kony sent a squad to meet Odyambo after he has crossed.
At this point Odyambo is supposed to fire twice.
Cautioned Okulu not to move quickly to Kony’s position.
Instructed all units to avoid talking too much on the radio, as Uganda People's Defence Forces is busy monitoring them.
Boasted of having a force of one thousand three hundred soldiers with a comment that the Lord's Resistance Army defectors are useless.
While referring to “Captian” Lukwiya who after defecting talked an Mega FM radio.
Directed people with mixed feelings among the Lord's Resistance Army to report to Uganda People's Defence Forces.
Revealed that the Lord's Resistance Army commanders can only survive in the bush but when released they will suffer.
He cited the example of Angola who hails from Awach that if he is released to go back home.
Warned his commanders that whatever is done in Uganda to help his family should be done in concealment.
Directed Lukwiya not to stay with Kony’s old women; this was after realising that his old woman Margaret defected.
Blamed seriously Alice Lakwena for accepting offers from the government she fought.
But in contradiction, he okayed it, if it is President Museveni convincing her or God’s plans.
Claimed that all learned Acholis with degrees are for the Lord's Resistance Army.
He complained that he was taking long without hearing from Dominic.
Otti reported that Alice Lakwena is very much willing to come back from exile .
He revealed that one Aliga defected to Uganda People's Defence Forces.
Lukwiya commented that in the Lord's Resistance Army culture Shea Nut oiI is not eaten during the Lord's Resistance Army operation period.
He revealed that one of Obura”s groups called SASA defected to Uganda People's Defence Forces with his Lukwiya’s wife.

He claimed that he charged eighty Sub Machine Gun rifles from Uganda People's Defence Force and commented that the Lord's Resistance Army prisoners of war will be destroyed by the government.
Kapere who is coordinating to meet Ocan Bunia asked Labongo whether Okongo had retrieved their hidden ammo.
He also informed Dominic that his sickness is still serious.
Angola promised that so long as “Major Generals” “Brigadiers” and “Colonels” like him are still there.
Comments Kony’s negative comment on Lakwena’s return was shortened by after thought of what has been going on between him and Betty Bigombe.
Because the way he started, he looked ready to criticise Lakwena’s move with some abuses.
But he remembered how Otti and some other commanders are inclined to peace deal with government and they expect him to agree some how.
Therefore his comment that “could be God’s plans and President Museveni’s convincing language” was meant to make Otti and other commanders hopeful.
Otti’s story on Lakwena’s move is meant to show Kony that things can end peacefully.
Kony has now come clear on his move to incriminate his commanders by involving them, in committing atrocities in their home areas.
To director general internal security organisation, from director of intelligence date june thirteenth two thousand four Kony, Otti, Lukwiya, Abudema, Ocan Bunia, Dominic, Angola and Okulu were on air.
Kony was happy when Angola told him most of the Lord's Resistance Army groups were in Uganda.

This was after Okulu reported that he crossed a certain road safely this morning.
Wanted to know who ambushed the Kitgum Local council five Chairman.
He wanted to talk to Kapere but was off air.
He could not read Otti and Dominic very well.
Otti asked Abudema to explain what he had gone to do in Ngomoromo area and the location of Opio.
He told Sam Otto that it is Ojera who met Lagulu before Otto Sam revealed that Lagulu has something for him.
He permitted Otto to release the problematic women of their fallen comrade saying their role is minimal.
Kony supported the idea.
Abudema reported to Otti that Kitgum Local council five chairman Nahaman Ojwee survived ambush in Ngomoromo yesterday.
He further reported that Acaye, one of the commanders they have been looking for has been got.
He replied to Otti that he went to Kitgum to attack a certain project and withdrew safely.
Kapere reported that yesterday he got in contact with Uganda People's Defence Force and claimed that nothing happened to him.
He did not give the details.
Otti and Otto Sam may start moving to Sudan after Sam brings the tapes he retrieved.
But the way things are; we cannot rule out Otti and Sam Otto separating from Kony to either government or exile.
Otti’s question to Abudema why he was in Kitgum may be connected with what some government agents.
This is in Kitgum, Otti might be knowing about it and there is likelihood that he thinks Abudema doesn’t know.
Lieutenant Ronnie Balya's report for august thirteenth to nineteenth.
I come from a farming family and I used to milk cows in the morning before going to school.
Wanted to know who ambushed the Kitgum Local council five Chairman.
I have no cow to milk here, so I spend my early morning catching up with news, mainly on television.
Three times in a week I jog in the morning to refresh myself.
I also read a lot in the morning before I set off to office.
Usually by eight ante-meridiem I am at office.
This has been cited in a two thousand nine United Nations report on Rwandan rebels in Democratic Republic of Congo.
Through mobilisation of ethnic divisions by deceiving the International community as a democrat fighting "dictatorship" in Rwanda.

Because they live in Rwanda and they appreciate Kagame’s effort to modernise the country.
Kony, Otti, Lukwiya, Abudema, Otto Sam, Kapere, Angola, Opio Makas, Dominic, Odyambo, Labongo and Okulu were all on air.
He is supposed to cross two of the three rivers they agreed with Kony.
And should be careful not to leave any trails behind that can lead the Uganda People's Defence Forces.
This was after Okulu sighted a huge force of Uganda People's Defence Forces deployed along a certain river.
She is only waiting for the delegates from Uganda to collect her.
Being a prophet she wants to come back to Uganda to treat people in Acholi land because she has all the medicine.
That he heard him talking on the radio and claims that Aliga was shot in the legs and hence was useless to the Lord's Resistance Army.
Also complained that soldiers at the division Governmental Military.
And that he could not talk on his radio for fear of being attacked by Uganda People's Defence Force.
Commented that according to the Lord's Resistance Army culture only commanders are not allowed to eat ducks, mudfish, and malakwanga vegetables and that is why other soldiers have started eating them.
The Lord's Resistance Army will continue to survive and carry out full time operations regardless of other Lord's Resistance Army soldiers defecting to Uganda People's Defence Forces.
Planning and deploying for operations on camps to cause atrocities as instructed by Kony earlier.
In Kitgum are doing that is luring the commanders to come out especially Lukwiya.
He doesn’t want Abudema to know especially now that Abudema is a confidant of Kony.

There is a target of eight percent in two thousand ten.
I'm an early raiser from childhood.
Most of the serious candidates were eliminated from the race and the opposition candidates that remained were actually escorts of Kagame.
In respect to Kagame, I think we need to go back to the history of this country.
They formed an alliance arising from the Arusha accord.
As political entities, they were there.
The difference is they decided to form an alliance with Railway Protection Force.
I know that three political parties went to register and they were denied either for legal reasons or for an institute reason.
We recently met one of them, the green party, and they gave us a briefing of their position.
We hope that this will be the case in the future.
However, we are also saying clearly that in doing so, one has to take into account the careful approach.
There should be no repetition. We should not give one an opportunity, including to the media, given their history.
The former Tanzanian Prime Minister sat down with the Independent’s Managing Editor Andrew Mwenda.
Salim was sent to Rwanda to lead the Commonwealth Observer Group.
President Kagame, as you said, was attracting large crowds.
On the other hand, people say if you go in that party,"Kagame will attack you".
It is not special for Rwanda that the ruling party had a superior position in the campaign.
We met with the Social Democratic Party, and we met with the Liberal party.
The lady from the People's Party of Canada party did not come.
For example, we met with the chairman of the Green party and he was very clear in his engagement.
We are going through that experience in Tanzania and Zanzibar.
Every time there is a rally, either by Chama Cha Mapinduzi or the Civic United Front, the language is different.
Since November last year, the language has been toned down.
Is not something we should see as a problem? I am saying it is something that is happening in Rwanda.
I cannot generalize that what is happening in Rwanda may also happen elsewhere.
But what happens when they have to vote in the secrecy of the ballot? How come they vote for Kagame?
I think there are limits and it would be unfortunate to underestimate the desires or the talent of the people of Rwanda.
We went right into the masses and we saw their energy and how they reacted to what Kagame was saying.
Are you concerned that it has taken two days since the election to announce all the results?
And I have seen their system here and they are supposed to announce within a maximum of five days.
In your assessment, was this ninty three percent we are hearing reflected at the polling centers?
Some of the electoral observers who were in Kigali for Presidential Polls held on August nineth
President Paul Kagame casts his vote during the just concluded presidential elections.
However, some agencies such as Saachi and Saachi or Mawad say they are hesitant to accept this work out of concern.
First we have been here for seven days.
Therefore, they are just escorts of president Kagame.
Other parts of Tanzania where there is going to be a government of national unity after the elections.
This is due to been abuses and counter abuse from the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi, where I belong, and the Civic United Front, which is extremely strong in Zanzibar.
When you moved around the Kagame campaigns?
I do not buy the idea that the people of Rwanda, all these crowds that went to Gasabo were not energetic.
To be able to understand the people of Rwanda can make up their mind.

Following the acquisition of the plane, the airline has introduced a new frequency along the Entebbe-Nairobi route.
The new route brings the number of flights the airline will operate from Entebbe to Nairobi on a weekly basis to fourteen.
At the end of February 2010, the airline launched daily flights between Entebbe and Kigali.

Amongst the socialites, were numerous young talented actors, editors, screenwriters and directors who had all gathered to celebrate the success of Ugandan film.
In the auditorium, people clamoured for seats for the showpiece of the night, a screening of IMANI.
IMANI was directed by Carol Kamya and other alumni from Maisha, an organization dedicated to providing training to Ugandan filmmakers.
The scenes are familiar to a Ugandan audience but actually seeing them onscreen, executed in such a professional manner, is wholly unfamiliar.
Inorder to understand the story properly it is important to go back to 2005 to when Mina Zair, acclaimed director of international hits such as Monsoon Wedding and The Namesake, established Maisha.
For years, Uganda has tended to import most of its culture, the hip hop, RnB and reggae that populates the charts is based on western music.
Sharpe Ssewali, a young screenwriter and director who is currently getting his film off the ground, says this phenomenon has to be stopped. .
Kimanje Mark, the marketing manager for IMANI, cited the example of how Congolese music, another outside source, dominated in Uganda until ten or fifteen years ago.
Now the music scene is almost exclusively populated by Ugandan acts, many of them performing in their native tongue, and it remains a massively popular industry.
Even the fact that IMANI, a relatively low-budget film made by several young Ugandan filmmakers, was shown at Cineplex, up against the enormous power and finances of Hollywood films shows that Ugandan film deserves its platform.
There are, however, some serious challenges to Ugandan filmmaking.
Matt Bish, a director and editor who previously worked in the Netherlands, says that even as someone who owns and manages his own studio, he has no proper way of controlling the distribution of his films.
Thankfully, events like Maisha African Film festival and, the other great film event in Kampala, Amakula Film Festival, which has now been running for six years, are around to try and increase awareness of Ugandan films outside of pirated distribution.
Amakula showcases reclaiming national culture for years, Uganda has tended to import most of its culture, the hip hop, RnB and reggae that populates the charts is based on Western music, the films that dominate Cineplex and get quickly copied and sold in Wandegeya or Kisementi are normally from the United States of America or India.
Before the ecstasies of the inaugural screening of the first African Film Festival at National Theatre, Maisha had been running a series of workshops where industry experts had been teaching young Ugandans techniques and tricks for how to put together a great movie.
At the last workshop, run by American actor Giancarlo Esposito (The Usual Suspects, School Daze, Do The Right Thing), there was a packed room of aspiring actors and actresses who soaked up Mr Esposito’s remarkable passion and sensible advice.
One of the people he touched with his workshop was Peace Among, a twenty four year old actress who first started performing in plays at school.
Just like several other young people involved in the burgeoning film industry here, Among studied an unrelated subject at university, Journalism, others had done Civil Engineering, Architecture and even Biological Science before realising that she had to follow her passion.
Among says her real passion is acting and that it will take her all the way to Hollywood, a line that is said with a laugh but with an undercurrent of determination that seems firmly rooted in everyday life.
The platform provided by excellent teaching at Maisha combined with the incredible passion and support of the young Ugandans who want to make films stands them in good stead.
What is more, this is a country in which there are many stories to tell, the international success of The Last King of Scotland is a prime example of this, most of which remain untold.
The more this energy that surrounds filmmaking in Uganda lasts the more likely high quality films such as IMANI or Bish’s Battle Of The Souls, will be produced.
Trust and public awareness of Ugandan filmmaking will consequently grow, creating more opportunities and, finally a proper industry.
“Whenever people see a really good Ugandan film there’s a lot of excitement about it, people think yeah, we can really do this!’” says Bish.
Having that belief is one of the big issues for funding because these companies don’t believe that Ugandans can actually make something good.
This is the dream of those young filmmakers who stood and applauded Ms Nair’s message.
As ironic as it may seem, this is the type of guy who appeals to the average Ugandan female.
Unlike some Ugandan men, they are easy to identify from their arrogant behaviour while in public places especially average to high class eatouts or entertainment spots.

Ms Zair stated publically on opening night, “If we don’t tell our own stories, no one else will".
The films that dominate Cineplex and get quickly copied and sold in Wandegeya or Kisementi are normally from the USA or India, even something as simple as what people wear everyday is, by and large, far from Ugandan in origin.
"It’s time Africa exported its culture to the rest of the world,” he reasons.
Uganda's film movement is providing entertainment and showcasing East African talent as well as bringing international films, although some have criticised the festival for placing too much emphasis on the latter, to the attention of the general public.

It happened in the 1970s when Idi Amin declared he would eat for life until he was herded out like a stubborn bull in a kraal in 1979.
In 2005, President Museveni removed presidential term limits from the constitution to make the period of eating well indefinite.
In fact for this reason Uganda has never relinquished leadership peacefully since independence.
While in other countries leadership is changed by the ballot, in Uganda it looks it will be changed by either the inevitable fate of age or any other unpreventable occurrence.
Just on August 28th while commissioning the regional office for people with disabilities in Mbarara, President Museveni declared that he is not going anywhere.

The Uganda People's Congress announced it had pulled out of the Inter Party Cooperation.
The Uganda People's Congress cited lack of transparency, accountability and deviating from the collective position initially agreed upon.
The Uganda People's Congress was part and parcel of the founding of Inter Party Cooperation.
However president Olara Otunnu said his party would be willing to work with its former partners within a broader framework of the national democratisation process.
The Uganda People's Congress instead will now partner with Civil Society Organisations, religious institutions and pressure groups to push for free and fair elections.
Uganda People's Congress exit started a fortnight ago when the other cooperating parties nominated their flag bearers to compete for the joint candidate for 2011.
Even then, accusations were flying high that the Forum for Democratic Change was planning to take the presidency through fraudulent means.
Forum for Democratic Change was also being accused of lack of transparency and manipulation.

The Head of the Inter Party Cooperation Secretariat Dr Frank Nabwiso described Uganda People's Congress decision to quit the opposition alliance.
It is unfortunate that Uganda People's Congress has reached that decision.
Uganda People's Congress has always been at the forefront of inter party cooperation right from 1962.
In 1979 during the Moshi conference, again Uganda People's Congress was very instrumental and also played a major role in the politics in the 1980.

The Al-Shabaab struck Mogadishu on Aug 25 and threatened to overrun the presidential palace.
The onslaught continued until African Union peacekeepers, comprised of Ugandan and Burundians intervened to rescue the Somali government.
The AlShabaab extended the war theatre from Mogadishu to Kampala on July 11 and killed more than 76 people who were watching the World Cup finals.
When they finally met at Munyonyo Resort, they did not even just resolve, they vowed to send more peace keeping troops to Somalia.
More than a month after the pledge, the terrorists are still wreaking havoc in Somalia and even threatening to take over the interim government.
In fact, if the Ugandan and Burundian troops did not intervene, probably there would be no government for African Union to protect in Mogadishu.
What are the African Union member states who pledged troops to Somalia waiting for?
Where are the troops you pledged for Mogadishu during the African Union summit in Kampala after terror attacks?
On 4th August 2010 Kenyans ratified a new constitution via a referendum, and they gave at least nominal support to devolution of political power in a way that isn’t really federalism.
Love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.
This is what happened on August 28 when a group of young people comprising mainly students were returning from a night club in Ntinda.
The African Union needs to get a little more serious and graduate from political rhetoric to political action.
Federalism will not work in Uganda today for the same reason something similar just might work in Kenya.
The difference is that in Kenya there are powerful challengers to the authority of the state.
As pressure on the Kenyan government mounted, the government could have closed ranks to defend its power against honest businesses.
In Uganda, by difference, there is almost no pressure on the centre to reform.
The last experiment with giving real power to local government failed after ninteen ninty three.
Until last year Kenya had two hundred fifty four districts but now has forty six.
The population of Kenya is about forty million people.
Each of Kenya’s sixty four districts can thus muster an average of around one point four billion dollars.
But the point is that it was precisely this power which forced the new constitution through Kenya’s parliament in April.
It is different here in Uganda.
Uganda has one hundred one districts with ten others waiting approval.
Uganda’s population is around thirty three million people.
Those one hundred one districts account for about four hundred sixteen million dollars and three hundred twenty seven thousand people on average in economic and political power.
It is easier to see how civil society in Uganda is less able to balance the power of the state than it is in Kenya.
This means that the most urgent task of the Ugandan federalist is not the winning of an election.
State House is strong enough to push Parliament to do its' bidding.
There is six point five percent inflation adjusted economic growth.
That so little of this benefits the starving farmers of Kotido or the struggling shopkeepers of Fort Portal.
A serious devolution of power similar to but more complete than the efforts of the ninteen ninty three Decentralisation Programme.

Uganda have continually retreated to this law to stifle democratic expression in this country.
The main celebrants of the judgment were journalists because we have born the biggest brunt of this law.
The Nataional Resistance Movement government and President Yoweri Museveni specifically should celebrate too.
In Uganda, the president is not born but elected.
The cancellation of the law by the courts was a major national news item and was carried on all major news networks across the world.
The National Resistance Movement should have taken this credit by arguing that it has established independent courts that are actively promoting democracy.
But it reflects the National Resistance Movement in the light as a regime hold onto an anti-democratic colonial relic.
Going to court to challenge certain laws that are inconsistent with the constitution publicized in ninteen nity five.
We were only helping advance the nation-building process apparently set in motion by the National Resistance Movement.
Therefore the National Resistance Movement government should have joined journalists to celebrate the victory.
Since it came to office, the National Resistance Movement has not abolish a single anti-democratic law.
Yet overall, the National Resistance Movement is fighting yesterday’s war.
For increasingly, newspapers are dying in Uganda.
However, since Uganda was connected by fiber-optic cable to the ocean, the technological foundation of a free media is uniting.
First, over half a million Ugandans are visiting the internet daily.
By two thousand fifteen, internet access is going to cost only five percent of its two thousand five price.
The reduction of technology would double the performance at half the price, giving technological innovation a price performance ratio of one to four.
From this perspective, an iPad that costs one thousand five hundred dollars today will sell for less than ninty four dollars in two thousand forteen.
As I write, Uganda has over eleven million mobile phone lines sold.
Since many people have more than one line, we can cut price three million lines.
This leaves eight million Ugandans with a mobile line.
The adult population of Uganda is only thirteen million (out of thirty two people).
The ability to send tonnes of data through cyber space in a second is impossible.
Uganda was producing only two thousand university graduates per year in ninteen ninty four (when I joined Makerere).
Indeed, the number of young Ugandans already hooked on Facebook and Twitter is growing every night and the debate on blogs is bloody.
Most “intellectuals” in Africa have remained blind to these structural changes taking place before our own eyes.
We were only helping advance the modernize process apparently set in motion by the National Resistance Movement.
Therefore the National Resistance Movement government should have joined journalists to celebrate the victory.
On the morning of August twenty fifth, two thousand ten a dozen or so journalists screamed into the registrar’s gloomy basement office.
This is because a High Court ruling in September two thousand nine abolished the creation of two hundred eight districts after ninteen ninty two, claiming there was no constitutional basis for it.
Its Gross Domestic Product at Purchasing Power Parity is about sixty three point five billion dollars or one thousand six hundred dollars per head per year.
And eight hundred sixty nine people in economic and political power.
Through the referen-dum in August.
They support a Gross Domestic Product at Purchasing Power Parity of about forty three point two billion dollars or one thousand three hundred dollars per person annually.
When you also consider that for almost three decades the power of religious, ethnic and cultural institutions was systematically opressed here instead of manipulated openly as in Kenya.
Or writing of a new constitution but economic development outside of Kampala.
And in Uganda we have a long way to go before the districts can make the centre feel their muscle.
In Uganda’s case, where around thirty five percent of the population lives in official poverty and where eighty percent scratches a living from subsistence agriculture.
There are great expectations that oil revenues will push growth higher as soon as two thousand twelve.
This is a symptom that there is not anyone or anything outside the centre which can force government to forego the purchase of Russian fighter jets and apply greater effort to food security and population growth problems.
Although introduced by the colonial state to suppress African demands for independence, post independence governments.
The victors included opposition politicians and the people of Uganda generally.
This could be so because of the political environment the National Resistance Movement government and Museveni have created.
It was in the suit Charles Onyango Obbo and I won in two thousand three.
A pursuit of the National Resistance Movement nation-building programme.
This is played by National Resistance Movement in trying to retain power in Uganda.
A committee of such men as Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Idi Amin would even find a child harsh.
The combined circulation of New Vision and Daily Monitor has declined by about twenty percent since ninteen ninty seven in spite of a big boom in education and increasing size of upper and middle classes.
Gordon Moore (Intel’s found-ing Chief Executive Officer) argued in the ninteen sixty's that it would happen after every two years.
Sixty two percent of our adult population is curved onto the mobile phone that is, modern technology.
It is producing over fifty thousand per year in two thousand ten and these students are increasingly taking advantage of different technology platforms.
I only laugh when I see it introducing laws to control the mass media as if we are living in the ninteen seventys.
This is when the East African Media Institute and I took the sedition matter to court.
This was at the Court of Appeals on Parliament Avenue in the hope of witnessing history.
In a shy, quiet voice began reading the summation of the petition that had been filed almost five years prior by journalists Andrew Mwenda and Haruna Kanaabi, represented by the Eastern African Media Institute.
Non-compliance with provisions of section nine of the Act attracts court proceedings against the offending party.
Where a political party or organization fails to comply with this section within twenty one days after the notice from the Electoral Commission.
Section twelve of the Act also provides that if the Electroral Commission fails to make a party comply, it petitions court.
When the party is convicted and court issues the deregistration order.
Under the Act, political parties are also required to have audited books of accounts verifiable by the Electoral Commission.
The National Resistance Movement has not met these legal requirements, but so are other political parties.
National Resistance Movement party is not officially funded by the government like in the case in Tanzania and South Africa where parties have business subsidiaries which generate revenue.
Elamoit missed his scholarship in India because of the university’s one week staff strike that was suspended on August twenty seventh.
Elamoit was supposed to get some necessary documents from the university to be submitted to the Indian University.
Elamoit arrived in Kampala on Augest twenty third from Gulu.
The lecturers vowed not to resume their duties until National Insurance Corporation pays them their earned savings.
Even at the duress of a gun we are not going back to work without our money,” said Tanga Odoi, chairman of Makerere University Academic Staff Association.
Five billion, which they saved with the national insurer between nineteen ninety six and two thuosand five.
This is not the first time a strike is frustrating Makerere University.
There have been many strikes by both lecturers and students at the eighty eight year old institution.
Strikes were reminders to the administration that hey this is our University,says Mugisha from campus.
I also suffered a lot in two thuosand six and two thuosand eight when I was doing my masters at the University.
The lecturers laid down their tools because of poor pay and we never had classes for close to a month.
Doctor George Lugalambi, the head of the Mass communication department at the university.
Makerere is a big institution and people feel that they can make a point out there by laying down their tools, he says.
Unlike before when President Museveni could not intervene in staff issues, now he has.
This time around President Museveni, in a letter to the Makerere staff dated august twenty sixth, asked the lecturers to resume teaching.
Staff members were defiant to suspend the strike questioning the seriousness of the president’s guarantee.
Let us unanimously suspend the strike President’s intervention buys three months for a solution to contested NIC payments.
Jimmy Siya staff members were defiant to suspend the strike questioning the seriousness of the president’s guarantee.
Give little time to the auditor general and update the president as the president deals with National Insurance Corporation as he requested, said Odoi.
The lecturers agreed to convene after three months to decide on whether to lay down their tools again.
We will use it again if we do not get our money,” said a professor from the chemistry department.
Earlier this year staff members announced a strike only to suspend it again after Makerere’s Vice Chancellor.
Venansius Baryamureeba, convinced the staff members that president Museveni would attend the fifty seventh graduation and would address their grievances in his speech.
However, in the end the president did not attend the graduation.
Secondly, top university officials, including the Vice Chancellor, were working around the clock .
The Vice Chancellor was hopeful that the president would assist them financially to develop certain projects such as their Kololo land.
President Museveni had previously given shillings four.
Five billion to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology after visiting the faculty on October second, two thuosand nine.
Despite having a big stake , makerere officials have been neglected by National Insurance Corporation, which has triggered more questions .
A lecturer who preferred not to be identified told the Independent that keeping Makerere University running is not an easy task and that such strikes help put things right.
Those who say that lecturers are striking all the time should know that strikes are a negotiating tool.
You have such a big university that is not paid attention to by a government that claims to have education in its priorities.
For instance, how else would the president have decided to pay attention to our troubles?
He adds that despite being the biggest university in Uganda, Makerere has meagre funds which can not satisfy all its needs.
When Nuwagaba was chairman of constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association the lecturers laid down their tools.
Doctor Saul Nsubuga says that strikes are mainly caused by the University council which makes poor policies all the time.
It is for instance the council that made us fall into this National Insurance Corporation problem and now they are not solving it.
Nsubuga is not the first to blame the university council.
In the meeting at the university hall on August twenty seventh, lecturers after blamed the university council for their problems.
In fact one staff member took to the podium before the meeting started and requested that the council chairman Mathew Rukikaire be voted out of office.
Members we are tired of this mess, our council has failed us and I request for a vote of no confidence in the council chairman right here and now.
Doctor Odoi and other executive members of The constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association had earlier told a press briefing at the university guest house.
We are in mourning that the council chairman can praise National Insurance Corporation for promising to pay arrears.
However, Odoi later apologised and said that the council chairman had called him and clarified that he had no interests in National Insurance Corporation.
Yet despite Odoi’s apology, staff members insist that the university council is the root cause of all problems and strikes.
Whether or not National Insurance Corporation clears the staffs’ savings remains unclear.
But as the staff members deliberated on the resolution after receiving the president’s letter.
If their money is not paid, it is clear that these Makerereans are more than ready to plunge the institution into yet another strike come November.
Tanga Odoi, President Museveni was told by Mwenda: You have won the election by ninety three percent.
Normally it is in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq that a presidential candidate gets such a figure.
Kagame, well in some of those places elections have not been taking place at all.
Many of them are represented in parliament.
Just sixteen years ago nothing existed, even human life was at stake in Rwanda, no institutions, absolutely nothing.
This is what operates in the minds of the people here; they have got a cow from Kagame, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
But there have been concerns expressed in the international media by international human rights groups saying look; in the run up President Kagame created an atmosphere of fear.
Mwenda, hosted President Paul Kagame of Rwanda on a radio show on Contact FM in Kigali, a day after the voting in that country’s presidential election.
Mwenda had started the show titled “Rwanda Decides” to promote public debate about the election in the country.
Kagame speaks about his election victory, claims on political repression like ours, it will simply happen.
The story they want to believe is that there is no democracy in Rwanda, that there is repression, and so forth.
For example, if you look at the case of the journalist who was killed here, the police investigated the case and the one who killed the journalist was arrested.
The Electoral Commission may apply to the High Court for an order to deregister the political party or organisation,” reads section nine part six of the Act.
The court prescribes the mode of disposal of the party’s assets, rights and liabilities.
Funding from the government on the basis of their numerical strength in parliament Daudi Migereko ,Kirunda Kivejinja ,Jim Muhwezi ,Mike Mukula ,Kabakumba Masiko.
When National Insurance Corporation operated a pension scheme for the institution.
The reoccurrence of strikes at Makerere is mainly because of the nature of the institution.
Then deal with the proprietors of National Insurance Corporation and managers as we did in the case of green bank,reads the president’s letter.
Later resolved to suspend the strike for three months and wait for the auditor general to audit the funds in question as the president directed.
Back to class for now student crosses at the closed faculty of social science Makerere university during the Lecturers strike on August twenty seventh.
Later resolved to suspend the strike for three months and wait for the auditor general to audit the funds in question as the president directed.
Amend staff relations with the government that have been strained for a long time on account of lecturers being perceived as anti-National Resistance Movement.
The corporation has managed to neglect over two thousand staff members at the country’s most respected university.
Professor Augustus Nuwagaba, a former constitution of the Makerere University Academic Staff Association chairman who led many lecturer’s strikes.
Said a staff member who could only be identified as Grace, amidst applause.
That they have started doubting whether the council chairman was working for the university or National Insurance Corporation as he seems to praise National Insurance Corporation all the time.
We are known for after sales service and genuine spare parts Snowmans Centre, Plot eighty nine, seventh Street, Industrial Area, Kampala.
That is how the Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have gained the confidence of the people.
A leading opposition politician was killed, a journalist who was investigating a story here was killed, a major and powerful political party called the Green Party was blocked from registration.
The weapon that was used has been retrieved and the killer has admitted to committing the crime and given reasons why he did so.
Haggai Matsiko Emanuel Elamoit, an international relations masters student at Makerere University, is a sad man.
The Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have managed to reconstruct the country, to bring normalcy to the country, to bring back value to human life, to the people of Rwanda and through social and economic transformation, people’s lives have totally changed.
A candidate who had potential to challenge Kagame and defeat Kagame called Victoire Ngabire was arrested and charged with divisionism.
He is well known and also a former soldier under President Juvenal, Habyarimana regime.
Although Mr President, assuming your critics say that this guy who was arrested and confessed to the murder, is just a ploy by President Kagame and his government to just create a lie, the boy will be in jail for just a few months and when the story cools down, he will be released from prison.
The candidate was very well known, a critic of President Kagame and he was killed in the runup to the election
In fact, this man was not the leader of the Green Party.
The leader of the Green Party is Habineza, not Kagwa Rwisereka who was unfortunately killed.
He is said to have been in the leadership of the Green Party.
Rwisereka lived in the Southern province, in the university town of Butare.
But of course the media there now blows things out of proportion, claiming this is somebody who had capacity to defeat Kagame in the election.
He was not even known in his home town of Butare itself.
"Okay, why did you refuse to reg-ister their party?" Mwenda asks.
This is how all these parties were registered including the Rwanda Political Front.
In the Green Party, they failed to do that.
At some point, the leaders of the Green Party went to Kampala, Uganda.
There was a meeting for the leaders of all the Green Parties in the whole of Africa and they met in Kampala.
So you were not afraid of the Green Party?
The President has a problem in the Rwanda Political Front then.
If things happen like this, the international media covers a story and the Rwanda Political Front and the Rwandan government are unable to put forth this explanation you have given me.
The international press, have prejudice, or even really contempt about Africa, about Rwanda, about these developing countries.
They consider themselves the do gooders for Africa.
So they imagine whenever Africans are hungry, we feed them.
They think Rwandans have to keep quiet and they will tell us what to do and what not to do.
Some of these countries where these journalists operate from have been responsible for the disasters that have taken place in our countries including the genocide in Rwanda.
When you see masses of Rwandans, given Rwanda‘s ethnic configurations and the politics that existed in this country for so many years, do you think those crowds that turn up, the cheering they give is all genuine?
Are you saying that this country, in the 2010, has traversed a long journey away from its politics where one’s ethnicity determined their position in politics, that they would turn up and they cheer a certain candidate called Kagame,a Tutsi, who doesn’t share a common ethnicity with the majority Hutu and be very happy about him?
But leadership that is determined to change that course will also succeed with the same people, and that is what we are experiencing under a different leadership that values the people of this country irrespective of their background, and rallying them for a common cause of building a new nation of Rwanda.
This is what Rwandans deserve and not a Rwanda of the Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.
People will say that President Kagame has a very sophisticated intelligence system and this system has spread its tentacles up to the last village, he has intimidated everybody.
Ordinary Rwandan peasants were harassed.
People are just so afraid of this man called Kagame and they have to show up at his rallies and to vote.
Millions of Rwandans, over 5 million Rwandans could be taken, intimidated, confused and manipulated and nobody complains.
You have reduced the incidence of malaria by almost eighty five percent, you have gotten ninety percent of Rwandans on medical insurance, you have done the roads and you have fought corruption.
Kagame speaks about his election victory.
Oh my God! Do you think the Green Party would challenge the Rwanda Political Front?
They could not challenge anybody else, forget about the Rwanda Political Front.
The Electoral Commission partnered with the United States government to post Uganda’s voter register online in a searchable and secure format.
The Electoral Comission launched the online voters register on August 26 at Hotel Africana.
The Deputy Attorney General Fred Ruhindi presided over the launch of the online voters register.
The United States Ambassador, Jerry Lanier said peaceful free and fair elections in 2011 are critical for Uganda’s future.
Jerry Lanier said the launch of the online voter register is a step towards realising this goal.
Jerry Lanier said posting the voter register online should boost voter confidence in Uganda’s electoral processes.
The United States government and the Electoral Commission are also working to develop an Short Message Service messaging system.
The online voter register is part of the United States of America’s ongoing support to democracy and governance in Uganda.
The Chairman of the Electoral Commission,Badru Kiggundu, appealed to all supporting partners to continue cooperating with the Electoral Commission.
Kiggundu said that the voters register will ensure integrity of all coming elections in Uganda if all Ugandans are involved.
Kiggundu advised voters to check their names at their respective polling stations to ensure they are not wrongly recommended for deletion.
Kiggundu called upon the people to check the voter lists to ensure their names are there.
Kiggundu cautioned that some people with ill motives might push for other people’s names to be scrapped off the voters register.
The oppostion had denounced the Electoral Commission register saying they do not trust the commission to make an accurate register.
Wafula Oguttu, said the launch would have been more realistic if it had been done a few weeks back.
Asuman Basalirwa, the Justice Forum party president, praised the move as the right direction.
The opposition have been demanding the removal of the current Electoral Commission on account that it is partisan.
Basalirwa said the Electoral Commission failed to involve all the parties in the process leading to the launch of the online register.
Basalirwa said the opposition was only called upon to witness the launch.
Basalirwa said the opposition should have been involved in the process of making the online voters register.
Basalirwa said the opposition's involvement would have helped in countering arising issues like the missing voters’ pictures on the register.
Basalirwa said the opposition needs to call upon the masses to embrace and ensure that all voter's names are on the register.
Hussein Kyanjo, the Justice Forum flag bearer hailed the online voters register.
Kyanjo said over one hundred villages have been affected.
Kyanjo said he had approached the Electoral Commission but it was adamant about his complaints.
Salaam Musumba, the Deputy President of Forum for Democratic Change, expressed gratitude that the parties have been able to achieve something.
Abed Bwanika, the president of People’s Democratic Party, joined other opposition officials to welcome the online voters’ register.
The opposition in Uganda has persistently asked President Museveni to breakup the Electoral Commission.
It appears the opposition is now applying pressure on the Electoral Commission from different directions.
The opposition Attorney General Erias Lukwago has dragged the Electoral Commission to court for refusing to scrap polling stations in the army barracks.
He said the Electoral Commission refused to phase out polling stations at Summit View barracks.
All these polling stations are in Kampala Central Division where Lukwago is Member of Parliament.
Lukwago says keeping such polling stations inside the military barracks would encourage rigging.
Lukwago wants the polling stations to be moved to a more friendly place outside the barracks.
Makindye West Member of Pariliament Hussein Kyanjo also has threatened to take the Electoral Commission to court.
Kyanjo said one of the illegal polling station is Nsambya Police Barracks.
We have advised the electoral commission in good faith but they have failed to listen.
Kyanjo said the opposition shall go to court or those with shallow brains will resort to violence.
Electoral Commission Secretary Sam Rwakoojo said they phased out polling stations in the barracks long ago.
Rwakoojo said the Electoral Commission cannot do anything about Kyanjo’s complaint.
Lukwago is seeking court to halt the ongoing display of voters register until it is published in the gazette and print media.
The opposition also is complaining that Electoral Commission did not involve them in constituting the parish tribunals.
Matthias Nsubuga, the Democratic Party General Secretary, says this is a plan to allow vote rigging.
Salaam Musumba says the law requires the judiciary to constitute the parish tribunals in consultation with the political parties.
Musumba added that political parties were never given chance to participate in forming the tribunals.
Musumba says the Electoral Commission did not ask the opposition a list of people to sit on the different parish tribunals countrywide.
Rwakoojo argued that there wasn’t enough time to properly constitute the tribunals as required by the law.
Rwakoojo said that in some areas of Uganda these parish tribunals were none existent.
Engineer Badru Kiggundu blamed the opposition for lack of grassroots structures in every parish countrywide.
There's another sticking issue of voters’ cards for 2011 elections.
The Electoral Commission has said it will not issue voters cards because it’s too expensive.
Musumba dismissed the Electoral Commission argument, saying it amounts to failure of its responsibility.
Rwakoojo said the voters’ cards are not provided for in the Electoral Commission budget because the government would be issuing national identity cards soon.
Rwakoojo said it would be financially irresponsible if the Electoral Commission issued voters’ cards now when government is to offer national identity cards later.
Tom Buruku, an Electoral Commissioner, said a lot of voters cards in the previous elections were still lying uncollected.
Buruku said the Electoral Commission has thousands of voter cards seated at their district offices and at the national office.
Buruku added that it is quite frustrating when people do not pick their cards.
Rwakoojo said voters cards which were not collected belong to people who registered late for the 2006 general elections.
By election time in February 2006 the Electoral Commission had not printed the cards for the people who registered late.
Rwakoojo said Electoral Commission only printed cards for the people who registered early.
Rwakoojo said some cards were misplaced during the sorting and distributing process before they were sent to the districts.
The Electoral Commission has given out cards which voters use to identify themselves at the polling stations.
Rwokoojo last week, said the voters’ cards had become irrelevant since some unethical people in town were forging them.
The Democratic Party has not entered, and has no intention of entering into an alliance with Uganda Peoples Congress.
Semogerere was commenting on the reported joint press conference held by veteran Democratic Party and National Consultative Council member, Mr Sebalu.
Semogerere said that the Democratic Party has not been a party to the statement.
Semogerere said the Democratic Party approves the proposals to hold a general election this year.
Semogerere said that if there will be any presidential election, such election ought to be held concurrently with the parliamentary elections.
Semogerere said that Democratic Party is opposed to the banning of political parties.
Semogerere said that his party is convinced that it is useful in the interests of national unity.
Democratic Party has no objections to holding the forthcoming general elections under the Uganda National Liberation Front.
Semogerere noted that some of the proposals made in the recent joint statement had not been discussed.
Muwanga and Sebalu told newsmen that their two parties, advocated for an electoral system that would allow the national political parties under their identities.
Mr Dan Wadada Nabudere, has said there is need to make some amendments in the 1967 constitution because it gives too much power to the President.
Nabudere was officially opening the Uganda National Liberation Front Jinja Branch.
Nabudere emphasised that the task of restoring democracy in Uganda was one of the top priorities of the Uganda National Liberation Front government.
Nabudere added that the Uganda National Liberation Front stands for national unity of all the people, regardless of political and religious differences.
The development of the online voter register was supported through a six hundred thousand dollar grant to International Foundation for Electoral Systems.
Hussein Kyanjo said he would sue the Electoral Commission for creating more villages and polling stations in his constituency.
Nsambya Police Barracks polling station is not yet fully open to the black.
Rwakoojo said he would consult the Local Government Minister on whether the zones the Electoral Commission used to create polling stations exist.

Low paid South Africans who last year campaigned for Jacob Zuma as the people’s president now say he has betrayed them.
These are some of the people who brought Zuma to power.
As the strike raged, the same people were potentially talking about getting Zuma out.
The Congress of South African Trade Unions was one of the key players in the Zuma for president campaign.
But there are also deep policy divisions and critics of Zuma in the unions want him to scrap the labour brokering system which bypasses unions pay negotiations.
Zuma has wanted to please everybody but in this kind of situation you can’t please everybody.
The strike could be a tipping point author William Gumede told South Africa’s Mail and Guardian newspaper.
The Youth League, previously seen as another pillar of support for Zuma, has even more radical policy demands.
After being criticised for indulging the ruling party youth league leader Julius Malema.
In response, Mr Malema, who once vowed to kill for Zuma is now turning his vitriol against the president.
Now that you are given power by the people of South Africa, you still go to the Queen of England and behave like you don’t have power from the people.
Until now, Zuma had not said much about the strike, instead continuing with his pre planned presidential duties.
What is Zuma doing in China while we struggle?
These are some of the people who brought Zuma to power.
As this strike goes on, the same people are potentially talking about getting Zuma out.
But Mr Zuma has also been under pressure not to destroy Africa’s strongest economy.
While advances to customers increased to three hundred sixty five billion from three hundred and six billion in June 2009.
Zuma was finally moved to rebuke him after the young firebrand praised Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe while on a trip to Harare earlier this year.
I dont believe Zuma has the capability to offer leadership that would steer up the country beyond her current challenges.
Zuma's obituary has already been written and will need all his survival instincts to see off these challeneges.
Industrial strikes detered Zuma's chances of acquiring a second term as South African civil servants staged an indefinite nation wide strike.
Between September third and nineth two thousand ten, the Independent wrote about an organised house party in Munyonyo in early tho thousand nine.
At one point, a whisper circulated amongst those in attendance that Qwela would be performing.
After the show, Qwela had to push their van out of the mud from where it had gotten stuck.
Over a year later, Qwela was nolonger stuck in the mud.
On August twentieth, they held a much publicised and hugely well received concert at Serena Hotel with fifty thousand shillings per ticket.
The band played, sang, and danced for over three hours and left the stage with an applause from hundreds of spectators.
One of the audience members, Darlyne Kyomukama said that the combination of Kinyarwanda and electric guitar was probably the best thing she had ever seen.
The music incorporated the strains of Fela Kuti, Santana, Eric Wainanina, Habib Koite and many more.
The shouts coming from crowd during guitarist Michael Ouma's massively elaborate and extended solos seemed to draw surprise and delight.
The production values, sound quality and professionalism exhibited at the show was world class.
For Joe Kahirimbanyi, singer, guitarist and band leader of Qwela, it was asn indicator of what's to come.
He predicts that Afro-Fusion will happen in a big way within the next two years.
The recurring themes in Afro-Fusion separate the style from others because musicians are technically proficient and have a wide variety of musical influences.
One song detailed the story of a child soldier in Nothern Uganda.
Music has been referred to as the bloodless revolution as explained by Mister Kahirimbanyi.
Francis said that they aim at creating a distinctive sound for Uganda that people will recognise as Ugandan just like Congolese music or West African music.
Qwela joins a generation of young, hungry artisitic Ugandans who are proud of their nationality and are acutely aware of the associated problems.

The promise of the genre was evident at Qwela's concert.
The people in attendance were diverse in terms of race, sex, age and were all enjoying themselves.
Probably the biggest cheer of the night came in response to mister Kahirimbanyi's rallying call of "its a little bit of Africa".
This is our music, this is Africa and this is who we are.
Most of the Afro-Fusion bands have been around for two or three years.
The large concert gave Qwela the chance to showcase their own song writing talents and also to express themselves fully.

Shock absorbers dampen the effects of rough terrain, as well as the slight bouncing motion brought about by the springness of the tyre.
Hydraulics and shock absorbers are related, if your shock absorber is leaking, there is probably a leaking hydraulic fluid.
Your shock absorber is probably made of a fluid filled cylinder with a sliding piston inside of it.
The piston absorbs energy through viscous friction which occurs when the hydraulic fluid presses against it and slows down its motion.
A leaky shock absorber is faulty because it has less hydraulic fluid therefore it provides less and less viscous friction as time goes on.
Shock absorbers make the drive smooth, though many people think that faulty shock absorbers do not need to be replaced.
In actuality, driving with faulty shock absorbers can extremely be dangerous.
If a shock absorber is leaking and faulty, it should be replaced immediately.
The shock absorbers or dampers in a car's suspension system smooth out the recoil action of the springs.
One or more faulty shocks absorbers affect a car's handling.
A telescopic shock absorber forms the main suspension leg with a coil spring at the top.
Rear suspensions have a leaf or coil spring with separate shock absorbers fitted between the axle or suspension arms and the body work.
Checking shock absorbers loosens the wheel nuts, jacks up the car and supports the chasiss on axle stands so that wheels hang free.
Inspect each shock absorber for fluid leaks.
Examine the body for deep dents and the piston rod for signs of pitting and rusting.
The ends of the shock absorber are bolted through rubber bushes.
Hold the upper and lower part of the unit and try to move it backwards and forward, then twist it about its mounting bolt.
If there is any movement, replace the bushes.
Place a jack under the suspension arm from a front shock absorber or under the axle at the rear while the car is still on axle stands.
Locate the top mounting which may be like the bottom one or a threaded end of the piston called a pin mounting.
For a pin mounting, count the number of threads above the nut. the same number must show when the shock absorber is replaced.

The President earlier on promoted patriotism nation wide.
Abrahams of Fort Portal responded and told him to stop insulting the Batooro.
The delegates held their breath at the fire spitting National Resistance Movement.
He made a bitter attack on his incumbent Amama Mbabazi.
“Mr Chairman, before I begin campaigning I have two complaints,” Otafiire started.
Otafiire left the campaign podium for the President where Mbabazi was seated.
Journalists rushed to capture that dramatic photograph of an angry Otafiire making his case before the President.
Otafiire is the minister of trade, tourism and industry.
After three minutes of dead silence, President Museveni rescued himself out of the crossroads.
We assure Honourable Otafiire that his concerns are being taken care of.
The voters’ register will be displayed at the polling stations,” said Felistus Magomu, the National Resistance Movement electoral commission chairperson.
Defiant Otafiire openly attacked Mbabazi over distributing different and less amounts of money as allowances to the delegates.
Mbabazi said one of the candidates was telling delegates that they complained of receiving lesser money than they were entitled.
I am that candidate and I will say it again,” Otafiire charged.
Mbabazi, who campaigned first, said one of his competitors was spreading malicious rumours about him on distribution of money to delegates.
Other contenders for the Secretary General Gilbert Bukenya, Elijah Mushemeza, Theodore Ssekikubo and Kibibi, had made their two minute campaign speeches.
Mbabazi fired back.
He counter accused Otafiire of making false accusations without consulting the relevant people for facts.
Delegates from far away areas like Karamoja, Rwenzori, West Nile, Acholi, Lango and Kigezi were given three hundred thousand shillings as accommodation.
Mbabazi did not comment on the different accreditation cards and denying genuine delegates into the conference as Otafiire, Bukenya and Ssekikubo alleged.
Museveni did not call back Otafiire to respond to Mbabazi’s answers.
Mbabazi appeared to have outdone his opponents.
Otafiire kept telling delegates that this is the time to redeem our party but they seemed to have already made their choice.
Mbabazi’s camp too was making similar rounds to groups of delegates selling their candidate.
It was Bukenya’s camp that was making rather quiet campaigns.
Mbabazi’s “super” authority in the National Resistance Movement cannot be underrated.
Even after the electoral commissioner’s reminders that campaigns had closed, Mbabazi continued campaigning for votes thirty minutes into the voting time.
It took the intervention of the president to announce that campaigns had closed for Mbabazi to stop.
When the results were announced, Mbabazi had carried the day with five thousand six hundred ninety four votes.
Other new faces were in the posts of national vice chairpersons for Karamoja, Northern Uganda, Central Uganda and Kampala.
Museveni was chosen party national chairman and National Resistance Movement presidential candidate unopposed and so was Moses Kigongo for national vice chairman.
Rebecca Kadaga was chosen national deputy vice chairperson and Michael Mukula for Eastern region.
Matayo Kyaligonza defeated Chris Baryomunsi for vice chairman for Western Uganda.
Why is Mbabazi still President Museveni’s blue eyed boy?
The delegates knew very well from the days of the Temangalo controversy when the President defended Mbabazi’s role in the land deal.
The fact that Museveni did not fault Mbabazi on any of the accusations, it spoke volumes about how close the two are.
Nearly every candidate who stood up to campaign had to repeatedly cite Museveni’s name to boost their campaign.
You could clearly see how candidates were fighting to endear themselves to Museveni.
Being the party’s Secretary General, Mbabazi was the lead organiser of the elections in which he was a candidate.
On voting day Mbabazi and his opponents only had two minutes to market their manifestos and candidature.
Apart from the advantages of incumbency, Mbabazi is a clever strategist.
He allied with most delegates and candidates from the North, East, Karamoja and central regions.
Each of the candidates from these region campaigned for themselves as they did for Mbabazi.
His only strong opposition came from the western region.
Indeed Mbabazi won in all the north, West Nile, east, Karamoja and central regions despite persistent accusa-tions of voter bribery.
Delegates who spoke to the independent alleged that Mbabazi’s camp was giving ten thousand shillings to every delegate who voted.
A delegate who campaigned for Otafiire admitted to the Independent that he had been given twenty thousand shillings to vote Mbabazi.
Overall it underlined the indispensability of bribery in National Resistance Movement elections.
Mbabazi’s camp had also pulled off a tactical media manipulation the previous day, which worked in his favour.
A government newspaper reported that the party’s National Executive Committee had asked Bukenya and Otafiire to step down for Mbabazi.
This created doubt among some delegates who had intended to vote Bukenya and Otafiire
On the first day of the conference Bukenya spent the most of the day doing damage control and denouncing the media reports.
Bukenya’s troubles were not over yet.
Knowing that other media would have carried Bukenya’s rebuttal, the government newspaper moved faster.
It was followed up with another story that Bukenya and Otafiire had defied the party’s central executive committee directive.
Bukenya had no more chance to rebut this.
Museveni addressed the party delegates at thirty minutes past two on Sunday night.
"If we had wanted to vet Bukenya or Otafiire out, they would not have come here,” Museveni said.
I put my thoughts to Central Executive Committe,” he added in response to reports that Otafire and Bukenya had defied his orders.
Only thirteen positions in National Resistance Movement were vetted.
P.hone text messages were sent to delegates claiming National Resistance Movement opinion polls had put Mbabazi in the lead.
At seven in the evening, another text message was sent to the delegates that provisional results now showed Mbabazi in the lead.
This might have swayed voters in Mbabazi’s favor but what cannot be ascertained is how many were influenced by the text messages.
Many things worked in Mbabazi’s favour.
Major General Kahinda Otafiire raised to the podium to campaign for the position of party Secretary General.
Amama Mbabazi was accused of printing different accreditation cards for the delegates with the purpose of rigging the elections.
Election chaos leaves National Resistance Movement in mess.
Museveni’s former principal private secretary Amelia Kyambadde won unopposed after the incumbent Ndaula Kaweesi pulled out at the last minute.
The senior National Resistance Movement officials were making accusations against Mbabazi at the conference.
This did not only affect their supporters’ morale but also created doubt about Bukenya and Otafiire’s loyalty to the party.
Museveni dismissed the media reports that Bukenya and Otafiire had defied the Central Executive Committee directive to stand down.
Mbabazi had seventy two percent followed by Bukenya with fifteen percent and Otafiire thirteen percent.
In fact there was complaining among the candidates that Mbabazi’s family had taken over the election process.
Why cannott we decentralise? Bukenya asked.
He was suggesting to Mbabazi’s family.
His daughter, Nina Mbabazi, was in charge of the party Information Technology system which stored information on every delegate.
His wife, Jacquiline Mbabazi, was elected chairperson of the National Resistance Movement Women’s League.
Her rival Nusura Tiperu accused her of bribing the voters.
Mbabazi’s wife was also handling the issue of refunding the delegates’ transport fare and allowances.
The hotels and restaurants that served food to the delegates were procured by the Mbabazi’ camp.
Even the ushers were campaigning for Mbabazi.
They veiled their heads with scarfs with inscriptions to vote Mbabazi.
Mbabazi had all the machinery under his control.
All the buses transporting the delegates were campaigning for him, how would you expect him to lose? said a delegate from Mityana.
In the June conference, the National Resistance Movement came under strong criticism by its members after logistics for the delegates were mishandled.
The same mess was repeated during the September sixth -ninth Special Organs Conference.
Hundreds of delegates queued up the whole day to get empowered.
Museveni’s reserved post Unlike in other political parties where the race for the party presidency was tight, Museveni’s was like God-reserved post.
Nobody stood against him.
Even those who had expressed interest in the post were vet-ted out by the party’s National Eelection Confrence.
Salim Saleh, Museveni’s brother and he is a junior officer in the army.
This is not a person who would put Museveni on competition.
In March this year Forum for Democratic Change nominated the incumbent Doctor Kizza Besigye.
They carried out three-month rigorous campaigns countrywide.
That competition was totally lacking in the National Resistance Movement elections for the presidency at Nambole.
This has played in the attacker hands who say the National Resistance Movement is a one-man’s party.
Analysts say that the fact Museveni still does not allow anyone internally to compete against him for the party presidency.
They say such elections would allow Museveni and the National Resistance Movement identify an emerging successor if he was interested in one anyway.
Museveni explains election mess Museveni dismissed claims that the violence in the primaries spelt the party.
He explained that opportunists within the National Resistance Movement who were charged with registering party members in the Yellow book.
This forced the National Resistance Movement to use the national Electral Commission voters’ register because of the greed of the unscrupulous party members.
He said four billion shillings was released for the primaries for sixty thousand polling stations.
Otafiire left immediately when it became clear he had lost the vote.
Vice President Bukenya too did not wait for announcement of the final results.
But analysts say the chaos in the primary elections has revealed that National Resistance Movement is a party controlled by power hungry individuals.
That is why all complainants in the elections were petitioning Museveni instead of the established party structures to address their complaints.
But Museveni had his own interpretation.
He said this showed Nationa Resistance Movement is a great party.
Otafiire’s camp was headed by Jim Muhwezi as the campaign manager and Brig. Henry Tumukunde as his chief election strategist.
They could not launch an open attack on Mbabazi because the president had cautioned them to conduct campaigns free of personal attacks.
It was only fearless Otafiire who came out boldly to campaign for himself.
Tumukunde is believed to be a good mobilser.
He would not dare restart his reducng troubles with the state especially that he would confronting security minister and a close confidant of Museveni.
Election petitions hang on the National Resistance Movement is grappling with about three hundred fifty election petitions arising from the primaries.
This is the most disputed issue the National Resistance Movement has to resolve or face a splinter force of disgruntled members.
Despite the mistakes in the National Resistance Movement primaries the elections have made the party stronger.
The contest has prepared the National Resistance Movement minds to the likelihood of a better way.
He said a committee headed by former Prime Minister Kintu Musoke that includes Professor.

He says Otafiire and Bukenya disagreed with Mbabazi in principle but disagreements were based on falsehood.
Opondo says the contest for various posts in the party prove to its critics that there is debate in the party.
He said when the claims against Mbabazi became many, he admitted and apologised, an acceptance of his mistakes.

Alex Kamugisha is angry.
He believes the Rujumbura County elections were stolen.

But Kamugisha says he is not dropping out.
Another person who has declared his intention to stand as an independent candidate in Mbarara Municipality, James Tweheyo’s response is serious.
Tweheyo and Kamugisha are two of the many National Resistance Movement members who, discouraged by the primaries, are planning to run as independents.
The National Resistance Movement primaries were so badly run that highly placed sources in the party have told The Independent that.
Felicitus Magomu has done a good job in the circumstances, but the Electral Commission needs a Chairman who is stronger.
"We all realize this,” said the source.
On the morning of September thirteenth when he gave the closing speech to the party’s Delegates Conference.
"If you contest as an Independent you will be causing confusion,” Museveni said.
Government Chief Whip, Daudi Migereko, told The Independent that a special committee is to be set up to deal with emerging petitions.
How the National Resistance Movement's Electoral Commission addresses some of those challenges will be a determinant.

"That will eventually lead to a method of getting a successor to President Museveni,” Opondo told The Independent.
After losing in the just concluded primaries for the ruling National Resistance Movement party flag-bearers’ race for the two thousand eleven general election.
Under the National Resistance Movement constitution.
When reminded that the National Resistance Movement party Chairman and presidential flag-bearer in the 2011 general elections, President Yoweri Museveni, has warned against such disloyalty to party.
At which the top party officials were elected amidst acrimony, Museveni got around and barked.
Whether most of the losers in the party primaries will either join the opposition or stay in the National Resistance Movement, but defy Museveni and contest as independents.
As a group, the independents have pushed National Resistance Movement strategists into a tight corner.
“The independents are very hard to control,” says Daudi Migereko, the National Resistance Movement Chief Whip.
Migereko was referring to the doublebarreled punch that independents could give the National Resistance Movement during the 2011 elections and thereafter in parliament.
The issue of disgruntled National Resistance Movement members who run as independents was high on the agenda when the National Resistance Movement National Executive Committee met in January.
Going into the meeting at Entebbe State House on January 11;
The National Resistance Movement Spokesperson, Ms Karooro Okurut, blamed independents on the Electoral College System, which was in use then.
Subsequently the National Executive Committee meeting, hoping to end the postprimaries wrangling, adopted the universal party member vote.
The just concluded National Resistance Movement primaries are likely to produce the highest number of independents ever during an election and even in parliament.
Apart of the problem is exactly what Karooro Okurut predicted, the cost of the election.
Karooro Okurut was right when she said using adult votes at the primaries was like running “two sets of elections”.
For this reason, some National Resisance Movement members who feared being routed at the primaries opted to run as independents.
Peter Claver Mutuluza is typical.
He is the incumbent Member of Parliament for Mawokota South but he was left in a lock when Amelia Kyambadde, the powerful former Principle Private Secretary to President Yoweri Museveni, threw her hat in the ring.
Amelia is a favourite because of her closeness to the President and Mutuluza had no chance against her in the primaries.
He says he will run as an independent Lt. Hannington Basakana and John Banalya who are going to contest against Government Chief Whip Daudi Migereko in Butembe County were in a similar situation.
Others are Moses Nagaya who will be challenging Nathan Igeme Nabeta in Jinja East, Naguib Kezaala who will be con party to fire its Electoral Commission bosses ,as jitters over independents spread National Resistance Movement fears trouble in 2011 after primaries Vice President Gilbert Bukenya.
His election in Wakiso sparked off accusations of electoral malpractices.

Alex Kamugisha who lost to Jim Muhwezi in Rujumbura, James Tweheyo who came third in Mbarara Municipality and Ronah Ninsiima who lost the Kabale Woman Member of Parliament’s slot to Agriculture Minister Hope Mwesige, will contest.
From Ndorwa East, Charles Musekura has petitioned against David Bahati’s win in the primaries.
Elsewhere, Zaake Kibedi who lost to Moses Balyeku in Jinja West, Santos Eruaga who lost to Moses Ali in Adjumani, Alex Onzima who lost in Maracha, Elizabeth Ociti Alimadi who lost to Betty Bigombe in the race for the Amuru Women’s seat, Kaddunabi Lubega who lost to Faisal Kikulukunyu in Butambala, Beatrice Nyakaisiki Byenkya who lost to Tafasi Kaahwa in the Hoima Women’s race and Patrick Isingoma Mwesigwa who lost to Henry Kajura in Hoima Municipality, say they will run as independents.
The most dramatic announcements were however those made by Vincent Sempijja who lost Kalungu East to Lule Mawiya, and Samuel Abura Pirir who lost Matheniko to John Baptist Lokwii.
Ssempijja said that being independent will help him fight “massive election rigging deeply embedded in the NRM,” while Abura Pirir announced that he had quit the National Resistance Movement.
Rigged elections sources within the National Resistance Movement and Electoral Commission indicate that all the one thousand and five hundred petitions cite ballot stuffing which resulted in figures that are either way above the numbers in the national register or in conflict with the total number of votes cast at district Chairman and Woman Member of Parliament’s level.
In Kalungu East, Vincent Sempijja has raised a red flag over disparities in the number of votes on the National Resistance Movement register and those on the national voter register.
He argues that while the total number of registered voters on the national voter register is about thirty two thousand those on the National Resistance Movement register were said to be thirty thousand eight hundred fifty three.
He wonders whether even members of the opposition participated in what was meant to be an apparently National Resistance Movement affair.
In Rwemiyaga County, Patrick Nkalubo’s fifteen thousand and four hundred sixty six votes and Theodore Ssekikubo’s fifteen thousand and four hundred twenty three votes show that National Resistance Movement voters there were thirty one thousand four hundred eighty.
Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kuteesa’s thirty nine thousand and eight hundred eighty four votes added to the fourteen thousand and six hundred ninety three votes that his two opponents, Isha Ntumwa and Vincent Kimbugwe, got gives Mawogola county forty four thousand and five hundred seventy seven votes.
Sources within the National Resistance Movement are also afraid that where the number of independents surges, the group might form another political party or join the opposition and take charge of parliament.
The National Resistance Movement thrives on control of the legislature and has invested heavily in controlling its Member of Parliaments' in parliament.
Under the relatively new multiparty dispensation, the National Resistance Movement which has a big majority in parliament has often opted to do most of its business in the National Resistance Movement parliamentary assembly and merely present them in parliament to be rubberstamped.
However, it has had no policy of dealing with dispute, especially from independents.
A raft of penalties and sanctions, including verbal and written reprimands from the chief whip, suspension of a member from the assembly, removal from leadership positions, and reference of a case to the part disciplinary bodies have been drafted to reign in dissenting National Resistance Movement Members of Parliament.
There are thirty eight independent Members of Parliament in the eighth parliament, one less than the number of the biggest opposition group, the Forum for Democratic Change.
Of the independent Members of Parliament, thirty two are disgruntled former National Resistance Movement members.
Some have signed Memorandums of Understanding with the National Resistance Movement party, but Chief Whip Migereko says that this does not bind them to supporting the party’s position all the time and that the party’s constitution cannot be invoked when dealing with them.
The law on independents, rule four of the party’s constitution, which deals with prohibited conduct spells out dismissal from the party of any member for leader of the National Resistance Movement who either campaigns against the party’s official candidate or funds such a candidate’s opponents, enforcement of the law has until now been impossible.
During the 2008 by elections to fill the vacant Bugembe Town Council chair, Migereko and Tororo Deputy Resident District Commissioner Richard Gulume supported independent candidate Sula Sentongo against the official candidate, Frank Kayemba who lost.
Migereko and Gulume were never punished.
Though it is no explicit, Article 83 of the Uganda Constitution which deals with the tenure of office of Members of Parliament, says that a person ceases to be a legislator if that person quits the party for which he or she stood and was elected to parliament to join another party or remain in parliament as an independent member, or if having been elected as independent candidate, the person joins a political party.
With the law on their side, losers in the party primaries have an open ticket to contest the 2011 elections as independent candidates and emerge as a major block in parliament.
"Is this the National Resistance Movement’s real fear?That is not something we are preoccupied with,” says Migereko.
Sources within the National Resistance Movement Electoral Commission indicate that all the one thousand and five hundred petitions cite ballotstuffing which resulted in figures that are either way above the numbers in the national register or in conflict with the total number of votes cast at district Chairman and Woman Member of Parliament’s level.
On the morning of September 13, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya walked out of Namboole a lonely and dejected man.
The elections to the post of Secretary General of the National Resistance Movement had just left Bukenya with an egg on his face.
So emphatic was Mbabazi’s victory that he got more than twice as much as the combined vote of all his opponents.
On the other hand, Mbabazi had always been projected as aloof, unavailable and inaccessible to party members, which made him look unsuitable to hold the office of Secretary General.
Following the chaotic National Resistance Movement primaries which most of the aggrieved candidates blamed on Mbabazi and the Secretariat, the elections had been expected to bring Mbabazi’s tenure as Secretary General tumbling down.
Bukenya and Mbabazi’s conflict is not new.
In 2007, Bukenya gave a recorded interview to daily Monitor in which he claimed there was a mafia in the government working to bring him down.
But on the following day when the interview was published, Bukenya appeared at a press conference at State House to “clear the distortions".
Sandwiched between Mbabazi and Sam Kutesa, he denied having said there was a mafia group plotting his downfall.
However it was widely interpreted that Mbabazi and Kutesa were the group Bukenya had referred but had now succumbed to their pressure.
They are the same National Resistance Movement heavyweights that brought him down at the National Resistance Movement elections at Nambole last week.
So where does this election leave Bukenya and his relations with the President and Mbabazi in the party?
Forum for Democratic Change’s Vice Chairman in charge of Western Uganda, Patrick Baguma says Bukenya should better jump before he is pushed.
Most of those who took positions had Museveni’s support.
Bukenya’s defeat only shows that he is out of favour.
"I don’t see him holding on as Vice President for long,” Baguma says.
Sources within the National Resistance Movement echo Baguma’s thinking.
They say Bukenya has put himself in a very vulnerable situation.
He has given Museveni a blank cheque.
"There is no better opportunity for Museveni to sack him than now because his popularity at home in the party is now in question,” said a member of the National Resistance Movement’s Central Executive Committee who declined to be named.
"That is a vote of no confidence,” he said referring to cases where Bukenya got no vote at some polling stations in the National Resistance Movement elections.
The same source said that as early as March this year, Bukenya was advised not to ‘demote’ himself from the post of National Resistance Movement Vice Chairman for Central Region to contest for Secretary General.
But not only did he defiantly go ahead to contest for the Secretary General post, he went for even a lower post of National Resistance Movement Chairman for Wakiso district.
Why did Bukenya go for a post he had earlier ridiculed as inferior?
Sources close to Bukenya say he had been aware that Museveni has been searching for someone to replace him as Vice President.
The preferred choice is a Catholic from Northern Uganda as National Resistance Movement prepares for 2011 general elections.
The move is calculated to either split or win over the opposition vote in the region and compensate for the reversal the National Resistance Movement and Museveni are likely to suffer in Buganda.
This according to the sources, knowing that the curtain is about to come down on him, Bukenya had to hold a powerful position of Secretary General to prove his political cloud within the party ranks and Buganda.
He has been repositioning himself in the central region.
For example though he supported the closure of Central Broadcasting Services radio, he was the first top government official to hand in a cheque for the rehabilitation of the burnt Kasubi tombs of Buganda.
The question now is whether the Namboole defeat did not leave him weaker and less politically relevant than before.
Where does defeat leave Bukenya?
A supplementary display of lists of particulars recommended for correction ,deletion from the register or,inclusion on to the register will be conducted for a period of ten days within each parish from 3rd - 13th September 2010.
The biggest fear is that once the losers contest, the number of independent Member of Parliaments will significantly increase making independent Member of Parliaments another power block in the Parliament of Uganda.
With enough numbers to influence parliamentary business or even take the National Rsistance Movement hostage, the independent’s numbers may be crucial in swinging the vote.

Kayumba shooting: The unresolved puzzle?
Highly placed security sources in Uganda told the Independent that before he was shot, Lieutenant General Kayumba Nyamwasa approached Uganda’s military attachment to South Africa.
Major General Steven Kashaka asked him to help establish contact with Kagame.
Kashaka consulted President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and sought his guidance.
It seems Museveni gave it a go ahead.
Kashaka then contacted Kigali and delivered the message that Kayumba wanted to “talk”.
Why then was Kagame skeptical when informed of this effort?
The July nineteenth to twenty first, African Union summit in Kampala was hijacked by the July eleventh terror attacks by the Al-Shabaab jihadists.
The summit which had been themed on “Maternal, infant and child development in Africa” was diverted to first discuss the Al-Shabaab latest terror missions.

He said that Acelam is now too weak to move before he was advised to carry him on stretcher after meeting Lotiba
Kony is still desperate and determined to meet Makas with whatever he is carrying.
He is also sure that if Makas succeeds to meet him, it will restore some commanders’ hope that Kony could still command.
Otherwise Makas’s failure to meet Kony could he disastrous to his command and control capabilities
If Makas loses everything, the meeting could be a boost to Kony.
Other commanders will not know what exactly Makas has arrived with and what he lost.
Since President Paul Kagame's recent election victory, the majority of Rwandans in and outside the country have been in festive mood.
Kony faces rebellion from his commanders.
On the night the election results were announced, I was in the Belgium capital, Brussels.
Brussels is a key site of anti Kagame and anti Rwanda Patriotic Front activism.
Television Rwanda showed scenes of jubilation as the thousands of people in and outside Amahoro stadium sang, danced and cheered.
President Kagame, his family and a host of government officials, were seen swinging to the music as the clock ticked towards dawn.
I was with fans and a few critics of President Kagame, his government and his party the Rwanda Patriotic Front.
He bragged about being the first member of the local Rwandan Diaspora to cast his vote the previous day.
Critics and admirers of Kagame rarely agree on anything.
The general argument that having a sense of humor and giving in to simple pleasures were not for which Kagame is famous.
I was watching television Rwanda on the internet and the scenes of jubilation were truly disarming.
The few voices, mainly of Rwandan officials and local columnists seek to tell the other side of the story.
They were literally drowned in stories claiming that Rwanda was growing into a typical African dictatorship.
The critics insisted that Kagame had no interest in opening up what they saw as restricted political space.
The Kagame government had no interest in allowing “the real opposition” or “the main opposition parties” from competing for power.
They were literally drowned in stories claiming that Rwanda was growing into a typical African dictatorship.
A common critique of the Kagame regime is “the climate of fear”.
Kagame regime has allegedly created fear to intimidate whoever wishes to engage in “real debate” about the situation in the country.
The critics claim that the climate of fear, has turned Rwanda into “a volcano".
Rwanda is to “erupt anytime” into mass violence and possibly another genocide.
Rwandans know that neither President Kagame nor the Rwanda Patriotic Front or the Rwanda government are without fault or weakness.
If one spent time talking to Rwandans about several aspects of government and public life, they would be seen as complaining.
Those whose knowledge of Rwanda is limited have a tendency of disregarding context.
Critics who know Rwanda well, are often guilty of willful distortion and twisting of facts to suit their purpose.
Rwanda is often portrayed as a country in the grip of a suffocating monopoly of power by the Rwanda Patriotic Front.
It is true that the Rwanda Patriotic Front is an overwhelmingly powerful political organization.
The most powerful was the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, the former ruling party.
The party leaders organized and arranged the genocide and mass murder of the early one thousand nine hundred nineties.
The Arusha grants obliged the signatories to share power.
Given its military might, the Rwanda Patriotic Front could have easily opted to rule alone and sideline or even ban other parties.
The country wide consultations led to the making of the post genocide constitution of two thousand three.
The majority of Rwandans argued against the return to multi party politics on grounds that parties had created the instability.
The Rwanda Patriotic Font could have easily capitalized on this anti party mood and barred political parties.
The consultations ran alongside elite focused consultative meetings presided over by then President, Pasteur Bizimungu.
The consultations included clergy, notwithstanding the soiled image of the church at the Rwandan secrets.
Some are directly responsible for its dirty history but are now determined to build a “new Rwanda”.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front has run the country in cooperation with seven other political parties.
The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party were both founded in opposition to the Habyarimana regime.
The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party were both founded in the early one thousand nine hundred nineties.
Both sponsored candidates to run against President Kagame in the recent elections.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front candidate was welcomed as a sign of growing political maturity in the country’s politics.
One of them is Imberakuri, founded by Bernard Ntaganda.
Ntaganda and some of his supporters ended up in jail on criminal charges.
Inkingi of Victoire Ingabire and Democratic Green Party of Frank Habineza, have been denied permission to participate in elections as presidential candidates.
The real opposition criticized President Kagame and the government for their failure to secure permission to register.
What Kagame’s critics have not bothered to do is examine and debate the reasons why the government has given for its decision.
In two thousand six, those restrictions were relaxed.
Rob Walker is a journalist.
What distinguishes Rwanda from its neighbours is the real climate of fear.
Mr. Walker, who was in Rwanda on temporary assignment, is not alone in making these claims.
Until the early one thousand nine hundred nineties, pre Rwanda Patriotic Font Rwanda was a one party, half military.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front’s path to power was for most Rwandans, their first introduction to war on grand scale.
The war lasted in the late one thousand nine hundred nineties, leaving many death and mass disruption.
It was a war that few inside the country had expected the Rwandan Patriotic Front to win.
This is not the fear critics of Kagame and the Government of Rwanda had in mind.
What they mean is that there are on going efforts by the state and President Kagame to intimidate the citizens.

One of the top housing managers in the country, rent on a four bedroom executive house in a prime location in Kampala.
According to a two thousand nine report by Knight Frank, it indicated the cost of a house in the East African countries.
In Tanzania, a house costs six thousand United States dollars per month higher than a similar one in Uganda.
Private construction of residential houses rose from eight and eight percent of Gross Domestic Product in two thousand to two thousand one.
Until recently, private construction of residential houses rose to fifteen percent in two thousand eight and nine.
In two thousand seven and eight, the sector grew by nine and one percent.

Bududa District Chairman Wilson Watira had a meeting with Minister Mukwaya.
Both the district and local leaders wanted the victims to be relocated to the neighbouring Sironko district.
Area Members of Parliament David Wakikona and Oliver Wonekha opposed the decision, initiating a draw in the resettlement exercise.
In the April 15th petition to the Prime Minister, residents of Bulucheke camp described that they were never consulted by district leaders on resettlement.
There is lack of abundant water resources, clinics,schools and insecurity from Karamajong cattle rustlers.
There has been constant conflict between the Bagisu and Sabiny of Kapchorwa and the Karamajong over the said land.
Bududa District Woman Member of Parliament, Oliver Wonekha says the cattle rustling by the Karamajong and the swampy land created fear in people.
The cattle rustling by the Karamajong and the swampy land created fear in people regarding the land in Sironko.
You cannot move people from landslides to floods and that is why the people rejected the land in Sironko.
Instead, the survivors proposed being resettled in Kayunga, Buikwe or within Bududa.
According to Watira, when the district officials and representatives of the victims went to Kayunga, they were shown a forest reserve.
The area was unsuitable because of the tension from the September two thousand nine riots which were occasioned by the Banyala.
The Banyala sought to culturally break away from Buganda kingdom.
On August sixth, when President Museveni was launching the Imbalu season in Mbale, the people asked him about the resettlement.
The president told them flatly that government will not resettle people in Sironko because of the land conflicts between Bagisu and Sabiny.
He said that the government was looking for public land in Bugisu, Bunyoro and Buganda.
The latest information on this matter indicates that Kiryandongo has been identified as the final resettlement place for the Bududa landslides victims.
On August twenty fifth, a team from the Office of the Prime Minister visited the Internally Displaced Persons at Bulucheke.
The Office of the Prime Minister asked for representatives to tour Kiryandongo on September first.
State Minister for Disaster preparedness, Musa Ecweru, says the resettlement will be an ongoing process.
Ecweru told the Independent that Kiryandonga was chosen because it is government land.
Private land owners in areas such as Kayunga outrageously overprice their land.
Kiryandongo also reportedly has a mix of ethnicities, which makes the Bududa people difficult to single out in case of ethnic tensions.
Other victims will be resettled to areas like Kyangwanzi and other government owned land.
Ecweru said the government is looking to resettle other areas affected by floods such as Butaleja and Teso as well.
According to Ecweru, the government will continue giving the Bududa victims relief food for six months.
The minister says Kiryandongo has fertile soils and supports the growing of such staple food for the Bududa people.
Kiryandongo has fertile soils and supports the growing of staple food such as beans, maize, and cassava.
The first phase will see three thousand Internally Displaced Persons transferred to Kiryandongo near the refugee camp.
Ecweru will also have to address the bureaucratic manner in which government conducted its business.

Kenya has made drastic cuts in mobile telephone call tariffs, posing a huge challenge to her Great Lakes regional counterparts.
Kenya posed a huge challenge to her Great Lakes regional counterparts to cope with the competitivenes in the sector.
Uganda charges three hundred forty Ugandan shillings.
Kenyans have been calling at an equivalent of three hundred Uganda shillings on average per minute across all networks.
The price difference has changed dramatically following the latest decision by Kenya’s telecom regulator.
Kenyans now call for an equivalent of about seventy five shillings per minute across all networks.
In Rwanda, the uniform call rate is ninety Rwandan franc per minute while it is five Tanzanian shillings per second in Tanzania.
This is still lower than nine shillings per second charged by Mobile Telephone Network per second in Uganda.
Uganda’s telecom regulator and Uganda Communications Commission’s attempt to fix uniform interconnection tariffs at one hundred thirty one Uganda shillings.
Last year attracted litigation between Uganda Communications Commission and telecom market leader Mobile Telephone Network Uganda.
Mobile Telephone Network sued Uganda Communications Commission.
Mobile Telephone Network insists that the one hundred thirty one shillings per minute was way below the realistic interconnection rate.
According to Mobile Telephone Network, the realistic tax should not go below one hundred fifty one shillings.
The uniform interconnection rate ceilings were slated to come into force on January first two thousand ten.
The case was later withdrawn to allow further consultations between Uganda Communication Commission and the stakeholders in the telecom sector.
Last week, Uganda Communications Commission issued a statement indicating that the new interconnection rate is already operational.
It will take effect from July sixth two thousand ten.
It is not clear whether Mobile Telephone Network consented to the tax which they had initially opposed.
Attempts to contact Mobile Telephone Network did not yield much as officials were secretive about the issue.
Even at one hundred thirty one interconnection rate per minute, Uganda telecom Network telephone calls in Uganda are higher than in Kenya.
Telephone calls on Uganda’s telecom network are much higher than in Kenya.
Zain Kenya slashed its call rates by fifty percent offering its customers a competitve rate of three Kenya shillings.
Safaricom controls about eighty percent of Kenya’s telecom market.
Safaricom swiftly responded by bringing its call rates down from twelve Kenyan shillings across all networks to three Kenyan shillings.
The Communications Commission of Kenya target was to open the market to competition and break up the ‘club effect’ established by Safaricom.
Mobile Telephone Network Uganda is operating a similar model.
The uniform interconnection rate would encourage subscribers of other networks not to crossover to Mobile Telephone Network Uganda.
Uganda’s interconnection rates in shillings.
Zain customers in Uganda get twenty five minutes for calling over twenty four hours within the same network under the Kika promotion.
If they pay two thousand Uganda shillings to enter the unlimited promotion, they get eighty three minutes,
Warid and Uganda Telecom have introduced similar arrangements for calling within their networks.
For Orange Telecom, customers can load airtime, make calls within the same network for a specific period without any charge.
Upon expiry of the period, the calls under Orange network are charged three hundred twenty Uganda shillings per minute.

Uganda will need to review the interconnection rates further downwards.
The Uganda Communications Commission claims that the uniform interconnection rates took effect on July sixth.
Fred Masadde, the Zain spokesperson, declined to comment.
Mark Kaheru, the marketing communications officer at Uganda Telecom, only referred the Independent to the company’s legal department.
The Uganda Communications Commission Senior Communications Officer, Fred Otunnu, too declined to comment, saying he was on leave.
The question of why the interconnection rates in Uganda are set much higher than in Kenya remained unanswered.
The Uganda Communications Commission media and public relations officer said that he would forward them to the ‘right’ officers.
Many of the new changes in Kenya’s telecoms sector are attributed to the entry of India based telecom giant Bharti Airtel.
Bharti Airtel acquired Zain Africa operations last April.
On his first visit to Kampala, Bharti Airtel’s international Chief Executive Officer Manoj Kohli, sounded an early warning.
He said Zain Uganda will soon rebrand to Bharti Airtel.
It was a clear statement of intent, especially targeting Mobile Telephone Network Uganda’s dominance of the market.
Bharti Airtel is famous for targeting low income earners by offering competitive call rates.
Zain Uganda is expected to announce lower call rates as a warning shot in a tariff battle that will be extended.
Most likely they would still be higher than Kenya’s because of the difference in the interconnection taxes between the two countries.
The excise duty on airtime in Rwanda was recently increased from five percent to eight percent.
Tom Mbalinda Nuwagaba argued that upholding the taxes was against public policy and would hurt taxable revenue.

On March 2 several villages in Bududa district were buried under a landslide that killed around 350 people.
Coffee growing, specifically of Arabica appears to have been struck hard according to area politician and Chairman of the Bugisu Cooperative Union, Nandala Mafabi.
250 acres of coffee gardens had been buried in the mudslide by March.
Mafabi told The Independent in a July interview that the full extent of the damage will only be felt in the future.
The landslides did not destroy the coffee crops alone but even the people who were involved in coffee production died.
The welfare of the Bagisu will go down by the equivalent of the 40 metric tons that was being produced from that area.
The Uganda Coffee Development Authority Eastern Regional Manager, Mike Butseya Maliro, says Bududa as a district had been harvesting about 20,000 metric tons of parchment.
60,000 trees of coffee were destroyed when the landslides swept through the area in March this year.
8 metric tons of freshly picked coffee for this year alone in the two harvesting seasons.
The smallholder producers in Bududa district are the leading producers of Arabica coffee in Uganda.
Uganda is among the 10 top coffee producing countries in the world.
Africa produces 10 percent of global output.
Uganda produced 198,000 metric tons of coffee in 2008/9 year, according to the East African Fine Coffee Association.
The Uganda Coffee Development Authority is predicting a 10 percent decline in output for the 2009/10 coffee year which ends in September.
Mafabi says the government has shown no interest in restoring coffee production in the area.
As a result, Bugisu Cooperative Union has started its own coffee revival effort.
Up to 100,000 seedlings have been secured for distribution in the Bugisu region.
Mafabi’s target is not merely to revive the destroyed coffee plantations but expand productivity to the peak levels of the 1970s.
Uganda Coffee Development Authority’s Maliro wants more long term investment to ensure sustainable coffee production.
Mafabi says Bugisu Cooperative Union has been providing facilities to the survivors of the landslide, including land so that they can cultivate.
Mafabi and Bugisu Cooperative Union are pushing ahead to acquire a US $ 5 million plant to produce instant coffee.
Bugisu Region was leading Arabica producer in Uganda before landslide.
Bugisu Cooperative Union plans rescue of Bududa coffee.
The first thing I encounter when I enter Kalita Bus Services Park, located next to Nakivibo stadium, is a security check.
The city is still clearly engulfed in fear less than a week after the Kyadondo and Ethiopian Village Restaurant bombings that left 74 dead and over 50 injured.
"Kasese to the right,” the bus conductor calls out in the background.
The manager of the Kalita Bus Services, Spear Mugambwa, is a man in his late 40`s.
Talking from a former lorry container that he has turned into his booking office, Mugambwa says the bomb blasts have heavily impacted the transportation business.
In a day we used to send nine buses out and into Kampala, but the number has reduced to five buses coming from upcountry.
The company, according to Mugambwa, used to net Shs600,000 per bus.
Because of the bombs and the fear they have created, Kalita is now netting only Shs2-3 million per day.
Mugambwa says people are not travelling from upcountry to the city.

What challenges do you face at Private Sector Foundation Uganda?
The major challenge today is that of the East African Community economic integration.
The pace at which it’s unfolding is way beyond the potential and preparedness of Uganda’s private sector to engage the regional markets.
The roles and tasks to accomplish for the Uganda government and the private sector are quite many compared to our regional trading partners.
Uganda forms its non-tariff barriers against itself because all these frustrate its access to regional markets and beyond.
This will help improve Uganda’s positioning in the regional competitiveness ranking.
Private Sector Foundation Uganda is also working with associations and enterprises to build capacities at the enterprise level through the provision of Business Development Services.
What will Private Sector Foundation Uganda's role be in the EAC Common Market?
The main role for Private Sector Foundation Uganda is to sensitise the businesses and the civil society and spread information relating to regional integration
What do you think will be the impact of the Common Market on Uganda?
The East African Community Common Market is about free movement
For Uganda the level of readiness for the East African Community common market is still bad.
All such obstructions are much likely to take their impact on the competitiveness and profitability of Ugandan companies.
What is the future of the Private Sector Foundation Uganda in the East African Community Common Market?
The future of the Private Sector Foundation Uganda and the private sector in Uganda is bright in view of the opportunities under integration

Fortirwari Karamira was a Tutsi and member of the Republic Democratic Movement party of Faustin Twagiramungu in Rwanda.
In 1992, he renounced his Tutsi identity, declared himself a Hutu and became one of the extremist Hutu supremacists.
He split from Republic Democratic Movement to lead its extremist wing.
Karamira then organised the worst massacres of the Tutsi.
The head of the Interahamwe that headed the genocide was Kajuga, a Tutsi who had made himself Hutu.
Basic knowledge of Rwanda would show 500 years of intermarriage and other social mechanisms of status change.
The Habyarimana government had to rigidly enforce an Identity Card system.
Many Hutu supremacists have actually been married to Tutsi women.
Former president Gregory Kayibanda was married to a Tutsi.
Karisiti Habimenshi was one of the leaders of the 1959 Hutu revolution.
Till his death, Karisiti Habimenshi took pride in having helped defeat Tutsi rebels in the 1960s.
His wife is Tutsi.
Kayibanda’s ethnic revolution against the Tutsi could not have been because he hated them but because it was politically move for him.
Social relations across the Hutu-Tutsi divide are even more complicated when you dig deep into Rwanda’s social structure.
Michel Makuza is father of the current prime minister of Rwanda Bernard Makuza.
He was the intellectual leader of the 1959 “revolution” and a close Kayibanda ally.
He was married to a Tutsi and some people claim that his wife was a distant relative of President Paul Kagame.
The wife of the late Seth Sendashonga is also said to be Tutsi and distantly related to Kagame.
It is hard to find a “pure” Hutu or Tutsi or one without relatives in the other group.
The story of deep ethnic hatreds between Hutu and Tutsi is a myth.
Take the example of Rwanda in 1994.
The Habyarimana regime had sought to create a mass awareness among the Hutu against Tutsi ever gaining power in that country.
However, the Hutu were not homogenous themselves.
Habyarimana came from the north which under colonial rule had provided soldiers to the army.
He had overthrown Kayibanda from the south which under colonial rule had produced the educated.
Political tribalism in Africa is as modern as the ipad, created and recreated by elites daily.
Do the Hutu and Tutsi of Rwanda nurse ancient hatred?
Habyarimana began his rule by eliminating the southern intellectuals including starving Kayibanda to death.
This set divisions among Hutu of the north against Hutu from the south.
As Habyarimana’s rule consolidated, Hutu were divided further this time along clan.
Habyarimana was a Mushiru and his regime was seen in that light.
Power increasingly went into the hands of Habyarimana's village mates and in-laws from Gisenyi in north-western Rwanda.
So the contours of division now went along clan lines and districts of origin.
Hutu from other districts began Habyarimana of creating akazu (kitchen cabinet).
There emerged the MDR which was the old Premahutu party of Kayibanda and led by Faustin Twagiramungu.
In fact Twagiramungu’s wife is a daughter to Kayibanda.
There came the Social Democatic Party.
Then came the Liberal Party led by Lando Ndasingwa, the only Tutsi in Habyarimana’s cabinet.
These political parties became signatories of the Arusha Peace Accords signed in 1993.
The principles to the agreement were Habyarimana’s Republic Democratic Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front would take 40 percent of the positions in government .
Within the context of Rwandan politics at the time, the main adversary of the opposition parties was Habyarimana.
Because he controlled the army, the effective way to challenge Habyarimana’s power was to ally with Rwandan Patriotic Front because it had the military capacity to counter him.
So the Republican Democratic Movement, Social Democratic Party and Liberal Party entered an informal understanding with the Rwandan Patriotic Front for cooperation.
This understanding realigned politics in Rwanda.
Habyarimana realised that in the ensuing government of national unity, his party would be in a minority.
Parties like the Republican Democratic Movement had calculated that given its Tutsi ethnic base, combined with the effectiveness of the ideology of Hutu power, Rwandan Patriotic Front stood no chance of winning the planned election.
If they could use Rwandan Patriotic Front's military power and add unto it their electoral strength, they would be able to gain and hold power.
But Habyarimana and his extremist allies saw it differently.
They realised that Rwandan Patriotic Front was going to capture power by allying with Hutu political parties.
The understanding between Rwandan Patriotic Front and the other political parties had realigned the politics in a way that created a real possibility that Tutsi could actually get into power.
Habyarimana decided on a double pronged strategy.
First, he created Coalition for the Defence of the Republic, a Hutu extremist political party as his fifth column.
Coalition for the Defence of the Republic argued that Rwanda is for the Hutu only.
Initially, the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic rejected all the Arusha Accords and was actually excluded from the power sharing arrangement.
But when this became clearly untenable, Coalition for the Defence of the Republic supported by Habyarimana began demanding inclusion.
The aim was to dilute the strength of Rwandan Patriotic Front and its allies.
Secondly, Habyarimana encouraged divisions within the other political parties causing them to split between their moderate and extremist wings.
In the ensuing contest, the extremists joined Habyarimana while the moderates leaned to the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
These contestations caused the failure to swear in the government of national unity on five occasions from December 1993 to April 1994 when Habyarimana was killed.
Now, under the terms of the ceasefire, the Rwandan Patriotic Front had been made to withdraw from its occupied territories to its area before the May 1993 offensive.
The areas from which the Rwandan Patriotic Front withdrew were declared a demilitarised zone under the United Nations which organised local elections.
Although all parties were free to participate, only the Republican Democratic Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front fielded candidates.
Rwandan Patriotic Front sent its Hutu leaders like Sendashonga, Bizimungu and Kanyarengwe to campaign on its behalf.
In a surprising and shocking turn of events,Rwandan Patriotic Front won all the local seats except for the top job of burgo master which was won by Republican Democratic Movement.
When a contingent of the Rwandan Patriotic Front military was sent to Kigali as agreed in Arusha, people lined up the streets cheering its entry.
These incidents changed the strategies of the architects of Hutu power.
They had succeeded in creating a widely shared social consciousness among elites and even ordinary Hutu that the Tutsi have no right to rule in Rwanda.
Short of genocide, their campaign to create a permanent wedge between Hutu and Tutsi would never succeed.
Therefore, genocide was not born of some entrenched hatred of Tutsi by Hutu.
If the architects of Hutu power were convinced that there was not a chance that Hutu and Tutsi would create an alliance, they would not have sought a “final solution.
Why then did masses of ordinary Hutu civilians pick machetes to kill Tutsi who were their friends, neighbours and relatives?
Many people believe that Hutu turned out in groups to kill Tutsi out of hatred.
The architects of the genocide put a price on the head of any Hutu who did not participate which was DEATH.
Secondly, many Hutu were told that if Tutsi came, they would be exterminated.
So many Hutu joined the bandwagon in a perverted search for preemptive self defence.
Therefore, genocide was not born of some entrenched hatred of Tutsi by Hutu.
These subtle reasons never find expression in both the pro and anti Rwandan Patriotic Front literature largely because of the complexity of the problem.
This background explains why it has been possible for Rwanda to achieve a large measure of reconciliation.
It also sheds light on why Rwandan Patriotic Front has been able to consolidate itself in power.
Kagame can easily win a free and fair election in Rwanda in spite of being Tutsi in a major-ty Hutu electorate.
The death last week of the former Ugandan president Godfrey Binaisa marks the start of the end of an era in Ugandan politics dominated by politicians who were born in the early 1900.
The death in April 2007 of the Secretary for Defence, Brig. Noble Mayombo, should have attracted con-tinuous, hour by hour media coverage than the death of Binaisa.
He was shaped by most of the same upbringing, education, religion, ethnicity, professional career and attitude as most enlightened Ugandans who attained young adulthood between 1940 and 1950.
This period was marked by young adults raised to aspire for formal, white collar, clerical jobs and a middle class lifestyle.
The writing was on the cards after Tiger Woods’ confession of his series of extra marital relationships had damaged his relationship with his wife Elin Nordegren.
There was nothing left in Tigers’ relationship with his wife Elin, after Tiger woods’ extra marital relationships leaked in the media channels.
It was a tough time for Tiger Woods’, as he put his career on hold to rectify his error, and spent some time at a sex rehabilitation clinic.
He also tried his best to repair the broken relationship with his wife Elin Nordegren.
The divorce settlement definitely made Elin richer by millions.
Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren were always in favour of sharing their children’s custody.

Football began across the Atlantic Ocean in England during the early eighteen twenties.
American Football, known simply in America as ‘football’, was invented with a mixture from both these games during the 19th Century.
In 1820, students at a New Jersey college, currently known as Princeton University began kicking a ball around made from a blown up bladder.
In 1609, a form of football was played in the colony of Virginia.
The history behind football dates back over three thousand years ago to the 2nd Century BC and China.
Documentary evidence can be found in a Chinese military manual from the Han Dynasty period.
Later in the fourth century Before Christ, the Greeks and the Romans had invented their own football variations.
The Greeks played ‘Pheninda’ which involved kicking, handling and running with the ball.
The Roman version was called ‘Harpastum’, and was played in teams with as many as a hundred people defending opposing ends of the field.

On Thursday August 19, First Lady Janet Museveni, irritated by the allegations being put against her son, entered the dispute.
Ms. Museveni who is also State Minister for Karamoja Affairs, fought back in the editorial pages of The Monitor that both Pulkol and Kiyonga were, “wolves in sheep’s skins” who were misleading voters to get votes.
Ms. Museveni argued that they are both bankrupt politicians struggling to save their political careers by pretending to speak for the Karamoja whom they have failed to serve all these years.

Up to now, in most areas of Uganda, the registers of voters have not yet been displayed so that voters can inspect them.
This is a requirement of the law which the Electoral Commission is most reluctant to apply and besides, the final voters’ registers have not arrived in the country.
What registers are to be used in a country like Uganda, where there is rampant scandalous use of government media and the government daily newspaper by one political party?
These media trumpet Uganda People's Congress daily as if no other party exists.
Every night, troops are deployed to display Obote’s pictures in towns and to pull down publicity materials of other parties.
This is the case in all those towns where Uganda Liberation Army is to be found.
The world and Uganda particularly is being told that elections are being held in Uganda.
The following article was published in the Weekly Topic, a Uganda publication, on Monday December 8th, 1980.
It was a special edition since the paper was always produced every Friday of the week.
This series is compiled and reproduced by John Njoroge. Uganda Patriotic Movement calls for fresh elections after December.
10 lists of malpractices by the same movement were published in The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010.
How does one explain the nomination of a Uganda People's Congress candidate who cannot construct a sentence in English and disqualify a University lecturer claiming he has no English certificate?
The Chairman of the Military Commission has not seen it fit to compel the display of registers as provided for by law because Uganda People's Congress does not need it.
As a final touch to the manipulation exercise, the Chairman of the Military Commission has unlwafully dismissed the Chief Justice.
He replaced him with one whose only visible qualification is his flair for meddling in Uganda People's Congress politics.
It is however hoped that legal ethics will not permit the so called new Chief Justice to take the oath and to accept such an appointment.
The Uganda People's Congress, led by Dr. Obote, the creator of Amin, is clamouring for a mandate from the people to form a government for the country.
And yet the Uganda People's Congress has, even up to now, failed to form its own party government.
The reason is fear of democracy within Uganda People's Congress itself as a party and the desire to install a one man dictatorship.
This is a flagrant violation of Article 7 of the Uganda People's Congress constitution.
Murders and other forms of harassment are now daily occurrences.
As recently as last week, a Democratic Party candidate in Kasese was murdered and although those who were implicated in the murder are known, they are still at large free.
Elections cannot be free and fair while one is in the grave and his murderer,a Uganda People's Congress candidate, is going to become a Honourable Member of Parliament.
The world in general and Uganda in particular must be informed that all our requests and petitions are to the Chairman of the Military Commission and to the Electoral Commission.
No single instance can be cited which would show that we sought advantage for our Movement to the disadvantage of other parties.
We wish further to inform the world in general and Uganda in particular that our Movement has borne some extraordinary instances.
We therefore call upon whoever will be in authority after 10th December 1980 to immediately set in mortion a process aimed at achieving this objective.
The situation today just like Uganda Patriotic Movement, was accusing the ruling Military Commission of refusing to reconstitute the Electoral Commission to accommodate representatives of other parties.
The opposition today is also making similar accusations and demands and the National Resistance Movement is giving exactly the same answers as the Military Commission in 1980.
This was when the Uganda Patriotic Movement protested the Electroral Commission composition.
The opposition is accusing the current Electoral Commission of being incompetent and too partisan to organise free and fair 2011 general elections.
For that reason, they demand that the Electoral Commission be reconstituted to have all political parties represented.
But President Museveni has flatly rejected the proposals the way the Military Commission rejected his similar demands in 1980.
They claimed the Electoral Commission is composed of competent people of high integrity and that there will be no change in its membership in 1980.
The opposition is facing media black out instigated by the ruling National Resistance Movement.
That also happened during the ruling of Military Commission to the Uganda Patriotic Movement and other opposition parties in 1980.
The Uganda Patriotic Movement and National Resistance Movement complained of harassment by the security in 1980, the same thing it is visiting upon the opposition today.
The Uganda People's Movement and National Resistance Movement accused the government of Uganda and National Liberation Army of trolling the city at night, pulling down posters of the opposition parties.
They went ahead and posted campaign materials of Uganda People's Congress.
The same thing has happened in all the previous elections under the National Resistance Movement.
Armed security personnel have pulled down campaign posters of the opposition candidates especially of Kizza Besigye around the city at night and hung posters of National Resistance Movement.
After losing to President Museveni in 2001 and 2006, the Forum for Democratic Change president Dr. Besigye challenged the outcome of the presidential elections in court following alleged rigging.
In his petition, Dr. Besigye accused the Electoral Commission of mismanaging the electoral process and cited examples.
In both petitions in 2001 and 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the elections were rigged and that the Electoral Commission failed to comply with the electoral law.
But the court declined to annul the elections saying the final result was not affected in a substantial manner.
By petitioning the Supreme Court, Dr. Besigye was seeking fresh elections, just like Museveni’s party in 1980 was calling for the same.
The only difference is that Museveni did not go to court.
He later decided to go to the bush to launch a rebellion.
The situation of the opposition in 1980 seems nearly the same today.
Museveni’s party complained of being denied access to the media at the instigation of the state.
Today, many media houses especially radios and Televisions have denied opposition candidates especially Besigye, space on their airwaves upon getting “orders from above” not to host him.
The state harassment of the opposition of 1980 seems to be replicating itself today nearly in the same form and substance.
The Independent, July 23 - 29, 2010 By Mubatsi Asinja Habati at 10:30 a.m.
Samuel Bukawa, 57, is waiting at the National Social Security Fund reception to meet the officer in charge of saver benefits.
Sitting on the blue-cushioned reception chairs, Bukawa, is anxious to get his hands on his 16-year-old savings.
As more people stream through the National Social Security Fund office, Bukawa, who has now been waiting for over 20 minutes, looks at me uneasily like he wants to quarrel.
In the National Social Security Fund Act, workers who save with the same are entitled to benefits if they are 50 years old, permanently incapacitated, or leaving the country permanently.
Benefits can also be claimed by a dead client’s relatives if the deceased had supported them financially.
However, for the last three years, Bukawa has been incapable of receiving any of the 30 million shillings he has saved with National Social Security Fund.
Today, he is no longer gainfully employed but still has the burden to provide for nine dependants.
On July 7, the committee of parliament on Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises, probed the National Social Security Fund for mismanagement.
It was found out that by 2007 the National Socail Security Fund had lost hundreds of millions of shillings to a fraudulent racket masterminded by employees faking beneficiary claims.
Between December 2007 and August 2008 National Social Security Fund hired Freddie Egesa, a private investigator heading the Global Equity Services Uganda Limited.
Egesa discovered that the fund was losing 200 million Shillings every 90 days to the scam.
He explained that National Social Security Fund employees were faking claims in the names of some beneficiaries, processing the cheques and cashing them.
After his 8 month investigation, Egesa testified in front of the Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises committee.
He said that he had discovered that the unscrupulous National Social Security Fund employees had generated unclaimed beneficiary cheques to a tune of 800 million shillings.
“These had become stale as the staff in the racket has failed to bank them,” Egesa said.
Set up in 1967, National Social Security Fund is the only social security provider for workers in the private sector and Non-Government Organisations.
This is because workers in the private sector and Non-Governemental Organisations are not covered under the Uganda Government Pension Scheme.
If a new law which is being debated under the Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Bill 2010, is passed, workers will for the first time in Uganda have a choice.
Workers can either save with the National Social Security Fund, a government statutory body, or any private pension scheme.
The bill was approved by cabinet in December 2009 and is awaiting debate in parliament.
It seeks to break the monopoly of National Social Security Fund by spurring competition, hopes to improve the quality of service in the retirement benefits industry and pensions sector.
The Bill also calls for an independent regulatory authority that will regulate the establishment, management and operation of retirement benefit schemes in the country.
In the recent years, the National Social Security Fund has been saving the workers' savings, with no political interferance and with better service due to competion.
The regulating authority will oversee both the public and private retirement benefits and pension providers.
The bill requires pension providers to have a prudent investment policy and to pay out high rates of return to the savers.
It bars speculative investment of the savings except if they are invested in securities, or in a bank.
A person who wants to establish a retirement benefits scheme has to apply for a licence upon payment of a fee.
Existing providers regulated by the Capital Market Authority will have to obtain new licences.
The new pension reforms are expected to be operational in 2011.
On July 23 - 29, 2010, The Independent published an analysis on how the new bill will transform the pension sector.
The Finance Minister Syda Bbumba at the inauguration of the new National Social Security Fund board in October last year said inefficiencies had prevented it from offering quality services.
She said cabinet had recommended the streamlining of the regulatory framework for the pensions sector and argued the entry of other players in the sector.
She added that this would not spell doom for National Social Security Fund unless the management fails to follow good practice.
With a liberalised pension sector, employees and employers will be free to choose their pension providers and it should enable workers to benefit and have reasonable interest on their savings.
Various service providers for individual retirement schemes will also be opened and it will be the job of their trustees, custodians and administrators to ensure that the scheme operates optimally.
“The proposed liberalisation of Uganda’s pension sector is a welcome gesture,” says Ibrahim Okumu, an economist with Makerere University’s Faculty of Economics and Management.
“It’s likely to bring on board more competitive investors in our capital market." Ibrahim Okumu added.
Uganda’s capital market, he adds, in certain ways, depends on the number of investors willing to hold long term liabilities.
“As is now, it is largely the National Social Security Fund that can hold long term liabilities and consequently invest long term liabilities." he continued.
"This would not only avail more funds for investment but also would enhance Uganda’s growth process." he added.
Okumu believes that National Social Security Fund’s service, evidenced by the low interest rates it has been paying towards workers' savings, is expected to vanish as competition sets in.
“The elimination of the National Social Security Fund monopoly by liberalising the pension sector signals enhanced competition among pension service providers in a bid to attract many,” he says.
“Therefore, we expect enhanced investment analysis before pension funds are invested and consequently better interest rates on workers savings" Okumu continued.
However, Kiwanuka Kunsa, a consultant in the pension investment, says liberalisation in the sector is a welcome point but there are still concerns about how it will be implemented.
At one time it represented a testament to Uganda’s reputation as one of the most refugee friendly countries in Africa.
But recent events at Nakivale and Kyaka camps threaten to erode this reputation.
On July 14, Ugandan police, working in tandem with Rwandan authorities, used false information to round up and forcibly deport approximately 2,000 Rwandan refugees.
The operation, which was decried by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and human rights organizations, left two refugees dead and another 26 injured.
These refugees were attempting to leap off the trucks hauling them across the border to Rwanda.
On Wednesday morning an unusually large Ugandan police contingent flanked by Rwandese officers surrounded the two camps.
These Rwandese officers lured refugees to assembly points with false promises of food and information on appeals processes.
Warning shots were fired when the refugees refused to cooperate with the police trying to load them onto Rwanda bound trucks.
The 2,000 refugees are currently being held in transit centres on the Rwandan side of the border.
The 26 injured remain in Uganda at health clinics around Nakivale.
Over the last three years, the Rwandan government has intensified efforts to have Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries, including Uganda and Tanzania, repatriated.
On October 3, 2007, the first major forced repatriation operation was launched when 3,000 Rwandan refugees were returned to their country of citizenship.
The operation was carried out by police and armed personnel who stormed refugee huts at 2:00 am under the observation of United Nations refugee agency.
According to the Legal Officer at the Refugee Law Project, Salima Namusobya, such operations are a one off and they are coordinated between the governments of Rwanda and Uganda.
Over the years, United Nations High Commission for Refugees has held numerous meetings with Ugandan and Rwandan authorities on the repatriation of Rwandan refugees.
In Rwanda, the refugees are held at transit centres, but once they are released from these temporary holding areas, many of them will find their way back to Uganda.
"Unwanted guests," the Rwandan refugees, are forced back across the border towards Kyangwali refugee camp near Hoima town.
In a courtesy Photo, featured in The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010, it was said that, upon return,the refugees are far less likely to make themselves known to the Ugandan government.
They will also not make themselves known to United Nations High Commission for Refugees but will instead quietly disappear into the villages surrounding the camps in south western Uganda.
“Most of the refugees they took back in 2007 have come back,” says Nabusobya.
“Many Rwandans who are taken by force come back and register as Congolese refugees so this doesn’t help any of the countries involved". Nabusobya added.
"Two months ago a bilateral agreement was struck between representatives of the Ugandan and Rwandese governments facilitating the deportation of Rwandese whose requests for asylum had been rejected.
But Kai Nielsen, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees country representative for Uganda, had a concern.
His concern was that among those deported on 14, July were people whose asylum claims had not yet been conclusively rejected.
Witness testimony from family members at the Ugandan refugee settlements indicate that a number of individuals had already been granted refugee status.
However those together with those still involved in the appeal process, were among those forced across the border.
Nielsen further stated how unusual it was for Rwandan police to be present on Ugandan soil.
The Kigali government has held the position for some time that there is no longer any need for Rwanda’s citizens to claim refugee status anywhere else in the world
Uganda, while still accepting asylum claims, has rejected 98 per cent of asylum applications from Rwandan citizens in the last year.
Many Rwandan refugees came to Uganda fleeing the 1994 genocide, while others have fled Rwanda recently for political reasons.
The Refugee Law Project has found that most Rwandan refugees are unwilling to go back because of fear of persecution through the Gacaca court system.
“These refugees have gone back and have faced persecution, others have problems with property restitution,” said Namusobya.
There are reports from those who return saying, people in government occupied their land and refugee agencies in Rwanda are not doing enough to integrate those that are taken back.
Human Rights Watch has indicated that although the Rwandese government has made notable progress in reforming its judicial system since 2004, there is little assurance for free and fair trials.
There have also been rights violation concerns in Rwanda, including increased insecurity and political repression in the period leading up to presidential elections on August 9.
Nielsen questions Uganda’s cooperation in the forced repatriation.
“I personally don’t see the reason for being so insistent on returning these people to Rwanda,” he said.
“I don’t think that they were a security threat or a financial burden to Uganda." he went on to say.
The Minister for Disaster preparedness Tarsis Kabwegye denies that refugees are being forced home.
He claimed those taken back were asylum seekers and said that the Rwanda government has a right to come and pick up “their stranded citizens"
But some of these refugees, according to Namusobya, should qualify for Ugandan citizenship.
Many refugees have lived in the country for more than 20 years and the constitution accepts them and for most Rwandese they even have a local language knowledge addition.
While the Uganda Refugees Act of 2006 recognizes that naturalisation applies to refugees, the immigration authorities in Uganda have continued to block refugees from acquiring citizenship.
Namusobya said the Refugee Law Project intends to petition the constitutional court to allow refugees who have lived in Uganda for more than 20 years to be allowed citizenship.
Most of these Rwandese have lost touch with their country of origin and so forcing them back ‘home’ cannot be the ultimate solution.
Refugees get off a truck at Matanda refugee camp in Kanungu district.
Many refugees forced back to Rwanda return to Uganda claiming they are Congolese.
In a courtesy photo in October 2007, Uganda deported 3,000 Rwandans on a Wednesday night when the authorities raided Kyaka II and Nakivale refugee settlements.
On that night, thousands of Rwandan nationals were violently driven out of those settlements.
A witness told reporters that the refugees were loaded onto four Fuso trucks and forcibly expelled late at night.
There were protests against the violation of the United Nations principle of non refoulemnt or involuntary return of people to a country they fled.
At the time United Nations High Commission for Refugees agreed with the governments of Rwanda and Uganda claims that return had been 'voluntary'.
There were reported cases of refugees who tried to commit suicide by taking a cattle dip acaricide in trying to resist the repatriation.
Refugees, some older than 50 years, had been forced to return to Rwanda.
Newspaper reports at the time revealed that the affected communities were mainly Rwandese of Hutu origin who had first sought refugee status in Tanzania but were expelled in 2003.
Most Rwandan refugees moved into Uganda after Tanzania began to aggressively return them to Rwanda.
Over 5,000 refugees moved to Uganda in 2003.
The Independent on July 23 - 29, 2010, in a declassified intelligence file by Rowan Emslie had information that on the night of the attack, everyone was in shock.
I talked to a young couple who had been watching the World Cup Final at The Lion’s Den, a bar immediately opposite Ethiopian Village Restaurant.
As Kampala slowly moves back towards normalcy, the mood around the city is changing.
People are starting to express anger, at either Al Shabaab or the police for not having done enough in preparation, as well as fear.
In a report by international relations expert John Mueller, he noted that, reactions to terrorism have often led to massive unjustified persecution, some of which is considerable historic consequence.
The Russian re-engagement with Chechnya in 1999 or Israel’s crackdowns against Palestine are instant examples.
President Museveni’s pledge to send additional 20,000 troops to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia was based on reactionary anger and a show of strength.
This followed the comments of an Al Shabaab leader who said that the bombings were revenge for Uganda’s deployment of peacekeepers in Mogadishu and was ‘only the beginning’.
Mueller is a renowned sceptic of how important terrorists are and has often argued that the relatively low death tolls cannot justify the massive killings seen in a retaliatory war.
Although some people like to proclaim that this is ‘the age of terror,’ Mueller in ‘Reactions and Overreactions to Terrorism,’ says, “deaths from international terrorism are only a few, annually"
Two American researchers, Jennifer Merolla and Elizabeth Zechmeister, spent five years researching the reactions of the general public to terrorist threats to see how people change their opinions.
Reports of xenophobic violence since the bombings have been disturbing, especially considering Uganda has a reputation for being an accessible and safe country.
What is perhaps more worrying is the lack of furore after the Ugandan Parliament approved the controversial Phone Tapping Bill last week.
Karin Bridger, a videographer and cultural anthropologist working in Uganda said, some people have embraced a ‘keep calm and carry on’ attitude, while others have become more crippled by concern.
Those who went to work on Monday morning relatively unconcerned, caused consternation with people who were more scared.
A lawyer, who asked not to be named said he went to work on the next Monday morning after the attack.
"Don’t worry too much", says one of those people who were less openly affected by the attacks.
There are also stories of an outpouring of anger and fear brought on by relatively minor things, maybe two or three days later.
A doctor who was called to Mulago,on the night of the blasts, working in frantic conditions at very short notice had this to say.
Coping with 7/11 aftermath, Mueller, a renowned sceptic of how important terrorists are, argues that the low death tolls cannot justify the massive loss of life seen in a retaliatory war.
In an introduction of an unreferenced memorandum dated 13, October 2008.
On the 08, October 2008, a meeting comprising of 24 former Allied Democratic Forces reporters led by their former Chief of Staff, Benz Tushabe Munyangondo, was convened.
The meeting was also important as a pre-emptive security measure owing to their grievances ahead of the 09, October 2008 Independence Day celebrations.
It was also about the just concluded Tripartite Plus,the Common Market for East and Southern Africa and the Southern Development Community Heads of government summit in Kampala.
The memorandum was signed by Hussein Maiga and Benz Tushabe on behalf of the group.
That they represent and work on behalf of the many Allied Democratic Forces reporters scattered all over the country having been pardoned under the Amnesty Act of 2000.
That it’s over 7 years since the former Allied Democratic Forces combatants voluntarily renounced rebellion against the government by reporting to various stakeholders.
These stakeholders included; army units/ detaches, Resident District Commissioner offices, churches and many others.
That it would be a wrong assumption for the government to think they surrendered because of cowardice or the Uganda People's Defence Forces fire power.
That they have written numerous reports and memorandum highlighting their plight to His Excellence, The President and The Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence.
That the resettlement package given to former Allied Democratic Forces was too small.
Nigeria has reportedly recovered its former president General Sani Abacha’s £3 billion.
After an agonising 33 hours, Patrick and Beatrice Kirumira Lubowa were relieved to receive the good news that their four year old son King Lubowa, had been recovered safe.
King Lubowa had been kidnapped by Uganda’s Al-Shabaab.
Beatrice Kirumira Luboowa is the daughter of Kampala businessman Godfrey Kirumira.
King was kidnapped from his parents’ home in Kiwafu-Makindye, a Kampala suburb, on July 24 by a housemaid, Soso Solange.
Swift action by the Uganda police and other security organs traced the kidnappers to a single room house in Makindye.
King becomes the second child to be kidnapped in just two months after another child Khan Kakama was kidnapped, murdered and dumped in a swamp just last month.
Last year alone, over 318 children were kidnapped and18 of them were murdered in ritual sacrifice.
In The Independent on July 30 - August 05 2010, in a news round-up, Yusuf Serunkuma said, the most renowned lines defining terror is that it is a “clash of civilizations".
”It was started by Princeton University professor Bernard Lewis in his 1990 article, The Roots of Muslim Rage.
Most recently, it was expounded by Cable News Network’s Harvard trained political scientist Fareed Zakaria in his book, The Future of Freedom.
After the July 11 bomb attacks in Kampala, I have come to fully understand that war is serious business, and more serious when it reaches your house.
If the July 11 had happened in Mogadishu, it would have passed as a small inconvenience and also maybe as a lead story on Aljazeera Television.
Kampala would be normal business mindless of our large military presence in this coastal country.
As it has always been, we would have absent-mindedly asked them when these people will stop fighting.
This question is an assumption that fighting groups in Somalia are unintelligent brutes fighting and killing each other without reason.
It also assumes that increased military intervention in form of peacekeeping missions can help save Somalis from finishing off each other.
This also assumes that foreign nations can help export liberty and other freedoms to Somalia, even if they seem uninterested in them.
Analyses of the Kampala bombings have become so emotional, as it were in post 9/11 America.
Hijab covered Muslim girls, and men with long beards or those wearing turbans are now the unfortunate recipients of public rage as the “bad guys”.
In a discussion with a colleague, I asked him what took America to Somalia against the Union of Islamic Courts that tried to give Somalia a resemblance of a government.
The union was trying this out after 14 years of civil war.
His argument was that the Islamic Courts Union had put in place an administration that cherishes stoning the adulterous, amputating thieves and compulsory wearing of full body garments.
Bernard Lewis called this “a clash of civilisation”.
As Professor Mahmood Mamdani has argued, modern violence is considered the inevitable hallmark of progress.
Israel’s shelling of the Gazans in late 2008 was considered crucial for Israel security, and so is the war in Afghanistan and in Iraq for American safety.
After the Septemebr 11th incident, frightened Americans considered any Muslim led country, an enemy to progress.
It piled all Muslims behind Osama bin Laden, which Americans had managed to subdue all along.
In America’s new frontlines, Aljazeera journalists Rageh Omar and Muhammad Adow who were born in Somalia note how the Union of Islamic Courts had brought peace to that country.
Warlords in the North, who surely thrived under chaos, were shocked by the rapid spread of peace and popularity of the courts.
They were not alone though, they had another equally distraught friend and that was America.
Fear: Was the headline on September 11th as the rest of the world; “saw a country struck by amnesia”.
Misled by the hypothesis of “clash of civilisations”, America was fearful of another stable Muslim led regime, which they thought would provide haven for jihadists.
In usual American fashion, the United States sought to bring the union of Islamic Courts down.
Using the Central Intelligence Agency, it secretly shuttled cash and ammunitions to warlord controlled parts of Mogadishu.
Faced with defeat in this move, with pro Courts Somalis staging a well choreographed and spirited defence, America sought conspiracy with Somalia’s arch enemy, Ethiopia.
Somalia was sent to the dogs.
Somalis are angry.
And as Franz Fanon has written “man is no to scorn of man, a no to the degradation of man, a no to the exploitation of man.
”And in the defeat of the Islamic Courts militia in 2005, an angry wing was born, the Al-Shabaab". Franz continues to write.
It emerged fighting Ethiopia, America and all its allies.
It is at this point that Uganda sends troops to Somalia on a peacekeeping mission.
Viewed through the lens of a conspirator, Uganda has imported terror in an attempt to export peace.
But the most unfortunate part of this bargain for America, and specifically for helpless Uganda is that the attack was on a Muslim country.
But as G.W Hegel has written in respect to the 1789 French revolution, men are able to die for a cause of greater value than life itself.
At that rate, Hegel added that they were ready to kill for the same cause.
But with a misguided cultural talk, Ugandans have the potential to drag their Muslim compatriots into supporting Al-Shabaab.
Culture talk, Al-Shabaab and political Islam Hijab covered Muslim girls, and men with long beards or those wearing turbans are the unfortunate ones.
Mwenda read with particular keenness President Yoweri Museveni’s article on July 25, where he defended Ugandan troop presence in Somalia.
I use the words “particular keenness” because I highly respect Museveni’s analysis of security issues.
While his article is strong and persuasive, I was not convinced about intervention in Somalia.
First, the president makes clear that he has not made research on Somalia even though it is in relation to the collapse of Siad Barre.
President Museveni should have learnt this from his reading of the United States experience in Vietnam.
These lessons constitute the Collin Powell Doctrine that was successful in the Gulf War one.
George Bush Jr ignored those lessons at great peril.
The president did not respond to critical issues like the objectives, key success indicators, timeframe of our intervention and our exit strategy in Somalia.
President Museveni should be a student of his own history and that of Uganda before he labels all insurgents in Somalia names.
Just imagine if, in 1986, the international community had branded him a communist and the United States decided to use African troops to prop the Okello-Okello regime.
In other words, The Organisation of African Unity forces would have come to Uganda to block a more meaningful resolution of the crisis of the state in our country.
That is what Uganda is doing in Somalia.
Sadly, the president presents the emergence of the Islamic Courts Union in American language as a group that sought to create an “Islamic fundamentalist state” governed by Sharia law.
What is wrong with this? Saudi Arabia is an Islamic fundamentalist state governed by Sharia law but Uganda has diplomatic relations with it.
What is so abhorrent in Somalia’s Islamic fundamentalist orientation and use of Sharia law that is intolerable to America and Uganda?
Besides, the primary objective in Somalia should be to get a group that can exercise effective military control over the country before we begin to talk of its religious.
I am inclined to believe that President Museveni is either misled or is posturing to Washington DC or both to take his current position.
There is no way a coterie of corrupt and opportunistic civilians without basic military know-how can establish security in Somalia even if propped by Uganda and the African Union.
President Museveni, more than any other African I know understands well how foreign interventions, however well intentioned, are incapable of establishing a stable peace, leave alone a functional state.
President Museveni writes about the Tanzanian invasion of Uganda to liberate us from Idi Amin’s murderous tyranny as, a very good thing.
However, the removal of Amin did not create stability but state collapse in spite of the presence of the Tanzanian People’s Defence Forces troops on our soil.
Ugandan exiles had misadvised President Julius Nyerere that resolving the post Amin situation required a democracy built on a consensus and coalition of different political groups.
Museveni made a counter proposal to Nyereresaying that the emerging coalition should be based on military organisation and capability, not on opportunistic politics.
He was ironically supported by Milton Obote.
Their disagreement was on the composition of the military coalition that Museveni wanted one based on 50:50 between his group and Obote’s.
Meanwhile the Uganda People's Congress leader wanted an 80:20 in his favour.
In the maneuverings that took place in Tanzania, Museveni and Obote lost.
That is how Yusuf Lule and the The Uganda National Liberation Front, completely lacking in military knowledge, came to power.
Uganda instead became extremely unstable as the state lost the ability to ensure personal security.
It was not until the Tanzanians withdrew when Obote and Museveni faced each other militarily in Luwero.
It is ironic that among African leaders, Museveni is trying to impose a solution on Somalia when he was victim to Nyerere’s well intentioned but failed effort to stabilise Uganda.
Isn’t it also ironic that it is President Museveni of all people who is labeling Somalis fighting for their country as mere stooges of the Middle East?
This was especially because he had been labeled a communist and a Marxist by the very people who do not see initiative in the struggles taking place in Somalia?
The Islamic Courts Union had made clear its desire to cooperate with the United States using its spokesman in Nairobi.
Had it been allowed it to consolidate, the United States could have leveraged technical and financial aid to moderate the extremist aspects of the government.
It would be the way it used similar tactics to dissuade Museveni from his Marxist economic policies of barter trade and state control of the commanding heights of the economy.
It is wrong for President Museveni to see in every initiative by the Somalis the hand of “ideologies” from the “Middle East”, whatever that means.
On Tuesday, we were taken to court and I was told I had no case to answer.
Instead of being released, I was taken back to Bramelene Prison to clear myself.
I spent two days there and was finally released on Thursday.
Placed security sources in Uganda told The Independent that Kayumba approached Kashaka and asked him to help establish contact with Kagame.
Kashaka consulted President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and sought his guidance.
It seems Museveni gave it a go ahead.
Kashaka then contacted Kigali and delivered the message that Kayumba wanted to “talk”.
Kagame was informed of this effort but he was sceptical.
First, Kayumba had appeared on Voice of America and made scathing criticisms of the government and Kagame personally.
Second, sources say that Kagame believes, on the basis of intelligence information that Kayumba was behind recent grenade attacks in Kigali.
The Rwandan president does not forgive such things easily.
However, some Kagame loyalists impressed it upon their boss that the country was better off having Kayumba inside than outside of it.
Kagame felt conceding to such logic would be like giving in to blackmail.
Kashaka had offered to travel from South Africa to Kigali to begin discussions with key Rwanda Patriotic Front insiders.
Those concerned argued that a Ugandan military member could not travel to Kigali from Pretoria without Museveni’s personal approval.
It is then that information arrived in Kigali that Kayumba’s driver had been issued with a Ugandan passport.
Uganda and Rwanda share a complicated relationship characterised by intrigue, dexterity and double crossing.
Rwanda learnt that when Kayumba left for South Africa, Ugandan intelligence kept close contact with him.
Kigali was told that Bichisha’s passport was delivered to him by the Ugandan police.
His air ticket was reportedly bought by the Ugandan police.
He was also reportedly driven to the airport by the Ugandan police.
Later in his prison cell, Gakwerera says, Bichisha revealed all this Ugandan police involvement to him.
Upon release, Gakwerere informed Rwandan authorities.
As top Rwanda Patriotic Front officials pondered what Museveni’s game plan was in this Kayumba saga, “a friend” from the American Central Intelligence Agency called Kigali.
He claimed that Kayumba had sent a message to Museveni seeking contact.
He said he had confirmed from reliable Ugandan security sources that Museveni had received Kayumba’s message .
However, it seemed the Ugandan president had not responded to it, at least not yet.
Was Museveni betting his time yet It is in this context that Kayumba was shot?
In Kigali, core people sat to assess the issue.
One option was that a faction among them could have taken it upon itself to shoot Kayumba.
Dicta Asiimwe, in the Election Watch under the 2011 national elections, said, the Democratic Party has started its primaries to elect leaders for all the party’s political positions in the country.
The one month exercise will end on August 25.
According to the party spokesperson Emmanuel Mwaka Lutukumoi, Democratic Party district councils will choose the dates when they want to hold the primaries in their respective areas.
However, they must submit names of the flag bearers immediately after August 25.
The party has also asked members who will stand as party flag bearers to pay two hundred thousand shillings to the party treasury for Member of Parliament.
However, Democratic Party Secretary General Matia Nsubuga says the members know the money is necessary to prepare for the primaries.
“We are not like the National Resistance Movement", Matia Nsubuga said.
We get our money from our supporters,” Nsubuga added.
He says that while the National Resistance Movement uses public funds for the party activities, Democratic Party has to raise money from its supporters to finance party activities.
However, Lulume Bayiga, Buikwe South Member of Parliamnet and the Secretary General of the Sam Lubega faction, says, Democratic Party would be better off settling the internal divisions first.
He says he believes the Democratic Party President Norbert Mao and Secretary General Matia Nsubuga are not interested in the party reconciliation.
Mukono North Member of Parliament Betty Nambooze says, she will participate in the Mao led Democratic Party’s primaries despite the fact that the two have not been on good terms.
This was because Mao had sided with the former party President Sebaana Kizito and went to Mbale for the delegate’s conference living Nambooze and other party members behind.
“We shall have nominations for the general elections in two months, and we have to be prepared to participate,” Nambooze said.
Nambooze also joined Suubi a coalition of Buganda politicians aligned to Inter-Party Cooperation and is currently in conflict with Democrtic Party.
The party has also castigated Kampala Central Member of Parliament Erias Lukwago for supporting the Inter-Party Cooperation.
Lutukumoi said those “renegade” members are welcome to contest in the Democratic Party primaries but they are warned.
He said this because the party would field candidates to stand against Democratic Party members who will not participate in the party’s primaries.
He says the party constitution requires that candidates who stand on the Democratic Party ticket must first go through the primaries.
“We are doing this under the party constitution and everybody must abide by it,” Lutukumoi says.
Nambooze asked why she was being asked whether she will participate in the primaries if that is the position she will take while Lukwago did not confirm his participation.
The Democratic Party National Women Chairperson Maxensia Takirambule accused Nambooze and other “renegade” Democratic Party members of confusing the public by associating with Suubi 2011.
Suubi 2011 which is a political pressure group allied to Inter-Party Cooperation, and then claiming they are members of Democratic Party.
She said they should be Democratic Party or stay in Suubi and leave the party.
The Independent of July 30 - August 05, 2010, had Solomon Kimbugwe reporting that the Conservative Party had named an unknown candidate as its flag bearer to challenge two presidential candidates.
Those two were Forum for Democratic Change’s Kizza Besigye and Olara Otunnu of Uganda People's Congress for the Interparty Cooperation’s joint candidate in the national presidential elections.
Lukwago and Nambooze were wondering whether the “renegades” will take part in Democratic Party primaries?
Prof. James Kigongo has no known political or public profile other than having once been a head of the Department of Philosophy at Makerere University.
The highest known political leadership position he has held is advisor to Conservative Party President Ken Lukyamuzi.
Kigongo was elected during the Conservative Party national conference of 60 delegates representing the regions rather than districts, on July, 23 in Kampala.
He defeated Wasiebe Magina, the Conservative Party Vice Chairman for Eastern region with 32 votes out of 60 voting delegates.
Probably the biggest thing the election of Kigongo has proved is that the federalism is its strong value.
Kigongo is a known monarchist and federalist.
This shows that Buganda’s most cherished value of federalism would be a key component of the Inter-party Cooperation.
However sending Kigongo to face Besigye and Otunnu in a political race is like placing apples and mangoes together and ask customers to pick the better choice.
It suggests, and rather strongly, that the race for the opposition presidential candidate realistically lies between Otunnu and Besigye.
However there is an important, though not crucial, a lesson from the election of Kigongo to hold the torch for Conservative Party.
All political parties have demonstrated this except the National Resistance Movement.
Uganda People's Congress has changed its leadership from Miria Obote to Otunnu in less than five years.
Miria Obote had been elected after the death of her husband Milton Obote who had been the exile party president.
The Democratic Party, its internal wrangles not withstanding, has changed its leadership twice since the National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986.
The Forum for Democratic Change, the youngest of the big four parties, having been formed in 2004, is also likely to change its leadership after 2011.
The incumbent Dr. Kizza Besigye has already said he will not seek re-election to lead the party beyond the current term.
Among parties that are more than 10 years old, it’s only the National Resistance Movement that has not changed its top leadership or elected a new candidate.
It has been Museveni in the last 24 years.
Museveni has been the chairman of the National Resistance Movement since 1986 when it took over power.
The argument that the National Resistance Movement only became a party in 2003 but had been a system since 1986 only exists in form not in substance.
In 2002 the Constitutional Court ruled that the Movement was a political party disguising as a “system” because it had a chairman and all structures of a party no matter what one called it.
Is Uganda seeing the dawn of peaceful transition from one political leadership to another or is this just a cosmetic change?
In the Independent, in the Jul 30 - Aug 05, 2010 news, Ken Lukyamuzi was featured under national elections news.
Sam Serwanga wrote about the election violence between the years of 1980 and 2011.
Mr. Nakendo is Vice Chairman of the Military Commission.
"Yoweri Museveni does not have a private army", said Nakendo.
Museveni, the president of the Uganda Patriotic Movement, one of the four political parties contesting next Wednesday’s general elections, was allegedly said to be commanding and training a private army.
The chairman of the military commission, Mr. Paulo Muwanga disclosed this during a Uganda Peoples Congress rally at Kashongi in Nyabushozi, Museveni’s home area.
Muwanga who has been on a six day grueling tour of remote places, addressing Uganda People's Congress rallies in Mpigi, Masaka and Mbarara districts, gave a stern warning to Dr. Bernard Buzabo.
Dr. Buzabo who is deputy minister for Animal Industry and Fisheries was told to stop the politics of confrontation, designed to intimidate the Uganda People's Congress supporters in Mbarara North Constituency.
Museveni admitted publicly that he owns no private army and that he was not training any force.
But if anybody is training a private army, that army cannot match the Uganda National Liberation Army which is your army.
He turned to the county chief of Nyabushozi, a Uganda Patriotic Movement member who was accused of abetting intimidators of the Uganda People's Congress members in the area.
Muwanga said many of the Uganda People's Congress supporters who were killed in Ankole were reported by the former Prime Minister also known as 'Enganzi'.
Mr. John Kahigiriza is now a Democratic Party Member.
The African Investigative Publishing Collective seeks one million signatures to push for electoral reforms.
Kizza Besigye, Forum for Democratic Change party leader and Ingrid Turinawe, the party Women League have tested the wrath of the state.
Asuman Basalirwa of the Justice Forum too, has tasted the same.
They are going to collect one million signatures across the country to back up their petition to parliament.
This will be for electoral reforms and dissolution of the incumbent Electoral Commission.
Kizza Besigye, chairman of the Interparty Corporation Summit, was present at the launch of People’s Power Campaign for Free and Fair Elections.
This took place at Christ the King in Kampala on August 6 and he said it was targeting all Ugandans to join the opposition.
The Inter-Party Cooperation has widened the scope of agitation.
Pressure political groups like Ssubbi and any other institutions interested in free and fair elections will be incorperated too.
The Inter-Party Cooperation leaders are resolute on stopping Badru Kiggundu’s Electoral Commission from presiding over the 2011 elections.
They say the Kiggundu led Electoral Commission is partisan and has been the primary instrument of electoral fraud.
The fraud is on behalf of the National Resistance Movement.
They want an independent Electoral Commission based on a clean and verified national voter register.
The Inter-Party Cooperation rejects the voter register compiled by the Electoral Cooperation.
The Electoral Commission in its weekly press briefing at its headquarters in Kampala on August 4, the acting chairperson, made an announcement.
Joseph Biribonwa, announced that they had discovered 159,419 double or multiple registration cases on the national voters register.
A total of fifteen million two thousand seven hundred voters registered out of Uganda’s estimated population of thirty two million people.
Apart from increasing pressure for electoral reforms, getting one million signatures also brings to the Inter-Party Cooperation, more supporters on board.
Margret Wokuri, the Coordinator of National Alliance for Free and Fair Elections, said the move will boost them positively.
Ingrid Turinawe appealed to more pressure groups to join the struggle for free and fair elections.
It has gained supporters like the Inter-Party Cooperation Youth, National Alliance for Free and Fair Elections and Ssuubi coming on board.
Turinawe says the violent clashes during the National Resistance Movement primaries last week was a clear manifestation the party's violence.
Besigye also condemned the warrant of arrest issued against Uganda People's Congress president Olara Ottunu for alleged sedition.
The Inter-Party Cooperation regards the summons as direct political persecution.
The legality of the sedition charge is being challenged in the Constitutional Court.
Rukiya Makumaamin’s family is to laugh all the way to the bank.
The family of former president Idi Amin is about to pocket $100m as part of a secret deal.
He brokered this deal with Yasser Arafat who was the Palestine leader, in the 1970s.
Amin’s son Jafari Amin has confirmed that the family is pursuing the cash with the help of Saudi royals.
The money was a reward to Amin for shifting his allegiance from Israel to the Arab world.
Amin had initially been an ally of Israel which facilitated his coup against Obote in January 1971.
However, Amin later changed his political allegiance and in June 1972, he visited various Arab countries announcing his change of allegiance.
King Faisal made a reciprocal visit to Uganda in November 1972.
Prime Minister Prof. Apolo Nsibambi says he has directed the internal affairs minister to put up a policy for the cabinet.
In the Independent of August 13 - 19, 2010, Chairman and Forum for Democratic Change leader Kizza Besigye displays a campaign document.
The campaign document was about free and fair elections at Christ the King on August 6.
Looking on are Inter-Party Cooperations colleagues Asuman Basarirwa and James Kigongo.
Jimmy, an elderly Rwandan national is cleared to vote at the Rwandan Embassy in Kampala.
This was on the eve of the Rwanda’s general elections on August 9.
President Kagame won the elections without a doubt.
The Independent will host Jimmy soon, for a discussion.
The move is to strengthen public safety systems following July 11 Al-Shabaab terror bombings in Kampala.
Uganda has no more former presidents and will have to wait so long to have another ex-president.
The only surviving ex-president Godfrey Binaisa passed away last week.
Binaisa ruled Uganda from June 20, 1979 to May 1980.
He was overthrown on May 12, 1980 by the Military Commission headed by Paulo Muwanga whose deputy was Yoweri Museveni.
Throughout the 1980s and 90s, Binaisa practised law in New York.
Other former Ugandan leaders Gen. Tito Okello Lutwa and Apollo Milton Obote passed away in the last 24 years.
Idi Amin Dada and Paulo Muwanga too passed away.
National Resistance Movement devour each other in what observers fear could be a mirror image of next year’s general elections.
National Resistance Movement has been engulfed in violent elections characterised by shooting, pushing, shoving and accusations of bribery and other election vices.
The most grisly scenes were in Sembabule district last week with Lwemiyaga’s Theodore Sekikubo and Mawogola County’s Sam Kuteesa.
These two, raised under the same roof, National Resistance Movement, were at it again.
Sekikubo taught the Uganda police how to treat an opponent.
He ably took the Sembabule police chief by the collar.
Vice President Gilbert Bukenya was accused by his rival, Wakiso district chairman Ian Kyeyune.
Ian Kyeyune accused him of bribing voters with a lavish party at his home 12 hours to the voting time.
The National Resistance Movement disciplinary committee summoned Bukenya to defend himself against the allegations.
Bukenya however snubbed the summons, a reminder that he is still mahogany as before.
The National Resistance Movement deputy secretary general Dorothy Hyuha, was among the suspects of election vices.
Dorothy Hyuha was summoned to face the National Resistance Movement disciplinary committee.
The National Resistance Movement house seems to be on fire.
The World Bank and other donors on August 9, fired a warning shot of a 10% cut of their budget support to Uganda.
This was because the Uganda government had failed to address the “high-level corruption".
”The donors had planned to give Uganda $360 million for 2010/2011 financial year.
This was said by Uganda’s aid basket holders.
They include the World Bank, European Commission, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.
They said the decision followed findings of an appraisal of the government’s performance in 2008/2009 financial year, concluded in early 2010.
The donors are angry at the government for taking no concrete action against several high-level corruption cases in 2008/2009.
The cases were especially those cited in the Commonwealth Heads Of Government Meeting audit reports of 2008.
“More than a year after the Commonwealth Heads Of Government Meeting audit reports were issued, insufficient action had been taken", donors said.
In the 2008/2009 financial year, foreign aid accounted for 30 per cent of the national budget.
An arrest warrant for Olara Otunnu, the Uganda People's Congress President, was sent out to anyone who knows his whereabouts.
It was mandated to cause his arrest and to be presented to Lira Grade One Magistrate’s Court on sedition and sectarianism charges.
Magistrate Faith Everest Palodi, issued a warrant of arrest for the former United Nations man for failing to appear in court to answer the charges.
But Otunnu is no easy chap.
In a News round-up in the Independent on August 13 - 19, Andrew Mwenda wrote.
In the summer of 1995, former United States president, Jimmy Carter, organised a conference on Rwanda in Tunis.
The conference was to “convince" the Rwandan Patriotic Front to be more ethnically inclusive by appointing Hutu politicians to cabinet.
In attendance were the presidents of Rwanda’s neighbours; Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko, Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni and Tanzania’s Ali Hassan Mwinyi.
Rwanda’s Pasteur Bizimungu was in attendance as well as former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere.
During the coffee break, they sat down for an informal chat with Carter.
The former United States president turned to Bizimungu and asked him why he doesn't appoint a few Hutu into his cabinet.
Bizimungu requested Carter to direct the question to Nyerere.
Carter asked Julius pensively, “why can’t the Rwandan Patriotic Front appoint at least one Hutu to cabinet?”
"This would reflect ethnic inclusion” Carter added.
Nyerere answered in his characteristic sarcastic style; “I do not answer questions about tribes".
"Ask Mobutu over there since he is the master of tribal politics", Julius added.
A frustrated Carter turned to Africa’s iconic predator.
“Mr President,” he began, looking in the eyes of Mobutu, “why can’t the Rwandan Patriotic Front appoint a Hutu politician to cabinet?
The Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu is also a Hutu.
Some Rwandans seated at a table beyond, immediately drew up a list of the cabinet and gave it to Carter.
More than 60 percent of ministers were actually Hutu.
Carter was shocked and turned to all the other leaders and asked: “Why then are we holding this conference?”
This farce tends to characterise a lot of political discussions about Rwanda in Western media but most worryingly in Africa.
The narrative on Rwanda about Hutu and Tutsi nursing hatred has been spanning for centuries.
It is one of those grand distortions of history that has left an indelible mark on Rwanda's politics.
There is no writing of precolonial Rwanda that shows that the Hutu-Tutsi had constituted an antagonistic relationship.
Indeed, even the broader story of deeply entrenched ethnic hatreds between African tribes is part of this distorted narrative.
This narrative was fostered by 19th century European sociology and political anthology.
Political tribalism in Africa is as modern as the ipad that is created and recreated by elites daily.
It is not surprising therefore that an Afrobarometer survey of 2009 found ethnic consciousness strongest among elites than ordinary peasants.
Sadly, many African intellectuals and elites accept European anthropology as a fact.
They don't know that some of our continent’s largest “tribes” like Kikuyu and Yoruba were created by the colonial state.
But once created, these identities took on a life of their own.
For example, Rwandan Patriotic Front recently changed the name of the genocide from the “Rwandan genocide” to the “Tutsi genocide".
Because its legitimacy is partly based on having ended genocide, Rwandan Patriotic Front has constantly used the genocide to promote itself politically.
There is also a possibility of focusing on public policy as a campaign platform and recognising the dangers Rwanda faces from ethnic politics.
Politicians in the West can fight over public policy issues like healthcare.
Africans are expected to fight over identity.
In pitching their campaign on public policy issues, the Social Democratic Party has made itself look like pretenders in the race.
In other words, they are Kagame’s auxiliaries.
It is clear to me that Rwandans are not very boisterous.
For those who ignore specificity, they conclude that this is because the Rwandan Patriotic Front and Kagame have suffocated free speech.
The Independent of August 13 - 19, 2010 said those who know Rwanda well, will tell a crowd attending an oppostion party campaign.
Oppostion parties in Rwanda include Social Democratic Party.
It could be that the five hundred years of strong and authoritarian states has given Rwandans a distinct deference to authority.
Rwandans seem obedient to a fault.
On August 4, I drove from Kigali to Kirehe near the border to Tanzania.
I was shocked at the masses of people who were walking on foot to go attend Kagame’s rally there.
At Kagame’s rallies, I was continuously struck by the level and effectiveness of organisation.
This level of organisation is only made possible by the obedience of ordinary Rwandans to what the authorities have told them.
The Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Defence, Jack Nziza, said that even under former President Habyarimana, this capacity for mobilisation existed.
“Rwanda has always had a strong state,” Nziza said wistfully.
The problem was that Habyarimana did not employ this vital national asset for development but largely for remaining in power.
If the Rwandan Patriotic Front seeks to undermine free expression, it is easy for them to secure compliance from the population.
Rwanda enjoys the rare capacity of an African state that has unprecedented capacity to penetrate society and the public with its desires.
John Bosco Nivuyekure, aged 28, is a Hutu peasant in Ngoma, Rwanda.
I met him at a poorly attended rally of Ntawurikuryayo on August 7.
He was soft spoken, laid back and expressed little enthusiasm in his candidate while others sang and chanted support for Ntawurikuriryayo.
Nivuyekure said he joined Social Democratic Party because it stands for justice, development and social welfare.
When I asked why there were so few people out to support the Social Democratic Party, Nivuyekure had an answer.
He said that people who do not support Rwandan Patriotic Front are afraid to be seen publicly.
He said that, the local leaders who are largely Rwandan Patriotic Front will discriminate against you if you support other political parties.
One of the greatest achievements Rwanda has registered over the last ten years is the impersonal application of public policy.
I asked Nivuyekure if his children are stopped from going to school or his family is denied fertilizers or mutual health.
This was because some over enthusiastic “Rwandan Patriotic Front-looking” election official came asking for our accreditation, which he did not have.
Sam Mutabaruka is another Social Democratic Party supporter I met at Ntawukuriryayo rally in Bugesera.
Hutu and 33 years, he had the look of an educated and enlightened man.
However, people and their leaders at the local level do not understand this.
He said that Rwandan Patriotic Front leaders at the local level want to please their bosses in Kigali.
They did this by showing that everyone in their area supports Kagame.
That is if you are not in Rwandan Patriotic Front supporters.
“This tendency needs not be dictated by the centre,” Mutabaruka told me pensively.
That is why Social Democratic Party wants power sharing to begin at village level.
This is important to undermine the tendency of lower level cadres using subtle ways to induce people to join Rwandan Patriotic Front.
However, Rwandan Patriotic Front has been dragging its feet on this matter because they are profiting from the current situation.
In the end, Kagame romped the election with 93 percent of the votes.
That is for the people of Rwanda to decide.
Yet the size of Kagame’s victory only reflects the complexity of Rwanda’s politics.
The Rwandan state under Kagame has been effective in almost all the policy issues.
However, the major issue an opposition candidate can build on for a strong profile is ethnicity, which is legitimately prohibited in Rwanda.
In other words, the opposition candidates have been forced to run on issues where Kagame holds all the aces.
In Rwanda the population is 50% Catholics, 40% Protestants and 10% Muslims.
Social Development Party candidate Ntawukuriryayo, votes Liberal Party candidate Higiro votes.
Rwandan Patriotic Front candidate Kagame casts his vote.
In the Independent of August 13 - 19, 2010, Muganwa Gonzaga said the Rwandan Patriotic Front’s Chairman, Paul Kagame, drew unprecedented crowds.
It opened on July 20, at Amahoro stadium in Kigali and got bigger in the countryside.
Even in unexpected areas like the north western districts of Nyabihu and Rubavu, people were cheering and dancing for Kagame.
This is a region that had been the stronghold of former president Juvenal Habyarimana and his Akazu clan.
The crowds that greeted Kagame indicated how much the Rwandan leader has served as a unifying force in post-genocide Rwanda.
This has been set up by refugees seeking to return to Rwanda, to a mass movement that encompasses many supporters.
In preparation for this second multi-party election in the history of the country, the Rwandan Patriotic Front seemed well prepared.
If his detractors cannot recognize the support he enjoys, Kagame said, "they can reach for the nearest rope and hang".
After seven years of presidency, Kagame has been credited with doubling the economy and lowering crime.
Paul Kagame is re-elected easily on his record of improving food security, empowering women and building up Rwanda’s social welfare system.
Nevertheless, these accomplishments have been overshadowed in recent weeks by the shooting of former Rwandese General, Kayumba Nyamwasa, in South Africa.
Also the mysterious murder of Green Party official Andre Kagwa Rwisereka, the arrest of politicians and the closure of two critical newspapers.
It was only the Social Democratic Party Permanent Secretary, Imberakuri managing to be officially recognised.
However, Permanent Secretary, Imberakuri later failed to compete in the election after an internal squabble.
This led to a split and the ouster of its founding chairman, Bernard Ntaganda, who is in prison on charges of violence.
The Democratic Green Party led by Frank Habineza failed to get registered as did the United Democratic Forces led by Victoire Ingabire.
Ingabire had controversial stances on the Rwanda Patriotic Front’s behavior in ending the genocide.
Her statements on the treatment of Hutus too led to criminal charges that kept her movements restricted.
It is the long established parties, such as the Social Democratic Party, led by its secretary general and deputy speaker of parliament.
The Liberal Party, led by Senator Higiro and the Party for Progress and Concord, led by Senator Mukabaramba Alvera, entered the race.
Liberal Party, a party known to command a disproportionately high level of genocide survivors in its leadership.
This including Higiro himself, promised to deal with the issue of compensation for genocide victims.
Social Democratic Party promised more open public debate on major policy changes.
Those changes have been interpreted as an appeal to those disgruntled by the shift from French to English in Rwandese society.
Inside Rwanda, the situation was not nearly as controversial or repressive as the outside media made it sound.
Posters, colors and giant billboards of the dominant Rwandan Patriotic Front, were on the streets of Kigali and across the country side.
Otherwise the sort of tension that tends to characterise African elections was absent.
The population know that Kagame is not going anywhere soon, so confidence and support in him is widespread.
On July 4, the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Aronda received a radio message believed to be a threat.
Whatever little they were willing to give, they channeled to Non Government Organizations and wasteful United Nation agencies.
Uganda National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has strengthening networks all over the country through its branches.
That is about one third the pressure on the centre in Uganda compared to Kenya.
Alex Mugisha, a Makerere alumni, says strikes are part of the University culture.
The new plane has been christened Bukoba in recognition of the business support Precision Air enjoys from people in that region.
Australia’s fosters Nile Breweries parent company is considering a stake in Foster’s Group beer operations but has not decided on making a formal offer.
A number of potential suitors including SABMiller and Japanese Asahi have been looking at the business since Foster’s announced formal plans to split its beer and wine operations earlier this year.
Foster’s runs one of the highest margin brewing operations in the world.
Its brands include Foster’s Lager, Victoria Bitter and Pure Blonde.
By the end of last year, the company’s debt obligations stood at thirteen point six billion compared to seven point seven billion in 2008.
Otafiire said old habits die hard: “we are the very people who fought Uganda People's Congress castigating election stealing".
His former junior colleague, Alex Kamugisha is to contest against him as an independent in Rujumbura County.
The Electoral Commission displayed the National Voters’ Register from 11th - 31st August 2010 at each polling station within the parish.
In preparation for the General Elections 2011 as mandated under section twenty five of the Electoral Commission act (Cap One hundred and forty) the Uganda Electoral Commision displayed the register.
A clean voters’ register is the cornerstone for free and fair elections.
He first belittled the post of Secretary General as “small” but later contested for it claiming he wanted to strengthen the party.
Check for correspondences of your particulars on the Voters Register and report the dead, non citizen, under age, to the Officer, if they appear on the Voters’ Register.
The disorganised primaries worsened the problem.
Some of the losers have since declared that they will contest as independents.
Others are weighing their options.
The two constituencies, therefore, had a combined total of seventy six thousand and fifty seven votes cast.
One would expect that the total number of votes cast for both the candidate for the district Chairman’s slot and the district woman Member of Parliament’s slot would come to that seventy six thousand and fifty seven, but that has not been the case.
How come the votes cast for the Woman Member of Parliament and the Local Council five Chairman were in excess of those cast for those who contested for the Member of Parliament’s slots?
Besides, barring party members from contesting as independents would be a violation of the constitution.
Any move against the independents can only lead to unnecessary litigation, from which the party would emerge more scathed.
He is either bluffing or running a big risk, if he is not.
His situation was understandable.
Sources close to Bukenya had told The Independent late in August that the president had made a substantial financial contribution towards his campaign.
This did not happen.
The Vice President is meant to be the most powerful man after the president, but once he starts getting zeros in some districts, then you know his political rating is really down.
This, the insiders say, portrayed his as a politically hungry person.
The purpose of the display exercise was to enable the general public to inspect the voters register for accuracy and completeness.
It is very unfortunate that our democratic principles have been brought under examination.
It is unfortunate that our leaders are being found with ballots, cheating, ballot papers found on the streets.
But his camp was fear.
So he campaigned under ground and the results showed this.
Most of the petitioners are threatening to stand as independents if their complaints are not resolved.
This is likely to increase the number of independents in parliament.
The campaigns were stiff but there were no opposition generated.
The exercise has built democracy and debate in the party.
He says all the party needs is to ensure an effective mediation mechanism for those contesting the election results.
Instead he says he plans to run as an independent.
“I am loyal to the party, but not to the chaos,” he says.
I appeal to competitors who did not win in primaries, not to think of running as independents.
He said fresh elections will be held where grounds are considered strong and adjustments will be made where grounds are weak.
Other delegates who were lucky to have secured approval earlier were already attending the conference.
The returning officer also wants to steal, the problem is attitude, he added.
They were responsible for the mess in the primaries.
It has been a learning point for organising future elections.
That there is complete healing of the mistakes witnessed in the elections.
And make recommendations that will leave the party united.
Its Electoral Commission leadership and membership is to be reconstituted “very soon”.
If the primaries were stolen bring facts and these people will cancel results.
The party cannot be centred only in the Kampala.
You have the same person working on delegation cards, the same person handling transport, and the Delegates.
Same person ensuring that you are registered.
Literally they were in charge of the conference.
He has the money and was literally in charge of everything at the conference ranging from organisation to determining who accesses the venue.
The organisers of the conference argued that they were overwhelmed by the number of delegates.
They were also of no known political power.
Nobody was sure who would win the presidency.
The only competition was in the lower positions especially the Secretary General.
You can aspire for other positions in the party, but not the presidency.
He instead said it shows the need for people to change attitude about time keeping and respecting electoral rules,” he said defiantly.
People were still campaigning while time for voting had started until I shouted.
The problem is that people have not internalised the struggle of democracy, the printer, transporter of the ballot wants.
He said they recorded names of their supporters leaving out others who did not support them.
His partly attributed the mess to meager.
He said they recorded names of their supporters leaving out others who did not support them.
He won resources.
The intense fight among the party officials suggests the thirst for power rather than to serve the country.
We are going to vote in a few hours but we do not know which delegate with which card will be allowed to vote.
The genuine delegates have been denied entry into this venue and non delegates have been allowed in.
The candidates have been denied access to the voters' register.
It is unfair that one of the candidates is involved in the organisation of the election process.
He grumbled as he waved a sample of two different accreditation cards.
Tension took over the audience.
The presidential guards rushed to make a security ring around the President.
Everyone watched in wonder and anxiety.
The audience fell silent.
You could hear a pin drop.
He asked the party electoral commission to explain.
He said delegates were receiving varying amounts of allowances depending on the distance from their districts.
Each district had one hundred delegates.
Each district had a polling station.
The old party leadership was returned save for the posts of National Party Treasurer.
Therefore, they could not dare throw out his man.
He had an additional advantage over his rivals.
This gave him more time than his opponents to market his candidature.
The delegates kept chorusing “abewo!”.
He spoke on the first day of the conference and he kept reminding delegates of his name and candidature.
Strategically it was these regions that had the swing vote and a candidate who would win them would be the Secretary General.
He did and was given the cash.
The other camps were also giving out money to delegates to vote for their preferred candidates.
Probably the difference was who had more money and power.
He was appearing to be an insubordinate candidate who has no respect for party decisions.
How could such people be entrusted with a top party office?
“Nobody can disobey the Central Executive Committee, that is a dream.
It cannot be any single moment.
Central Executive Committee sat and passed through these names.
Others were removed for various reasons.
I do not work alone.
Yet at this time, voting was still going on in all polling stations.
These text messages swung the voters’ mood.
It would be futile to vote a losing candidate.
It cannot be mathematically established that voters changed their mind because of this.
Usually voters do not want to vote a losing candidate.
His daughter was in charge of accreditation and managing data of delegates.
He talked amidst the wild applause from the delegates.
He was figuring out what to do with his fighting strongmen and whether he should support one against the other.
After falling out with the unions, one of his main support bases, the soft-spoken man with a vibrant and infectious personality and dance moves to boot.
But that reputation is rapidly being eroded by a president criticised as indecisive on the country’s main problems.
We have nothing to celebrate.
We lost more than one point one million jobs.
As a result, five point five million South Africans have been pushed into poverty.
With some one million public sector workers about to enter their third week on strike and as Cosatu threatened to bring the entire economy to a standstill by calling other sectors to join the stoppage.
Public workers want an eight point six percent wage increase, while the government has been standing firm on its offer of seven percent.
If he chooses one side, then he loses the other.
The strike has had a crippling effect on schools and hospitals, leaving health facilities having to function with skeleton staff, military aid and ordinary South Africans.
This further alienated his supporters.
Some believe his handling of the strike has deeply damaged the ruling's long standing alliance with the left.
Meeting the demands of his union and left wing backers would have alarmed the markets and the business community.
And in terms of alleviating poverty, his ministers have argued that raising pay for those with jobs would mean less money to potentially create work.
Some analysts say his biggest challenge is his need to appease the conflicting interests in the broad alliance which propelled him to power.
The challenge I am facing is that of balancing family and work.
I am serving on several boards of schools.
The most obvious impact is that of opening up markets and therefore making it easy for us to open branches in the member countries.
The common market, I hope,will bring a wider market for our products and services
The future for this business is very bright only that those that fail to style up will be forced to close.
Those are our secrets for now which we can’t tell everyone.
I personally believe in systems and control and this has a lot to do with my background in banking, especially in audit where I spent a while.

You are saying that it will remain the same as during the colonial regime.

Uganda Nile Breweries' Operations operations could be worth more than ten billion dollars.
The merger will not affect the existing management, staff and the services rendered by the two companies.

The French made Regional Transport Airplanes aircraft has a capacity of 48 passengers.
Like other aircraft in the fleet, it will feature inflight entertainment that allows passengers to watch movies and listen to music inflight.
How are you resolving these challenges?
However I am prioritising and delegating wherever possible.
But this also has challenges, in that we must be prepared to face very stiff competition.
The free flow of labour will also avail us skills that were hitherto scarce in our own individual countries.
The competition will improve efficiency, which is good for customers.
What new innovations are coming up at the forex bureau?
But certainly we have new innovations up.
What is your style to successful management and who are your mentors?
Unfortunately I don’t have a particular mentor, because I have been mentored by several people in the different trades.
He taught me how to use my brain a little better and that totally changed my life.
This strong growth was driven by increased customer deposits and customer lending,prudent cost management and better portfolio management.
In spite of the pressure on the net interest margins, we are on track for yet another good year.
During the period under review, the bank remained steadfast in implementing its investment plans of expanding the delivery channel mix.
The new brick and tile factory cost thirty six billion in equity and loans.
What challenges are you facing?
I have taken on a lot of responsibilities, and yet I still have a young family to take care of.
In addition to my several business interests, I also serve my church in various capacities.
I must physically visit the over one fifty clubs that exist in these countries in the course of the year.
I have to do all this in six days of the week because Sundays are for my family and my mother whom I must visit whenever I am around.
Do you consider yourself an overachiever?
This would not work if the people I am leading and supporting through different institutions were not hard working.
This would not work if the people I am leading and supporting through different institutions were not hard working.
This was giving us a very bad name for sure.
I think after he served a sentence or something.
Have you arrested the people who killed this politician?
That is a different issue now.
There are parties that were registered but did not front a candidate.
I will not suggest it is all of them, there are sections of the international press.
Whenever they are violent and they are killing each other, we must go and pacify them.
Do you sometimes have doubt and say," wow, possibly people are afraid and that is why they are showing up at these rallies?"
One would be making a very serious mistake to ignore the level of maturity that has been reached in the process by our people.
You see leadership is very important in everything.
You can get even a hundred percent of the votes, but a hundred percent of what?
It should be, I guess, about ninety six to ninety seven percent.
The title of superman seems to confirm everything.
No, in fact, I should not be overpraised.
I have really never doubted my people and more so in the recent days.
We have explained it to the media.
So why do you think the international press remains negative?
I think there is a much deeper problem than this.
In their view nothing good is happening here, nothing good should be happening here.
So there is this whole thing about image, perception and bias.
That is why we are here as you see us, forget the names they call us.
We are determined to shape our future, decide for ourselves, fight for our dignity, for selfdetermination and there is no question about it.
I followed you on many campaign rallies and I saw huge crowds.
I know the expressions they make out there are genuine, are honest and I think anybody is mistaken to underrate that.
What do you think could have caused that?
Leaders led our people to kill each other, to have genocide in this country that took a million lives of our people.
We have seen it work over the years and these are the results.
You are talking about the turnout or the votes?
What is the turnout?
There are things you can’t do and achieve unless people are imagining that I am a superman.
You could have people on the rally who have been brought at gunpoint and forced into being there, herded there and guarded there.
Whether you would also force them to be even happy on their faces and they jubilate and even when they are going back home they go singing, they go running and the next day they come the earliest time to vote, you cannot achieve that.
You know you have achieved many things.
That is true.
So what would stop you from mobilising people through intimidation and fear to come to your rallies?
I think if that is the way it is, people should respect it for so long as it works for the people of the country and they are happy with it.
Even if they don’t respect me, they should respect the fact that I am superman.
This has been made known to everybody because we all were concerned and worried.
This socalled journalist had actually earlier on been charged with genocide.
He had been prosecuted in the courts of law as a genocidaire but later on he was released.
I didn’t even know he was ever a journalist.
All these facts are out there in the public but journalists choose to ignore them because they want to keep the story that the journalist was killed by government,that this was to do with repression and it was to do with elections.
It had nothing to do with election.
The confession is just forged.
This time they will have evidence and facts to support their suspicion.
They can keep checking on him in jail to see whether he will be secretly released.
Let’s now come to the politician who was killed.
The blogs, the international media and the human rights groups are saying that he was a very strong politician.
First of all the government refused to register his party, which was very strong, because you feared his party would defeat the Rwanda Political Front in the elections.
First of all, there are lots of distortions and there is no truth at all in that.
I have no issue with that one.
He actually owned a bar, which was more known than the man himself.
Secondly I didn’t know this man, I had never heard of him until I heard of his death.
The press have suggested that he was a strong and influential politician whom you were afraid of.
Absolutely not!
I am telling you he was not known to me and he was not known to many.
If you ask people around, many people had never heard of him.
This fellow was an unknown entity.
How could I have been afraid of him to the point of killing him?
The police is under pressure to investigate to get to the bottom of the matter.
This is why I am saying some journalists put together all sorts of things that are unrelated but have happened randomly due for different reasons and just create a story even if these things are not related.
There are many events that happened in the runup to the election that seem related.
For example, this politician who was killed, it coincides with denying his party registration.
Why?
There are parties that wanted to front candidates but did not qualify or did not go through the normal procedures.
There are two things, the party qualifies through a process and the party leader or the would be presidential candidate also has to qualify through another process.
This is how parties get registered here, you get two hundred supporters, they get together, they form a general assembly, they declare their intention of forming a party, they call a Notary Officer that is the lawyer from the Ministry of Justice to come and witness and endorse that.
This goes to the Minister of Local Government who ensures that this has gone on according to the law and procedure and brings the matter to cabinet and the party is registered.
They have had quarrels within the party that neither were they able to bring together a general assembly.
In fact what happened when they tried, they were fighting among themselves and they had split.
They had people fighting over the leadership of the party.
I don’t know what happened there, but by the time they came back they had internal problems within the party and they said no, this man who went leading us is not our leader, we don’t want this person.
These are things we learnt after the minister of Local Government investigated to find out what was wrong.
Later on, the Minister of Local Government tried to help the Green Party, and he said "you know what, if you want to run, you better abide by this,sort out your internal problems, get together, form a general assembly and declare your intentions, and then later on you have to front somebody who will qualify as a presidential candidate and it is as simple as that".
They wouldn’t even challenge these other small parties.
You can’t blame the international human rights groups when you have failed to explain yourselves.
We have more than explained this story several times with a lot of clarity.
We have put together these ambassadors who stay here for example American, European and all others.
We have taken them through detail by detail.
They know it very well.
We shop the world for you!
We sell milk coolers of three hundred liters to ten thuosand liters, generators ,milk reception unit yoghurt mixing motor, cream seperator and Butter churner.
That is an unprecedented figure.
Your critics are saying that this was a stage-managed election.
So it is different here in a sense that there are different parties already that exist and that participated in this election process.
But I want to say that you get ninety three percent because of our context.
So we have had to build from scratch.
The context involves the fact that there was instability, lack of security, people were desperate, everywhere it was just death and despair.
We have had to build and as we build, people identify themselves with those people or processes or struggle that have impacted their lives.
There is a saying in our local language here.
It means, ‘you thank the one who gave you the cow, not the one you anticipate will give you a cow.
So their vote was an expression of that culture.
That in other words you and your government created an atmosphere where any strong and potential opposition was crushed.
It is not easy to do that and you continue to gain the confidence of the people.
Below are edited excerpts of Part one of the interview.
The second part runs in the next edition.
He had scooped a fully paid scholarship in conflict studies, his dream course.
He works in a non-governmental organisation, only to be greeted by closed, padlocked doors and police trucks patrolling the University.
At a press briefing amidst loud applause from staff members.
The government committed to take responsibility of the situation.
They demanded an increment in payment
In fact were beginning to think that he has conflict of interest,” he said.
It was clear that more than eighty percent of the hundreds that had gathered wanted the strike to continue.
We shop the world for you!
It was not a genuine election.
One has to know where we are coming from?
What remained to be your competitors were actually your allies in government who were just escorting you on this joy ride.
The biggest problem is that the university lacks autonomy to implement certain decisions.
The lecturers are demanding a lot of money from the university.
However, the insurer says the deposits amount to only shillings thirteen billion.
We never used to stage strikes for nothing.
They were tools to right the wrongs like unjustifiable fees increments and poor policies.
He adds that these events tarnish the image of the university and questions why the government can’t solve them for once and all.
For God ’s sake this is the country’s best university.
For instance this strike has elevated negotiations to a higher level.
In case of any problem with the deposited money, government would have to take responsibility towards the depositors.
Let us remove our catalyst.
It will not be the first time a strike is suspended to be resumed again.
When the president failed to turn up to the graduation, the lecturer’s hopes were shuttered.
What do you expect?” asked the lecturer.
Strikes should be expected as long as there are disagreements.
Lecturers are paid poorly and not in time because there are no funds and as the result they lay down their tools.
The issue of strikes is mainly because of the poor policies made by the university council,” he says.
They are missing the point.
The chairman tried out the two options but he still failed to win the elections in Rubaga.
The results were the riots and murders which followed the two thousand seven general election there.
The idea that saving the state was the only way to save the power of those sitting in government.
So, the idea of decentralization was resurrected.
There is dissatisfaction with government among those who do not benefit directly from its hospitality or who nurse historical unfairness..
But this does not manifest as touch-proof election majorities or civil unrest.
Public debate is distracted with changing the people who run the system instead of changing the system itself.
One reason this is so is political.
The distribution of people and money by district is not uniform.
In conditions like that federalism can not work.
Not for lack of passion or new proposals for reform, those are abundant but for the lack of the right tools.
Elections and constitutions are important.
That is the point, you need both but they have to arrive together.
This is different than saying federalism is not needed.
In general, very strong executives in countries with weak or volatile economies are sponges.
They soak up money, people and information that could be put to better uses elsewhere.
It is fair to ask what the government has done with its monopoly of power.
If that works, though, it will be because people in the districts have clubbed together.
The Constitutional Court declared the sedition law unconstitutional.
The sedition law was bad law because it was wild, literally making criticism of government a crime.
To remove it from our statute books is therefore an important step in promoting democratic debate.
Anyone who publishes information that is likely to cause disaffection, hatred or contempt against the “person of the president” is a criminal.
Therefore, people should be free to try and spread disaffection, hatred and contempt against him personally.
To criminalise such actions is as good as saying the president should not be criticised.
The existence of independent courts and judges with confidence to make a judgment against the state could only have been possible.
Instead, the government has promised to appeal to the Supreme Court, itself a legally legitimate step.
Besides, the Supreme Court has almost already pronounced itself on this law.
The principles of command set out in that judgment formed the basis for the judgment.
The president and his ruling party have consistently argued that they put in place a democratisation process.
The basis of this process was the constitution making exercise.
There is therefore a big gap between promoting democracy and the actual politics.
On the contrary, it has reinforced many of them.
It is currently writing a media regulatory law.
This has previously been driven by the spread of radio.
Increasingly, the computer and the mobile phone handset are connecting most especially around information and news.
Moreover, across this country, there is an unsual boom in education at all levels, most importantly secondary and university education.
Websites and blogs are spreading like wildfire and today constitute the most effective forms of communication by our growing middleclass.
The registrar, dressed in a navy-blue suit, was not used to the media spotlight.
Together the men were challenging the constitutionality of the rebellion charges the state had imposed against them.
Around the country, journalists, politicians, students were glued to their televisions in prediction.
The Daily Monitor’s newsroom briefly stopped chasing their daily stories to hear the Constitutional Court’s decision.
After the summation came a summary of the submissions of the petitioner and a summary of the state’s responses.
The strength of officeholders and institutions at the centre is decreasing relative to the rest of the country.
In Uganda there is frustration with the government but no real balance to it.
And also local government, or it could have tried to buy off disaffected tribes.
The realisation that worse violence was near and the influence of donors and international agencies finally brought home the idea.
This was because districts were too poor to deliver on the short term expectations of participants.
And not everybody in a district is an opponent of the central government.
And far from pressure to limit the total there is little standing in the way of increasing it by administrative order.
But they must arrive together with economic power directed to the same end if they are to be successful.
And even to manipulate or avoid rulings of the High Court.
Because they are the only institution strong enough to ensure that it gets what it wants.
Pooled resources and created political and economic power through their cooperation and directed it to their own, local benefit.
That is according to the law of sedition.
Those who feel an incumbent president has done a poor job.
This is in the sedition suit in the Constitutional Court.
This is if combined with the spread of mobile phone usage across the country is rapidly rendering government control of information flow.
Luckily, giraffes have elastic blood vessels in their necks, this makes it possible for them to drink water from a stream, without fainting.
A group of giraffes constitute a herd.
Neck wrestling matches are often held to show authority in their herds.
A giraffe is the one of the largest, strongest and peaceful animals on Earth.
An adult male giraffe is called a bull, a female is called a cow and a young giraffe a calf.
The average life span of a giraffe is twenty to twenty five years.
A large male giraffe can eat up to one hundred pounds of food in a single day.
He was replaced by successive insatiable other eaters.
What is most amusing is his reason for not leaving.
That his government has made a lot of money for the country and it would be foolhardy to leave it for others to enjoy it.
Now that he is entering the last year of his contract, he says he cannot leave because he has made a lot of profit for the company.
We are entering a good service with the production of oil, security is good and those who led the liberation should be part of the team that looks after these resources.
The president concluded that it was a strange occurrence.
When a manager makes profit for a company and even gives dividends to the shareholders, does he declare he cannot leave to let new managers eat the money he made for the enterprise?
Cruel hand of death strikes and life can be real cruel.
Imagine you are wining, dining and dancing and in the next hour you are in a mortuary or unconscious on the hospital bed.
The police said the cause of accident is suspected to have been high speed and overloading.
Driving under influence of alcohol could not be ruled out in such circumstances.
Such is the everyday trend of carnage on the Ugandan roads.
The fire outbreak that destroyed merchandise of unspecified amount was attributed to an electric fault.
Voting in many parts of the country was disrupted by violence and the delay of election materials.
By then, however, at least 32 lives, including members of parliament, had been lost.
This is an extraordinary casualty toll in a single military offensive.
But one firm lesson has been delivered.
Africa is unable to sort its house in order.
Supporters of federo here are asking themselves whether Ugandans could accomplish the same thing.
It might not surprise anyone if the oil proceeds go into the pockets of only those who led the liberation.
He has been leading our country for a quarter of a century hence the levels of poverty in the country and the level of corruption.
So whoever engages in kidnap must be treated as a terrorist.
The main causes of the estimated five million deaths of children under the age of five are malnutrition, diarrheoa, respiratory infections and malaria.
In Uganda the people do not own the budget.
The desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, or martial laws, or secret police.
Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way.
It always seems impossible until its done.
There were wild celebrations among journalists and politicians last week when the Constitutional Court nullified the sedition law.
Each time a giraffe lifts up its neck it picks up five hundred and fifty pounds.
A new born giraffe measures about six feet.
A giraffe is one of the animals who is born with a horn.
The scientific name of the giraffe is Camelopardalis.
Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern.
The tongue of an adult giraffe measures twenty seven inches.
Giraffes are vegetarians and live on the leaves of the baobab tree.
Every step a giraffe takes is fifteen feet in length.
The giraffe is able to grasp objects such as leaves with the help of its tongue.
Giraffes sleep for no more than five to thirty minutes in twenty four hours.
The film has been screened around the world, collecting praise and six international awards.
As it stands, the industry is propped up by one off commissions, donations, art grants and filmmakers who are able to self-finance.
There is no properly functioning infrastructure that ensures any lasting growth.
The best he can hope for is to leave it with the people who run the pirate DVD racket around the country as they have more expertise than anyone else.
There is no legitimate framework that filmmakers can work within once they’ve actually created their product, it just gets released to whomever or wherever will stock it.
The only way he has ever gotten any recognition is by entering film festivals.
Sometimes it takes too long for films to get here or they don’t appear at all, so in the end I grow tired of looking for it.
He stripped it back to the basics of what being in a creative industry means, communication.
It’s all about being an excellent communicator.
Film is the language of many different nations and people, I truly believe that it has the ability to change the world.
For her, it’s something she feels she has to do.“Acting lives in me" she says.
She says if they gave her any part, she would do it.
"I know I’ll make it, I have faith, I have hope" she says.
She is always perfectly dressed, ready trained for stardom, and burns with ambition.
Her days are spent meeting with potential employers, cajoling them, networking, persuading and constantly selling herself to everyone just in case they might be the ones to take her to the heady heights of fame.
This is part of what these workshops have given her.
Film appears to have a great future.
Beware of the new breed of men.
He is good looking and well groomed.
Have you noticed that it is becoming difficult to distinguish male from female behaviour today?
Personally I hate it.
We were created differently for a reason other than sexual compatibility.
This trend of unisex is spreading rapidly.
As a result, we have the equivalent of the “dumb blonde".
Like the female variant, this breed of men is cute.
They are usually slim, tall, light or dark skinned or of average build showing their six pack and wear tit revealing tshirts.
You cannot miss to see both earlobes pricked and accompanied by diamond studs.
Real men are uncomfortable near these guys who should not be confused for jerks.
Jerks are like crows.
It is for this reason that I insist on bringing to your attention the difference between the elusive good guys who you will never marry.
The jerks lie and break hearts.
Their behaviour is pretty unpredictable.
If you ignore him, he treats it like a turn on.
If you abuse him, you appeal to his resilience.
If you succumb he will dump you, when caught redhanded he will deny.
If you fall in love, you will be used.
If you get pregnant, he will take a walk forever.
But perhaps most important is the medium itself, not as inaccessibly highbrow as visual art, not as prohibitively expensive or elitist as fashion, a truism that applies all over the world.
The way a novel can absorb someone is often remarkably all encompassing but it remains an experience restricted to good readers.
Film, on the other hand, can be consumed and understood by pretty much everyone and it can have a similar immersive quality.
For a long time these jerks have prowled, leaving shattered hearts in their wake.
Until now, their dominance is unmatched.
They are only good for show cuties whose only claim to fame is a cute face.
Don’t pretend to be surprised.
I happened to catch some local male “celebs” hanging out in a beauty parlour, not a barber shop for your information.
They had facial masks on, cucumbers on their eyes and were waiting in the queue to be manicured and pedicured.
When did men get so lazy that they cannot find time to clip their own toenails?
Men now exfoliate their faces and visit saloons!
Guys are now keeping ripened avocado in their fridges, not for the health salads but for a face mask.
What the hell is going on?
They wait to be offered drinks.
They wine, are moody, shop cosmetics, spend a lot of money on clothes and they gossip too.
They are a total disgrace.
The sad thing is that, there are women like them.
I guess the game has come full swing.
If this kind of man ever asked you, believe you me, he is not fun to hang out with but in a life time you need to give it a try.
Not as in the case of the “dumb male blonde”, who has a simple natural appearance that looks innocent and with a friendly face.
It takes decades or more than three thousand kilometres before they lay eyes on decent ladies not because the ladies are out of reach but because they do not have a proper strategy or vibe to convince these ladies.
I mean that the ladies have got more brain matter than these lads.
This kind of men is a bit wide-spread throughout the country, so the elite woman is trying to avoid them but before you know a dozen more of this type spring up.
When you stare in the face of this wannabe, you will discover he is so daft because he cannot get it through his thick skull that you are damn bored of his hallucinations or is it called illusions.
Because he has asked you out for dinner, you decide to give it a try and accept his invitation to a restaurant.
Each time a character made a joke, the place would explode with laughter, chatter and shouted comments.
Film has an incredible advantage because of how it can appeal to people’s emotions through visuals as well as through sound.
Young filmmakers want to be able to tell their stories and to be able to tell them in a way that touches people both domestically and internationally.
I am told it’s because men are learning to embrace their sexuality.
It explains why they all have the same sob story about some jerk who slept with them, then turned over and snored.
My sister Irene, thinks it is cool for men to groom themselves.
It is what women demand, cute pets.
This breed of guys speak something like, “Man, that chic has the latest play station at her crib” or worse, “did you see the ride she spins?”
Please guys, give us a break.
We were quite satisfied with the transparency of it all.
Of course there were challenges.
They did not mind much about the spoilt ballots.
But the process was good.
What did they do with the spoilt ballots?
Then all of them were put together in the ballot box.
That is what we saw.
For the technical aspect of it all, counting at the polling station went well.
In fact we had our people in the districts who had not even been noticed of the outcome of the voting.
The procedure is clear that the thing will go to the centre and from the center to the district, and then to the national.
Many experts of the government argue there was no electoral competition.
This concept of escorts is only said by those who are criticizing him.
These people who are the Liberal party, the Socialist party, they are among those who suffered in the genocide.
I would not call them escorts, but they definitely were not critical opponents of the government.
I do not know how good they were.
From what we saw from this party, they are not connected in the crimes or involved with the past and so on.
However, there may be other reasons and the state can make an explanation.
In situations like this, it is in the interest of the democratic system to be as inclusive as possible.
This country went through genocide and genocide is not a joke.
Over one million people were killed and we have some people who are not even reconciled that people were killed.
We have to be careful and make sure that the things that bring about such hatred are not allowed to happen.
When we talk of balancing, we are talking of the need to be careful.
But the other extreme is balance that ensures that there is a degree of inclusivity in the process.
That’s what makes the process of democratic dispensation succeed.
Did you feel that there was enough public debate on the electoral process and the candidates?
So whatever happened could have happened before.
For example, New Times had more extensive coverage to the incumbent than the opposition.
But the government media, including radio and television, from what we saw, went out of the way.
His experts are saying rallies of the opposition were less attended because there was widespread fear in this country.
On the one hand all these opposition say they are part of the alliance.
I think that is funny.
I do not buy that.
If you support this opposition you are considered to be an enemy of the state.
Everybody in the press is saying the opposition are just escorts of the president.
But you are either this or the other, you can’t be both.
Did you talk to the other opposition candidates about their feelings towards the process?
The people who were not satisfied were the other opposition.
He was also very polite.
He is not one of those opposition who come out and start abusing.
During the campaign process I did not hear candidates criticizing the other.
They seemed to focus their messages on what they planned to do.
Did you find that odd? It is the style.
It is not common to have that experience.
Parties in an alliance will always be more careful and alart of what they criticize.
And even now there has been a transformation in the country.
People are polite and are talking about nation building.
You cannot expect the strong, hostile, abuse coming out from any of these parties.
Did you get the sense that the crowds were there out of fear rather than out of support for the president?
Do not underestimate people’s intelligence.
These are not cows.
These are human beings.
Let us say there was a certain level of terrorizing.
Why did they turn up in such large numbers for the president? Were they also terrorized to vote?
The accuracy we can make about this thing is to also be sufficientlyfreehearted.
I must say I am a bit uncomfortable with the fact that the polling went so smoothly and efficiently.
The capital city is flooded in campaign posts.
Faces and slogans are made to be seen and read.
As elections draw closer some of them might even become campaign tunes.
Each candidate uses their posters in different ways.
Some like to have their face as pronounced as possible to carry an image of power.
Many candidates come up with their own slogans before giving them to advertising agencies to produce.
Here are a few interesting campaign signs The Independent noticed during its tour through the city.
What kind of candidate are you?
This means appreciate what you have instead of craving what have not seen.
It might lack originality but will probably work well during the campaigns if people have to sing.
They could be perceived as supporting a particular party or candidate afterward.
Whether in trees or on the road, campaign posters provide insight and at times, a good laugh.
Should being a critic of the government give politicians a green card to break the law?
Some of these achievements include the following.
In education, the government has done a lot.
Higher institutions of learning have increased from one to twenty.
For example, real Gross domestic product.
The seriousness should be reflected in the media.
That she said the soldiers she has, are not trained.
Soldiers have started eating ducks.
Action taken fourth division order title opinion and concerned district officers were informed.
This was after he asked for the where abouts of other commanders.
What challenges do you face?
One of our biggest challenge is getting our raw material for brewing malt.
The government has put in place an effective health policy which requires every citizen to have subscription to a health insurance.
Supported by their lobbies in western capitals.
He cannot manage to stay with the people because of the crimes he committed in the area.
Well knowing that they will be haunted and they will find it difficult to mix up in the society.
How do you start your day?
How will the population increase affect food security?
The current population growth rate is three point two percent compared to the world’s average of one point two percent.
For instance having a skilled and inspired population in farming would have an unfading positive impact on the agriculture sector.
This is true for other sectors of the economy.
Climate change is a challenge to businesses.
With every tool available to the international community, including bed nets, indoor residual spraying and top quality drugs.
Those for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio and measles.
A malaria vaccine may be used together with the existing malaria control and immunization programmes.
It is also opening up its library of compounds of potential malaria drugs for researchers anywhere in the world to pursue.
Change the equation in the fight against malaria for good.
Sweets worth twenty two point five million shillings, cosmetics worth ten million shillings, tinned beef worth four point nine million shillings and food supplements worth six point five million shillings.
They are for cleaning re-useable bottles in the beverage and alcohol industry.
It blames the practice on the multiplication of small manufacturing units in homes turned into factories.
There is no way you can enter a person’s home to inspect to find out whether there is any packaging or manufacturing taking place.
These are powder milk, juices, tooth paste, bathing soaps, detergents, edible oil, ladies cosmetics, medicinal syrups, and wines.
This is because of weak trade regulations and flooding of the so-called investors who have turned into retail traders.
He blamed fake investors for some of the forged and substandard goods.
Corruption is a serious issue that should be handled with a brutal sense of urgency.
This is through sensitising our members on bidding processes, supporting good purchasing processes, equity in taxation systems, and administration and good tendering processes.
Before we look at the region, the focus should be on creating a critical number of skilled labour necessary to transform our country.
Like garage operators, spanner boys, saloon operators and, metal fabricators.
It has remained constantly poor, leading to weak state of the agriculture sector.
Resolve the issue of land policy to guarantee ownership and user rights of land by farmers.
From right inputs to correct production systems, value addition processing and marketing.
Transformation in real terms of our country.
They supported the ascendance to power of civilian groups which were opportunistic and incapable of holding the country together.
It is an obvious misconception to argue that liberal democracy gives birth to liberal democracy.
Foreign interference was to keep back the evolution of a militarily strong organisation that could establish order in the country.
The state of affairs favoured weak and incompetent warlords.
However, nothing short of death can stop human initiative.
It organised around a unifying ideology of Islam and began implementing Sharia law.
I was struck by how profound his insights on the subject were.
He argued that external actors tend to distort local politics by creating artificial winners and artificial losers.
Support from foreign forces makes the winner lack incentives to seek internal political integration domestically hoping to rely on foreign allies .
Democracy exists in stable and effective states, not in anarchy
The challenge, however, was how to inform the public without creating unnecessary alarm.
Monday, the director of counter terrorism
However, the memo noted that as Muslims, the youths were upset.
“This should not be underestimated or (not) taken seriously because these are practicing Muslim youths who regularly meet at least five times a day for prayers
They were not released until four years later
These betrayed promises increased disgruntlement
They knew of their internal structures, their operational plans, the names, home addresses and car number-plates of security operatives
The challenge therefore was not lack of information but rather how to operationalise it.
This theory is based on the discovery of two sliced heads of the suspected suicide bombers at both sites.
The identities of the suicide bombers have not yet been established.
These warlords began to control small pockets of the country from whom they could rip a small fortune.
quietly despising him for clinging to power and presiding over a corrupt system.
They belonged to the Salaf and Tablique sects of Islam.
Working for security, resumption of bomb attacks against the public with interest in crowded places and to intensify recruitment with emphasis on educated citizens irrespective of religion
Under the belief they would receive amnesty, monetary compensation or getting jobs in the army and other security organisations.
The suicide jacket tends to destroy the middle body leaving only the head and limbs.
Inside the Koran were telephone numbers which gave police important leads.
The bomb had failed to explode the previous day.
From these clues, security forces proceeded to follow up other simcards the phone had used on eleventh July.
What it shows , however is that security organisations have the right clues to track down terrorists.
Nothing more was done.
Terrorists avoid the strong points and attack spots where you least expect them to.
Other intelligence sources explain that terrorists were successful because of corruption in security agencies which limited the gathering of intelligence information.
Operational funds are used by intelligence chiefs to enrich themselves leaving operatives without working capital.
National security has been compromised by personal enrichment.
Operatives complain because they cannot justify their operations.
He introduced a system whereby every operation is clear with streamlined potential benefits.
Most of its intelligence was technical and general in nature whereby terrorists had increased their activities.
Security agencies infiltrated the communication infrastructure, flow of money and disrupted the terrorist groups.
People were arrested, tortured and their release was based on money.
He was against detention of people without trial and against torture.
He asserted that he will deal with anyone who tortured suspects.
People suspected of terroristic activities should be investigated efficiently and then handed over to the police.
Therefore, operational funds were not increased.
Most of the operations came to a standstill and old contacts were not reactivated.
Lack of funds has constrained security operations.
Money appropriated for security operations was embezzled by the chiefs.
Rebels disguised themselves as hawkers, bodaboda riders and taxi drivers.
Football fans were cautioned not to engage in unsafe sexual and risky activities during the tournament.
This was because of the inconsistence in the security agencies.`
The infiltrated rebel networks were replaced by new ones.
The rebel group has also resorted to using women instead of men to calm suspicions.
There was elimination of security personnel.
Resumption of bomb attacks against the public with interest in crowded places.
Intensify recruitment with emphasis on educated citizens irrespective of religion.
They however continue being false.
These documents simplify their mobility and makes it difficult for the unsuspecting public to identify them as wrong elements.
There has been a noted immigration lapse.
This is intended to make tracking by security difficult.
A cross-section of the public has always taken our operations as state inspired to press down on political or perceived enemies.
The legal procedure borne by the telecommunication companies that demands court order to secure printouts on top of making some payments is inconveniencing and leads to unnecessary delays.
They are difficult to monitor.
The threat is very imminent.
It calls for boldness and vigilance where each member of society should be security conscious of his or her own security.
Since it transcends borders, then it calls for collective effort.
With the switch to ethanol-based fuel, there came a side effect that had not been anticipated.
The high-stakes game of real-life, monopoly is leading to a modern colonialism to which many poor countries submit out of necessity.
Militant Islamist groups are determined to spread their activities into every corner of the world from attacks.
The third part will run in the next edition.
Responses to the article by Rwandans leave nothing to the imagination regarding what they think of him.
The furious reactions should not surprise.
Those who know him well are aware of how clingy he holds on to his views, valid or not.
Be that as it may, there are issues he raises that merit careful consideration.
And in its abnormality lie the reasons why it should not be assessed on the basis of conventional criteria.
It had no civil service, no police, no health service and, perhaps more frightening, no source of income.
For years, donors, believing that the new government would not last, with held assistance.
Their defected comrades are now working with security.
The rest of the public believe that it is a religious persecution.
There is low rainfall and sources of fresh ground water are drying up and arable farm land is becoming scarce.
Prices rose as farmers turned from growing maize for human and animal consumption to growing it for profitable car fuel market.
Millions of people in the developing world were in danger of slipping back into absolute poverty, spending up to 65 percent of their income on food.
This will lead to significantly increasing transportation costs and so raising the price of such critical commodities as oil.
suddenly every part of the world has become important in military and counter terrorism terms.
They used it to feed the very people who had executed the genocide.
If we don’t do something it will hurt all of us.
We also need to start thinking about new tools, including a malaria vaccine, which could complement existing interventions.
Vaccines and immunization services have been critical to improving Africa’s health over the last several decades.
There are only few of us who have not directly been affected by the disease but anyone whose child has suffered from malaria can imagine what a malaria vaccine would mean.
Several years ago, when I started working in pharmaceuticals, a malaria vaccine was only a distant dream.
The vaccine candidate is approaching the end of a long journey.
Policymakers will need to design a policy structure and strengthen health systems.
This means everything from improving infrastructure and delivery systems to training healthcare workers to administer a new vaccine.
These efforts can build upon work that is already underway for other new tools, such as rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines.
Partners need to get involved.
The chemicals involved are mostly bought by the small companies in soft drink and alcohol business.
The health danger to the consumer of such expired chemicals is that the active ingredients become inactive.
He warns that the most affected products on the list of expired consumer goods.
We need more money to be able to deepen awareness more effectively.
We would want police to confiscate commodities which they suspect to be expired and then call us.
We want it to get to that point where people should not only get arrested for criminals because it is under the Police Act.
“Because of weak regulation, when they are arrested they pay the fine and return to business,” he said.
Stricter new laws could help.
Impacts of corruption are destructive for both private and public sectors.
I think two of the major solutions to corruption are to strengthen moral value systems.
Most private sector entrepreneurs in Uganda lack information, how can this be overcome for them to go into public private partnerships?
We are developing an integrated communication system that will allow feedforward and feedback delivery of business information.
Our efforts will tap into unity of other private and public agencies engaged in brokerage of business information.
Skilled labour or human capital is key software for a country to develop and maintain development.
The issue of skilled labour is historical and has to be resolved through fair and complete change options.
This action will restore their confidence and allow their availability in the expansive labour market provided by the Common Market.
This is happening at a time when the country is experiencing unsual population with a high fertility rate.
Where food production fails to match or exceed population growth you have terrible food insecurity as a result.
Though the overall poverty rate in Uganda has fallen in recent years, about four million households, half of them classed as “subsistence".
Large and small scale commercial farming will only be possible if as a country and people increase financing for the sector.
We must also invest in rehabilitation of our environmental and ecological togetherness.
Sebaggala denied he had crossed to National Resistance Movement four years ago.
But in any case, what is wrong with cooperating with Museveni and the NRM?
Did they want me to be like Ssebaana who spent most of his time as mayor trading words with Museveni?
Sebaggala stood for the Democratic Party presidency during the party’s Delegates Conference in Mbale in February this year, but lost to Norbert Mao.
Party members who attended the Mbale conference say the money Sebaggala was dishing out before and during the conference aroused suspicion about the source
They say that during private meetings with DP members, Sebaggala would often talk about striking a power sharing deal with Museveni
It was strange that he was talking about doing business with Museveni if he failed to get a fifty one percent majority in the coming elections
Sources say that Sebaggala provided some of the mattresses for the delegates
They wondered how the UPDF could have released its mattresses to facilitate an opposition conference unless someone high in government was interested in Sebaggala taking the Democratic Party presidency
This has impelled observers to say Sebaggala had long planned to hand over DP to Museveni and the NRM, but his mission was thwarted by the defeat at the Mbale conference
The NRM has celebrated Sebaggala’s arrival
NRM spokesperson, Mary Karooro Okurut wrote: “Sebaggala is one of those few people in Uganda who are a little more than just individuals.
Mabikke dismissed the assessment as an overestimation of Sebaggala’s popularity.
It has already been killed by a weed,” Mabikke said.
Mabikke says that NRM falsely believes that Sebaggala is the weapon they will deploy to rout the opposition and recapture Kampala
Opposition FDC candidate Dr Kizza Besigye received 245,004 votes, which translate into over 50% of the total votes cast
Democratic Party candidate Ssebaana Kizito got 11,993 votes, Abed Bwanika 3,045 votes and Miria Obote 1,425
Museveni scored 170,688 votes.
If the 2006 electoral statistics are anything to go by, Sebaggala cannot deliver Kampala to the NRM
How long did he stay with the Progressive Democratic Party?
"How long did he stay with LDP before he ran to the NRM?” Kezaala wonders
Mabikke says that all Kampala Division Chairpersons except Godfrey Nyakana and all MPs except Freddie Ruhindi, were key mobilisers and planners in Sebaggala’s 2006 campaigns, but have since fallen out with him.
He supports the claim that Sebaggala cannot win an election on his own.
Senior researcher at Makerere Institute of Social Research, Golooba Mutebi, also believes Sebaggala will not add any political value to the NRM.
“History will judge us,” Sebaggala said defiantly.
His first election as mayor in 1997 was based on his DP membership and his participation in 1996 presidential campaigns for the joint candidate of Inter Political Forces Cooperation.
In 2001 Sebaggala supported Besigye who was standing under the Reform Agenda flagship.
At that time the NRM ridiculed Besigye as unfit for a national leader for allying with a convicted fraudster yet he was purporting to fight corruption in government.
It’s now the same NRM that is applauding Sebaggala as a big political catch that will boost the party’s support in 2011.
The problem of double registration in Uganda in the voters’ register has been teasing the Electoral Commission for last three elections.
Pontius Namugera you have so far identified 150,000 double registrations; does that mean you have cleared the voter register by 150,000?
Kalisa’s latest project is to invite bids from fuel operators to manage the national fuel reserves at Jinja in spite of an earlier agreement with Tamoil to manage the same facility as part of the KenyaUganda petroleum products pipeline.
The reserves on Mutibwa Road in Jinja now stand dry and empty with no one to manage them.
The bid document indicates that the procurement method for the bid is Open International Bidding, however, in his usual opaque operations style, Kalisa is keeping a tight lid on any information despite a mandatory right to such information by the public.
The Ministry of Energy decision on how to manage the oil reserves is supposed to be approved by parliament but MP Fred Bukeni Gyabi, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Natural Resources, says he is not aware of any such bidding and is hearing it from the press.
Kalisa’s latest venture is not the first time the ministry is reaching out for bidders to manage the facility.
In 2008 President Museveni said the government’s maintenance of the fuel reserves would unnecessarily tie up public monies.
MP Gyabi wonders how the ministry can award a contract to another bidder when they are already in contract with another company
Observers say that Kalisa’s ministry seems to be playing games as its offers are on and off.
However, like many other critics, Parliamentary Energy Committee Chairman Gyabi insists that “the reserves are so critical; they should be a preserve of government,” he says, “that responsibility can not be left to private oriented players.
Some experts disagree with Gyabi.
Critics say the failures of Kalisa’s ministry stem from its failure to be transparent, poor planning and poor negotiation skills of its officials.
She was among the first Ugandan loan recipients when BRAC opened shop in Uganda in 2006
But the loans aside, Ruth says she has also benefitted from the basic training and encouragement from BRAC officers
Every Monday Ruth deposits Shs 52,725 on her BRAC loan repayment account and says loan repayment is hard and she has to sacrifice to make the weekly repayments
Instead, she adds, she cannot imagine life without BRAC
Their fortunes may vary, but BRAC’s clientele has grown phenomenally, to over 130,000 borrowers over the four years they have been in operation in Uganda
No wonder BRAC Uganda was one of five institutions nominated for this year’s Africa microfinance bank of the year award
BRAC is an acronym for the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee
” Deputy Bank of Uganda Governor Louis Kasekende is one of them
Khondoker Ariful Islam, the founding BRAC Uganda Country Program Head, says BRAC is currently the largest NGO in the developing world, and in Uganda
BRAC provides microcredit at an interest rate of 22 percent per year, which is somewhat high, Khondoker admits
BRAC’s monthly interest rate is 18 per cent
After setting up the branch offices, the BRAC officers identify the target population of the area, usually within a radius of seven kilometers from the area office
He joined the BRAC organization 27 years ago, soon after graduation
Talking to The Independent at BRAC’s country offices in Nyanama, Kampala, Khondoker said they have enjoyed success in Uganda because of three main reasons
Over half of BRAC’s offices are located away from district headquarters
Brac’s second unique feature, according to Khondoker, is the absence of shareholders within its ranks
” Because BRAC is not run with the intention to make profit, he explains, the interests of the beneficiaries take center stage
By this approach, he says, BRAC provides several other essential services apart from microfinance
” He adds that the support BRAC accords its clients encourages them to cooperate and repay their loans on schedule, explaining the organization’s minimal default rate of less than 2 per cent
By the end of August, BRAC had covered 98 per cent of its operating costs and Khondoker says they project that they will have ‘broken even’ by the end of March 2011
When BRAC eventually makes profits, he says, they will be reinvested
For now, BRAC receives support from, among others, BRAC International, BRAC USA, BRAC UK, Living Goods Foundation, Nike International, Master Card International and Whole Planet Foundation
The battle for customers between Bharti Airtel and MTN is however expected to heat up
MTN has announced a massive reduction in the cost of calls in addition to launching MTN Play

Top winners at this year’s annual Presidential Export Awards were Nile Breweries Ltd, for exporting products worth US$5.6 million
Hima Cement won the Diamond Award for exporting products worth US$52 million.
Over 70 big, medium, and small companies either won awards or recognition at the event organised by the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB)
President Yoweri Museveni attended
UEPB Executive Director, Florence Kata said if Uganda’s informal cross border trade is factored in, the overall performance of the export sector would exceed the US$3.6 billion in revenue

This is the second time a Warid tariff cut is shaking up the market
When Warid Telecom cut its call tariff to other networks to Shs 299 or Shs 5 per second (Peak) and Shs 249 (off Peak) in February 2008, it sparked off a similar price war as the competition scrambled to match its offer
Kavuma Kaggwa Kyaggwe, Mukono NRM fleecing Ugandan taxpayer, Rujumbura County MP and Chairman of NRM Veterans, Jim Muhwezi, says Museveni will deploy some of the election losers within the party or the state and facilitate others to carry out private business.
I now know why fuel prices are high; money is being collected from us and used to bribe voters and disgruntled NRM cadres
"Why give out jobs to losers if politics is not employment?" asked Galiwango Daniel.
Everything about President Museveni is becoming ridiculous
During the NRM national conference at Namboole last month he condemned people who join politics as means to employment
Haven’t you heard about two South African police officers who rejected a million dollar bribe by the assassin who almost ended the life of Lt Gen Kayumba Nyamwasa during the World
I have read several comments in the media attributed to NRM historicals who are now in opposition saying they regret participating in the Luwero rebellion because of what President Museveni has turned out to be 23 years down the line
I’m not a fan of President Museveni but whatever has become of him today, I still believe the Luwero Triangle war was justified
Fallout with Museveni cannot write off gains of the bush warThere are moral arguments that are probably torturing the consciences of those who fought in Luwero because things have not changed that much in Uganda as they expected, yet people died
Museveni’s war against Obote’s forces was justified
Obote had to go
But don’t ask me if the same deserves of Museveni of today
Those who want answers should ask Museveni for a cup of tea, put him in a relaxing mood and then directly ask him: “What happened to you, buddy?”Abbey Kibirige Semuwemba UK2
James MukonoWhy NRM losers don’t join FDC It’s Movement hangover or people are still drunk with the Movement system where the power of individual merit still reigns
Rutamwebwa The question then is one of identifying the extent to which a reformist agenda might be pursued from within the NRM
Just because every Musevenist is a Movementist, it does not follow that all Movementists are Museveniists
Museveni might not always be able to defuse the threat posed by a popular wouldbe rebel MP by allowing that MP space within his party
OchiengNRM members are joining IPC in record numbers, they have just woken up and realised that Uganda is decaying, the little Museveni gives them to stay in NRM doesn’t match the suffering the rest of Uganda is enduring
Uganda is not NRM and NRM is just a small part of Uganda
The cost of being with Museveni is about to affect those with him and those without him equally
Adam Kifaliso said that people who depended on the master Museveni to get elected and hired, to find themselves on their own, they are at a loss, frightened and do not know what to do or where to go except to remain within his domain
NRM knew this, thus after realising how wildly the process of micromanaging patronage had become, even though it served well entrenching them, they now found it expedient to subject all their members to a system of suffrage
It wasn’t because the NRM are democrats at heart; it was just more convenient

Last week, during a closed session meeting in Entebbe with UN Security Council envoys, President Museveni reportedly said that Uganda is willing to pay any price, including jeopardising relations with Omar alBashir’s National Congress Party, to ensure the secession of the South if they vote for independence
Museveni’s statement is the strongest show of support for secession by any head of state yet

Michael ezra: Uganda’s wanted man Police continue to hunt Mike Ezra over charges resulting from a false cheque worth $550,000 he had issued to Dr Charles Mushabe, a software engineer, and his brother Frank Katusiime, an IT consultant
“We desperately need him and are searching for him inside and outside Uganda,” said Criminal Investigations Directorate boss Edward Ochom
Ezra reportedly issued the false cheque after he convinced the pair to loan him the money so he could set up a joint venture in the city centre
Ezra reportedly promised to refund the money after a week and provided the brothers with a postdated cheque as a guarantee he would return the money
They allege Ezra had ordered the bank not to cash the cheque, which prompted them to report the incident to police
Worrying that his image could be in jeopardy, Ezra called an impromptu press briefing at Emin Pasha Hotel in Kampala where he displayed what he says was $3 million worth of cash before journalists
The stunt, however, stroked the ire of the authorities who were already seeking Ezra’s detainment over outstanding debts of Shs 1.21.6 billion to the Uganda Revenue Authority for unpaid income tax and Shs 400 million to the National Bank of Commerce over an outstanding loan
On October 8, in a telephone interview with the Daily Monitor, Ezra claimed that his $500,000 cheque to Katusiime bounced because the URA froze transactions on all his accounts, not because he was insolvent
“I am not aware of any summon,” said Ezra referring to the police demands he turn himself in
”Ezra became famous for being a philanthropist

Court stops besigye’s double trial The Forum for Democratic Change President Dr Kizza Besigye and ten others are now partially relieved after the Constitutional Court ruled that their trial on treason in different courts was unconstitutional
Besigye and his coaccused have been on trial for treason in the High Court and on a parallel trial on terrorism in the court martial since 2005 when he returned from exile
The judges agreed with Besigye’s lawyer David Mpanga that by prosecuting the suspects in both the civil and military court the state had subjected the accused to double jeopardy and caused them psychological torture
Besigye’s lawyer had submitted that the rearrest created doubt whether the accused would ever get a fair trial since the state had treated them as if they were guilty even before the court judgement
After the judgement on October 12, Besigye said he was relieved to see the outrageous double trial end
“The people of Uganda can now discipline those who abused the power trusted them with,” Besigye said
“The DPP had the power and ability to rid the country of this disgraceful process,” Besigye added
Justices Alice Mpagi Bahigeine, George Engwau, Amos Twinomujuni, Costance Byamugisha and Augustine Nshimye presided over the petition
The cost, in men, material, and money, of the Somalia war has become an issue since President Yoweri Museveni announced in September that he is ready to deploy another 12,000 and 20,000 UPDF troops to Somalia to bolster the 7000strong contingent already there
Museveni is conscious of this
The UPDF Spokesperson Felix Kulayigye is more laconic
However, it is no secret that President Barack Obama’s administration has provided military and financial support to Museveni’s Mogadishu mission
Museveni has vowed not to let the AlShabaab, which controls most of Somalia, take over power
Recently, however, Museveni’s military campaign looks to be falling into place
Uganda’s representative at the UN in New York, veteran politician Dr Ruhakana Rugunda moved quickly to put Somalia on the UN agenda
When on Oct 3, Rugunda led a United Nations Security Council delegation to a meeting with Museveni at State House in Entebbe, two issues were top on the agenda; a pledge from the UN for support to Uganda’s mission in Somalia and increased scrutiny of the upcoming referendum in Southern Sudan
Museveni told the UN team that Uganda’s contribution of peacekeepers in Somalia under the AU Mission is proof of the history of solidarity among Africans
In the same week, Museveni hosted 27 members of the European Union’s top military organ to rally efforts against the resurgent Al Shabaab
Museveni, who has been in power for 24 years, needs to reinvent himself
As a reaction, Museveni has muzzled free expression in the media and other public spaces and clawed back the little democratic space his government previously let citizens enjoy
When he attended the UN General Assembly late last month in New York, Museveni met with US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the summit to discuss the Somalia situation and the pending referendum in Sudan under the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan’s 22year old rebellion
Museveni’s biggest impediment to increasing the number of troops in Somalia is the funding and other logistical support for the additional troops
We have the human beings, we have the experience, we have the training, but we cannot provide the money,” Museveni told the press recently
Museveni asked the Security Council delegation to commit more money for his increased deployment but they were noncommittal
Museveni is known to take unilateral positions if consensus seeking fails him
Museveni would have been more credible if in explaining the electoral chaos, he had continued his ‘hunter’ and ‘carcass’ analogy and told Ugandans that beasts like hyenas will always follow vultures all the way to some other predator’s kill or carcasses
If anything, the NRM primaries brought into the open what critics and commentators have often spoken out about but in abstract terms: the collapse of institutional governance and processes, systemic corruption and a culture of political impunity
The electoral irregularities showed it is practically impossible to hold a free and fair election under the NRM
The NRM political elites view elections through a different lorgnette fogged by their desire for selfadvantage
Although Lubega remains defiant that the court injunction is inconsequential, the legal advisor to the Democratic Party of the Norbert Mao leadership, Mukasa Mbidde, says it is enforceable
Mbidde says the court order issued on October 8 will result in the arrest and prosecution of Lubega and his group if they continue “masquerading” as leaders of DP
He says the ruling was delivered by judge Lawrence Giddudu the same person who presided over the petition the Lubega faction had taken to court challenging the legitimacy of the DP leadership under Mao
Giddudu dismissed the petition in May
Lubega had sought court to nullify the February party delegates conference in Mbale which elected Mao’s DP leadership
Lubega had contended that the delegates conference had been held unconstitutionally and was therefore a nullity
But the judge dismissed the petition on a technical ground that in the petition, the Lubega group had presented themselves as DP leaders yet the national Electoral Commission only recognises the Mao DP leadership
Mbidde told The Independent that he had forwarded the court order to the Electoral Commission and the police to arrest Lubega and his group if they continued to present themselves in public as DP leaders
Lubega denied knowledge of the court order and said his lawyer had not received it either
He speculated that Mbidde was lying
He argued that Mbidde could not have gotten the court order on the basis of a ruling that had been appealed
Lubega said he had, on October 7, appealed against the dismissal of his petition and the case was still pending hearing
He claimed even when the court dismissed his petition, it did not pronounce itself on whether Mao’s leadership was the legitimate representatives of DP
Mbidde said they did not secure the injunction on the basis of Lubega’s appeal
He said the injunction was based on its own merits and the Lubega’s appeal would have no bearing on it
“The appeal will probably be heard two years from now,” Mbidde said
However, while Mbidde says he forwarded the court injunction to the police and the Electoral Commission, the police spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan Idi Senkumba said he had not heard of it
The head of the Political Parties Desk at the Electoral Commission Patrick Byakagaba also denied knowledge about the injunction, saying he had not seen it or heard of it by October 7 when he left office
The Electoral Commission recognises the Mao leaders as the official DP establishment and this has sucked the national electoral body into the fray
The court appeal by the Lubega faction shows that the Electoral Commission has been sued together with the Mao leadership, former DP president Ssebaana Kizito and Mathias Nsubuga who acted as the party Secretary General during the delegates conference in Mbale
Lubega accuses the Electoral Commission of legitimising Mao’s leadership by recognising them as the rightful leaders of DP when the process through which they were elected is still in dispute in court
Dismissing the Lubega petition, court held that it’s Mao leadership which was recognised by the Electoral Commission
Kasese is the only district in western Uganda where the opposition FDC president Dr Kizza Besigye defeated President Museveni in the 2006 elections
For Bukonzo West the FDC has fielded Lucy Biira Kabanyoro, former chairperson of Kasese District Service Commission, to challenge NRM’s Dr Chrispus Kiyonga, the Defence Minister, for the seat
Kiyonga has represented the constituency in parliament since the 1980 elections
He was the only person who won the parliamentary seat on Museveni’s Uganda Patriotic Movement in the opposition in 1980
Since 1986 Kiyonga held different cabinet positions in the Museveni government ranging from Minister for Cooperatives and Marketing to Minister Without Portfolio
In 2006, Kiyonga polled 20,837 votes
His closest challenger Mathina Bwambale was an independent candidate
He got 20,083 votes, losing to Kiyonga by 754 votes
The FDC candidate Yohazi Baruku, who scored 1,185 votes, was among the trailing pack of four who collectively raised a paltry 2200 votes
Although Kabanyoro has not been in active politics for quite a time, she is already raising excitement in Bukonzo West
She is a daughter of Bulasio Maate, the first Kasese District Commissioner in the 1970s
However not all is rosy for FDC in the constituency
He had no known links to either the NRM or the opposition
He aimed at tapping into both the NRM and FDC support, which may explain the small vote difference by which Kiyonga beat him
Now that Bwambale will not stand in 2011, his votes could go either side
Busongora South MP Christopher Kibanzanga (FDC), who has left parliament for the district leadership position, says the FDC has addressed the weaknesses it had in the 2006 elections, especially in Bukonzo West
He dismisses the claim that Kabanyoro having been out of active politics for while is a big undoing on her political clout in the area
Kasese District Woman MP Winfred Kiiza and Yokasi Bihande MP for Bukonzo East will contest on FDC ticket
He says the three candidates who lost to Kabanyoro in the FDC primaries have joined her
Kabanyoro polled 409 votes to beat Richard Baluku (188 votes), Yohazi Baluku (50 votes), who was the FDC candidate in 2006 elections and Benon Muhindo (19 votes)
The FDC’s incumbent District Woman MP Winfred Kiiza will face challenge from NRM’s Rehema Muhindo, a district councillor
In Bukonzo East NRM’ Fred Businge will tussle it out with FDC’s Yokasi Bihande, former Kasese LCV chairman and incumbent MP for Bukonzo East
In Busongora South FDC has elected to Jackson Mbaju, former attorney general of Rwenmzururu kingdom, to stand against NRM’s Boaz Kafuda
Mbaju is a new candidate
He fills the void left by Kibanzanga, who will stand for LCV seat
But Mbaju’s chances of winning maybe affected by Constantine Siwako who has indicated he will stand as an independent after his candidature in FDC primaries for the same seat was cancelled on academic grounds
In Busingora North FDC has fronted William Nzoghu, who has worked with a number of NGOs in the region, to contest against incumbent NRM legislator Elijah Kyetunda
He lost to Kyetunda in 2006 by a margin of 751 votes
In the newly created Kasese Municipality constituency FDC has deployed Musa Bwambale, a son to former Kasese District Woman MP Loyce Biira Bwambale
He will compete for the seat with NRM’s James Mbahimba
This was even in defiance of the advice by then de facto cultural leader of the people of Rwenzururu, Charles Wesley Iremangoma, to his subjects to vote UPC
In the 2006 multiparty elections, Kasese again showed their stubbornness by voting the FDC’s Besigye to defeat President Museveni
It was widely interpreted that Kasese had voted the opposition as a protest vote because President Museveni had refused or failed to recognise their kingdom, Obusinga bwa Rwenzururu
There is a general feeling among the populace that the recognition of the kingdom came too late and was because of their pressure rather than the NRM and Museveni’s magnanimity
According to Dr Aaron Mukwaya of Makerere University’s Department of Political Science, the index, “fails to analyse the underlying factors and forces involved in Africa’s struggling political and economic spheres
” Dr Mukwaya says the index is based on a consultant’s model and an “outside outlook”
Fredrick Golooba Mutebi of Makerere University’s Institute for Social Research agrees with this sentiment
According to Golooba Mutebi the danger with such indexes is how they create perceptions about Africa which are not necessarily accurate, even if they do give a broad picture of what people already know
“There is a tendency to see African countries as static and these indexes recycle this picture,” Golooba Mutebi says
Mutebi notes that drawing conclusions from data which does not represent current underpinnings of African country performance, as it is seen on the ground, stands to discredit the index
Mutebi sees utility for the prize committee to refuse giving out the award until its criteria are met as to not reduce the award to a mere “ritual”
Mutebi notes that “Presidents are not driven by their desire for recognition rather than for their narrow interests
Margaret Asiimwe, 14, a Primary Six pupil of Kivumbi Primary School in Kampala cannot read or answer questions in English
However, her teacher, Arthur Bwiire, says Asiimwe is one of the brightest pupils at the school
Despite being the health prefect for her school, Asiimwe is incapable of addressing her fellow pupils in English
Bwiire, who is not well conversant in English himself, blames a lack of textbooks and opportunities to practise on the pupils’ failure to speak English
As a result of increased enrollment, says Fortunate Ahimbisibwe of the Ministry of Education, there is now a critical shortage Uganda amongst worst places to be in school Pupils and teachers can’t speak English Pupils at a primary school Rwemiyaga, Sembabule district study under a tree
Michael Niyitegeka, Head of Corporate Relations at Makerere University computer facility, says that universities are often blamed for poor education but the problem resides at lower levels
President Museveni has often argued that it is the parents’ responsibility, not the government’s, to provide lunch for their children
Wafula Oguttu, the spokesperson for Forum for Democratic Change, says that the report’s findings are important
Wafula says that the majority of government schools lack teaching facilities and teachers, yet the government does not want to recruit more teaching staff
Those who are there are paid poorly and as a result end up dodging classes,” Wafula says
For example in the districts of Butaleja, Mbale, Arua, Maracha, Oyam, Pader and Abim, the ratio is 1:120, alarmingly higher than the recommended 1:50
Wafula adds that for as long as enrolment keeps rising with fixed school facilities, education standards in Uganda will keep deteriorating
The only exception has been MTN which continues to charge Shs 6 per second
“There are no plans for tariff changes in the pipeline at the moment,” says MTN Chief Marketing Officer Isaac Nsereko, “Our customers get value for money since most of the subscribers are on MTN
”MTN’s reaction is unusual for a market leader
This is the second time a Warid tariff cut is shaking up the market
When Warid Telecom cut its call tariff to other networks to Shs 299 or Shs 5 per second (Peak) and Shs 249 (off Peak) in February 2008, it sparked off a similar price war as the competition scrambled to match its offer
Back then market leaders, MTN, launched its MTN Zone which offered up to 99 percent discounts to customers depending on availability of capacity and Zain introduced its 12hour free innetwork calling
MTN could also be counting on ‘customer confusion’ which renders customers unable to switch to the competition, according to Charles Omagor, a marketing expert who is also the dean of the Faculty of Commerce at Makerere University Business School
He says MTN offers packages like yellowmax, paygo standard, MTN zone and per second and a subscriber who is already confused on which package on the MTN network to choose is likely to get even more confused if tempted to switch to another network, where there are also several packages to select from
“Fearing that there could be even worse confusion elsewhere, the subscriber will most likely choose to stay where he is,” argues Omagor
But Omagor says the natural reaction from a marketer’s perspective is to pause and watch the competitors
Commenting on its reaction, MTN’s Nsereko told The Independent: “We are studying the situation and we can only respond when we think it is necessary
Nation Media, owned by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development SA, first announced plans in March to list in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda

Bank of Baroda Uganda started in 1953 as a subsidiary of Baroda but was incorporated as a separate entity in 1969
Like so many overly ambitious and simplistic Africans, Isabirye, the play’s central character goes to great length to “buy” a visa to fly abroad for greener pastures

The background from which 23year old Moses Kipsiro, the 2007 5,000 meter bronze medallist as well as 2008 world cross country runnerup, came to prominence is both disjointed and bewildering, but strikingly similar to AkiiBua’s
Idi Amin may be gone but poverty is rampant
Julius Baribangba, a journalist of The EastAfrican newspaper explains:“Few people in Uganda can afford a decent meal
The Kipsiros have grown up amongst this lot
”The country’s few successful athletes in recent times like Kipsiro himself, Boniface Kiprop (former world junior 10k record holder) and Dorcus Inzikuru (2005 steeple world champ) are all school drop outs who sought the track as a shortcut to earning a living
Moses is highly regarded
The country had hinged all its hope on (Boniface) Kiprop but his failed promise put added pressure on Kipsiro
Kiprop had not done too badly but he remains in the shadow of the Ethiopians and Kenyans
“I always wanted to be an athlete,” Moses Kipsiro says quietly
”Kipsiro showed some early promise but nothing striking
Kipsiro at HomeKipsiro is mentally resilient, and pragmatic as is evident from a recent journey from Limerick, Ireland back home to Uganda
Moses Kipsiro of Uganda is the favourite
21:18 Kipsiro is turning out to be a “stubborn competitor” for the Kenyans
Kipsiro accepts the rigours of his journey with equanimity
Kipsiro is a quiet unassuming man and an intensely religious man
Kipsiro’s trainingHis training in Uganda is determined necessarily by the terrain, the environment and the time of year
In keeping with the African approach, Kipsiro doesn’t count mileage
Kipsiro will run for an hour or ninety minutes each day
Kipsiro trains alone, at altitude, without the presence of his coach and agent Ricky Simms, who is better known for being Usain Bolt’s agent as well
But the coach is keenly aware of what Kipsiro is doing each day and is satisfied that he will not over train
When it’s compatible with his own training, Kipsiro trains with the elite staple of Kenyans under Simm’s tutelage
These sessions allowed Kipsiro to mingle with the Kenyan athletes whom he admired, namely Daniel Komen and the great Moses Kiptanui
”Simms’s task is to fine tune and maximise Kipsiro’s exciting potential
21:26 A brilliant finish by Kipsiro and another gold for Uganda
Kipsiro is the first runner after 70 years to win a double
“My favourite distance is the 5000m and I hope to get my time down to 12:45,” says Kipsiro who in addition to his bronze in 2007 was 4th at the 2008 Games and 2009 world champs in the 5k
”Should Kipsiro fulfill the full arc of his athletic career he will have created a considerable legacy
You don’t displace a giant like AkiiBua
What a week!Ugandan fans cheer Kipsiro

Her mother Beatrice Kemigisha had been taken away by Obote’s security operatives
We never saw her again,” Dr Olive Kobusingye’s prohibited book starts
This reminiscence brings an instant juxtaposition of the character of Museveni’s regime and the regimes he overthrew, which shows that they are not much different today
The book catalogues the extrajudicial killings especially of political opponents under Museveni’s regime, the collapse of the rule of law and the role of the state in the death of Besigye’s brother Joseph Musasizi Kifefe

The book by Dr Olive Kobusingye accuses President Museveni of veering off the correct ideals of the NRM revolution
Interparty Cooperation candidate and FDC president Dr Kizza Besigye has said the opposition will have their own vote tally centre during next year’s elections
The Electoral Commission has warned him against such a move
The trigger was the arrival of Kampala Woman MP, Nabilah Naggayi Ssempala, who stormed the meeting room and usurped Mukalazi Kibuuka’s mandate to address the conference
She claimed that her supporters were being systematically rigged out to give her opponent, Rashida Naluwooza, undue advantage
The suspects, Charles Iga, Robert Ssempebwa Kazahura
The gang is also suspected to have killed Nkata Mugagga, Claude Ndeezi alias Munyarwanda, Constatine Ssempala, and two men only identified as Mubaraka and Younger
Police Chief Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura said that enough evidence has been gathered to convict the criminals and have them safely away from society for a reasonably long time
Kayihura also promised to investigate allegations that rogue officers within the police connive with criminals, often releasing them soon after their arrest
The new law which seems designed to catch Kabaka Mutebi who through former Buganda Premier, Mulwanyamuli Semwogerere, and the likes of former Mengo Minister Medadi Sseggona, is associated with the pressure group Suubi 2011, bars cultural leaders from engaging in partisan politics or joining any political party

Well, President Yoweri Museveni has eventually given you a clue
On top of the cash, Museveni promised to construct a residential house for the marathoner who raced himself into Uganda’s and the Commonwealth Games’ record books with the country’s first double gold at a major international event
Museveni also promised to upgrade a training field in Kipsiro’s home district of Bukwo into a fourlane training field to provide athletes there with high altitude training facilities
I like President Museveni’s style
Voter register not readyThe Electoral Commission once again has the opposition really worried
The EC displayed the national voters register between August 11 and September 13 to allow village tribunals to clear it of dead, underage or other ineligible voters
In early August the EC kicked off a storm when it announced that it had registered 15,002,720 voters, a figure that the opposition challenges on grounds that it is practically impossible for half of the country’s population to be eligible voters
Now with EC Boss Kiggundu saying that the final number of voters is yet to be tallied and the final register yet to be finalised, the question of how many people qualify to vote remains a major contention, at least the coming weeks Minister of Works and Transport John Nasasira (R) talks to the the African Union official Paulus Geraedts at the opening of the SubSaharan African Transport Policy meeting at Speke Resort Munyonyo on October 18
Police quell demonstrators over the damaged Kafumbe Mukasa Road on October 15
Mwenda Last Saturday, October 16, I was a guest on Capital Radio’s Capital Gang programme and our debate settled down to the subject of democracy in Africa – specifically on Uganda and Rwanda
But look: The second most influential man in Uganda after President Yoweri Museveni is Amama Mbabazi from Kanungu district
Mbabazi and a few elites are not “the people of Kanungu
” Yet Mbabazi is not an oddity; his is the story of Africa’s democratic experiment
If Museveni wants to win the Bairu vote in Ankole, he does little to address their concerns over healthcare, education and transportation
He appoints Amanya Mushega, Kahinda Otafiire and Ephraim Kamuntu into his cabinet
His opponent, Kizza Besigye, in trying to win over the Baganda does not address their concerns over land and agricultural policy
He strikes a deal with two former Katikkiros – Ssemwogerere Mulwanyamuli and Daniel Muliika
When Museveni openly gives envelops stuffed with cash to ordinary people, as has become his norm these days, he is addressing a vital existential need to gain political advantage
While appearing before parliament on October 13, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Kirunda Kivejinja, claimed the book is a national security threat
Dr Kobusingye, the author, is a sister of the leader of the opposition Forum for Democratic (FDC) party, retired Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye
It’s a chronology and examination of how Museveni has made 360degree turn from his passionate promises and ideals of 1986 to the political evils of the past regimes he had contemptuously condemned
It chronicles the early signs in the 1990s of what the author calls Museveni’s derailment from the Movement’s original ideals, the failed internal struggles to reform the Movement and the emergency of Besigye on the political arena
It shows how, prior to announcing his candidature, Besigye warned his family of the dangers his action would expose them to during his pursuit of democratic change in Uganda
“Besigye repeated his warning that we might be targeted for harassment, and I recall Margaret [Besigye’s sister now in exile] saying she was not going into the second exile,” the author writes
Margaret Kifefe was first forced into exile by Amin’s military regime
The author catalogues the extrajudicial killings especially of political opponents under Museveni’s regime, the collapse of the rule of law and the role of the state in the death of Besigye’s brother Joseph Musasizi Kifefe to whom the book is dedicated
In fact in its preface, the book begins with a reminiscence of the state kidnappings and killings during Obote’s regime before it quickly brings you back to a similar state of affairs under Museveni today
“One afternoon in 1981 when I had been at Makerere University for only a couple of weeks, my niece Annette burst into my room at Africa Hall wailing
Her mother Beatrice Kemigisha had been taken away by Obote’s security operatives
This reminiscence brings an instant juxtaposition of the character of Museveni’s regime and the regimes he overthrew, which shows that they are not much different today
She uses Museveni’s own book and other writings on the political evils like state inspired violence, political persecution of opponents and arbitrary arrests he contemptuously condemned in the past
The author brings out how Museveni has since become a vicious perpetrator of the same evils
For example in The Price of Bad Leadership; What is Africa’s Problem? Museveni condemned Milton Obote’s government for attacking the Kabaka’s palace in 1966
He stated: “During the 1966 when Obote was quarrelling with Mutesa, Obote’s army massacred many people
If Mutesa is having a political quarrel with Obote, what does the population have to do with it and why kill them? I do not agree with the proverb that when two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers
The incidents were a test on Museveni’s sincerity
Museveni disagreed with Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi (Buganda’s king) who wanted to visit Kayunga, a part of his kingdom
The disagreement was sparked by a much smaller issue than the one between Obote and Mutesa in 1966
Museveni stopped the Kabaka on account that a local community in Kayunga was opposed to the king’s visit
So what had happened to the government’s capacity to arrest rioters without killing them? Had Museveni lied in his book? Dr Kobusingye’s book shows that Museveni has so changed that he is no longer his former self
Museveni had said nominations for all political posts would be done on individual merit under the Movement
But when Dr Besigye announced his candidature, Museveni declared him a deserter from the Movement
Museveni rallied the cabinet and the Caucus to announce him as the Movement’s preferred candidate for the 2001 elections
” The resolution was formally signed by Movement Caucus chairman Prof. Gilbert Bukenya on December 9, 2000
By this, the author says, no other candidate was eligible to stand on the Movement ticket except Museveni yet the election was supposed to be on “individualmerit” basis
This amounts to blatant manipulation of the political system which Museveni had castigated shortly after capturing power
So when Museveni was seeking to be endorsed as the only candidate for the Movement, wasn’t he in essence manipulating the political system against public interest?
According to Museveni’s earlier writing, such cannot be called freedom
Kobusingye doubts Museveni’s sincerity in his earlier writings and suggests he was just covering up his political dishonesty
“Since the NRM is not officially a political party despite having the characteristics of a ruling political party in a single party state, it has sought to create an illusion that Uganda is a noparty state
Such semantics obscure the basic reality of the NRM’s partisan dominance of the political process in Uganda,” the report reads in part
” However when Besigye announced his candidature in 2000, Museveni declared him a deserter, meaning he was no longer a member of the Movement
So where did Museveni want him to go?
But after the elections, NRM officials announced that the Movement had won
The Constituent Assembly elections in 1994 were conducted on individual merit under the allinclusive Movement
The book says some EC top officials were representatives or agents of companies which were doing business with the Commission
One example was Lithotec, a South African company, which was contracted to print ballot papers for the EC in 2001
One of the EC top officials, whom the book names, was the company’s business representative and indeed it won the contract
The parliamentary committee which investigated the 2001 election violence in 2002 discovered that more than half of the EC senior staff were not qualified
The book cites several cases of fraud in procurement deals which were carried out even after the government contracted SWIPCO, a Swiss procurement company, had advised A military squad called Black Mamba lays siege on the High Court after the judge had released treason suspects on bail on November 16, 2005
The indictment on the EC incompetence is reinforced by the findings of the Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006 which showed the Electoral Commission could not be trusted to deliver free and fair elections
In his Mustard Seed, Museveni says that lack of trust is a big impediment to the democratisation process
“Not to be trusted is the greatest strategic handicap for any political group,” Museveni writes
Yet he has rejected the opposition and civil society organisations’ demands to dissolve the EC well knowing that the public has lost faith in it
Our country has gone through a traumatic experience for the last twenty or so years, mainly because Obote and Amin had no respect for the rule of law
Nobody has the right to take away a person’s life, freedom or property except within the due process of the law,” Museveni said passionately at the seminar
However this contrasts sharply with the Museveni who ordered the rearrest of Besigye and his 21 coaccused who had been duly released on bail by the High Court in Kampala on November 16, 2005
His soldiers, like Obote’s and Amin’s armies, deprived the suspects of their liberty contrary to his promise at the law seminar in 1987
In February 2002 two opposition supporters Peter Oloya Yumbe and Steven Olanya were arrested on charges of murdering Alfred Bongomin, the Movement chairman for Pabbo in Gulu
In his “Ours is a Fundamental Change” Museveni had stated: “No regime has a right to kill or beat any citizen of this country
” However, for Yumbe’s murder by Museveni’s soldiers, the government did not even investigate the case
Olanya and Penytoo were released but later rearrested on March 9, 2005
When the police were about to release them, the UPDF grabbed them again and took them to the military barracks where they were joined by another opposition supporter Ochan Laryang
The suspects were transferred to Kampala and charged with murder of Ochaya, Kitgum RDC, who police said was killed in 2002
One month later the police said the suspects had killed Alfred Bongomin in Gulu, not Ochaya
Then the state arrested MPs Michael Ocula and Reagan Okumu and charged them with killing Bongomin
One day a man came to her home and told her that the state had heard that she was planning to report to the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC)
He warned that the day she would report to UHRC was the day she would die
She has never reported to UHRC
Frank Atukunda was arrested for subversion and taken to a garage at Arua Presidential Lodge
A military intelligence officer called Drani led the beatings and told the suspects they did not deserve to live
He would tell them Museveni is “a good parent and whoever opposes him deserves to die
” Drani is still in CMI, The Independent has established
Another intelligence officer Arnold Kajjo, a relative of Security Minister Amama Mbabazi, would use big sticks to hit the suspects
Patrick Mamenero was arrested from Kabale for alleged subversion
He died in CMI detention on July 23, 2002
Noble Mayombo told the press that Mamenero had died of malaria
Mamenero had been detained with his father
From Museveni’s early days of the struggle, he was resolute that sorting out the A death certificate of Patrick Mamenero from Kabale district who was arrested by soldiers for alleged subversion and killed at CMI in 2002
In his Selected Articles on the Uganda Resistance War 1985, Museveni said: “There is quite a lot of misconception not only on the question of Uganda but also on many African issues
”However in 2005 after the constitution had been controversially amended amidst accusations that he had bribed parliament to pass the amendment removing presidential term limits, Museveni changed his previous statement and told the press: “You wasted a lot of time and power discussing kisanja (presidential tenure)
From then onwards Museveni started saying that Uganda’s fundamental problem was in fact economic development and serious people should talk about things like poverty alleviation and industrialisation
Before Musasizi Kifefe was arrested in November 2004, there had been an assassination attempt on his life
Saasi left later in another car
And how could Besigye have been so right and with such a precision?” the book reads
Francis Ayume was the Speaker of parliament
“Ayume was seen as a threat, so he was removed and made Attorney General and replaced with Edward Sekandi” the book reads in part
Ministers Bidandi Ssali, Eriya Kategaya, Miria Matembe, Amanya Mushega and Sarah Nakiyingi who opposed the change of the constitution were dropped from Cabinet
Then Museveni’s cheerleaders started choruses calling for him to rule for life
At a rally in Sembabule in January 2004, four cabinet ministers and 20 MPs danced for the third term for Museveni
Minister Syda Bbumba took the issue a little further
Khiddu Makubuya changes goal postsKizza Besigye’s arrest on treason and rape charges on November 14, 2005 threw his presidential candidature into balance
The Electoral Commission sought the opinion of the Attorney General, Khiddu Makubuya
Makubuya was a member of the commission set up by Museveni in 1987 to investigate human rights abuses from 1962 to 1986
Makubuya, then an associate professor of law at Makerere University, disagreed with his fellow commissioners on some issues and wrote a minority report
However, on Besigye’s case, he turned his statement on its head and said that the FDC leader’s candidature should be blocked because the treason charge had placed his level of innocence below that of other candidates
The book also captures the various episodes in Besigye’s trial both in the High Court and military court and the protracted struggle by Besigye’s lawyers to stop the arbitrary prosecution by the state
The book then delves into how the state blocked Besigye’s brother Musasizi Kifefe from getting proper treatment and in time, leading to his eventual death
It places Kifefe’s death at the hands of the state
The author borrows from Museveni’s explanation in 2003 when he was justifying why he had lent his presidential jet to fly his daughter abroad to give birth instead of taking her to local public hospitals
According to Museveni, the book suggests, the possibility of poisoning a vulnerable prisoner like Musasizi in prison is real in Uganda
The author narrates the various attempts by the family to get a medical report for Musasizi’s bail application in court and how doctors and administrators of Mulago Hospital refused to release it citing fear for their lives
According to Museveni, the book suggests, the possibility of poisoning a vulnerable prisoner like Musasizi in prison is real in Uganda
It bears a picture of Museveni in military uniform with an assault rifle, an image of militarism in Uganda’s politics
It holds Museveni against his every promise in Sowing the Mustard Seed and concludes that his political accountability has fallen flat
Critics have pointed at the confiscation of the book as another sign of the growing intolerance of dissenting views by the Museveni regime
With less than five months to the general elections next year in which Museveni and Besigye are likely to be candidates, human rights advocates are worried about the erosion of basic freedoms of speech, association, and the right to information
Legislators including Kitgum Women’s Member of Parliament Beatrice Atim Anywar objected to the introduction of the bill before the tabling of the more comprehensive law to govern the industry, the Petroleum Act
By delaying the introduction of the Petroleum Act, the government is “overlooking the foundations of a solid and accountable system,” said Atim
Energy Minister Hilary Onek held a press conference practically handing the Italians the keys to Uganda’s oil fields
Just a few days later officials including the Minister of Investment Aston Kajara contradicted him, saying that a final decision had not yet been made on whether the government had rejected Tullow’s preemption of the sale
According to some reports, the company had received a letter from the Permanent Secretary of Energy, Kabagambe Kaliisa, giving it permission to go ahead with its plan of paying Heritage and depositing the tax claimed by the government in an escrow account in London
The current chaos in the management of the industry points to a problem at the top, according to Dickens Kamugisha, of the Africa Institute for Energy Governance
“All this confusion we are seeing is the result of one man trying to manage everything,” said Kamugisha
He clamped down on officials jumping his signal with a letter to Minister Onek declaring that no oil deals were to be signed without written presidential consent
As Kamugisha says, “From the start, Museveni is creating the impression that he is so powerful, that ‘You companies can’t survive without my say
It’s clear that the government, especially President Yoweri Museveni, blames Tullow for letting Heritage get away without paying the US$404 million the government claims in tax
The current chaos in the management of the industry points to a problem at the top, according to Dickens Kamugisha, of the Africa Institute for Energy Governance.
“All this confusion we are seeing is the result of one man trying to manage everything,” said Kamugisha
He clamped down on officials jumping his signal with a letter to Minister Onek declaring that no oil deals were to be signed without written presidential consent
As Kamugisha says, “From the start, Museveni is creating the impression that he is so powerful, that ‘You companies can’t survive without my say
Musumba has been Buzaaya County MP since 1996
It was therefore a shock that he lost to little known LCV councillor Martin Muzaale
Musumba and Menhya were reluctant to discuss their defeat, but Kiyingi, who rose to prominence in 2006 after handing FDC’s Eastern Region Vice Chairperson Salaamu Musumba a shock defeat, is not taking the loss lightly
But if his 2006 election feat surprised Busoga, the NRM Returning Officer Sanubi Namusisi’s announcement on September 7 that Kiyingi had lost to former Makerere University guild president, Henry Maurice Kibalya, left Busoga shell shocked
Kibalya got 17,171 votes and Kiyingi, 16,974
The returning officer was under strict instructions to fix the results in favour of my opponent,” Kiyingi claims
Who issued the instructions to have the results fixed? He claims it’s Kadaga
He says Kadaga should not have supported Moses Kizige against Menhya in Bugabula North, Kibalya against him in Bugabula South and Martin Muzaale against Isaac Musumba in Buzaaya
All those who allegedly had Kadaga’s backing won the primaries
Government and NRM Chief Whip, Daudi Migereko, doubts the allegations against Kadaga
He says it is normal for new entrants to approach an established leader, like Kadaga, about their intentions
Former Iganga LCV Chairman George Patrick Bageya, says that protracted fights have always existed among Busoga’s leaders since 1986
He says former Vice President Speciosa Kazibwe ganged up with Kadaga to fight Kirunda Kivejinja who was viewed as Busoga’s undisputed political leader
The friction between Kadaga and Kivejinja remained even after Kazibwe quit cabinet
Bageya says the infighting led to the emergence of strong opposition politicians like Abdul Katuntu
Bageya says Katuntu was introduced by Kadaga and supported by Kazibwe to defeat Kivejinja
How can three men claim that they were defeated because of one woman?
She argues Kiyingi was defeated because of refusing to support Prince William Gabula’s claim to the Kyabazinga’s throne
"I would side with Kadaga if at all she fought him,” Musumba said.
Kiyingi’s case is one of the several cases that are to be reviewed by a joint team the NRM formed to review and resolve electoral disputes, but the committee has not held a single meeting yet
Even if the committee eventually visited Kamuli, can it indict Kadaga, a member of the party’s Central Executive Committee and Deputy Speaker of parliament?
In 2008 the two politicians also disagreed over how Kiyingi handled the petition Kadaga lodged before the parliament’s committee on rules, privileges and discipline, accusing Kibuku MP Saleh Kamba of defamation
During an NRM parliamentary caucus meeting, Kamba had accused Kadaga of having facilitated Katuntu to defeat Kivejinja in the November 2007 byelections for Bugweri parliamentary seat
Parliamentary sources say Kiyingi advised Kadaga to get a different person to present the petition rather herself
This was to save Kadaga from appearing as a complainant, prosecutor and judge since she is Deputy Speaker of parliament
Salaamu Musumba is preparing to stand again in Kamuli.
That is why the party is trying to resolve all those issues,” says Migereko
Moses Kisolo Wojega has given way for his rival Mutwalibi Zandya Mafabi to carry the party’s flag in next year’s elections
The votes Zandya received from the two divisions exceeded the number of registered voters
According FDC officials the party investigated and found the allegations were correct.
Kisolo won the fresh elections held on Oct 10 but Zandya refused to concede defeat.
However Richard Kudeeba, the FDC district electoral commissioner, said Zandya had been duly informed
They convened a meeting and tasked Budadiri East MP Nandala Mafabi to mediate and persuade Kisolo to step down for Zandya
Kisolo was Nandala’s driver.
Kisolo says he yielded because people were complaining that the Bagisu from Budadiri were taking over all the positions in Mbale
Some of the prominent politicians from Budadiri include Nathan Nandala Mafabi and Jack Wamai Wamanga, the incumbent Mbale Municipality MP
Kisolo says that his stay in the race would give credence the claims and polarise the party faithful
Party supporters, he says, of Zandya’s camp were likely not to vote Wamai in the parliamentary elections
Wamai had lived abroad for over 30 years and was not well known in local politics
Kisolo played a big role in marketing his candidature to win the municipality’s parliamentary seat in the byelections earlier this year
Kisolo has now turned his eyes on the seat for chairman of Industrial Division in the municipality.
The meeting will determine whether a rerun should be held or the party upholds the disputed results that would make Nagudi the official flag bearer
Mugarura confirmed that the party had investigated the alleged malpractices in the recently concluded primaries for Mbale Woman MP and discovered that in some places the votes exceeded the number of registered voters
Last week, Kudeeba told The Independent that the party had decided to uphold the initial election results that made Nagudi the winner
However, Mugarura insisted the party had not yet named the flag bearer for the Woman MP seat by October 19
Francis Mwijukye, a committee member on the party’s Information and Publicity Department, said 80 voters were held at the FDC district chairman’s home on the day of the voting.
This is the question you hear among the Kamuli folk in most social talks.
Tayebwa said he would petition the party.
Mwijukye says Tayebwa is a member of the party’s National Executive Committee and one of the founding members
He said Tayebwa is a huge political asset to the FDC and the party would exhaust all avenues to ensure his grievances are addressed appropriately
However Mugisha told The Independent that she had met with Besigye over the election irregularities in Nakawa Division where she is standing for FDC flag bearer for the parliamentary seat
She is locked in a wrangle with Michael Kabaziguruka, another party stalwart in Nakawa
The party Secretary General Alice Alaso had said the election in Nakawa was being handled at the highest level
Mugisha says Besigye rarely involves himself in party wrangles over who is elected where or gets what, a style different from President Museveni’s system
Museveni would meet disgruntled supporters and try to persuade them to give up by promising them compensation in terms of jobs or business
In 2006 Dr Besigye received his first test when opposition members of parliament disagreed on who would become their leader of opposition between Sam Njuba and Prof. Ogenga Latigo
Some senior party members took sides in the media but Besigye stayed out of the wrangle to allow the vote decide
"She must be a very powerful woman,” Salaamu Musumba wonders
Abbey Semuwemba is a Ugandan living in the United Kingdom.
If anybody wants to enter parliament, they better run to State House for President Museveni’s blessings or anointment.
An important feature of the recently concluded NRM election primaries was the violence and fraud that characterised the process across almost the entire country
This produced a large number of aggrieved NRM politicians who have declared they want to run as independents
President Yoweri Museveni had previously sought to treat them as rebels and threatened to expel them from the NRM
However, after meeting the party’s parliamentary caucus, many of whose members lost in the primaries, Museveni altered his stance and allowed them to run as independents
Given the multitude of losers in the NRM primary, this was a smart move by the party president
Museveni may have been afraid that if he refused them to run as independents, many would have toed with the idea of joining the opposition
Consequently, we are likely to have an independent candidate in almost every constituency in Uganda
It is also possible that most independents will be from the NRM
This means that NRM will most probably have two candidates in every constituency
Given that the opposition seems unable to field candidates in all constituencies, the real race in most of Uganda will be NRM running against NRM
This means that even if NRM had not opened up to multiparty politics, its internal power struggles would have created an inevitable multiparty situation
The inability of the opposition parties to attract disgruntled NRM politicians is not because of lack of ideological support
We know that most NRM politicians share the sentiments of opposition parties regarding endemic corruption, incompetence and mismanagement of this nation
Therefore, the challenge for us intellectually is how to explain NRM’s ability to retain a large number of followers among the leadership of this country even in the face of widespread discontent among them
Museveni has ensured that NRM is able to exhibit and project some form of democratic character
By allowing regular internal elections, he has created opportunities for many people seeking to climb the ladders of power inside NRM to do so
More critically, Museveni understands that an election is a time to test a politician’s popular standing
But he also needs NRM to have a big win in every election in order to sustain the myth of his personal and his political party’s invincibility
This is important to discourage potential defectors in NRM from joining other opposition parties
For example, NRM has demonstrated that in western Uganda, it cannot be beaten
Therefore, even the most ardent critics of the NRM in Western Uganda do not join any opposition party
Take the example of Alex Ruhunda who was recently elected as NRM flag bearer for Fort Portal Municipality
I argued that NRM should be credited for promoting liberal economic reforms that have sustained robust growth for two decades
Ruhunda was angry with me for saying something positive about NRM
He accused me of having been probably compromised by Museveni
Ruhunda’s decision had little to do with his personal character, morality and integrity as most Ugandans would argue
However, if he were to have any chance of going to parliament, he could only do so as an NRM candidate and possibly hope to join some progressive faction inside the party to promote reform
The myth of invincibility that Museveni and NRM have cultivated over the years is the major reason disgruntled NRM politicians find it more profitable to run as independents
It is also the reason why people who are very critical of NRM join it nonetheless
Museveni has been keen to reward everyone when they accept his leadership even when he knows that at heart they disagree with his politics
Museveni recognises that cooptation of elites is cheaper than fighting
He has employed repression of course, but only selectively on those who have sought to challenge him – like Kizza Besigye
By demonstrating the rewards of loyalty and increasing the costs of opposition on the individuals who try, the president has scared many potential NRM defectors and opponents from attempting resistance to his rule
Museveni’s willingness to embrace potentially hostile politicians has led to what economists call “preference falsification” – people pretending to support NRM even when they actually don’t
Politicians in Uganda therefore face a choice of staying loyal to Museveni and hence continue to enjoy power and the privileges that go with it; or to openly challenge him and invite the wrath of the state like Besigye
Why NRM losers don’t join FDCthe Last WordMore critically, Museveni understands that an election is a time to test a politician’s popular standing
20 President Yoweri Museveni met about 3,000 supporters of his party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), from Mawokota North constituency in Mpigi district
The meeting was organised by the newly elected queen of the area, Amelia Kyambadde, who is the immediate past principal private secretary to the President
The meeting was intended to get the area MP, Peter Claver Mutuluuza, not to contest against Amelia in next year’s general elections
The calm and softspoken Mutuluuza is no stranger to battles with big shots in his party and, he says, defeating Kyambadde in the 2011 parliamentary elections will be easy even if she has Museveni’s backing
According to a statement from State House, Mutuluuza told the President that he deliberately chose to contest as an independent candidate “because of the democracy and right guaranteed under the constitution”
I will have a picture of Mutuluuza and that of the President because I am his supporter
I have no problem with Museveni
I want to thank Amelia for the development she has done in Mawokota North
If I had also been given money I would have done the same,” he said in a veiled swipe at State House sponsorship of Museveni’s blueeyed girl, Amelia
“Abantu abamu mu muvumenti basiwuka,” he said in Luganda, meaning: “some people lack manners”
“They are Movement only in words but not in their actions,” Museveni said in a veiled reference to Mutuluuza
Museveni reportedly dangled a ministerial appointment for him if he dropped his 2011 bid
That was unusual and appears to have shocked Museveni
The Amelia, Mutuluuza rift is not the only fallout from the recently concluded countrywide NRM primaries and NRM party leadership elections
Up to 600 election petitions have been filed with the NRM Electoral Commission and losers have been spewing threats to catch President Museveni’s eye
Museveni knows that very few of them would reject a ministerial job or any other in the government
Take Agaba Abbas, the former leader of the NRM youth league, who was beaten to the party’s flagbearer status in Kitagwenda constituency, Kamwenge district
He petitioned against the results claiming the incumbent MP and NRM flagbearer, Nulu Byamukama, used massive intimidation and violence in which some of his supporters were even cut with machetes
He says, however, that he will not stand as an independent because he is sure Museveni will give him a job
He says Museveni persuaded him to drop out of the race for NRM vice chairperson for Western Uganda.
Matayo Kyaligonza on assurances that he was to be “deployed elsewhere within the state”
Museveni, whose urgent concern is to hold his supporters together after the acrimonious primaries and hardly five months to the general election, looks increasingly determined to use his prerogative to promise NRM losers to public office jobs
NRM cadres that have already been identified should not have to think that the electoral offices are the only offices of service.
”Promises for jobs have raised concern during Museveni's campaign.
Dr Yasin Olum of Makerere University Political Science department says Uganda’s politics has become transactional, is no longer a service and Museveni will use it to maximum advantage
President Museveni will definitely achieve his immediate objective, which is keeping himself in power
”Olum, who is an expert on the democratisation process in Uganda, says the negative effects of the commercialisation of our politics will be borne by future generations
The Uganda constitution limits the number of ministers and their deputies to 42 but, in a bid to appease numerous political interests, Museveni has appointed 69 ministers and their deputies, hundreds of RDCs, Presidential Advisors, and other state agents
For now, because it could jolt the gravy train ahead of the impending elections, Museveni cannot announce many new appointments but the job promises spewing out of State House suggest the legions of statesponsored leaches will increase in 2011
Critics say this places a huge burden on the national purse but Museveni maintains that it is the price of peace and proponents of the jobsforpeace in the NRM are equally adamant
NRM Vice Chairman for Eastern Region, Mike Mukula says the strategy will work
A party supporter who spoke out on condition of remaining anonymous says he was rigged out in the NRM elections in 2005 for MP in Mayuge district
He says Museveni and Hajji Moses Kigongo, at a meeting at the party headquarters on Kyaddondo Road in Kampala, convinced him and others not to stand as independents on the understanding that they would work on the regional Museveni Task Force and later get jobs.
He says they held several meetings chaired by Sembabule District Chairperson Herman Sentongo as they toed with the idea of going independent
Rujumbura County MP and Chairman of NRM Veterans, Jim Muhwezi, says Museveni will deploy some of the losers within the party or the state and “facilitate others to carry out private business”
”Others, like Mutuluuza, are unlikely to pay attention to Muhwezi’s counsel
Until his party, the NRM, endorsed Amelia, Mutuluuza’s seat was secure
The resident of Kammengo Township along KampalaMasaka highway remains very popular among his ethnic Banyarwanda who are a sizeable voting block in the constituency and has courted the other big voting blocks in his constituency, the Catholics and the Baganda establishment at Mengo
When in 2008-2009 Museveni’s government fought with the Mengo establishment over the acrimonious Land Amendment Bill 2007, Mutuluuza voted with Buganda and ganged up with Buganda legislators to force an emergency recall of parliament from recess to discuss the arrest of three Buganda Kingdom officials who had spoken out against the proposed land amendments
Kyambadde tried to court ethnic Baganda by promising to engineer the return to air of the closed Buganda Kingdom radio station, CBS
She used to move with some of the former workers of CBS, assuring supporters that she is working hard to switch the radio back on air and she is taking care of the interests of the former workers
Despite that, President Museveni appears to have anointed Amelia
Sensing this, Mutuluuza opted to step outside the NRM, not participate in its primaries but run as an independent in 2011
Museveni and Amelia know Mutuluuza could defeat them
The Mawokota North MP is no stranger to battles with party big shots
He wrestled the constituency from an NRM strongman, the late former minister Zimula Mugwanya
In the heat of the acrimonious 2001 campaigns in which Mutuluuza accused Mugwanya of violently attacking his supporters, Mutuluuza is thought to have sponsored a court case in which Mugwanya was eventually thrown out of parliament for lack of academic qualifications
Mugwanya was one of the financiers of the NRM bush war and his entourage on the campaign trail always had military escorts
Museveni’s hands tiedAs he weighs his next move, Museveni has been meeting with delegations from different areas where primary elections were chaotic and threatened his support
Museveni appears to merely seek opportunities to cajole, caution, and threaten
One such delegation came from Nakaseke district
In Nakaseke, an NRM stronghold, antiriot police are still on patrol, and Finance Minister Syda Bbumba’s home is one of the highly guarded spots
The district was gripped in tension when one Nsamba Bukenya was declared winner of the NRM flagbearer contest for the district chair
Incumbent chairperson, Ignatius Koomu, is believed to have won the election but the results were allegedly interchanged with those of Bukenya
NRM delegates boo the party General Secretary Amama Mbabazi during the National Conference at Namboole on June 26
Both Vice President Prof. Gilbert Bukenya and Trade Minister Maj. Gen. Kahinda Otafiire, who lost the secretary general post to Security Minister Mbabazi, have shown limited interest in party activities since the acrimonious showdown at Namboole
Opponents accuse her of orchestrating a voterigging scheme that turned the results of the primary elections upside down
The moment Bukenya was declared winner, spontaneous demonstrations broke out in the district
Some 1,500 party cards were returned to the party offices in Semuto subcounty by angry supporters who felt their candidate had been robbed of victory
The demonstrators took to digging up the new tarmac road that is being built from Matugga to Butalangwa, the seat of the district administration
With the situation out of hand, Museveni invited a team from Nakaseke to explain to him what had happened
A source that attended the meeting says that Bbumba tilted the composition of the team to include many of her supporters who would misinform the president about the situation on the ground in Nakaseke
“I felt uncomfortable throughout the meeting with the president because what was being fed to him was false but I was afraid to say the truth until Mubeezi, a resident of Ngoma subcounty, spoke out and informed the president that whatever he was being told was wrong,” the source told The Independent
After Mubeezi spoke out, the source added, he got support from a few members of the delegation and the president was put in a dilemma
“He (Museveni) promised to send a factfinding team to establish the truth of what was going on in Nakaseke,” continued the source
The factfinding team established that most people in Nakaseke favour Koomu and on the basis of this information, radio announcements were made to the effect that Koomu is the NRM flagbearer for Nakaseke district
Bbumba sailed through the primaries for the Nakaseke North constituency unopposed
One is a diplomat in Germany while another holds a big National Social Security Fund post in Northern Uganda
18, three disenchanted party members – Muhammad Nsereko, Steven Masinde and Rose Namayanja – went with their supporters and appealed to Museveni about what they say was rigging at the party’s Delegates Conference at Namboole
Nsereko, who lost to former Kampala MP Francis Babu in the race for the newly formed Kampala Regional NRM vice chairperson post, told the President that his agents were forced to sign unfilled declaration forms
The results that were entered in the forms and eventually declared at Namboole, Nsereko reportedly informed Museveni, were false
Namayanja lost the deputy secretary general post to incumbent Dorothy Hyuha while Masinde lost to Katongole Singh in the race for deputy treasurer
The three petitioners and their supporters, our source revealed, told Museveni that the ushers, who were pro Secretary General Amama Mbabazi who retained his post, are the ones who voted instead of the real delegates
“We went hoping to give testimonies to the president,” one of the candidates’ agents who was at the meeting told The Independent, adding, “he, however, came and served a big dinner after which he told us the Hajji Moses Kigongo commission will handle the complaints
Nsereko had fought Babu on three different fronts in just a couple of months
Namayanja confirmed that the meeting took place but declined to divulge what was discussed
She was referring to the chaos and rigging that marred the Butaleja district primary elections in which Hyuha lost the flag for district woman MP despite being accused of participating in rigging
Her only hope, she said, was in the new entrants on the executive team, especially Amelia Kyambadde (party treasurer), Abdul Nadduli (Vice Chairperson for Buganda region) and Sam Engola (vice chairperson for Northern region), to bring a new dimension
Some of the other delegations he met recently came from Kalungu East where the incumbent MP, Umar Mawiya, is accused by Masaka district chairperson Vincent Ssempijja of rigging the MP primary election; and the recently elected members of the party’s youth league
Both Vice President Prof. Gilbert Bukenya and Trade Minister Maj. Gen. Kahinda Otafiire, who lost the secretary general post to Security Minister Mbabazi, have shown limited interest in party activities since the acrimonious showdown at Namboole
Bukenya has since withdrawn from the public and the only time he has spoken, he said he was busy working on a science paper
Otafiire, on his part, was reluctant to comment on NRM issues
” On Sept 26, the Moses Kigongo reconciliation team met in Mbarara with all candidates who participated in the primaries in the 14 districts of western Uganda
If Otafiire and other disgruntled party members choose to keep off party activities and leave it to Mbabazi’s group, as Otafiire’s comment suggests, Museveni would find himself in a complicated position on the campaign trail next year
Alice Karango, 39, uncomfortably sits in front of her two roomed house in Masheruka, Bushenyi District, desperately watching her three kids, Atwiine Martin, 15, Arinda Bridget 13 and Nelson Andinda 10, fight over a piece of bread
Karango is a widow to the late Private Edris Kyeyune who died while fighting Kony’s Lords Resistance Army (LRA) with the Uganda People’s Defense Forces (UPDF) in the DRC in 2001
Karango says that her husband’s body was brought home for burial
Since 2004, Karango is supposed to have received her late husband’s pension from the government but has failed despite repeated efforts
Karango says that her inlaws were against the idea of her pursuing the pension and consequently hid the documents that were required for one to claim the pension
”Karango has been helped by her friend Sirajj Musoke, a UPDF officer who retired from service because he is HIV positive, and who has also worked to get his own pension since 2003
Musoke says that he has been helping several widows and orphans to secure their pension
”Ann Kalenzi, 24, also says that she dropped out of school in S.3 when her father, Sgt Alex Kalenzi died in 2004 in a motor accident
”Karango and all other pension seekers only ray of hope lies with the previous exsoldiers’ registration that could see tens of thousands receive their pensions
” However, Felix Kulayigye, the UPDF spokesman recently announced that the Ministry of Defence has already secured the money to clear the pension arrears
The audit titled “Pension Processing by the department of Compensation: ministry of Public Service” noted that “the general delays led to failure by retired officers to provide for themselves and their families leading to increased dependency burden, distress and frustration
Kulaigye says that in total over 140,000 exservice men were registered in the process and that these would benefit from the Shs 34billion that the government earmarked for the exsoldiers
Kulaigye adds that another Shs120bn was also set aside for the same purpose, however this chunk is meant to cater for various exservicemen including civil servants, police and the like
The exercise will also see exsoldiers who served in Amin and Obote II regimes officially discharged from the army
In March 2009, there were reports that there was a racket in the Directorate of Records, Manpower Audit Section, in which billions meant for the departed soldiers were stolen
Emilio Mondo, chief of the Uganda Veterans Board who personally participated in the registration process says that although he cannot say that the ghosts were totally eliminated, he was sure that they were limited and reduced
Mondo, a former soldier in the Obote and Amin governments, oversaw the registration of over 50,000 exsoldiers in West Nile and northern Uganda regions
“We are receiving the complaints from upcountry that the money is not coming, so we also do not know what is happening,” Mondo says
But the recent UFA national Delegates Conference, which took place from Sept 22 to 24 at Namboole Stadium, suugests that Kamya has either failed to sell her party ideas to the masses, or her mobilisers are letting her down
UFA, which started as a pressure group that believes in the promotion of a federal system of government that would go far beyond the regional tier system, had delegates from Kampala’s four city divisions of Rubaga, Makindye, Kawempe, and Nakawa which were represented as districts
Kanyeihamba, the UFA coordinator, said these were part of the 12,000 delegates expected at the conference
Mukono and Wakiso districts did not have delegates; these areas are composed of Baganda people, who have wanted the federal “federo” system of governance since the days of Sir Kabaka Edward Muteesa I
In April 2010, the party was almost deregistered for presenting ghost members on its registration form from Masindi, Buliisa, Kibaale, Iganga and other parts of the country when it was called upon by the electoral body to submit 50 members from at least twothirds of the districts of Uganda
Ronald Kanyeihamba, the UFA coordinator, said each district was expected to bring six members who were appointed on the district executive committee, and two other delegates depending on how big the district was
Joseph Nkongoki, the chairperson from Rubirizi district, said his district had 10 representatives who included himself, his vice and other leaders of the party on the district level
On Sept 20 Kanyeihamba said those elected at Kawempe were special groups who included representatives of women, youth and Persons with Disabilities
A delegate from Ngora told The Independent that they were told to come and vote for the party president
Kamya was unopposed as party president as had been widely anticipated
Kamya is the only woman candidate in the race and the second woman to contest for the highest office in the land after Miria Obote who contested in the 2006 presidential elections on a UPC ticket
In northern Uganda, which also covers West Nile, where the election was first conducted, the losers were not as grumbling as their NRM counterparts
So was the case in the Gulu district chairman’s race where the loser, McMakot Kitara, immediately congratulated the winner Martin Ojara
Godi was defeated by Amina Atako, a local journalist who polled 52 votes against Godi’s 29
In Rukungiri Municipality, FDC Women’s League Chairperson, Ingrid Turinawe, lost to Roland Mugume, the party’s district chairperson
Conceding defeat Turinawe said the election had been free and fair but announced she would run for the district Woman MP seat to take on the minister of state for public service Sezi Mbaguta
In fact, after the election Turinawe, her fellow losers and the winner Mugume drove in the same car in the streets of Rukungiri town celebrating the victory
He claimed the municipality mayor, Christopher Acire, manipulated the voters’ register by allegedly deleting some names and replacing them with those he perceived as supporters
The source said the FDC officials from other regions were not happy that their colleagues from west had left the FDC president Kizza Besigye to fight as a lone ranger against the NRM party in the region
The source said officials from the east and north warned that if westerners were not committed to stamping the party in the region, this time round they (from north and east) will take full charge of the FDC leadership
But, Toterebuka Bamwenda, FDC’s deputy publicist, refuted the claims
Bamwenda, who is also contesting for the newly created Buyaga East County, said it’s not true that the FDC officials from the west had left Besigye to fight a lone political battle
Bamwenda said Muntu having stood for the party presidency, would not like to lower his candidature to constituency level
Besides, he adds, Muntu is representing Uganda in the East African Legislative Assembly for which he might seek reelection
Bemwenda claims FDC this time round is set to win more seats in western Uganda as the conditions for voting in 2006 have changed in the opposition’s favour
In some places like Kabarole, Bundibugyo, Kamwenge, and Kyenjonjo the FDC party barely has a member on the LCIII Council
According to Jack Sabiiti, the FDC treasurer and former Rukiga MP in Kabale district, what bogs down the party is where they lack a strong candidate in NRM strongholds
He says one Wilfred Murumba who is the district FDC chairperson and his group are doing great mobilisation
He said he will contest for Rukiga parliamentary seat
”Constituencies to watch in western Uganda if FDC fields its big shots in the NRM strongholds include: Kinkizi West where NRM Secretary General Amama Mbabazi comes from and is standing
Who will take on Mbabazi in 2011?
John Nasasira has represented Kazo since the Constituent Assembly in 1994, who will unseat him? In the previous election the FDC fronted Mwetise Bintabara and he is willing to take on Nasasira again
But will Bintabara dare the devil and defeat Museveni’s longest serving Minister for Works, Transport and Communication?
Mbarara Municipality has for long been a lone opposition constituency until FDC strong women, Winnie Byanyima resigned her seat for a UN job and NRM captured the seat.
FDC strongman retired Maj. John Kazoora has shown interest in recapturing the seat
But he has to defeat Dr Medard Bitekyerezo who won the NRM primaries for the same seat
Other FDC strongmen in western Uganda include Augustine Ruzindana who will contest for Ruhama to unseat First Lady Janet Museveni
Chapaa Karuhanga will tussle it out with NRM firebrand Maj. Gen. Kahinda Otafiire for Ruhinda constituency in the new Mitoma district (carved out of Bushenyi)
Odo Tayebwa will face former youth MP for Western Uganda, Nasser Basajjabalaba for BushenyiIshaka Municipality MP seat
FDC iron lady Ingrid Turinawe will lock horns with minister Mbaguta for Rukungiri district woman MP seat
Francis Mwijukye, an FDC youth winger and leader, will contest against NRM’s Ephraim Biraro for the Buhweju constituency
FDC vice chairperson for western Uganda, Amanya Mushega is facing NRM’s Raphael Magyezi who defeated Disaster Preparedness minister Tarsis Kabwegyere in the NRM party primaries
Other FDC strongmen like Mugisha Muntu, Musinguzi Garuga and Richard Kaijuka are not running for any elective office
In some places like Kabarole, Bundibugyo, Kamwenge, and Kyenjonjo the FDC party barely has a member on the LCIII Council
Kayihura had been told by Toro Queen Mother Best Olimi Kemigisa, who has a money dispute with Kasango, that the President had ordered the arrest
State House sources say that the President’s protocol officials were shocked when she showed up with two other persons: Jonathan her nephew, who is the personal assistant to her and King Oyo Nyimba Iguru, and a Kampala lawyer, William Byaruhanga
The Permanent Secretary Ministry of Lands, GabindadeMusoke, has stolen my money, she told the President
But, Byaruhanga told the President, although the government had paid Kemigisa Shs 4.5 billion for land she sold to the government, her lawyer, Bob Kasango, had walked away with all the money
Kemigisa and her lawyer also told the President that Kasango owns properties in Kampala and expensive vehicles that should be impounded and sold to recover money from him
Upon leaving the meeting, the Queen mother called the President’s Principal Private Secretary (PPS), Grace Akello, informing her that the President had directed the immediate arrest of Kasango and that the PPS should cause that to happen by further communicating the President’s directives to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to cause the arrest
State House has officially confirmed to The Independent that the President never promised to arrest Kasango nor has he ever instructed Kayihura to do so
When The Independent contacted Kayihura, he confirmed that the President never instructed him to arrest Kasango
Instead, said he had received a call from the queen mother claiming that the President had instructed him to arrest him
According to Kayihura, he directed the arrest of Kasango after both the queen mother and her lawyers told him the President had ordered the arrest
What is more, the police also reported Kasango to have been elusive and that he could not be reached by phone or in his office
In fact Kayihura told The Independent that he had held a meeting with Kasango on other official matters in his (IGP’s) office “two or three days” before he was arrested
Kasango said Byaruhanga’s partner, Andrew Kasirye went to CID headquarters in Kibuli sometime in May 2010 to register a criminal case against him and have him arrested
He says he visited the queen mother at her residence in Munyonyo in the evening and in their conversation, she denied having any intentions to have him arrested and even challenged him if she had reported any matter to any police
Instead, according to Kasango, she told him that it was the lawyers who were exerting pressure on her to have Kasango arrested
He visited the queen mother at her residence in Munyonyo in the evening and in their conversation, she denied having any intentions to have him arrested and even challenged him if she had reported any matter to any police.
My conviction is buttressed by some other information a person close to William Byaruhanga volunteered to my wife regarding Byaruhanga’s role in having me arrested and what lengths, together with the queen mother they had gone to have me arrested regardless of the truth
”When The Independent put this accusation to Andrew Kasirye, he denied having anything personal against Kasango but admitted that it was wrong on their part not to have written to Kasango demanding accountability on behalf of their client
“We believed the queen mother,” Kasirye says, “and if it is true that Kasango paid her, then she lied to us and that was wrong and unfair of her to us and to Kasango
But Gabindade wrote to Kemigisa’s lawyers saying that the queen mother had instructed him to pay all the money to Kasango’s law firm, Hall & Partners and also confirmed that the queen mother even talked to him about the matter and confirmed that Hall & Partners should receive the money on her behalf
When Andrew Mwenda, the Managing Editor of The Independent, who is related to Kemigisa and is also Kasango’s business partner visited her, the Queen mother told him that Kasango had paid her “some little money” – about Shs 400 million only – after the first release of her funds.
To that Kasango said, “Yes it is true some mutual friends have attempted to mediate in the matter and said to me that William is ready to apologize if the queen mother lied to them
Kasango, who spoke very emotionally, said: Byaruhanga said of me, words laced with acid and bitter lies, nothing he does can take that back
He came with the queen mother and Andrew Kasirye to me while I was in custody, they came at midnight in the company of my wife.

Byaruhanga has made it his top agenda to fight me and he has done this in three different cases
In this particular matter of Kemigisa, he approached her thrice, convincing her to take away instrutions from me and give them to him
On each occasion she told me the full discussion they had but I ignored Byaruhanga
Kemigisa instructed Kasango to represent her in the matter by a letter dated October 18, 2006, a copy of which The Independent has seen.
On the December 5, 2006, Kasango and Kemigisa executed two Retainer Agreements for legal fees – one for Shs1 billion and the other for Shs 600 million; total Shs 1.6 billion, that is, 35 percent of proceeds from the sale.
Kasango and Kemigisa established a relationship of mutual trust
“Bob is a very intelligent young man from who I sought very valuable advice on many issues and we had a good working relationship,” Kemigisa in particular told The Independent’s Managing Editor.
Kasango told The Independent he had officially written to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and attached all copies of payments made to the queen mother before the charges were sanctioned
Kasango says he knows the answer and, since he is now in court, he will say it in court for all to hear
Recently Adrian Jjuuko, a young and aspiring human rights lawyer, was set to have his petition heard in court, one and a half years after it was filed
Journalist Andrew Mwenda’s petition challenging the now abolished sedition law was filed five years ago
The significance, Jjukko says, is that without the resolution of such cases, Uganda can never experience and express fundamental human rights and freedoms as provided by our constitution
Similarly, Peter Magelah of Human Rights Network Uganda says their organisation has filed two petitions against legislation that impedes human rights which have stood unresolved for the last one and a half years

“If you are seeing such high incidences of multiple registration in nearby constituencies, how many are there in the registers of constituencies in Bundibugyo and Karamoja which are distant and hard to reach?” opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) Vice Chairperson for Eastern Uganda, Salaamu Musumba, wonders
Opposition Chief Whip Kassiano Wadri says that failure to come up with a clean register is one of the reasons behind the opposition’s persistent demands for an overhaul of the EC, which is accused of being incompent and partial to the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party of President Yoweri Museveni, who appoints the EC officials
The opposition has been very active in organizing protests against the Badru Kiggundu led EC which they want disbanded, but they are not jointly or at individual political party level applying all sorts of data analysis tools, to analyze the voter roll and provide their findings
EC Chairman Badru Kiggundu said that the employment of biometric technology and the application of facial recognition would exorcise ghost voters from the register.
Rwakojjo concedes that finger print match ups could not apply to the 10.5 million voters who had been on the register before June this year because they did not have finger print records in the old register
Sam Mugumya, a Forum for Democratic Change youth activist and Dr Kizza Besigye’s personal assistant, has borne the brunt of police wrath during political demonstrations
The FDC president and joint presidential flag bearer for the Interparty Cooperation (IPC) Kizza Besigye was roughed up by stick wielding militia (Kiboko squad) as he led an opposition demonstration at Katwe Mosque grounds near Clock Tower on June 9, 2010
Police spokesman, Vincent Sekkate, says the police explanation on the Bill has been misunderstood and misrepresented in the media
Mugumya says that the Bill is an a plot by the police to legitimise what they have been doing illegally since the Supreme Court ruled in the Muwanga Kivumbi vs Attorney General petition that demonstrators do not need police permission, they only need to notify the police
The FDC spokesman Wafula Oguttu said his party is working on legal documents to challenge the Bill as soon as it is tabled in parliament
Norbert Mao, the DP president, said the Bill’s “implementation will infringe on people’s right of association
Some political observers say that the Bill also targets to check Buganda kingdom administration’s actions following public riots in September last year after the government blocked the Kabaka of Buganda from visiting Kayunga, a part of Buganda kingdom
While celebrating his 17th coronation anniversary, Kabaka Ronald Mutebi said the persecution of Buganda should stop

Nampera added that doctors have advised her and other patients to approach media houses to counter what the minister of health Stephen Malinga and state minister for health James Kakooza have said about the availability of cancer drugs
To solve the problem, Kakooza said meetings had been scheduled between stakeholders, the Uganda cancer institute board, the ministry of health and National Medical Stores (NMS), the government department charged with purchasing drugs for all government hospitals
According to Chris Baryomunsi, the vice chairperson of the social services committee in parliament, because the cancer institute receives its own money to buy whatever it needs, Mulago hospital pharmacies cannot subsidize their shortage in drugs

Arua Municipality MP Godi Hussein conceded defeat
The NRM electoral commission is grappling with over 600 election petitions where the losers are threatening court action or to stand as independent candidates in the forthcoming general elections next year unless their grievances are addressed to their satisfaction
However, the FDC election primaries were not all rosy
The incumbent Gulu Municipality legislator David Oceng Penytoo cried foul
In electing the party flag bearers, who will face candidates from members of the interparty cooperation parties, the FDC used consensus where the rival candidates agreed on one representative among themselves and electoral colleges where consensus failed
Meanwhile winning more parliamentary seats from the western region for the FDC remains a salient issue
Information available to The Independent indicates that top FDC officials from the north and east have been complaining that their counterparts from the western region seem to be in the struggle only by word of mouth, not action on the ground
Besigye is from the west
The FDC has only three MPs from western Uganda and all of them come from Kasese, the only western district where Besigye defeated President Museveni in the 2006 elections
The other four FDC legislators are from the central region
The FDC officials from the east and north have the numbers and can democratically take over the party leadership
He said top FDC chiefs from western Uganda will contest in their constituencies
But, Bamwenda said, that Muntu stood for the presidency is enough proof of his commitment to FDC
Western Uganda is still known as an NRM stronghold
How the FDC western wing is working to correct this perception is what many critical voices in the party will watch out for in the 2011 elections
What would happen if all the big guys in the party contested, who would Besigye campaign with? Because this would literally mean each one largely concentrates on their campaigns,” says a party official who asked to remain unnamed

He said the top FDC western region hierarchy will contest for positions in next year’s elections and are determined to make their mark in the region
Last time it was Garuga Musinguzi who gave Mbabazi a run for his money
However Muntu will be active in mobilising for FDC in the west
When he was elected as the IPC presidential flag bearer Besigye promised to meet the nomination fees of every candidate and urged the cooperating parties not to leave any elective post uncontested
In the 2006 elections the NRM took over 100 constituencies in the country unopposed for lack of opposition candidates
This time round the FDC and IPC contend that they will field candidates right from LC1 level to the top most elective office
That is when the queen mother called Kayihura and Kasango was arrested
“The CID was very professional and asked him to present documents and a statement from the complainant,” Kasango said
After being approached by many responsible persons and clients who were concerned that William Byaruhanga was talking excessively ill of him and promising to send him to jail over the case, he decided to ask the queen mother about it.
Kasango said: “The Queen mother told me the lawyers had said to her, “we have given you bwino (a local slang for documentary evidence), now you should squeeze him
The Independent has also learnt that Byaruhanga has offered to discuss the matter with Kasango and offer an apology if it is true Kasango paid the queen mother
When The Independent put this accusation to Kasango, he expressed surprise.
In the interview with The Independent, Kasango insisted that he owed the queen mother no money at all but instead she owed him monies he had advanced to her prior to the payments by the government
The Independent has confirmed with authenticated bank documents that Kasango paid Kemigisa monies which together with the agreed legal fees amount to Shs 4.3 billion
What does this mean for constitutionalism and democracy in Uganda?
The Constitutional Court is the court of first instance for all matters concerning interpretations of the constitution.
Jjuuko’s petition is just one of many petitions filed in the court to challenge the integrity of judicial decisions and legislation which contradict Uganda’s Constitution
Jjuuko is not only fighting for Ugandans’ constitutional rights, but also the practicality of Uganda’s legislative and, by default, democratic process
The report also shows that despite an increase in the number of cases disposed Is the Judiciary delivering or delaying justice?
The Chief justice Joseph Odoki, marking his remarks during the New Law year function at High Court in 2008.
When the Independent asked FDC if they would resort to the courts to deal with likely grievances against the upcoming elections, FDC spokesman Wafula Oguttu said they would not.
He notes the FDC has tried many times to use the Constitutional Court to hear grievances over the outcomes and handling of elections but to no avail.
He referred to the petition FDC filed in the Supreme Court disputing the results of the 2006 election
Currently, the FDC continues to fight in the Constitutional Court to have the ‘substantial’ clause removed out of the Presidential Elections Act to prevent similar situations of 2006
Prof. Onyango says solutions should include generating more autonomy between the financial and administrative elements of the judiciary, less interference from the government, and appointing new judges.
With all these issues, is the judiciary delivering justice?
Onyango notes: “The increase in the number of petitions filed proves that there is a growing confidence in the court.
Mukula Gladys is listed on the voter’s register for Central Ward polling station in Soroti Municipality as number 11515367 and 33398901
In the same Soroti Municipality Central Ward, voter number 34594429 is Esabu Steven, born on June 10, 1985
The EC says that the number of registered voters rose from 10.5 million voters in 2006 to 14.5 million following a registration process that ended in June this year
How then could the number of voters surged by 6.1 million in a period of over five years?
Following the proposed Public Order Management Bill 2009 which the police are about to present to cabinet, the plight of Mugumya and others might become more complicated than before
The Bill seeks that any public gathering comprising three or more people must get clearance from the Inspector General of Police (IGP) or any other officer representing the IGP
In July, members of the National Alliance for Free and Fair Elections (NAFFE), an opposition activist group, were violently dispersed when they attempted a demonstration demanding resignation of the Electoral Commission team, which they accuse of being partisan in favour of President Museveni, the appointing authority
Public rallies of the Democratic Party too have been forcibly dispersed by the police in the city suburbs and various parts in the central region such as Mukono and Masaka districts
I therefore find the powers given to the Inspector General of Police to prohibit the convening of an assembly or a procession an unjustified limitation to the enjoyment of a fundamental right
“In Uganda the problem is that the ruling party and the police look at the opposition political demonstrators as disturbers instead of stakeholders in the affairs of the state
They think it is wrong for me to express my views through a demonstration that Mulago Hospital needs cancer drugs but it is right for a religious leader to demonstrate with the cross, because his demonstration does not question what the government is doing for the taxpayers,” says Mugumya
Livingstone Sewanyana, executive director of Foundation for Human Rights Initiative (FHRI), said the Bill poses serious challenges to Ugandans in enjoying their fundamental freedoms and human rights guaranteed by the 1995 Constitution
About 30 people died in the riots and the kingdom’s radio, CBS, has since been switched off air for allegedly inciting the riots.
Kizza Besigye and other opposition politicians oppose the proposed Public Order Bill.
Observers speculate that the Bill could be targeting to control Kabaka’s gatherings which usually carry political overtones whenever he tours the kingdom
He cited the closure of CBS, denying him access to some territories under his kingdom, arrest of his ministers in 2007 and dividing Buganda into chiefdoms
The Kabaka’s remarks were interpreted to be a reference to September riots when he was blocked from going to Kayunga, a district in his kingdom
He said Buganda will not waver on demanding what rightly belongs to it
Secondly, Buganda has been divided, and many of its properties haven’t been returned
Thirdly, it is very disappointing that there are places in Buganda where it is said the Kabaka of Buganda must seek permission before visiting his people there,” the Kabaka said in his speech
The government also says the Bill is to ensure public safety from constant terror threats following the July 11 bombings in Kampala
The Bill gives the IGP and the Minister of Internal Affairs wide discretionary and unjustifiable powers over the management of public meetings
”Amnesty International has decried the Bill as a move to stifle freedom of association and assembly in Uganda
On my way back to Kampala, I sat next to a man leaving the camp
She has to spend at least Shs 1.4 million a month for a dose of drugs when the subsidized drugs are not available at Mulago, which is almost always
He was responding to reports that ran in the Daily Monitor on Aug 15 that said 250 cancer patients had died for lack of cancer drugs at the cancer institute
“They look at your diagnostic and prescription slip and when they realize that you are from the cancer institute they just send you back without the drug,” says Nampera of the Mulago pharmacy
However, while Nampera and other patients at the cancer institute constantly complain about the cancer institute’s drug stock outs, the problem lies primarily with NMS, the body responsible for delivering the drugs
According to NMS public relations officer Hamis Kaheru, the drug stock outs occur because cancer medicines are not easy to acquire because the supplier starts the manufacturing process only after the customer has ordered them
This statement, however, was contradicted by the owner of Ngapi pharmacy, which provides wholesale services to retail pharmacies in Wandegeya
He explained that as a private individual, he has to send his orders of drugs to the National Drug Authority (NDA), which makes sure he is bringing legal drugs into the country
Cancer drugs still missing Despite government’s claims, patients still need to purchase their own medications.
Before the July 11 twin terror attacks in Kampala, intelligence had been tracking and arresting ADF operatives in various parts of the country

After school, he learnt carpentry in Iganga town council in 1982-1995 at Byekwaso Furniture Mart on Plot 02, Old Kaliro Road.
That while in Prison, he was indoctrinated by ADF activists in ‘b’ above and soon became one of their chief cadres.
Among other tasks, he was assigned by Jamil Mukulu to distribute tapes laden with jihad ideology and he got 42 tapes from Kampala but due to security clampdown on him, he was not able to distribute them but passed them on to one Hatwib Jowali to distribute as he went on flight to the Buvuma Islands

Elections for FDC flag bearer for Mbale district Woman parliamentary seat were scheduled for Sept 27, but were postponed until Sept 30 because grassroots structures to constitute electoral colleges in some of the places were not yet in place
However, in these districts, unlike in Mbale, winners have been announced and the petitioners are seeking a repeat of the primary elections
Sources in Mbale told The Independent that the elections between Wokuri and Nagudi were marred with massive irregularities like vote buying and falsifying of results, bribery etc
Sources in Mbale alleged that Nagudi’s group bribed Wokuri’s polling agents between Shs5000 and Shs10,000 per person
According to the documents seen by The Independent Maguru was duly nominated by the NRM electoral commission, but it did not present his name to the delegates conference for election

In its response to the UN draft report, Uganda’s Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa penned an indignant letter to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sept 24
The draft report, says Kutesa, “is a compendium of rumors deeply flawed in methodology, sourcing and standards of proof…Its authors heavily relied on information supposedly provided by unspecified NGOs and individuals whose motives are suspect
In his final point, Kutesa argues, that the report is “silent” on the activities of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU) and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)
In North Kivu, the Ugandan rebels of the ADF/NALU attacked and looted several villages in Beni territory, abducting children, young girls and women whom they used as slaves, including sex slaves.

Mabikke, who had been in the same DP faction as Sebaggala says the Mayor joined the NRM almost immediately he started his second term at City Hall
Mabikke says Sebaggala’s defection is confirmed by Museveni’s attendance of his Political king or villain?
Sebaggala told The Independent that it was hard for him to return to DP because of the endless squabbles in the party

Museveni has nothing to offer to people except to take away their independence and hope
The number of civil organisations that have come together under the Citizens Coalition for Electoral Democracy in Uganda to monitor the 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections is five hundrend.
Just as President Museveni flew in his presidential jet to the UN summit in New York about a week ago, the media was awash with stories that jiggers had attacked families and caused deaths in villages in Busoga
The FDC headquarters suspended the declaration of the final results until a thorough investigation was carried out.
Similar incidents have happened in Arua, Zombo, Maracha, Ngora and Kitgum districts over the women parliamentary seats
For example the initial information indicated that the electoral colleges in Arua were 78 yet the tallied results represented 89 electoral colleges
The FDC has received petitions from the losers in these districts

He is seeking court to stop Museveni’s nomination which he says was illegal
Maguru further contends that he had been He is also challenging the legitimacy of the NRM national conference at which Museveni was elected was not valid because many of the delegates had not been elected yet
He wants court to stop Museveni’s nomination as presidential candidate for 2011 until his petition has been heard and concluded
He argues that if Museveni is nominated before the disposal of his petition, it will defeat the purpose of his going to court
If the court allows the petition, it means that Museveni’s candidature, the NRM national conference and its activities at Namboole will be null and void
The NRM will have to convene another national conference and conduct fresh elections for the presidential candidate
As a way of facilitating the smooth running of the exercise the Ministry of Education and Sports has offered to help schools partnering with government to implement the programme
According to the circular signed by the ministry’s permanent secretary, Francis Lubanga, each school will receive the same number of specimens regardless of the number of candidates it has registered for the exams
This is the second time government is paying for the current S.4 students benefiting from the USE programme
The selection of model farmers will be done at the parish and subcounty level from where the names will be seconded to the districts,” Museveni said
He said conflicts and lack of communication about the programme and its implementation were some of the reasons NAADS had failed to reach all the intended beneficiaries
Museveni is angry that Heritage refused to contribute just 30 percent of its earnings to the nation's underdeveloped economy, despite a 966 percent profit on the sale
Some industry insiders believe that the Irish company will have to pay the outstanding taxes on behalf of former partner Heritage if it wants to continue operating in Uganda
"Tullow is stretching Museveni's patience and soon he will kick them out," said another source close to the transaction
Italian giant Eni, whose deal to buy Heritage`s assets was all but signed when Tullow preempted it, remains keen to participate in the oil industry in Uganda, according to an industry insider
The Independent has learned that the company has written letters to companies including CNOOC, Total and Eni threatening to sue them if they show any interest in the Ugandan fields
Instead, only US$128 million was paid to Uganda and the outstanding amount of $281 million deposited in a London escrow account.
President Museveni's hopes for first oil before the election may have failed along with an early production scheme, but a fat tax cheque would demonstrate to Ugandans that the government will not let all the profits of oil be leached out of the country by foreigners
Other senior members of government have also said publicly that Uganda is looking to Tullow to help collect tax from Heritage
The company made a mistake in buying from Heritage while the tax issue remained unresolved, according Tullow has operations across three exploration blocks in southwestern Uganda
Museveni’s hopes for first oil before the election may have failed along with an early production scheme, but a fat tax cheque would demonstrate to Ugandans that the government will not let all the profits of oil be leached out of the country by foreigners to D'Ujanga
If forced to pay the Uganda government on Heritage's behalf, Tullow may be able to recover the money
That would allow for the release of the money in the London escrow account to pay the Ugandan government
If the cost of getting Kingfisher back is the outstanding taxes, it is well worth it for Tullow to pay; Heritage's outstanding taxes amount to US$281 million, while the company expects production in Uganda to amount to 200,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak
Dickens Kamugisha, of the African Institute for Energy Governance, says he believes that Museveni's frustration with the Irish company dates back even further than that
The government has consistently refused Heritage`s offers of arbitration in London, maintaining that outsiders should not be making decisions about a Ugandan national resource
Uganda`s Solicitor General has advised the government not to go to arbitration, suggesting he fears the government does not have a good case
Perhaps his analysis of the PSAs has revealed another factor that weakens Uganda’s argument
As the wrangle gets bigger, drawing in Tullow and later maybe, oil majors from around the world, the one thing that is clear is that many people consider the reserves in Uganda worth fighting over
In trying to quell the MayiMayi, the UPDF, says the report, “instituted a reign of terror for several years with complete impunity
” The report alleges that the UPDF, “introduced a particularly cruel form of detention, putting the detainees in holes dug two or three metres deep into the ground, where they were forced to live exposed to bad weather, with no sanitation and on muddy ground
Over and again, the UPDF is accused of potential war crimes not solely during the Second Congo War, but during the First Congo War between July 1996 and July 1998, and the transition period of January 2001 to June 2003
He writes that the report accuses the UPDF of crimes in areas where it had not even been deployed
Although UPDF crimes are far more pronounced in the report, the report is hardly “silent” on these other guilty groups
Yet if individuals such as Minister Kutesa, outright deny and discredit the report, how can we expect other leaders to exercise the discipline and energy to react to it?
Thousands of Hema children allegedly recruited by the UPC underwent military training in the Mandro, Katoto and Bule camps
They probably did not have to meet UJA, after all many journalists believe it does not exist anymore
