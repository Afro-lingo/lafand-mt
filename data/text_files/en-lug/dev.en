They were arrested while on duty in one of the Islands on Lake Victoria.
They were sent to Makindye Military barracks and jailed for four years without any substantial reason.
They single out the brutal hacking of the late Abbas Kagimu where until to date no culprit had been brought to book, and his family is suffering.
Sheikh Haidari Sserwanga Bukenya and Maneno Majaliwa were granted amnesty.
They are still being held in Luzira prison even after being cleared by the General Court Martial.
Their fate now is impending clearance by Chieftaincy of Military intelligence agency which has up to now failed to act.
They also talk about the unlawful arrest of Lukwebe's wife and other female suspects because of their husbands' involvement in ADF rebel activities.
On 3rd February 2004, they had an audience with His Excellency the President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.
The former Uganda People's Defense Force Chief of Staff Joshua Masaba discussed the ADF reporters' grievances with the president.
The President, through the former Minister of State for Security Betty Akech directed for the release of Majaliwa and Sheik Haidari Sserwanga Bukenya.
They worked as a team by conducting mass mobilisation to convince other Allied Democratic Forces combatants to renounce the rebellion.
That the Allied Democratic Forces Reporters representing office should have an audience with the Chieftaincy leadership.
They have issues with the former Uganda National Rescue Font ll of Ali Bamuze and Uganda National Freedom Army of Muhammed Kiggundu.
They appealed to the government to recognise them and the current leadership of Allied Democratic Forces reporters.
Build confidence and relationship between government and Allied Democratic Forces reporters in the country.
They assist the government in its bid for peace negotiations with ADF combatants still in the bush, ending war and fighting terrorism.
That warn that eighty per cent of Allied Democratic Forces returnees are still in their youthful age.
The Uganda National Rescue Front II returnees are older and above 50 years.
The Allied Democratic Forces returnees are still young, swift and vigilant to be employed for more hardships.
They call upon the government to desist from mistreating them and should be dully considered like other returnees and UPDF soldiers.
The Allied Democratic Forces include combatants in the Democratic Republic of Congo, returnees who got amnesty and Muslim youths.
Dealing with this group requires a lot of experience, that's why there has been continued recruitment into ADF to date, especially in the Eastern region.
Most of these Muslim youths, though not much educated are aware of the new Islamic resurrection in the world.
The Muslim youths are also aware of the American invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and the events taking place in Somalia.
The former Container Village meant for Allied Democratic Force mobilisation office to be re-established and reinstated.
It will be done as was the case during the late Twatera's time, to enable them to perform normal operations.
The Independent issue of July 2010, says that the office which mainly comprised of Allied Democratic Forces reporters was strategically put in place.
There is an office coordinating up the dealings and conduct of Allied Democratic Force reporters to Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence.
There is a reception centre meant to receive Allied Democratic Force members who have renounced rebellion.
The office also does counselling, recovering arms and reuniting ADF members with their family members, and assisting them in getting amnesty.
They monitor activities of former Allied Democratic Force, Salaf and Tablique Muslims in eighteen districts in Uganda.
Doing intelligence networking, tracking and surveillance missions on Allied Democratic Fund plan and activities.
Countrywide mass mobilisation, sensitisation programmes for the Presidential campaigns and other elections.
The ADF reporters should be considered for enrolment into Uganda People's Defense Force with their respective ranks while in the bush maintained.
The financial assistance and resettlement package for Allied Democratic Force reporters is clearly stipulated in the Amnesty Act of 2000.
They seek approval from the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence and government to help them form an Organisation for Amnesty beneficiaries.
Once they become registered and legally recognised they can lobby and solicit funds from Non-Government Organizations, and donor agencies.
They still remain a peaceful community that has worked with the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence despite several shortcomings.
Grievances and displeasure were exhibited by the former Allied Democratic Force reporters and were spearheaded by a few individuals.
Some of the Allied Democratic Force reporters stubbornly refused to enrol and train to become Uganda People's Defense Force soldiers.
This has made it difficult for some of them to easily access Uganda People's Defense Force salary loans, promotions, and gratuity.
A substantial number of the willing and disciplined former Allied Democratic Force reporters were trained and integrated into UPDF.
Munyoro, Yahaya Sendi, Sadat Kinobe, Kakaire Badru, Mucunguzi Tadeo, Tumwiine Kamada, and Nakawooya Amina were recruited in UPDF.
The office at Kitante for carrying out Joint Anti-Terrorist Task Force of Uganda operations was turned into Department of Operations at headquarters.
The current Ghanaian Electoral Commission members have presided over elections for sometime now.
The interparty Advisory Committee oversees the activities of Ghana's Electoral Commission.

Recently the InterParty Organisation of Dialogue member party secretary generals visited Malawi.
They visited Malawi to study how its Electoral Commission has organised agreeable elections.
Mathias Nsubuga was the chairman InterParty Organisation for Dialogue.
The Malawi experience is the best solution Uganda should adopt to end its election related conflicts according to Mathias Nsubuga.
Basing on Malawi's procedure of constituting the Electoral Commission, Nsubuga believes Uganda can get an all inclusive Electoral Commission.
He said parties would organise a meeting of InterParty Organisation for Dialogue's highest body.
The reason for calling for independent bodies to appoint the Electoral Commission is to ensure the commissioners' loyalty to the country.
The Electoral Commission ensures that the commissioners' loyalty is not to the president, but to the country.
Fewer African presidents are willing to give up the power to appoint electoral commissioners.
People in the electoral commission are increasingly becoming Africa's kingmakers.
President Museveni said the current Electoral Commission team was vetted by parliament.
President Museveni had a meeting with the United States deputy secretariat of state Johnny Carson last month.
Daudi Migereko,the government's chief whip said Ugandans are ready and are used to holding regular elections.
He cannot afford to postpone the February two thousand eleven elections.
The Uganda constitution empowers the president to appoint the Electoral Commision.
Allowing opposition parties' proposal to have the Judicial Service Commission appoint the Electoral Commission requires constitutional amendment.
Uganda has held five elections since it attained independence in one thousand nine hundred sixty two.
Uganda has held five elections since it attained independence in one thousand nine hundred sixty two.
The first post independence elections to be organised were by the Military Commission headed by Paulo Muwanga.
Yoweri Museveni was the Minister of Defence in December one thousand nine hundred eighty.
Vincent Sekkono was the secretary to the Electoral Commission chaired by Kikira, a former district commissioner.
Kikira was allegedly a Uganda People's Congress card holder and die hard.
The commissioners were appointed with the approval of the Military Commission, making its members part of the electoral process.
The election outcome surprisingly was disputed by Museveni who was a member of the Military Commission.
The one thousand nine hundred eighty one National Resistance Army freedom fighters war brought Museveni in power.
Museveni came into power in one thousand eighty six.
The next three elections to be held in Uganda were under the one party Movement system of governance.
The next three elections in one thousand nine hundred ninety four were for constituent Assembly and for presidency.
One thousand nine hundred ninety four elections were organised to elect members to draft the one thousand nine hundred ninety five constitution.

Like in the two thousand one ruling, the Supreme Court upheld, a four to three majority ruling.
I would not be surprised if a pathologist is appointed to carry out a postmortem on the two thousand sixteen elections.
Dr. Frank Nabwiso was the interparty cooperation secretariat.

The Ugandan football industry depends almost entirely on donations.
Sports Club Villa was docked nine points for failing to turn up for two league games.
Sports Club Villa is Uganda's most successful football club of all time.
The club had not paid players' allowances for six months, prompting a sit down strike.
Coach Sula Kato was forced on one occasion to play seven men instead of eleven for failure to raise the numbers.
Villa's most successful period in the mid one thousand nine hundred nineties was occasioned by the late Patrick Kawooya's bottomless pockets.
The now relegated Arua football club failed to turn up for three games in the last season.
Federation of Uganda Football Association, Chief Executive Officer Edgar Watson argues that football has gone beyond just a game.
Moses Magogo is the secretary to the Uganda Super League Committee.

Tororo District failed to hold its National Resistance Movement district elections on August second.
President Yoweri Museveni wrote a letter on August sixteenth which observers say might haunt him after the two thousand eleven elections.
The National Resistance Movement Secretary-General was Amama Mbabazi.
Tororo municipality and West Budama were authorised to have separate National Resistance Movement teams.
Museveni's letter did not address the core issues as explained by the Tororo District Woman Member of Parliament, Grace Obura.
Obura said she did not contest because she wanted to give a chance to others.
Obura wanted to appease the animosity between the Iteso and Jopadhola over alleged inequality.
Tororo Municipality delegates wanted to keep the position of National Resistance Movement district chairperson.
Violence erupted from delegates of West Budama.
The incumbent was from Tororo Municipality and the position was expected to rotate to West Budama.
At the centre of the chaos was West Budama South Member of Parliament, Emmanuel Otala.
Emmanuel Otala, the junior minister for labour had a list of people he wanted to get posts.
The problem was about individuals and not communities as addressed by Museveni.
Not surprisingly, four days after Museveni's letter of August.
Otala was involved in yet another fight.
This time it was in his West Budama constituency.
Otala was detained by police after he beat up a journalist who recorded him allegedly bribing voters.
Otala fired several bullets during the fight.
The Jopadhola are mainly in West Budama and the Iteso in Tororo Municipality.
President Museveni miscalculated, he thought segregating them, as in his August sixteen letter suggests, would solve the problem.
Similar dishonesty has failed to crush the violence in Butaleja district.
The move appears to be a continuation of Museveni's "ring fencing" strategy of political positions based on tribes.
His July fifteenth two thousand nine letter was at the height of the Banyoro versus Bakiga or Bafuruki saga.
While touring the district in June, Museveni announced that he had approved the splitting of Bunyole County into two constituencies.
Dorothy Hyuha is the District Woman Member of Parliament, National Resistance Movement Deputy Secretary General and Minister without Portfolio.
Despite being separated, Hyuha and Dombo are supporting candidates against each other and inciting violence.
Dombo is supporting Celinah Nabandah against Hyuha for the District Woman Member of Parliament slot.
Hyuha supported Imran Muluga against Dombo during the election.
On August second, Butaleja witnessed the most violent election in the district's history.
Police fired in the air after a group of people attacked the district chairman, Richard Waya.
Dombo accused his opponent, Imran Muluga of conniving with Waya and Hyuha, to rig the elections.
Muluga allegedly hid over three hundred voters at his school.
Tororo Progressive Academy prevented other National Resistance Movement candidates from talking to them.
The National Resistance Movements' internal elections and primaries point at trouble over the two thousand eleven elections.
According to National Resistance Movement Electoral Commissioner, Lydia Wanyoto, the district elections drew over five hundred petitions.
The National Resistance Movement district elections drew over five hundred petitions amidst scenes of unprecedented rigging and violence.
In Sembabule district, the elections were scuttled in the gunfire of bullets that left two injured.
Area Members of Parliament Ssekikubo, Anifa Kawooya and Kutesa hurled before the party disciplinary committee.
The National Resistance Movement Chief Whip is Daudi Migereko.
He admitted that there could be big problems if the violence seen during the National Resistance Movement internal elections is not addressed.
Migereko said that the failure to handle violence would bring many problems to the country.
According to reports, Migereko practically begged the district National Resistance Movement chairman in Jinja to put him on the district executive.
Migereko said they were struggling to serve.
Ofwono Opondo is the National Resistance Movement's Deputy Spokesman.
Ofwono Opondo says that the candidates in predominantly National Resistance Movement areas look at winning the primaries as a must.
Rubanda West Member of Parliament is Henry Banyenzaki.
Professor Elijah Mushemeza was an aspirant for the National Resistance Movement Secretary General's job.
Professor Elijah Mushemeza sees the violence in the National Resistance Movement elections as due to greed.
He wrote an article in the Daily Monitor of August eleventh.
Journalist Charles Onyango Obbo wrote in Daily Monitor of August eleventh.
National Resistance Movement has become a meal ticket.
The general election of February eleventh, two thousand eleven is happening in National Resistance Movement today.
Onyango Obbo said that If you win a position in the party, you are assured of winning the election.
Onyango Obbo said that winning the election leads your allies to victory too.
National Resistance Movement member, Ikuya Magode says the violence shows the party has deviated from the principles of good governance.
Their closeness to President Museveni is prone to violence.
This was the case in Wakiso district where Vice President Bukenya allegedly hid the voters from his challenger.
National Resistance Movement Deputy Secretary-General Hyuha is largely unpopular but is determined to win using the party machinery.
In other areas such as Tororo, Buliisa, and Buganda, the fault lines could be a result of multi-ethnic composition.
Sembabule appears to combine all these elements.
Lwemiyaga Member of Parliament Ssekikubo and his supporters routinely clash with supporters of minister Kutesa.
Lwemiyaga Member of Parliament Ssekikubo and his supporters routinely clash with supporters of woman Member of Parliament Kawooya.
All act with impunity because they are very close to President Museveni either by ethnicity or marriage and therefore seemingly untouchable.
The powerful Secretary to the Electoral Commission, Sam Rwakoojo is also from Lwemiyaga.
Although located in Buganda, Sembabule has a strong migrant community, mainly of Banyankole and Banyarwanda.
Before two thousand six elections, Museveni rushed to Sembabule to stop the rift within the party that involved the same people.
At that time, Museveni wanted Joy Kabatsi to step down for Kawooya on the District Woman Member of Parliament seat.
As usual, Kawooya was backed by Kutesa, while Kabatsi had the powerful Herman Ssentongo and Sekikubo.
Museveni failed to reconcile them.
Elections in Uganda have frequently been mired in violence, manipulation, murder, bribery, threats, intimidation and vote-rigging.
The failure by National Resistance Movement to hold peaceful internal elections is seen as a sign of violence in two thousand eleven.
Ofwono Opondo claimed it was in only four of the one hundred seventeen National Resistance Movement districts where the elections were held.
He mentions Sembabule, Bulisa, Tingey in Kapchorwa, West Budama, and Tororo.
Many fear to imagine that the violence in National Resistance Movement will dispute out against the opposition.
In past elections, government authorities who are National Resistance Movement members, have unleashed terror on the opposition.
On February fifteenth, two thousand six Lieutenant. Ramadhan Magara shot at a crowd of then-presidential candidate Kizza Besigye's supporters.
Kizza Besigye's supporters were gathered at the Buganda kingdom palace at Bulange, Mengo when Lieutenant Ramadhan Magara shot at them.
In two thousand six, Lieutenant Colonel Dick Bugingo, head of military police, slapped Major.
Rubaramira Ruranga is the head of election management for the Forum for Democratic Change.
Bugingo was convicted of public assault but retained his position as commander of military police although he was later retired.
Fox Odoi was Museveni's former senior legal assistant.
Fox Odoi pointed a gun at Forum for Democratic Change supporters in Tororo on voting day in two thousand six.
Despite having photographs of Odoi pointing a gun at three men lying on the ground, police claimed a lack of sufficient evidence.
In two thousand six, Ali Kirunda Kivejinja of the National Resistance Movement was found to have used intimidation, violence and torture.
Ali Kirunda Kivejinja used intimidation, violence and torture against supporters of his Forum for Democratic Change rival Abdu Katuntu.
He was kicked out of parliament for election rigging but Museveni appointed him third Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs.
In two thousand one, Security minister Amama Mbabazi's agents shot a supporter of his challenger in Kinkizi West, James Garuga Musinguzi.
Early warnings about violence in the two thousand eleven elections have been extensive.
Kizza Besigye was the leader of Uganda's main opposition party, Forum for Democratic Change.
The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Moreno Ocampo, warned that his court would pursue perpetrators of any election violence.
He said the court learnt from the deadly post-election violence in Kenya at the end of two thousand seven.
Beginning of two thousand eight and in Zimbabwe, the court drew a lesson from the post-election violence in Kenya.
The result of the presidential election in Kenya in December two thousand seven triggered tribal clashes leaving at least a thousand dead.
In Zimbabwe, violence erupted after opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat incumbent Robert Mugabe in the presidential election by six per cent.
Morgan Tsvangirai failed to secure an overall majority.
Tsvangirai pulled out of a second-round runoff, complaining of violence against his party's supporters, effectively handing outright victory to Mugabe.
There are emerging indications that the case in Kenya in two thousand seven violence might follow the election.
Part of the problem is that any outcome of the two thousand eleven Presidential Election will not be unanimously accepted.
The Electoral Commission is discredited by alleged partiality in favour of the appointing authority, President Museveni.
Women for Peace and National Alliance for Free and Fair Elections was formed to fight for the Electoral Commission to be reconstituted.
Although Museveni raised similar concerns about the partiality of the electoral commission in one thousand nine hundred eighty.
The Commission of Inquiry into Post Election Violence report in Kenya concluded that the post-election violence was a spontaneous violent reaction.
Uganda was still a British colony and proudly so.
It was a Christian country, designed to be run by western-educated men and women.
At independence in one thousand nine hundred sixty-two, Binaisa was one of a few Baganda elite of the period.
The Baganda put their Ganda identity, sentimental attachment and loyalty to the kingdom above their loyalty to Uganda, the country.
The prominent first Buganda public figures were Paulo Muwanga, Emmanuel Lumu, Benedicto Kiwanuka, Jaberi Bidandi Ssali, and Kintu Musoke.
Many of the non-monarchical Baganda had typically studied in secondary schools or worked in districts outside Buganda.
Many Baganda often were married to non-Baganda, they usually studied in Kenya, India, Tanzania or Britain.
Binaisa attended King's College Budo, a secondary school that during colonial times was the training ground for many of Uganda's future leaders.
Binaisa qualified as a lawyer in Britain in one thousand nine hundred fifty-five.
He returned to Uganda in the year one thousand nine hundred fifty-six and plunged into the nationalist politics of the period.
He became Secretary-General of the newly formed Uganda National Congress.
He became attorney general during first Uganda's People's Congress government of the one thousand nine hundred sixties.
Binaisa and two others over one night drafted a new constitution in the year one thousand nine hundred sixty-six.
That constitution paved way for the transformation of Uganda into a republic and eventually the abolition of the historical, traditional kingdoms.
This was the constitution that made Prime Minister Milton Obote the president and gave him what many viewed as dictatorial powers.
Binaisa fled into exile during the regime of Idi Amin Dada who was president from 1971 to 1979.
This period of waiting and hoping that the military government of President Idi Amin would be overthrown in a coup yielded nothing.
Finally, after clashes along the Uganda-Tanzania border in late one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight, Tanzania invaded Uganda.
In March, the Tanzanian government organised a conference in the town of Moshi that brought together over twenty groups of exiled Ugandans.
Moshi Unity Conference soon revealed something disturbing.
The extent of disunity, fighting, interest and power play among Uganda's political, intellectual and military elite.
The conference formed the Uganda National Liberation Front and elected Yusufu Lule, a former Principal of Makerere University College.
It was becoming apparent that the Amin government was about to collapse before the advancing Tanzanian army and armed Ugandan forces.
When President Lule was voted out of office in June one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine, Binaisa was installed.
President Lule was in office for only sixty-eight days.
Binaisa rose to the presidency at a time of much national uncertainty.
He was a man the general public knew in one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine.
Alarm spread through Uganda when Binaisa was named President.
Lule had been from the old intellectual and social tradition that viewed Uganda as a conservative Christian nation.
Uganda was mapped after British tradition.
Binaisa was part of that tradition but he also had the same radical socialist and pan-African outlook that Obote had.
Many Baganda did not support Obote's aligning Uganda with what they regarded as the Communist, atheist Soviet bloc countries.
Once Binaisa became president, he was occupying State House in preparation for the return of Obote.
Binaisa did not have real powers.
Like Lule, Binaisa proved to be an interim president.
He might have been the first East African head of state to occupy the office in preparation for another.
Many political analysts, politicians and the news media concluded that their worst nightmare was about to come to pass.
Obote was being prepared for a second term as president.
It could be argued with hindsight now that the instalment of Binaisa as president was the start of the civil war.
The civil war would follow the one thousand nine hundred eighty general elections.
Obote was hated by most Baganda and resented by many non-Uganda People's Congress politicians.
Obote had become the most divisive figure in Uganda's post-independence history, more divisive even than Amin.
Binaisa must have known this.
Powerful former freedom fighters like David Oyite Ojok, Yoweri, former Ugandan president Godfrey Binaisa and his wife Tomoko Yamamoto.
August thirteenth to nineteenth two thousand ten, Museveni had hope of gaining and protecting power.
Museveni's only hope of gaining and protecting power would be to appeal to the influence of Tanzania's President Julius Nyerere.
Being from the fore mentioned generation of nationalistic minded Baganda, Binaisa sought to forge a sense of national unity and goodwill.
He relied on goodwill and hoped for goodwill to prevail in the chaotic wake of the end of the Amin regime.
Binaisa felt that the only healing Uganda could hope for was holding elections on September one thousand nine hundred eighty.
September one thousand nine hundred eighty elections were held under common front in which all shades of political opinion could be represented.
The Moshi conference had been dominated by arguments among politicians, these same politicians rejected the idea of parties under one umbrella.
The umbrella idea was a pioneer in Ugandan politics of the idea of cooperation across party lines.
A forerunner to the post in 1986 in Uganda and the Inter-Party Cooperation today.
He attempted to reshuffle his cabinet in May one thousand nine hundred eighty.
Yoweri Museveni Minister of Defence and Vice Chairman of Military Commission of Uganda National Liberation Front appointed Army Chief of Staff.
David Oyite Ojok as ambassador to Algeria resulted in his removal from office.
Many Ugandan politicians and opposition figures have discovered over the past thirty years that in Uganda the military has the final word.
He was to discover as Lule, that Uganda remains a state where the military has the final word.
Even after the fall of Amin's regime, a wave of violent robberies, murders of prominent Ugandans and shooting at night suddenly erupted.
It must have shocked and puzzled many of the idealistic educated Ugandans when shooting at night suddenly erupted.
Since one thousand nine hundred seventy-one, the darkest and most barbaric deeds in the country's history had been perpetrated by Amin.
The first reaction to the post Amin violence was that these were remnants of Amin's army and State Research Bureau.
To this day, the two year period in Ugandan history remains a closed chapter.
The murders of prominent Ugandans in one thousand nine hundred seventy nine were intended to portray Binaisa as incapable of managing security.
Gunpoint of prominent Ugandans was to portray Binaisa as too weak to contain the deteriorating security believed some analysts and historians.
Others claimed that these acts of violence were by the Uganda Peoples' Congress or parts of the army loyal to Obote.
The acts of violence were to emphasize the point that without Obote, Uganda could not hope to stabilize.
A bulky, simple man, Binaisa had an alert mind, was intelligent, humorous and very much the British educated African.
Binaisa is quoted as having expressed distaste for Idi Amin partly because Amin spoke broken English.
Binaisa, in the remarks about Amin, betrayed the mentality of the earlier Ugandan elite, influenced and mesmerized by British culture.
Binaisa was of that era.
Amin once said the reason so many intellectuals in Uganda were so bitterly opposed to him was that he was a Muslim.
He would have added key details to our understanding of Uganda's chaotic history.
Having returned to Uganda in two thousand one, he had been reduced to a figure of fun in the eyes of Ugandans.
He married a Japanese woman, Tomoko Yamamoto, as one of many coupled wedded via satellite link-up by the Unification Church.
He delivered a speech at the one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine Non Aligned Movement summit in Havana.
News magazine photos at the time published photographs of journalists asleep in a heap as the Ugandan president spoke.
In that speech, he praised the restoration of peace and the rule of law to Uganda by the Tanzanian army.
He stated that Tanzanian soldiers were now even dating or marrying Ugandan girls, much to the amusement of the assembled delegates.
Had he not been appointed president, he would have remained unclear in the pages of Ugandan history.
He was one of many well educated, internationally connected Ugandan intellectuals of no particular distinction.
An elderly man pays final respects to the late Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa at Parliament on August tenth.
The casket bearing the body of the late Godfrey Lukongwa Binaisa was carried out of Parliament on August tenth.
The presidency of Godfrey Lukwongwa Binaisa has been the subject of much controversy.
In Uganda since independence, Professor Mutibwa characterises the Binaisa presidency as one of "confusion, destruction and corruption.
The role Binaisa played in evading the one thousand nine hundred sixty-two constitution remains controversial.
Fred Guwedeko in his serialised biographical account portrays Binaisa as opportunistic in his political views.
His fellow lawyer Peter Mulira wondered whether he was committed to his legal profession.
Binaisa is no longer around to defend himself.
It is important for Ugandans to appreciate the circumstances at the time he inherited the highest office in the land.
It is important for Ugandans to appreciate the context of the environment they operated under.
In one thousand nine hundred seventy-nine, Uganda's economy was in ruins; the country was under an increasingly unpopular occupational force.
Coupled with all this, there were multiple conflicting parties fighting to fill the political vacuum left by strongman Idi Amin.
It is also in charge of the small parts of the capital Mogadishu under the Transitional Government.
This can bring peace not only to Somalia but to the whole region.
Mubatsi Asinja Habati said, "If we can't defeat Al-Shabaab we leave their country", because politics is a game of numbers.
A combination of the two seemingly unrealistic figures by the NRM and the Electoral Commission has complicated the puzzle.
On Sunday,11th July 2010, bomb blasts at Ethiopian Village Restaurant and Kyadondo Rugby Club, claimed loss of lives and injuries by people.
They can also inform any LC official at the nearest police post and any security officer in the vicinity.
Places of entertainment, social gatherings, bars, hotels, , taxi, bus parks, churches, educational institutions, hospitals, restaurants, markets.
It can then spend that income at source and submit accountability to the Ministry of Finance.
The EC Deputy Chairman Joseph Biribonwa said they needed more money than they budgeted to have voter registers given to political parties.
One of the parties in the forthcoming elections; the UPM, has called for re-election after the December 10 poll to guarantee peace.
Of the Movement's Executive Committee Bidandi contended the elections were being held in conditions that have rendered them unfair and free.
He uni-laterally chose an electoral commission which excluded names that had been suggested by DP and Uganda Patriotic Movement.
Apparently, it's because they did not apply themselves energetically in rigging elections in favor of Uganda People`s Congress.
The situation has therefore arisen whereby almost all Returning Officers are Uganda People`s Congress supporters.
I have never done any business or financial transactions with Kayumba.
Francis Gakwerera is among people arrested for the June 19 shooting of former Rwanda Defense Forces Chief of Staff in South Africa.
Unlike Karegyeya, Masetera rooted for the successful side.
That night, I had a long chat with Kayumba's driver.
I told him that he sounds like a professional assassin and he said he was a soldier in the National Resistance Army.

Museveni also lashed out at Mwenda personally, days later at Garang's funeral in Yei, South Sudan.
But that night on his programme Mwenda didn't stop but instead went further, responding with equal criticism to the president.
KFM was closed for a week, resulted in fifteen criminal charges against Mwenda, including sedition, criminal defamation, promoting sectarianism.

The East African countries need to work out a regional security arrangement for joint operations.
This is because since the Uganda Police Defence Force deployed in Somalia, its hardline militants have publicly sworn to create chaos in Uganda.
Therefore, our security agencies were well aware of what was likely to happen only that they did not know exactly how, when, where.

We need to be active participants in keeping our country safe both for ourselves and future generations.
Fortunately, as our five-car convoy snaked along, we had a police escort car with siren to cut through the mass of slow moving evening traffic.

We were hurrying to an interview with President Yoweri Museveni and that made us VIPs.
Usually, journalists would not travel 400km just to attend a press conference.
The attacks were at Kyadondo Rugby grounds and an Ethiopian Restaurant in Kampala.
On the morning after the attack, Museveni visited both places to view the carnage.
He also visited Mulago Hospital to sympathize with the injured being treated there and console the bereaved.
Why the President chose to have journalists ferried all the way from Kampala to tiny Ntungamo on the border with Rwanda, I will never know.
Journalists were put into several vans to head to Ntungamo.
The journey was supposed to start at 1pm but began at 4:30pm instead and lasted six hours.
After clearing the Masaka Mbarara, with its mounds of murram and dust we hit the Mbarara Ntungamo stretch.
We were running late and the event organizer, Uganda Media Centre boss Fred Opolot, kept leaning out of his dust-covered luxury Toyota Prado.
But the Coaster van carrying most journalists could not move any faster and Opolot soon sped off, probably to calm down the President.
The president's Ntungamo country home is on a murram road.
It was freezing cold when we arrived after 10pm and people fell over each other to grab a cup of hot tea.
Unlike, the Kampala crowd who, coming from a warmer place, wore no warm clothes, Museveni had on a checked black and white shirt .
"Two points," the president started as soon as the last journalists were ready.
Opolot allowed one question for each journalist, except Al Jazeera who had requested a short one on one interview.
When asked, Museveni said he was very angry about the bomb attacks which he blamed on the Somali radical Islamists group, AlShabaab. AlShabaab are angry that UPDF, under AU Mission in Somalia are propping up the regime, with Ethiopian support, outed them from power in 2006.
The African Union peace and United Nations Security Council took the decision to send peacekeepers to Somalia.
Uganda and Burundi are the only countries to send troops there although many promised.
Now AlShabaab wants to bomb them out of Somalia.
But Museveni said he would instead push to change the African Union Mission to Somalia mandate.
We were in Mogadishu doing our small bit of guarding the sea port, presidential palace and airport.
Museveni said withdrawing troops from Somalia is illogical because it would mean surrendering the African continent to terrorists.

The president blamed the July 11 terror attacks in Kampala on the AlShabaab militants.
The Inspector General of Police Kale Kayihura responds to questions from journalist during the press briefing with the President .

Watching him speak, I thought of the many people who oppose Museveni on Somalia.
Dr Kizza Besigye, the leader of Uganda's biggest opposition party, says Uganda has no business being in Somalia.
He says African countries like Nigeria and Malawi that promised troops have not sent them.
The Uganda Police Defence Force has been fighting all along, Ugandans are not told the truth that we are fighting on one side of civil war.
I concluded that Museveni is better off using the chance for hosting the African Union to convince African leaders to choose a better strategy.
One way would be to get more African Union states to send troops under African Union Mission to Somalia.
Merely relying on Inter Governmental Authority Development might mean Uganda will remain in Somalia alone.
Inter Governmental Authority Development comprises seven countries; Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and Eritrea.
Inter Governmental Authority Development wants the troops increased from the current six thousand three hundred to twenty thousand.
Eritrea, one of the three countries free to send troops to Somalia, is suspended.
Sudan has never shown any interests in taking its soldiers to Somalia.
If Uganda manages to get the African Union Mission to Somalia mandate changed but other African Union countries fail to send more troops.
He explained that he had a house in Ntungamo because his ancestors were born in the present Ntungamo and Rukungiri districts.
The journalists were told they would sleep in Mbarara, about 66kms away, and we immediately went back to our vehicles
Most journalists, however, decided to drive through the night and were in Kampala at about 7pm.
The journalists arrived at 7:30 pm the next day.
On the journey back, along the bumpy and dusty road, I kept thinking how Museveni is a resolute man who will not flinch from a fight.
But I was keenly aware that even powerful countries, like the USA, that have in the past attempted to pacify Somalia, have failed and fled.
It is too early to tell what Museveni and Uganda's road to Somalia might be like, but it is certainly bumpier than mine to Ntungamo.
Brian Bwesigye, on July 11th will go down in the history books as the day Uganda was thrown into a somber mood of shock, bitterness and panic.
The twin bomb attacks in Kampala did not only turn an otherwise merry night into a tragic night of death and suffering.
The AlShabaab, an Islamic extremist organization soon after claimed responsibility for the attacks that left 76 people dead.
The attacks reignited the debate on Uganda's deployment of its troops for the African Union peace mission in Somalia.
AlShabaab has warned Uganda and Burundi that there will be reprisals in Kampala and Bujumbura.
AU Mission in Somalia with UN mandate to protect the Somalia Transitional Federal Government and the shaky peace process in Somalia.
AlShabaab, an extremist military organization linked to AlQaeda, the world's most deadly terror group, controls a larger part of Somalia.
The forces that are currently in Somalia are understrength and underequipped the United Nations and European Union, among others.
The hostile environment in which the forces operate creates insecurity for the troops.
AlShabaab has killed dozens of African Union Mission to Somalia soldiers and injured many others.
Yet the troops face significant constraints on their ability to operate as the United Nations authorized mandate.
This strategy puts the African Union Mission to Somalia troops in a delicate and vulnerable situation.
AlShabaab fighters dress like civilians and use weapons that inflict mass casualties at once.
African Union Mission to Somalia is thus a crippled mission that cannot defeat AlShabaab.
Thus, as AlShabaab attacks Uganda for deploying troops in Somalia, Ugandan soldiers in Mogadishu have no mandate to fight the armed militia.
Therefore this calls for a rethink of Uganda's security and foreign policy on Somalia.
From the outpouring emotion and reaction among the Ugandan public, two important opinions on what citizens want the country to do come up.
One, that Uganda should hunt down AlShabaab so as to disable them and save the world from terror attacks.
Another is that Uganda should withdraw from Somalia and beef up its national security.
If we have no peace and security in Uganda, the citizens have a right and duty to ask their state to withdraw its forces and maximize security here.
We can contemplate a mission to hunt down AlShabaab when we are assured of our own security.
Eritrea, one of the three countries free to send troops to Somalia, is suspended.
Sudan has never shown any interests in taking its soldiers to Somalia.
If Uganda manages to get the African Union Mission to Somalia mandate changed but other African Union countries fail to send more troops.
He explained that he had a house in Ntungamo because his ancestors were born in the present Ntungamo and Rukungiri districts.

The twin bomb attacks in Kampala did not only turn an otherwise merry night into a tragic night of death and suffering.
The AlShabaab, an Islamic extremist organization soon after claimed responsibility for the attacks that left 76 people dead.
The attacks reignited the debate on Uganda's deployment of its troops for the African Union peace mission in Somalia.
AlShabaab has warned Uganda and Burundi that there will be reprisals in Kampala and Bujumbura.
African Union Mission in Somalia with UN mandate to protect the Somalia Transitional Federal Government and the shaky peace process in Somalia.
AlShabaab, an extremist military organization linked to AlQaeda, the world's most deadly terror group, controls a larger part of Somalia.
It has thus attacked African Union Mission to Somalia troops and warned it will continue to attack the citizens of the contributing states.
The forces that are currently in Somalia are understrength and underequipped the United Nations and European Union, among others.
The hostile environment in which the forces operate creates insecurity for the troops.
AlShabaab has killed dozens of African Union Mission to Somalia soldiers and injured many others.
Yet the troops face significant constraints on their ability to operate as the United Nations authorized mandate.
This strategy puts the African Union Mission to Somalia troops in a delicate and vulnerable situation.
AlShabaab fighters dress like civilians and use weapons that inflict mass casualties at once.
African Union Mission to Somalia is thus a crippled mission that cannot defeat AlShabaab.
Thus, as AlShabaab attacks Uganda for deploying troops in Somalia, Ugandan soldiers in Mogadishu have no mandate to fight the armed militia.
Therefore this calls for a rethink of Uganda's security and foreign policy on Somalia.
From the outpouring emotion and reaction among the Ugandan public, two important opinions on what citizens want the country to do come up.
One, that Uganda should hunt down AlShabaab so as to disable them and save the world from terror attacks.
Another is that Uganda should withdraw from Somalia and beef up its national security.
If we have no peace and security in Uganda, the citizens have a right and duty to ask their state to withdraw its forces and maximize security here.
We can contemplate a mission to hunt down AlShabaab when we are assured of our own security.
Further, African Union Mission to Somalia as it stands today has a limited mandate and resources.
Mukwaya is a National Resistance Movement scare monger Professor.
He says the Inter Party Cooperation should break up and the individual parties find their own candidates.
He says the Inter Party Cooperation should break up and the individual parties field their own candidates.
He speculates that even after winning power, the Inter Party Cooperation would disintegrate into warring camps.
What is at issue in the next election, is not which party is more united.
Mukwaya must have read Niccolo Machiavelli's discourses.
Over the last five years, Uganda has begun to look more like a monarchy than a republic.
To me this is the most important goal for voters in 2011.
Therefore, whether the Inter Party Cooperation will collapse or not is irrelevant to the 2011 elections and thereafter.
If Inter Party Cooperation collapses, it will be replaced by new groups to please an energized electorate.
In 2002, Kenya rejected Daniel Arap Moi's monarchical rule, ushering in the Rainbow Coalition.
In 2007, the political class tried to steal power back from the commoners.
The result was an even weaker political class, which finally caved in, paving the way for the 2010 constitutional amendments.
Voters should shun these scare tactics by the National Resistance Movement.
The message was sent using Jessica Banturaki's email.
Ugandan terror concessions are strange looking at the Middle East, especially the Palestine Israel suicide bombing incidents.
Take an example of Timothy, the 1995 Oklahoma bombing.
Despite commending Rwandans and their leaders ,the western world is speculating on what will happen in Rwanda in 2017.
They are always predicting bad scenarios like President Kagame will change the constitution to allow him seek a third term.
The three men who remained on the ballot were not considered real alternatives to Mr. Kagame.
Frank Habineza, his deputy and his green party were not even known in that party and they don't know the reality of this country.
This is what happened in the recent elections in Rwanda and it happens everywhere in the world.
It's an insult to Rwandans to say that after Paul Kagame, Rwanda will no longer exist.
Joseph Habineza, the Minister of Sports and Culture Republic of Rwanda People should not worry about Kagame's legacy.
When asked why he carried out the bombing, he said for the same reason that takes you to Iraq.
Now when I see our Hassan Luyimas here shedding tears and apologizing, I wonder why these are behaving differently from the usual terrorists.
We have got less than two hundred days to 2011 elections but the Uganda opposition has failed to convince the voters.
Mao's Democratic Party and Bidandi Ssali's party are fighting the Interparty Cooperation.
I suggest that the Inter Party Cooperation ignores Mao and Bidandi and start selling their policies to the masses.
The opposition should, for instance, have a policy on Universal Primary and Secondary Education .
When President Museveni introduced Universal Primary Education in 1997 after the 1996 elections, it won him a lot of support,
In 2006, when he went back to the population, he reminded them of the Universal Primary Education.
Museveni promised the peasants Universal Secondary Education if they voted him.
I don't know what Museveni will promise the voters in 2011 but he always has something up his sleeve to give them.
Abbey Kibirige Semuwemba is reporting from the United Kingdom.
African tribalism makes people to compliment Andrew Mwenda.
I want to add one important point that is if you study European history.
To the very best of my understanding, Rwanda had a very strong feudal structure at the onset of European colonization.
However, the invading Europeans were already well beyond feudalism.
The demise of feudalism in Europe brought up much of the territorial nationalism.
David hatred is created by circumstances, not foreign powers alone.
For example some Banyoro in Mubende and Kiboga were forcibly converted into Baganda during the colonial occupation.
We see it everyday on the streets of Kampala.
Ethnic divisions are not new in most of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia which were never colonized.
OchetoI can forgive you for not reading the feeling among Rwandans correctly.
But if Kagame even holds such a view, he would be living in denial.
Mwenda says history is not shaped by literature.

The Isis-WICCE has released a report of stories of how sexual violence has affected women in Uganda, Liberia and Zimbabwe.
According to the February 2010 study by Isis-Women's International Cross Cultural Exchange and researchers from Coventry University.
Dominica Banire from Zimbabwe Women and AIDS Support Network says;
"If one is tested positive and the other is negative, men tend to blame women for bringing the virus".
The Nakasi story is a case of a much broader miracle widely spread in nearly all conflict-ridden countries on the continent.
Rukiga Makuma says the July 19-21 African Union summit in Kampala was hijacked by the July 11 terror attacks by the Al-Shabaab Islamic militants.
The summit which had been themed on "Maternal, infant and child development in Africa" was changed.
In order to first discuss the Al-Shabaab latest terror missions.
It transpired at the summit that of the many challenges facing Africa, the search for peace and security remains the most pressing.
The August 31 2009 three cities declaration constrains states to deal with the burden of conflicts and violence on the continent.
This done by committing resources.
The lastest victim of the conflict troubling many parts of Africa is Uganda which lost 74 people in the July 11 bomb blasts.
It also had dozens of others wounded.
All the African Union leaders condemned the Al-Shabaab acts.
Eriya Kategeya, Uganda's first Deputy Prime Minister, said the government was preparing to send more soldiers to Somalia.
This is to strengthen the peace keeping forces in Somalia.
Guinea and Djibouti also pledged to send soldiers to Somalia to reinforce the Ugandan and Burundian peace contingent.
Museveni, who described the Al-Shabab as agents of mindless cowardly Middle East terrorism.
He said they and their foreign backers would be defeated.
"Who are they and whose interest do they represent?" , Museveni charged.
The Al-Shabaab attacks showed, as Rose Asha Migiro the United Nations Deputy Secretary General said that no country is immune to terrorism.
Migiro thus called upon the AU states to implement the UN Counter terrorism strategy.
Implement it with a global response rooted in the rule of law and respect for human rights.
However, as united as the African Union leaders were on terror, so were they on shielding African leaders indicted on terrorism.
Mutharika, for example, argued that the arrest warrant by the ICC against Sudan President Omar Bashir undermines African solidarity.
it also undermines peace and security that Africans fought so hard to get.
The African Union leaders agreed to oppose Bashir's accusation.

On maternal and child development in Africa, Thoraya Obaid, the Executive Director of the UNPF said poverty, illiteracy are major hindrances.
Obaid argued that, most women who die while giving birth do not seek proper healthcare either because they cannot afford the cost.
Or because they do not consider it important.
Bience Gawanas, Africa Union's commissioner for social affairs said, every pregnant woman is likely to die during child birth.
A woman in Sub-Saharan Africa has 1 out of 16 chances to die during pregnancy or childbirth.
This is compared to 1 out of 4,000 chance in developed countries.
Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest risk of maternal mortality among the poor and rich countries.
In September 2001, a total of 147 heads of state endorsed Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.
That bleeding is one of the top causes of maternal death and can be caused by failure of the uterus to contract before, during or after child birth.
Byamugisha cheered the African Union for giving maternal and infant mortality top priority on the summit agenda.
The Minister of Gender, Labour and Social Development Gabriel Opio told the summit that the government would commit $30 million.
This would be for reproductive health.
The AU theme predicted a future when the African woman nolonger has to die during childbirth because there is not enough health care for her.

Many in the crowd recall that Butambala County was previously under Mpigi district but is now Gomba district.
Two disastrous events in the last twelve months have shaken the centuries old kingdom.
The September 2009 riots over the blocking of the kabaka from travelling to Kayunga a province of his kingdom.
This touched off a deadly riot and led to the closure of the kingdom's radio station CBS.
Kingdom spokesman, Charles Peter Mayiga says there is little for Buganda to celebrate.
Considering the obstacles they have faced from the central government.
Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II was crowned on July 31, 1993.
This was twenty-seven years after Buganda kingdom was suspended along with other kingdoms in Uganda by President Milton Obote.
Since his installation at Naggalabi, Budo, Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II has largely had cold relations with the NRM government.
This government which is curiously led by his former friend Yoweri Museveni.
Mayiga says, the government owes Buganda kingdom about Shs 20 billion in rental debts for the use of land and facilities.
This claim is linked to the unresolved question involving the historical 9000 square miles of land.
This was vested in the hands of the Buganda Land Board at independence.
Mengo officials harbor the view that the solution to Uganda's political problems is the restoration of a federal system of governance.
This is a demand government has clearly been cold about.
The closest the two sides came to a solution was in 2005.
This was when a high powered Buganda delegation led by then Katikkiro Joseph Mulwanyammuli Ssemogerere.
The Buganda legislative body, the Lukiiko, threw it out arrogantly and Mulyanyamuli went with it.
Mulwanyammuli is now back to torture Museveni through his association with the Inter party co-operation and Ssuubi 2011.
Mayiga was part of the Buganda negotiation team that agreed to the regional ranking.
He now says the kingdom could not stant the requirement to have an elected Katikkiro.
This was one incurable weakness since they wanted the current situation to remain whereby the Kabaka names the Katikkiro.
The government argues that an unelected Katikiro defeats the democratisation crusade.
This is because it removes the people of their right to elect their leaders.
They argue further that a Katikkiro appointed by the Kabaka is hard to hold accountable.
Because the Baganda treat their Kabaka with near faultlessness.
Mayiga also said that the regional ranking agreement did not provide resources for the regional government.
The Buganda demand for Ebyaffe, a demand for government to honour this suggestion is fueled by the kingdom's claim.
Many Baganda believe the claim, including those who support the NRM such as former Luwero chairperson, Abudul Naduli, a Luwero veteran.
According to Nadduli, it was president Museveni's promise to restore the kingdom to its former status after he overthrew the UPC government.
Nadduli, on the other hand adds that he is satisfied with what the NRM government has provided to the Buganda kingdom.
He argues that by allowing the coronation in 1993, recognising the kingdom in the 1995 constitution and granting the regional rank.
However, they have occasionally appeared to make acknowledgement to the Central Government.
Kingdom officials have been discouraged from openly campaigning against the ruling party in 2001 and again in 2006 national election.
When tough talking Katikkiro Daniel Muliika was relieved of his duties as prime minister of Buganda after less than one year in office.
For now, Kabaka Mutebi's predicament has atleast not yet deteriorated to the extent of his father's, Sir Edward Mutesa 1.
Mutesa was exiled to London twice; from 1953 to 1955 and again in 1966 until his death in 1969.
Initially, he had problems with the British and later with Apollo Milton Obote.
In the seventeen years he has reigned, Mutebi, like his father, has repeatedly come head-to-head with the government.
As the Baganda celebrate, they will be eyeing the February 2011 national elections.
They will be hoping to possibly squeeze some rights out of Museveni's government.
A number of aggressive operations against ADF operations in and around Kampala and a number of key collaborators have been captured.
Some killed and others are still on the run.
Those who escaped arrest are suspected to have moved to their hideouts in Eastern DRC, Nairobi and others have gone into hibernation.
The aim of this presentation is to update you on the current Justice Action and Truth operations carried out against ADF terrorism.
National Resistance Movement and Rwandan Patriotic Front had a bias to violence as a means of resolving political problems.
Museveni was wrong in sending troops to Somalia.
Mwenda are you assuming that a war is fought with clear objectives and ideologies that everyone can easily identify?
Do you think that Museveni can clearly state why he sent his troops to Somalia?
The stability of Somalia is not clear from Museveni's intentions.
However, the Somali disaster has become more internationalised because of its Al Qaeda connections.
Museveni is there for his personal gains.
He's basically exploiting the need for Americans to fight anti-Americanist jihadists.
Principally Al Qaeda that has found and enjoyed the sympathy with Al Shabaab.
By taking a pro western position, the Western powers respond by not influencing the change of power against its Uganda personal leadership.
All that stuff about Somalis interests is breathtaking to the political survival of Museveni's rule.
Ocheto said Somalis must solve their problems themselves.
Why should Ugandans die for a cause that is not theirs?
We did it without assistance, so the Somalis need to do it themselves.
Our young men should not die in Somalia fighting America's wars by proxy.
I do not see why we are being bombed in this country by a war in another country whose causes are unknown to Ugandans.
Is there peace in Somalia?
Moslems in Somalia are fighting to install an Islamic republic strictly adhering to the Sharia law.

Volkswagen launched a prototype for a new vehicle lovingly called the Bio-Bug that runs on processed sewage.
Autoblog Green's Frank Filipponio points out, making methane, clean enough to power an engine over the long term has been a serious challenge.
Geneco, a subsidiary of the British sewage treatment company Wessex Water, appears to have made a breakthrough.
The subsidiary worked with Volkswagen on a vehicle type, which just made its poo-powered debut in Bristol.
According to the Geneco, first the methane is produced from sewage through anaerobic digestion by bacteria.
Joseph Lutaaya tried to covert us to his way of thinking.
Fillipponio reports that a four cylinder engine runs on the biogas and speeds about 114 miles per hour.
Geneco says that 70 households' worth of human waste is enough to power the vehicle for a year.

The ease with which Mutabazi shakes off his figures is impressive and partly a common feature of Rwandan society.
Kagame's 93% win marks a new era Perfect finish.
Many people are wearing Kagame and his party campaign gifts.
However, a one 52 year old man who is known as Jack Mutabazi a resident and peasant of rural Bugesera, stands out.
He is emotionally involved in cheering Kagame dancing, jumping up and down, and singing at the top of his voice.
Mutabazi later tells me he is Hutu and lived through the racial killing.
Mutabazi tells me that he is a health mobiliser.
You do not understand what Kagame has done for us ordinary Rwandans.
I had taken note of 32 year old Beatrice Nyirimana, who had been dancing with a wild dance.
A reprimand was given and the domestic violence ended after reporting her husband to local authorities.
People in Rwanda feel shy or afraid or both to talk about their background.
She says passionately at the top of her voice that she supports Mzee Kagame because he has liberated women from oppression.
Nyirimana immediately turned to her friend who was laughing shyly next to her.
Nyirimana's husband later abandoned her but not before he sold their family land.
Through the government's land program, Nyirimana was given a plot of land for free.
"Mzee is for women's rebalation," she says with satisfaction and goes back to singing, Kagame is ours; we are going to vote for him.
Nyirimana's eagerness is a feeling I have encountered at all Kagame gatherings ordinary men, women and youths singing and dancing wildly.
For those who covered the campaign, it was not surprising that Kagame got 93 percent of the vote.
But his opponents could hardly get a crowd of 500 at their gatherings.
Kagame's were running above 100,000.
A crowd attends a Railway Protection Force campaign gathering addressed by the incumbent, President Paul Kagame.
But for many women the love and adoration of Kagame is clearly recognised.
Given the general perceptions about extreme unfriendliness between Hutus and Tutsis.
The story of deeply rooted ancients hatreds among African ethnic groups is one of those grand distortions of our history.
Rwandan politics appears to shake that.
At many of his campaign gatherings, I have heard Kagame say: "There are no hutus, tutsis and twa in Rwanda", we are all Rwandans.
Previous regimes in Rwanda had promoted the ideas of Hutu power with unequalled effectiveness and had succeeded beyond measure.
Post racial killing, Rwanda has been trying to burry these ethnic demons.
Rwanda's challenge is to sustain this momentum to the next generations.
What seems important is, many analysts of Rwanda will tell you that the society here has a strong tendency to buy into what its rulers tell it to do.
Even though such cultural concept can be misleading, it may hold some water in this Central African nation.
The effectiveness with which the state that Kagame over threw mobilised ordinary civilians to pick machetes.
Rwandan society has proved to have an unusual respect to power and if this history holds true, it can also work the other way.
Therefore, as ordinary people cheer Kagame's insistence on a common Rwandan identity;
Is it a reflection of the success of Railway Protection Force's ideology?
However, it is not only Kagame who is surprising in this election.
The interesting person is the candidate for the opposition Social Democratic Party.
Jean Damascene Ntawukuriryayo is a prominent Hutu politician.
He is also the deputy speaker of the chamber of deputies, a moderate and a well educated man with a Doctor of Philosophy.
Ntawukuriryayo was in Rwanda in the early 1990s and belongs to the few moderates who did not participate in the racial killing.
Manase Nshutu told me, being tall gave Ntawukuriryayo a "tutsi look".
It is possible this stereotyping gave Ntawukuriryayo an insight into the dangers of ethnic politics.
Ntawukuriryayo served as minister in the Kagame led federation government.
Railway Protection Force is the one claiming kudos for mutual health.
Ntawukuriryayo says, "people tend to associate all government success with Railway Protection Force".
His campaign manager, Stanislus Kamanzi is a Member of Parliament and a knowledgeable Rwandan.
He is currently Minister for Environment and Lands in Kagame's government of national unity.
According to Kamanzi, Personal and Social Development aims to identify key areas where it can make quick wins.
It is rare to find a campaign in Africa that is fought purely on issues and not racial identity.
This way, Request For Proposal has created such hopeless fear in Rwandans.
The Electoral Commission members are still appointed by the head of the ruling party.

Museveni has been the Movement's temporary chairman since its establishment.
Museveni's nomination was effected when the Conference passed a resolution proposed by Erisa Kironde.
Kironde explained that candidates were required by law to name their Presidential candidates.
In Museveni's closing remarks, he apologised.
Joseph has been idle for weeks.
Museveni urged the Uganda Peoples Congress to desist from cheating in the forthcoming elections.
He repeated the Uganda Patriotic Movement stand that only one ballot box should be used.
A call to protest the December tenth elections has come from Uganda's ex-president and a Democratic Party member.
Yusuf Lule issued a statement from Nairobi and telexed to Uganda newspapers.
According to political observers, the statement is a direct turn down to what Lule said.
Lule said that the time had come for Ugandans to review of the current situation in the country and put things right.
Ugandans have waited for these elections for eighteen years.
It would not be wise for people to be rushed into voting by the Military Commission.
Lule said that Ugandans must unite against electoral manipulations.
The Uganda People's Congress said it would win these elections.
If Ugandans go to these elections, they will be playing in the hands of those who want legitimacy for dictatorship.
A lot has taken place in Uganda since the assumption of power in May this year by the Military Commission.
While advising the population, Paulo Semogerere said that who ever goes to the elections under these conditions is deceiving himself.
Leaders of the Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Uganda Patriotic Movement should not be tricked into any argument.
The ballot boxes are not the only ways in which the Uganda Patriotic Movement would fix the elections.
The 3 parties should stick to their common stand after they walked out of the National Conference on Communication on September 16, 1980.
The measures already taken assure Uganda Patriotic Movement every opportunity to claim victory.
The public in Uganda is warned against the danger ahead, they might discover too late that they have been cheated.
The minority group used the techniques which were adopted by Dr Obote and his Uganda Patriotic Movement party to control the majority.

Museveni said this was due to the disruptive intruders from some of the neighbouring countries.
There are some criminals in nothern Uganda who are still keeping Amin's guns.

Museveni recalled that the recent invasion in Arua had resulted into death of many Ugandan soldiers.
This story is reproduced from the Weekly Topic newspaper edition of 21st November 1980 a few days before the December 1980 elections.

Many residents in Kaluguuza accept political opinions, but as a result of high poverty and ethnic tensions.
However, George Bizibu, a councilor for Mataale sub county says the problem is that "people have monetized politics".
Non-government organizations like Action Aid, World Voices Uganda and others have offered sentization programs.
Action Aid has worked in Bunyoro for nine months on activities to arm citizens with knowledge, skills and attitudes.
On July 21, Action Aid took journalists to Kibaale and they looked into the issues of citizens participation and responsibility.
The journalists spoke with district leaders, opinion makers, and ordinary citizens so as to assess how deep democracy is in Kibaale.
In the run-up to the elections, National Resistance Movement has made efforts to tighten its already firm gap on the region.
Nsambu John, the District Internal Security Officer says that Opposition parties are minor.
They must first seek permission from Joseph.
Kibaale residents have also been affected by years of ethnic tensions between the indigenous Banyoro and the majority Bakiga.
The Bakiga are immigrants.
George Namyaka, a Munyoro, admits that he is a comprise candidate after being imposed on the electorate that had chosen a Mukiga.
Namyaka was appointed by President Yoweri Museveni at the helm of ethnic tensions between the Banyoro and Bakiga.
The district was further divided into five constituencies; Buyaga East and Buyaga West, Bugangaizi West and Bugangaizi East, and Buyanja.
Last year, Kibaale district was among the worst performers.
The district National Agricultural Advisory Service coordinator was recently arrested for embezzling funds.
Empty pockets speak loudest in Kibaale gaping the inability to read and write, poverty and ethnic tensions.
According to the independent issued on August 13-19, 2010, Mubatsi reported that the Lango sub region lies near the swampy Lake Kyoga.
A study conducted from 1994 to 2005 among some districts in Uganda revealed that Apac had the highest number of infective mosquito bites.
According to the Ministry of Health in Uganda, approximately three hundred twenty children and women die of malaria.
A Member of Parliament from Apac described the malaria burden in his area as a big disaster.
The malaria related deaths are more than any other epidemic that has hit Apac district.
Maruzi County member of parliament, David Ebony told The independent that every family has been affected.
Most of the people in Northern Uganda are poor.
Michael Okia, the senior entomologist at Uganda's Ministry of Health, offers explanations why Apac bears such an over balanced malaria burden.
Finally, Apac's hot temperatures allow malaria infected mosquitoes to reproduce quickly.
Okia says a second type of mosquito called anopheles funestus is also common around the Apac district swamps and bushes.
Since June 2005 when Uganda was considered for the President's Malaria Initiative, millions of dollars have been spent fighting the disease.
Uganda completed Phase I of a sixty six million American dollars Global Fund Round Four grant that provided a mix of malaria drugs.
The Global Fund Round Four Phase II grant of 71 million dollars, signed in 2008 will provide enough supplies of American College Testings.
This will be done nationwide through 2011.
In spite of this, Uganda still falls behind regional countries by fifty percent on the target to cut malaria infections.
In 2006, the government endorsed the use of indoor residual spraying as a trial programme in ten districts, including Apac.
Indoor residual spraying was last used in 1963, and has so far made use of Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane, Icon, and Fendona.
Bendiocrab a chemical endorsed by the World Health Organisation, will soon be rolled out.
Okia says, the use of different chemicals in spraying mosquitoes follows an insecticide management recess.
Okia explains that malaria parasites in the human body developed resistance to drugs such as chloroquine.
Okia said that the use of different chemicals in the indoor residual spray is intended to prevent insects from getting used to one chemical.
Dr Chris Baryomunsi says, although it sounds reasonable for mosquitoes to build up a resistance to chemicals, continual use is actually effective.
Health experts think of switching chemical sprays because it has been observed that mosquitoes in Apac do not die.
This happens when they continuously use the same chemical spray.
Baryomunsi adds that a chemical like Icon is more expensive but relatively safer because it is less associated with environmental problems.
Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane was used in Europe and several countries in Asia in quarter of the 20th century, where malaria is now history.
Indoor residual spraying using Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane was first used in Uganda between 1959 and 1963 in Kigezi.
This was during the malaria trial removal project.
In fact, the first chemical to use in the Indoor residual spraying project in July 2006 was Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane.
DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane has more than six months, which is the longest, per dosage
The effectiveness of Icon lasts between three and six months after spraying.
Ebong says government has to take a joint approach in the fight against malaria.
He notes that emphasis on the use of treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying with DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane should take centre stage.
He wonders why the distribution of bed nets began in central and western Uganda instead of Apac where the disease is widely spread.
Ebong said that if government can drive out malaria in Apac as a pilot scheme, it can deal with malaria in the country.
In Apac each person is still bitten on average five times a day by an infective mosquito.
According to the Malaria Operation Plan 2010, there seven hundred thousand houses which will be sprayed in the six districts.
The finding by researchers supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH;
Clarifies the picture of parasite metabolism.
Manuel Llinas of Princeton University and colleagues discovered that the deadliest malaria parasite, uses a double branched metabolic pathway.
According to Dr. Llinas, this specific branched pathway has not been detected previously in any other organism.
The malaria parasite appears to use one branch primarily to generate the molecule acetyl Certificates of Analysis.
This branch may represent particularly weak points to target with antimalarial drugs, says Dr. Llinas.
An estimated two point eighty five billion people world wide were at risk of contracting malaria in 2009.
Approximately ninety one percent of the world wide population is at risk of Malaria parasite lives in central and south east Asia.
Although the United Nations reports that malaria cases and/or deaths have dropped by half in twenty five countries in the past ten years.
European researchers have discovered that antibiotics could help fight malaria.
A 2009 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the leading malaria drug was less effective against the disease.
Pascal GahamanyiI in July/August 2010 issue of Foreign Policy Magazine explains how malaria causing parasites survive inside human blood cells.
Ayittey claimed that the Rwanda Patriotic Front dominates all levels of power.
His publication also included President Kagame what he calls the "worst of the worst leaders".
Reading the magazine, one wonders whether George Ayittey had any facts to support his shallow and foolish labeling of President Kagame.
Since Railway Protection Force came to power in 1994, it has never attempted to take over political power.
Apart from including all tribal groups in the cabinet, Railway Protection Force also accommodated all political parties.
These included the Social Democratic Party, Rwanda Socialist Party, Liberal Party, Democratic Union of the Rwandan People, DRM .
The Rwandan constitution of 2003 that marked the end of the transition is an inclusive one.
In addition to this, the President, Prime Minister, President of the Senate, Speaker of Parliament must come from different political parties.
Due to this provision, the Rwandan parliament today has the highest percentage of women parliamentarians in the whole world.
The security sector which was dominated by former Rwandan exiles due to historical factors has transformed over the years.
The Rwanda Defence Force has discussed, retrained and absorbed officers and men from the former government forces.
For example, over fifteen thousant armed forces of Rwanda have already been joined in Resource Description Framework.
In the Civil Service, the government has put in place various programmes, mechanisms, processes and institutions.
The Public Service Commission has been put in place to handle all recruitments into public offices.
George Ayittey claims that the Rwandan Patriotic Front dominates the education sector as part of the civil service.
Almost all of the five public universities in Rwanda are headed by foreigners.
Most of the university lecturers in both public and private universities in Rwanda come from foreign countries.
Ayittey also reported that those who challenge the president are accused of being isolating, hatemongers and are arrested.
The most pressing issue that government had to deal with upon assuming office in 1994 was to ensure the tribal killing does not take place again.
Avoiding the repeat of 1994 situation, the government of Rwanda decided to immediately deal with the issue of accountability.
This accountability was for tribal killing doers within the rule of law.
It is a fact that the isolating and deniers of the tutsi genocide exist mainly among Rwandans.
Non Rwandans associated with the old tribal killing regimes.
This has been at the core of many African conflicts in the past ten years.
In Rwanda, there are still some politicians who hope Rwandan Patriotic Front is one of the world's most all inclusive governments.
The problem arises that analysts like George Ayittey mislead the world by focusing on isolated incidents and basing on the present.
This does not mean that Africa does not have good leaders.
Africa has had some of the best leaders in the world; Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Nkwame Nkrumah and others.
President Kagame should be seen in that light, a leader with a big vision for both Rwanda and the continent.
Saying that attacks of President Kagame are always accused of dividing peope is thus ill intentioned or uninformed.
Before long, Mwenda, Kanaabi and approximately forty other individuals that have been charged with sedition, were free.
Andrew Mwenda's sedition saga originated on Wednesday August 10, 2005.
His death was a huge blow to the peace agreement that had been signed three weeks earlier.
Three days of riots in Sudan followed and left over one hundred thirty people dead.
Accusing fingers were pointed at President Museveni who had lent the sixty year old leader his own personal helicopter.
In Uganda, the most vocal accusations against Museveni came from Andrew Mwenda.
Mwenda felt that Uganda should be held accountable for putting Garang on "a junk helicopter" at night over a rebel infested territory.
These comments, together with his role in the subsequent publication of High Command minutes, induced Museveni to lash out at Uganda's press.
"I have been seeing this young boy, Mwenda, writing about Rwanda, writing about Sudan and writing about the Uganda People's Defence Forces".
Mwenda and Eastern Africa Media Institute lawyer, Kenneth Kakuru, shared a laugh.
His threats are completely ignored since President Mobutu Seko ruled Congo for thirty two years and Museveni has yet to clock twenty.
How did he die and how did he leave Congo yet his own soldiers were shooting at him?
If Museveni wants to walk that path, I tell you he's welcome to walk that path.
The episode, which Mwenda has since acknowledged went extremely overboard, provoking the Ugandan government to shut KFM.
However, this was not the first time the state had taken the outspoken Mwenda to court.
Mwenda and Charles Onyango Obbo, who were the Monitor's senior reporter and editor, respectively at that time, were charged.
The two journalists challenged the charge in the Constitutional Court, but were told to face the charges in a lower court first.
Between October 24, 1998 and February 16, 1999, the pair made thirty three trips to the courts.
When they took their petition back to the Constitutional Court, it upheld the legality of the offence with which they had been charged.
However, the court's decision was later appealed in the Supreme Court, and the publication of false news law was ruled unconstitutional.
Up until the Constitutional Court's landmark ruling on August 25 this year, sedition has been used against politicians.
To date, only Haruna Kanaabi, the former reporter and editor of the now defunct Shariat news paper has served a jail term for a sedition charge.
When Mwenda was charged in the aftermath of the "Garang Episode" in 2005, he joined the East African Media Institute.
"At one point, a judge would be indisposed and another time the state counsel was sick," says James Nangwala of the delay.
All along, however, the government continued to pluck journalists from their office, bring them to the Central Police Station for questioning.
"I've been to the police station over fifty times during my nine years of journalism," recalls Semuju Ibrahim, former editor at The Observer.
Museveni's government, having prosecuted one sedition suspect successfully in the past 24 years, cannot expect to win many of their cases.
"I've lost friends on account of my charge," says former Independent and current Daily Monitor reporter, John Njoroge.
Moreover, Makerere University Mass Communication lecturer Adolf Mbaine says many students are now seeking "safer" careers in public relations.
"This section of the law was limiting Ugandans from demanding accountability from their leader," says Kanaabi.
Subsequent to the Constitutional Court's ruling, State Attorney Patricia Mutesi, said the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
Mutesi has the support of powerful figures in the government such as Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity James Nsaba Buturo.
"It is an essential piece of legislation," Minister Buturo told The Independent by phone.
Buturo added that in most developed countries, the media is mature but, you don't find that here.
It is fortunate for Minister Buturo and other members of the government displeased with the sedition ruling.
"They wanted the Supreme Court to deal with it," Mwenda reasoned confidently afterward.
In the Independent of September 03 - 09, 2010, they were sure we were going to appeal.
Nangwala and Kenneth Kakuru, counsel for the Eastern Africa Media Institute appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.
The promoting sectarianism charge, "offers the government with less leg room," says Mwenda.
However, these charges may appear insignificant.
If the proposed amendments to the Press and Journalist Act 1995 are submitted and passed by parliament.
Those amendments, would require publications to be licensed yearly by the Media Council and charged with enforcing ethical standards.
Under the Press and Journalist Amendment Bill 2010, any publication could have their licence revoked if it publishes injurious material.
The Media Council would also be given authority to not only mediate but regulate any potential media violations.
Joshua Kyalimpa, President of UJA and member of Article 29 Coalition, says the group has met with the Minister of Information.
Even Media Council Chairperson, Professor Goretti Nassanga, has expressed skepticism over the amendments in their current form.
"I'm hoping that is not how the bill will turn out," says Professor Goretti.
Professor Goretti Nassanga went on to talk about the bill.
Professor Nassanga added that the balance between media laws that promote national unity, "is still very touchy".
The Independent of September 03 - 09, 2010 reported about the Andrew Mwenda and Eastern Africa Media Institute sedition victory.
"I was able to stay with ordinary prisoners and see the challenge of the prison system in Uganda".
"The police were very nice to me, the president's son came to see me", Mwenda continued.
Kanaabi is the acting executive secretary for Independent Media Council and the only Ugandan journalist ever convicted of sedition.
Haruna Kanaabi has been charged with sedition on two occasions.
The first, in 1993, occurred after the Shariat newspaper mocked several ministers from trying to get support for Museveni.
The opinion argued the ministers would have been better served sharing their encouraging words with Museveni's cows.
Kanaabi, who was subeditor of the paper, says he was only responsible for the article's headline.
The second occasion took place in 1996 after Museveni had toured Western Uganda and parts of Rwanda.
Museveni was quoted in the nation assuring the people of Rwanda that he was there to write a new history.
Kanaabi recalls that he spoke as if he was the president of Rwanda.
As a result, Shariat ran an opinion that mocked Museveni for turning Rwanda into Uganda's fourtieth district.
The same afternoon that the story came out, Kanaabi was arrested on charges of disobedience for a second time.
Kanaabi as he was represented the original question says that Mwenda never went to jail.
Luzira is a very different place.
Kanaabi explained that there were no visitors in Luzira.
Kanaabi and others remained behind bars except from 8am to noon.
The cell that would house Kanaabi and seventy to eighty other prisoners would be closed permanently for the night by 3pm everyday.
Kanaabi recalls that a man once collapsed from a heart condition and they still refused to open the cell.
Kanaabi says that at Luzira, the food is simply posho and beans and is served only once daily.
But the hardest part for Kanaabi was the communal showers.
As a result, Kanaabi would resort to washing himself with a jerry can over the toilet in his cell.
Kanaabi remained in Luzira for the duration of his four month trial.
Although Kanaabi was found guilty of disobedience at the end of his trial, he was released by the officer in charge of the prison shortly afterward.
Kanaabi's and Shariat's problems continued on the outside.
Harassment and intimidation of reporters and Shariat vendors persisted.
The August 25 decision was a huge victory for Kanaabi and his colleagues but it still can't erase what has been stripped from him.
At the end of the interview, Kanaabi reflects back at the suffering he went through.
Haruna Kanaabi still reflects back at the suffering he went through while he was behind bars.
Seven years after the ruling National Resistance Movement was registered as a political party.
Ofwono Opondo's insistence that NRM has an annual budget is promptly rejected by the admission of another senior party official.
Captain Mike Mukula says that they don't have that budget and he has never had a budget for his activities, not even a shilling.
His defence is verified by another member of the National Executive Council, who declined to be named.
Other political parties like the DP, UPC and FDC have annual budgets, which they recently passed.
The UPC treasurer Peter Mukidi Walubiri says the party has a thirty three billion shillings budget for 2010/2011 ending next June.
The FDC Spokesperson Wafula Oguttu says the party's national conference passed a twenty three billion shillings budget in February this year.
The Democratic Party treasurer Issa Kikungwe too says his party's National Executive Committee recently passed a budget.
It's the National Resistance Movement, Uganda's biggest political party, which does not have a budget among the top four political parties.
Neither is it officially funded by the government like in the case in Tanzania and South Africa where parties have business subsidiaries.
Except for the mid 1990s when NRM, previously called the "Movement system", set up Danze Enterprises Ltd as its trading arm.
Nathan Igeme Nabeta says that each of the NRM's members contributes one hundred thousand shillings to the party every month.
It cannot even finance one National Resistance Movement national conference in a year.
For instance the National Resistance Movement spent four million shillings.
NRM spent five billion shillings on allowances and transport of the thirty thousand delegates for the June 25 to June 27 conference this year.
That's why, observers say, more than half of the NRM executive are either cabinet ministers or hold other big government jobs.
NRMVice President, Proscovia Salaamu Musumba too says the National Resistance Movement's biggest financier is government.
She says that those are the resources which are used to run the National Resistance Movement.
This insistence is reinforced by Godber Tumushabe, Executive Director of the Advocates union for Development and Environment.
Tumushabe says that it is not possible to separate the National Resistance Movement as a party from the government.
He says that the National Resistance Movement and its team are maintained through a carefully dodged funding system.
Seven percent of the 2010/11 budget has been allocated to the public administration sector, defence and security.
For that reason, he says, it is not possible for the National Resistance Movement to be dominated by people who do not hold government jobs.
For instance, without considering the President, more than half of the NRM's 22 Central Executive Committee officials are cabinet ministers.
The NRM National Chairman is President Yoweri Museveni and the 2nd National Vice Chairperson is Deputy Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga.
The Secretary General is Security Minister Amama Mbabazi and his Deputy Dorothy Hyuha is Minister without Portfolio.
The Chairperson of the National Resistance Movement Women's League is Education Minister Namirembe Bitamazire.
The chairman of the youth league is Abbas Agaba, a State House employee.
The regional vice chairpersons general is only the first National Vice Chairman, Haji Moses Kigongo.
The captain is Moses Ali from the north.
Mike Mukula, Felistus Magomu, Treasurer Ndawula Kaweesi and his Deputy Katongole Singh do not hold cabinet jobs or senior government offices.
It is important to note that by October 2005 Muhwezi and Mukula were in cabinet when the NRM Central Executive Committee was elected.
Muhwezi was the Minister for Health while Mukula was his deputy.
But even members of the Central Executive Committee who don't hold government jobs are beneficiaries of huge government subsidies.
Hassan Basajjabalaba, has been a beneficiary of twenty one billion shillings soft loan from Bank of Uganda.
NRM offices whose heads luck profitable government offices are either dormant or in virtual limbo due to financial constraints.
They have not held a single meeting since they were formed in October 2005.
Major General Muhwezi, the Chairman of the Veterans League says that all the leagues have not held any meetings.
In a report to the National Executive Committee meeting of 12th January 2010, Mbabazi pointed out poor party.
Muhwezi said the Members of Parliament contributions are used for rent and facilitation of party branch offices countrywide.
He mentioned the case of Rukungiri branch, which has gone for months without pay.
However, Muhwezi blames this problem on disorganisation within the party.
Dr Frank Nabwiso, says that the National Resistance Movement has over the years built a network through which it draws money.
When the Independent pressed him, he became hostile saying the law allows the NRM to protect the identity of its funders.
Opondo did not mention a contrary law that allows protection of sources of funding for a political party.
Nabudere reminded the people that a new voters' register will be prepared next month.
He thanked the people of Jinja and Iganga for their efforts in arresting vehicles, which smuggle Uganda coffee.
Mr John Lyavala is the branch chairman.
Lwanga, urged the government to take a closer look at the back bone of the internal security forces.
According to the independent issue of September 03-09, 2010, John Howself stated that partnership is not the party's target.
Nkurunzinza was returned to office unopposed for a second five year term amid a series of explosive attacks and allegations.
The Uganda People's Congress leader Olara Otunnu split from the Inter Party Cooperation amidst a disagreement.
The Federation for Democratic Change along with the Inter Party Cooperation parties seem confident.
The argument of the opposition about the Electoral Commission is a means to an end.
Otunnu argues, the main cause of the UPC splits from the Inter Party Cooperation, is that President Museveni cannot be defeated.
The Democratic Party, now the Uganda People's Congress suggest that the opposition response in the lead up to the elections may be unlucky.
The beating of peaceful protesters over this period has undoubtedly tarnished the National Resistance Movement's reputation.
There are multitude of reports and public statements that express fear of violence in preparation for the polls in 2011.
Human rights activists Samuel Olara says five years is a long time in politics.
When conditions are good, participation in Uganda's politics is the right thing to do.
The Electoral Commission has received billions of shillings to help it conduct a free and fair election.
No donor country has supported the opposition in criticising the unfairness of the Electoral Commission.
With the opportunity of elections to satisfy donors only every five years, the decision to boycott the opposition is equates to castration.
The Forum For Democratic Change leader's view in the Inter Party Coalition camp is based on his experience in the past elections.
Besigye has been at the forefront of the fraudulent election problem in both the 2001 and 2006 elections.
Despite claims to the contrary, the politics of Uganda is driving away from the current status of violence and intimidation.
Ugandans, adequately represented by an opposition, reasoned and coordinated, will not tolerate the political games of yesterday.
The strategic importance of the Electoral Commission is producing free and fair elections in Uganda.
Like Burundi, this process is paramount to the long term political and social stability of the Uganda's future.
Plural participation in this process therefore forms the basis for achieving peace and stability in Uganda.
John Howse is a student of Maters in Peace and Conflict Studies programme, Makerere University, studying political violence in electoral processes.
Kizza Besigye and Olara Otunnu advised Nkurunziza that the election avoidance will only eliminate opposition to the background.
Kony, Otti, Odyambo, Lukwiya, Abudema, Opio Makas, Ocan Bunia, Angola, Lotiba, and Labalpiny all spoke.
Kony sent out several small fighting groups.
Kony had ordered Odyambo's group to make sure he stops and ambushes the Uganda People's Defense Force without fail.
He later directed Odyambo to send some soldiers to him as soon as possible.
He stated it clearly that the situation might worsen if Makas is destroyed before reaching him.
He ordered Lotiba to make sure he meets Makas by 0800hrs today, so they hurry to join him in his defence.
In reaction to Lukwiya's report, Kony directed him never to stay and continue communicating when the enemy is advancing towards him.
Otti instructed Angola that he doesn't want to hear that Ojara has separated from him.
Ocan Bunia closed down after he failed to read Kony clearly.
Lukwiya reported that he was seriously being followed and attacked by the Uganda People's Defense Force.
Angola reported that Ojara had joined him.
He revealed that it was Caca who attacked Minakulu and robbed a mixture of drugs that can help them.
He also revealed that he attacked Atine and the results were not bad.
He did not elaborate the issue.
Lotiba reported that his enemy is disturbing him and he could not stay on air.
Kony seems to be preparing for his final showdown with the Uganda People's Defense Force.
It seems he cannot change location before he meets Makas to reinforce him with mainly food and drugs.
This has forced him to put up a defence sending fighting groups to engage and ambush the advancing Uganda People's Defense Force.
Kony has a habit of putting up a defence and then sneak out without the knowledge of his commanders in the defence.
He will stay about a kilometer plus with two or three soldiers who sit in a few meters from his location to hear him if he wants their services.
It is up to Joseph to take action on the recommendations.
The Uganda People's Defense Force should put into consideration Kony's survival instinct.
Kony, Otti, Lukwiya, Ocan, Angola, Kapere, Abudema, Dominic, Lotiba, Labongo, Opio Makas, Odokonyero, Wodo, and Oyoo were all on air.
Kony directed Lukwiya Raska, who had already crossed into Sudan to move and pass through the area.
Kony instructed all units with the support of weapons such as B10, SPG-912.
Museveni should be sent to Sudan to beef up his security.
President Museveni had a plan to destroy the Lord Resistance Army by deploying mobiles and gun ships at once.
He instructed Otti to remove Alit from the command of a brigade to a lower post.
Labongo was instructed to take all the women of the Lord Resistance Army officers to Lakat.
Otti revealed that he was attacked by the Uganda People's Defense Force and many of his soldiers were killed in action.
Bigombe and Adek had peace talks with Kony.
Lakati was accused of not operating to the Lord Resistance Army's expectation and yet he had just been promoted.
Labongo reported that he attacked the Kalabongo camp in the Namokora subcounty on June-3-2004.
He ambushed a vehicle on July-18-2004 and charged five liters of gun oil and thirty thousand shillings.
He further ambushed a vehicle on Madi-Opei road, in both incidents he charged both accumulators.
He revealed that the havoc he did in Kalabongo is a revenge for what the Uganda People's Defense Force did to them.
Abudema reported that he was off air because of pressure from the Uganda People's Defense Force which attacked him.
Opio Makas reported that he was hit by a gunship injuring one soldier and killing one recruit and a child.
He informed Kony that four soldiers namely; Dwoka, Ongwere, Otto and Oroko where separated from Justine during the contact.
Kapere is planning for a serious horror in revenge for the killing of his wife and the child.
He informed Labongo that he lost his uniform during the attack, so he should get him some pairs.
Kony seems to be worried about the Lord Resistance Army stays in Uganda in big numbers.
He thinks that they can easily weaken if pressed by the Uganda People's Defense Force.
He wants to discuss the way forward after the Sudan government change their offical stand on Lord Resistance Army.
There are ongoing efforts by the state and President Kagame to intimidate the citizens into total silence.
In my 10 years of association with Rwanda, I have encountered many people who are reluctant to talk about politics.
They include members and supporters of the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front, former members and members of the armed forces.
I have also met people, including President Kagame, who is open and willing to discuss any subject.
Many are members and supporters of the Rwanda Patriotic Front including public officials serving in a wide range of institutions.

Many are members and supporters of the Rwanda Patriotic Front including public officials serving in a wide range of institutions.
Rwandan government critics, some of whom have never been there or read anything about genocide never ask themselves this question.
I have attended several public meetings where, before President Kagame speaks, people are given an opportunity to present their views on issues.
The government of Rwanda also hosts an Annual National Dialogue attended by people from all walks of life.
The "climate of fear" claims have been used by some to explain large crowds during President Kagame's campaigns and on election day.
It seems the objective was to portray Rwandans as incapable of deciding on whether to attend election rallies or even vote.
However, the large turn-outs by Diaspora Rwandans on election day and the resounding endorsement they gave to Kagame tell a different story.
Yet one ought not to stop at the popular endorsement that President Kagame has won.
Rwanda is the only country in the region that has demonstrated the organizational capacity to conduct transparent elections.
The enormity of this achievement becomes more striking when one considers Rwanda as 2nd poorest country among the East African countries.
In a recent profile of Kagame by the Financial Times of London, Tom Burgis, quoted; "he`s sitting on an ethnic time bomb."
This claim is loved by diplomats and aid workers whose knowledge of Rwanda and interactions with locals are often superficial.
It is argued that Rwanda is set to explode into violence any time.
The less restrained among them argue that those being denied a voice are the Hutu population.
I do not claim that Rwanda is guaranteed never to become unstable again.
There is no guarantee that the Hutu are currently denied a voice.
If there are Hutu that have been denied a voice, it is those who aspire to exploit their identity for political purposes.
Frederick Golooba Mutebi said that he has listened to some women claiming that their husbands are in prison on genocide charges.
It is important to note that even the Tutsi are not free to use ethnicity as a political tool.
The Rwandan government has been characterized as hostile to the press by media rights groups.
As for President Kagame, the best label the France-based Reporters could come up with was ‚Äòmedia predator' or something to that effect.
The media in Rwanda are much more restrained in their assessment of Kagame and his government compared to Uganda.
It is true that since the France based Reporters took over power, journalists have fled or been prosecuted for various offences.
One journalist was murdered following what international media allege was his investigation into the shooting of Lt.Gen. Kayumba in South Africa.
Taken together without reference to context, these things easily raise questions about both President Kagame and his government.
But there are also important aspects of Kagame's relationship with the media that critics do not talk about.
Kagame has also held many long meetings with members of the media fraternity, during which frank views have been exchanged.
I have a recording of President Kagame condemning a government minister at one press conference.
Kagame's view was that, it should be a matter for the courts to sort out between individual journalists and aggrieved parties.
Anyone in the media would know that it is divided over the criticisms rights groups throw at President Kagame and his government.
At a media conference held in Rwanda in July this year, several journalists denounced the "self appointed champions of media freedom".
It is not enough to argue that Kagame is a dictator and another genocide is likely unless freedom of speech is respected.
Rwanda's politics is heavily shaped by the country's history of periods of state-planned violence, ethnic and regional discrimination and restrictions.
If we see the Hutu elect Kagame and Rwandan Patriotic Front, we should recall that they have been victims of dirty politics.
There are things the post-genocide government, the Rwandan Patriotic Front and President Kagame could be criticized for.
They should also join Rwandans in celebrating the RPF's vast achievements which will leave a permanent imprint on the country.
Kagame may not take them to that destination, but he has helped them navigate some of its most difficult stages.
