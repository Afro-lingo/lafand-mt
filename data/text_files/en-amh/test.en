Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today .
Simultaneously a demonstration was held by activists and journalists in front of the parliament as a majority of MP's voted for the bill.
An improvised coffin plastered with the words Freedom of the Internet was carried by activists signalling the anticipated death of the Internet in Jordan.
Participants wore black to the funeral-themed demonstration.
The approved law must still receive ratification from the upper house of parliament as well as approval by King Abdullah II, who retains supreme authority and whose signature is the seal of approval to all legislative matters.
Member of Parliament, Jamil Nimri, who voted against the bill, in addition to the head of the journalists syndicate, attended the protest and claimed that such laws serve only to restrict freedoms and muffle the voices of the people.
It requires the owners of websites to register with the government and obtain a license, just like any other publication.”
Owners of websites will also be made responsible for the content of comments published by readers on their sites.
Outrage over the proposed law has been simmering for a while and netizens had already staged an online campaign to draw attention to the new law and its repercussions.
On Twitter, netizens expressed their dismay at such a bill.

Nizar Samarri adds: ‪@‬NizarSam: The house of representative have passed the amendments to the press and publications law just a while ago… what a shame
‪
And @godotbasha asks:
@godotbasha: So if I draw parallels between Jordan and police states vis a vis ‪#censorship‬ law I can be subjected to persecution? ‪#freenetjo‬
Hisham Al Balawneh tweets: @Jor2Day: I am not convinced at all that the goal behind the press and publications law is to organise, but is rather to shut the people up and move Jordan backwards
And Hanin Abu Shamat states:
‪@HaninSh: ‬What's with the #FreeNetJO drama?
The Senate (Upper House) has to approve it first...
I trust our Senators and not our useless MPs. :) #JO
Shahzeydo reflects:
@Shahzeydo: With one regressive law Jordanian bureaucracy puts a leash on Jordan's knowledge economy.
Brilliant' Govt logic in a recession. #FreeNetJo‬
And Majd Yousef continues: @Mayousef: They have killed freedom in our country and accused it of being dishonourable so that they would exonerate themselves
Fadi Zaghmout comments: @ArabObserver: A black day in Jordan's history
While Mohamad Shawash warns:
Bashar Zeedan links the new attack on the freedom of the Internet to the Jordanian Spring.
He says: @BasharZeedan: The government has been suppressing, censoring, lifting and suppressing since the start of the #Jordanian_Spring… they've misunderstood the issue
And Omar Qudah adds: @OmarQudah: He who thinks he can fence space like he fences a roundabout or a farm, is crazy!
Omar Kamel sees the Parliament's decision as a signal to boycott the elections: @BshMosawer: The parliament of 'fangs'… I hope to see the day you suffer!
This is the reason number 1000 following thousands of other reasons to boycott the elections!
Activists launched a petition on Avaaz.com under the title Save the internet, which called on King Abdullah II, the minister of information and members of parliament to repeal the amendments to the press and publications law.
Human Rights Watch also published a report on the latest bill passed by the parliament and the restrictions that are to be imposed on Jordanian websites, titled Jordan: Moves to Censor Online Expression.
The Union Women and Child Development Ministry in India is considering a draft bill which, if passed by parliament, would make it legally compulsory for husbands to pay out a portion of their monthly income to their homemaker wives, for doing household chores.
As per the Ministry's proposal, a model is being framed which will allow for valuation of the work done by homemakers in economic terms and then recognition of this contribution to the economy by compensating homemakers for their labour.
The proposed law is expected to refer to homemakers as home engineers.
Minister Krishna Tirath has said that this amount, which could be anywhere between 10-20% of the husband's monthly salary, should not be looked upon as salary for housework; rather it could be referred to as an honorarium or something similar.
While the Minister sees this as a step forward in women's empowerment, the proposal is being debated hotly, both offline as well as online.

Some feel that measuring the value of unpaid work at home is conceptually correct and well worth trying, though making it mandatory for husbands to pay out a fixed percentage of their salaries in lieu of this work may be the wrong way forward.
Others wonder how it will be possible to put a 'price tag' on all the work that goes on within a home and how such a law would be implemented - given the various questions that are sure to come up in it's wake.
And questions are indeed being asked.
For example, LordRaj asks:
Are you suggesting an Employee / Employer relationship for the married couple?
Who is going to decide on the working hours and job description?
In Ground Report, which is an open news platform, D. Chaitanya outlines some further questions related to this issue that people (both men and women) appear to be hotly debating.
For example:
If in the place of wife, house-maid is discharging every day house-hold work, then how should the house-maid be treated?
Should not the house-maid be treated on par with the wife?
(In such cases) who are legitimately entitled for that 10 or 20% of amount?
If 10 or 20% salary is deposited on wife’s name, what about the maintenance money to wife, if she deserts the husband and files a maintenance case on husband?
Will this law create new financial skirmishes between wives and husbands?
Like 498-A of Penal Code, Maintenance laws, domestic violence laws, will this law also be misused by some wives?
Blogger Surya Murali too is wondering how the government proposes to implement a law such as this.
She says on her blog:
I am all for the empowerment of women, and also their financial independence... (but) my biggest question to these lawmakers is that how are they planning to implement the proposal?
If they go about doing it the way such that a husband shares a percentage of his income with his wife for her work, I don’t see how it makes the economic situation of the house any better or how it makes the woman independent and empowered.
The gross income remaining the same, the household economy is not changed.
Most responsible husbands, in my belief, would share the running costs of the household with their wives anyway… if that isn’t the case, then this sort of a scheme is not going to improve the husband-wife equation of those households.
At iDiva, Archana Jayakumar asks:
How does all of this not make her anything but a glorified servant?
Sunita at Supari.org agrees and calls this proposed Bill as family breaking move by the government.
Under the guise of 'development and welfare' of women, all you have been doing is promoting a bias against men.
Men's rights groups tend to agree.
Vicky Nanjappa points out:
A proposal to part with a portion of the husband’s salary and hand it over to the wife has been strongly opposed by Men’s rights groups...The ‘Save Family Foundation’ has written a letter to Krishna Tirath, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, seeking immediate withdrawal of the proposal.
The foundation, representing around 40 different men’s organizations across the country, has termed this proposal as one-sided.
With such incentives, it is not surprising that many wives would rather just sit idle, and get free doles from their husbands, with the kind blessings of the Indian judicial system.
And all this under the guise of women empowerment
However, others are more positive to this proposal for various reasons.
For example, in a discussion in the Defence Forum India, Yusuf appears pleased.
Actually this news is music to my ears.
Gives me more ways to save tax. :-)
Blogger Surya Murali goes on to offer, what she feels is a more practical solution to the issue, something that will truly benefit the women without getting her into the employer-employee hierarchy within the family.
Let the government work out a method in which they evaluate the households economically and they give the housewives / homemakers an allowance.
This totally skips the husband as a middleman and is a direct deal between the people who want the housewives to be empowered and the housewives.
In my opinion, this would not only help the women be independent, it will also improve the general quality of life in households which otherwise manage with meager means.
Thus, both targets of economic upliftment and female empowerment would be achieved.
InfoQueenBee agrees and adds:
While we wait to see what happens to the Minister's proposal, it appears that the debate surrounding the question of the husband being forced to pay his house engineer an 'honorarium' for household work, is far from over.
Over the past few years it has become apparent that, if one has a loud enough voice and a big enough audience — not to mention a good sense of humor — social media can serve as a great platform for change.
And while that often means political or social change, it can also mean — as famous blogger Heather Armstrong, aka Dooce, has proven — the ability to get a major company to listen to your complaints.
Adding a hashtag, Mowafi encouraged followers to tweet their own complaints about the airline: To all those who've been tortured by @flyegyptair please join me in my plight to get them to answer and explain themselves #DearEgyptAir
Many quickly followed suit.
Waleed Mowafi (@WallyMow) added:
#DearEgyptAir Sometimes when i'm at home I rub sandpaper on my arms because i miss the feel of the Egypt Air blankets @flyegyptair
Mai Eldib (@14inchHEELS) complained:
#DearEgyptAir would it be possible for me to once fly without having pilots smoking in the cockpit @AmyMowafi
@Mayounah had a more pressing concern:
#DearEgyptAir plz don't roll your eyes at me when I complain water is dripping from your ac on board...I'm pretty sure it is an issue
Many were focused on the culinary delights offered by the airline. @ShadenFawaz said of the cake:
#DearEgyptAir have you tried eating that cake that you serve!?
Well it's not food in case you haven't noticed
@LailaShentenawi quipped:
#DearEgyptAir U make sure no one boards with a nail file! Yet u ignore that if someone got hit with the bread u serve he/she could die!
Waleed Mowafi mocked:
@MarwaAyad was a little more straightforward:
#DearEgyptAir Who prepares and cooks those meals?
Seriously who?
On 13 July, 2012, Ethiopia's federal court sentenced a prominent Ethiopian blogger Eskinder Nega and 23 other opposition activists to 18 years in jail for allegedly participating in terrorist activities.
Eskinder Nega is a journalist, who turned to blogging to find a breathing space online for his dissenting views, has been in a prison for a year now.
14 September, 2012 marks the first anniversary of his arrest.
The Ethiopian online community remembers him on Facebook:
Mesfin Negash writes:
One year since journalist Eskinder Nega arrested in front of his son.
We mark the day demanding the release of Journalists and other prisoners of conscience in Ethiopia.
Light a candle wherever you may be today.
We want Eskinder and others FREE!

Jawar Mohammed shares Qale'ab Tadesse Che Jr.’s note which was written by Serkalem Fasil, the wife of Eskidner Nega, and demands that the Ethiopian government free all political prisoners:
It is one year today since Eskinder Nega was thrown to jail , he was then falsely charged with terrorism and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment.
According to the note below by his wife and fellow journalist Serkalem Fasil, when he was a rrested, Eskinder was bringing their 6 year old child from school. The police stopped him on his way and would not even let him bring the kid home.
They violently split the boy from his father.
What was strange was that they ( police) kept video tapping and taking pictures as the boy was crawling on the ground and crying watching his father who was being thrown around and hand cuffed.
None of them tried to comfort the terrified baby.
Since then all the young child could to talk is police.
He repeats how the police took his father.He is scared that they would come any time.
He is terrified of them.
Serkalem asks, now tell me who is the terrorist?
She says she is worried more about the psychological impact this had on her young son than incarceration of Eskendir, because unlike the child, the father was prepared and knew this was coming.
Free Eskinder Nega and the rest of the over 30,000 political prisoners languishing in the various Ethiopian jails.
Meanwhile, Facebook users created a Facebook group which says iCare with all members of the group making their Facebook profile pictures with an Ethiopian flag with a note on it which reads I care!:
Nebiyu Hailu one of the members of the group writes:
Every single day shows me that Meles Zenawi was monster, evil, cruel dictator.
Thanks God I’ll never see Meles again.
But this good-for-nothing Epdrf guys must free up Eskinder Nega, Andualem Arage & other political prisoners.
I really care! we need freedom.
After all we live in a big prison.
Zone Nine, a blog which is a host of nine young Ethiopian bloggers, reports the online event and demands the release of all political prisoners :
The one year anniversary of the incarceration of Eskinder Nega is being marked by Ethiopians on Facebook! Ethiopians are changing their profile pictures with an Ethiopian flag with a message on it!
As a group of bloggers who firmly believe in free press and free discussion we demand to the Ethiopian government to free Eskinder Nega and all political prisoners!
The Ethiopian government has increased its online censorship activities since September 2011.
Among those jailed are two Swedish journalists who are serving an 11 year prison term for allegedly supporting an ethnic Somali rebel group.
Eskinder Nega is the winner of Pen America's PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award for his endeavor for freedom of expression in an extremely inhospitable media landscape.
As the tension between China and Japan over the disputed Diaoyu Islands (also known as the Senkaku Islands) has elevated, large scale anti-Japan protests have taken place all over China in more than 80 cities over the weekend.
Some of the demonstrations turned violent, protesters started attacking Japanese style restaurants, shopping malls and shops; some even tried to set fire to Japanese vehicles.
Yet, in a country where online activities are closely monitored and public security forces are extremely effective, many wondered what made these nationwide protests possible.
Free More News's video shows how protesters in Changsha attacked and mobbed a Japanese shopping center in September 15, 2012:
Coordination of protests
Many netizens pointed out that the protests were coordinated via QQ groups, which are more private than other social media platforms such as Weibo.
From Sina Weibo, Mars explains :
Protesters set fire to a car in Xian.
Photos from Free more news.
Weibo is not a popular platform.
The anti-Japan propaganda is spreading via QQ groups and QQ space like a virus.
The violent protesters are stirred up by these platforms.
Also on Weibo, user Economist finds out that government civil servants were active in mobilizing the protests:
I asked him about the background of the senders.
He said one is working for the land revenue bureau, one is working for a research center in a military corporation.
zy in boston raises a technical question:
How come there are so many anti-Japan protesters in Shenzhen?
What about the three layers of monitoring existing in QQ?
Are all these functions suspended because of patriotism?
Indeed over the past two days, even though words like Rally (游行) have not been searchable on social media platforms, the term Anti-Japan protest has not been banned.
Words like Diaoyu Islands, Protect Diaoyu, Protest, and Crushing even appear in the hot topic search list.
Below is the screen capture of the Anti-Japan Protest (反日示威) search result:
Behind the scenes?
Hu Zimei raises a series of questions and wonders who exactly is behind the scenes:
Something is wrong.
1
40-50 cities are protesting at the same time; 2.
The total number of participants are not too many but the protests are rather destructive. Most of them are young men, they work together to launch attacks at some very specific targets; 3.
The riot police are not prepared; 4.
The state-controlled media and opinion leaders consider the violent protests as radical expression of patriotism; 5.
All micro-blogs that show the violent scenes are deleted.
I wonder if this is organized violence that has nothing to do with people?
Some bloggers believe that the protest is related to the upcoming 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
Some news reports have already pointed out that the numbers in the Politburo Standing Committee (top leadership of the Communist Party of China) will be reduced from 9 to 7 seats and the secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee will be dismissed from the core leadership.
The Committee is designed to oversee public security, law execution and judiciary in China and has been responsible for stability maintenance in the past few years.
Such an arrangement is believed to be related to the scandal of the former Chongqing party Secretary Bo Xilai, who is closely connected with the Head of the Public Security Bureau and the current Secretary of the Political and Legislative Committee, Zhou Yongkang.
Below are some of the speculations found on Weibo :
Tang Song history: The propaganda authorities and the Political and Legislative Committee are working together under some commands.
This is what they want, an excuse for them to take action.
Then they can re-enter the scene.
This is their intention.
They are the directors and you are the voluntary actors.
Please think who are the victim and who gain from this?
History has be recurring through out all the dynasties.
Do we have to go through this again?
RVP: Why there is no violent act in Taiwan and Hong Kong?
Only one reason, the Communists are self-directing the whole act.
Cry out loud: Can't you see?
They are making use of the anti-Japan protest to express their anger at the government.
The Maoist Left is probably behind this.
The central authority is caught in the middle of internal and external tension.
Rational voices
While angry patriots are in the street protesting, cooler heads do prevail online as the Tea Leaf Nation pointed out .
Below are some of my picks from the more rational voices:
WeMarketing: I know a bit more about China in this violent protest.
We are now in 2012, but history still keeps recurring.
This is in the name of anti-Japan, next time in the name of anti-capitalists, or anti-foreigners.
If you are among the group of people being targeted at, you can't protect your property and your own safety.
Boxer rebellion, Red Guards, patriotic thugs, one generation after other.
hut in the city: In history, both the Boxer and the Red Guard are used as weapons and then turned into scapegoats.
Don't join the angry youth.
Who will gain from these violent acts?
Please just use your brain.
They make use of a 7 kilometre square piece of land to stir up the crazies all over China's 960 million square meters of territories.
Some of us still feel that they are heroes.
My mother asked what would happened if the war started?
I said I am not afraid of war but I am afraid of the Cultural Revolution.
As the violence has elevated, riot police have adopted stronger measures.
However, as the anniversary of the Muken Incident is approaching on September 18, the anti-Japanese sentiment may continue to grow in the next few days.
An Iranian official, Abdolsamad Khoramabadi, said this was due to a request by the public to oppose an anti-Islam film on YouTube that many see as blasphemous (Google owns YouTube).
Khoramabadi is a key member of a Commission to Determine Instances of Criminal Content”.
Meanwhile some speculate that the true reason for blocking Google has more to do with promoting the so called Iranian national Internet which was supposed to become operational on 22 September, but has so far not appeared.

Global Voices contacted several Iranians in different cities including Tehran, Shiraz and Qom. Almost all say they have no access to Gmail.
A number of them are also unable to access Google search.
Arash Abadpour, a Canada-based Iranian blogger and computer scientist explained the situation to Global Voices as following:
Cutting off access to Google Search essentially pushes a significantly larger population towards looking for ways to be able to get around the filtering regime.
A result of this process is not necessarily a better or more free Internet, but, nevertheless, the current course of action is not going to help the Iranian establishment either.
They are pushing people towards a more vigilant approach to the Internet.
They are telling people go learn how to use a VPN, and I foresee that being exactly what is going to happen.
A Facebook campaign has launched to call for Internet freedom and the right to access Google.
Mana Neyestani's cartoon (right) on Google being filtered is eye-catching on this Facebook page.
Several Iranian netizens also tweeted about the filtering with irony.
Behran Tajdin tweeted :
@Behrang: This public who requested Google filtering, did they not have gmail accounts?
If they had, what do they use them for?
Saye Roshan tweeted :
@sayeeeeh: We blocked Gmail and Google, we brought up the rate for the dollar, I doubt we can make life harder for the USA with these actions.
In reality the primary victim in this decision is not Google, but the freedom of Iranians.
It seems even virtual freedoms are too much for the Islamic regime.
Proscovia Alengot Oromait has become Africa's youngest Member of Paliament (MP) at the age of 19, after she won the Usuk county election with 11,059 votes.
The outspoken youngster replaces her father who died earlier this year.
Alengot is a member of National Resistance Movement, headed by President Yoweri Museveni.
Many people have come out to congratulate her, whilst some are saying she will not survive her term in parliament because of her age and limited experience.
Some people believe this is the beginning of change in Africa and its time to get rid of the overly old leaders and allow young people to take the continent forward.
Hon. Alengot's area faces challenges of clean water, electricity and poor roads among others.
For now the people of Usuk have their hopes pinned on the 19 year-old MP.
Hopefully, she will be in position to represent her area and develop it.

Joy Doreen Biira requests someone to teach Ms Alomait the basics she needs to learn as an MP:
@JoyDoreenBiira: Alengot Oromait, 19 years old is now a MP in Uganda....
Very Good.
But can someone home-school her on the basics she needs to know else...
Commenting on New Vision website, Agambagye Frank thinks its good that she was elected and believes this is how democracy should be:
thats why democracy is good pple voted her
Commenting on a story on the Monitor website, nkuutu urges advises the MP to concentrate on her studies, as the MP seat can be lost at anytime and she may have to look for a job:
I just have one piece of advice for the hon MP: Don't worry, be happy.
This might be the only time in your life to shine!
Come next elections ....who knows.
Don't forget your day job ...I mean your studies.
No one will give you a job with a CV with ex-MP but no qualification.
Anyone can be an MP, but not everyone is educated.
Congrats!!
ProWoman thinks people are treating Ms Alengot like a baby.
She goes on to tell them to let her think for herself because she is an adult:
Proscovia does not need too much advice.
You guys are treating her like a baby.
At 19 she's an adult.
Why is every man trying to be a parent to her?
Leave this young woman alone to think critically for herself.
It seems that there are too many cooks around.
Proscovia actually has the figure of Michelle Obama.
Tall, athletic, beautiful and confident.
Michelle the first Black US first lady did not need too much advice on how to be a first Black first lady in the White House.
Congratulations to Proscovia!
Proscovia Alengot was sworn in on Thursday 20, September, 2012.
She is the youngest and first female teenage Member of Parliament in Africa.
Monday's official confirmation of Ethiopia’s Prime Minster Meles Zenawi's death, sparked reactions among social media users in Tanzania, especially after tweets started appearing from what some thought was Zenawi's official Twitter account.
In all started when Zitto Zuberi Kabwe, a Member of Parliament from Tanzania, sent this tweet:
@zittokabwe: My condolences to the people of #Ethiopia following the death of Prime Minister #MelesZenawi Hope for a democratic developmental Abbysinia
Chambi Chachage tweeted a blog post titled ‘Meles Zenawi's Farewell to Young African Leaders' from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on 16 November 2006, which was retweeted by others. And then suddenly @PMMelesZenawi intervened, apparently 'tweeting after death' to Tanzania's Member of Parliament Zitto Kabwe:
@PMMelesZenawi: @zittokabwe please be better than I was.
Not fun up here I am preparing 2 pay for some of this http://www.ethiopianreview.net/index/?p=42267
Meles Zenawi ‏@PMMelesZenawi - tweeting after death.
Source: Twitter Screen Shot
This tweet to Zitto Kabwe, who has more than 29,000 followers, caused a stir, setting off speculation- was ‏@PMMelesZenawi hacked by opponents?
@zittokabwe: @hmgeleka this account seems not to be genuine of recent @pmmeleszenawi
Zitto Zuberi Kabwe concluded, and continued:
@zittokabwe: @AnnieTANZANIA tweets by @PMMelesZenawi not genuine.
Account hacked by his opponents
Omar Ilyas backed it:
However, the debate on Meles Zenawi’s legacy continued ranging from both admiration for Meles ability to ‘get the job done’ to the widespread awareness that Meles was not a democrat:
@Htunga: @zittokabwe Who is Meles seriously?I see Ethiopians starving n dying in lorries..I remember the shooting in 2010 too.
@zittokabwe: @Htunga were Tanzanians not starving and dying during Nyerere?
But we celebrate him because of his principles.
Meles the same’ @zittokabwe: @PMMelesZenawi regardless of his mistakes, #MelesZenawi remains a role model to me.
You have freedom to bring back #TheDerg or Isaias
The fake (supposedly hacked) @PMMelesZenawi Twitter account, which managed to set off the debate mentioned above, also raises the question of why many public figures and politicians in Africa haven’t had their Twitter accounts verified.
Reportedly, in many cases Twitter takes too long, or simply never respond to requests for verifying accounts.
Twitter is extremely popular in Tanzania as a tool for exchanging views and debate and also as a platform for breaking news.
Twitter, however, can easily be abused as in @PMMelesZenawi case, and can also cause confusion and suspicion with regard to authenticity and reliability of sources.
Other fake, hacked or parody African Twitter profiles at present are:@Hailemdesalegne, @Julius_S_Malema, @kabwezitto, @alfredmutua and @MwaiKibaki
Meles Zenawi was President of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995 and later became the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in 1995 following the general elections that year.
Hibiscus is a Global Voices project designed to amplify Sino-Africa conversations taking place online and create dialogue about the relationship between China and Africa, specifically encouraging conversations between bloggers in both regions and those outside the region who write about the China-Africa relationship.
Chinese interest and presence in Africa has increased rapidly in the last few years and the country has become Africa's largest trading partner.
Trade between China and Africa increased by more than 22 percent year-over-year to $80.5 billion in the first five months of 2012, writes Mike King quoting figures from China’s Ministry of Commerce.

Below are some of interesting stories that Deborah Brautigam has written about the Chinese presence in Africa.
Learning Chinese in Zambia':
A growing number of students are producing really first rate field research on China in Africa.
I recently read the M.A. thesis of Arwen Hoogenbosch
Arwen spent several months doing participant observation, enrolled in a Chinese language school in Zambia
(which has both a Confucius Institute and a private-for-profit Chinese language school).
He got to know his fellow students, and reports on their varied goals and hopes for learning Chinese.
She continues:
Arwen's analysis of the motives for Zambians to study Chinese is thoughtful.
Some thought it would advance their job prospects, although Arwen writes: it appears that Chinese companies prefer Chinese skilled employees.
I think there is a lot more potential for Africans who speak Chinese than perhaps Arwen does.
I'm current in Ethiopia and seeing some fascinating examples of Chinese companies employing Ethiopians at a high management level.
Kenyan Traders Protest Against Chinese Competitors':
The proliferation of Chinese traders in African markets is one of the perinneal sore spots in China-Africa relations.
This video highlights the recent protests in Nairobi where African traders fear and resent the competition.
Consumers generally welcome the expansion of products at lower cost, but frequently complain about the low quality of cheap goods.
On the plus side: cheap Chinese cell phone have allowed Africans at the bottom of the pyramid to communicate in unexpectedly large numbers.
None of these products need to be sold by Chinese, of course.
As I've noted in this blog, thousands of African traders visit Chinese cities and export directly from China to their home markets.
The YouTube video below posted by NTVKenya on August 16, 2012, shows Kenyan traders protesting against Chinese traders:
Zombie Chinese Land Grabs in Africa Rise Again in New Database!':
Last week, the new Land Matrix land grab database was released at a big World Bank conference on land.
The Land Matrix project is an international partnership involving five major European research centres and 40 civil society and research groups from around the world.
On paper, they have a strong methodology and very strict criteria about projects that are to be included.
But in practice, they seem to violate their own rules routinely, at least when it comes to Chinese projects in Africa.
She goes on to list Chinese zombie land grabs in Africa:
I understand there is a lot of Chinese land investment in Asia, especially in Cambodia and Laos.
I don't know the Asia cases, but when the database was made public, I checked the China-Africa cases in the online database, which supposedly only lists the cases that have passed their robust fact-checking process (which apparently involves checking to see if another NGO has published a link to a media report on an alleged case).
I was interested to see which Zombie Chinese projects (i.e. dead projects, or projects that in fact never had any life to them at all!) are in their database as confirmed.
Here is a sample:
(2) ABSA Biofuels 30,200 ha in Ethiopia.
Huh?
This proposed joint venture is not Chinese but South African-Chinese-Ethiopian, and was listed in an Ethiopian database in 2008 as in the pre-implementation phase.
It has never been implemented.
(5) Zimbabawe 101,170 ha irrigated maize project.
I've written about this countless times.
It was a construction contract given to a Chinese company by the Zimbabwe government, not a Chinese investment.
They were not paid.
They went home.
The land never ended up being developed.
This all happened almost ten years ago, in 2003 for Pete's sake!
Africa's Free Press Problem: Is China Causing It?':
Keita's piece makes a lot of good points.
Investigative reporters have a very tough road in many parts of Africa and there are many examples of courage under impossibly tough conditions.
However, his opinion oversteps his evidence in linking increased Chinese economic activity in Africa with increased repression of the media.
Asking Why this disturbing trend? (of media repression) Keita points to (inter alia) the influence of China, which surpassed the West as Africa’s largest trading partner in 2009.
As an example of this causal linkage, Keita wrote: The volume of trade between Rwanda and China increased fivefold between 2005 and 2009. During the same period, the government has eviscerated virtually all critical press and opposition and has begun filtering Rwandan dissident news Web sites based abroad.
She agrees with Keita about Chinese technical and media ties with African government:
Keita actually does make a good point in his observation that with growing trade, China has been deepening technical and media ties with African governments to counter the kind of critical press coverage that both parties demonize as neocolonialist.
Rather than training African reporters to be like Xinhua reporters, the Chinese goal in stepping up training and PR activities is to present a different picture of Chinese activities in Africa to counter the negative reporting eminating from the West.
The establishment of modern China-Africa relations dates back to the late 1950s when China signed the first official bilateral trade agreement with Algeria, Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Morocco and Sudan.
However, ancient China-Africa relations date back as far as 202 BC and AD 220.
Lebanon now boasts a Virtual Museum of Censorship, an online database of censorship cases in Lebanon since the 1940s.
The website was launched by Lebanese organization MARCH to draw attention to information kept away from people.
On September 2, 2012, the day the Museum of Censorship was launched, MARCH said:
WELCOME TO THE VIRTUAL MUSEUM OF CENSORSHIP IN LEBANON !
Ever wondered WHAT was censored in Lebanon, WHEN, and particularly WHY?
You have come to the right place.
Here, you will be able to look up material that was censored since the 1940's !
Heard of something that is being censored, is under the threat of being censored or has been censored in the past that we have missed/failed to spot?
Feel free to report it in order to complete the database.
Netizens can report censored movies, music, theater pieces, books, print and audiovisual content from 1940s to date on the website.
They are required to give the name of the censored work, the censorship date, entity and reason.
For instance, Charlie Chaplin's Great Dictator was banned in 1940 for its anti-Nazi views.
While, in 1990 LBC International received threats from the National Audiovisual Media Council to suspend its transmission over the broadcast of an interview with David Levy, the Israeli foreign Minister at that time.
Who censors in Lebanon?
The Virtual Museum of Censorship lists four main Lebanese censorship entities:
General Security: Licensing, Monitoring, Censoring creative works
Provides licenses to publish for periodical publications
May suspend a TV channel for a maximum period of 3 days
Can censor cinematic works from the preliminary stage of the censorship process, along with the General Security
The special administrative committee: In the case that General Security finds what it considers enough cause to prevent part or all of the film from being screened, a decision shall be made by the committee according to a majority vote of its member to allow the film to be screened as it is, to edit certain parts of the film or to ban the film from being screened altogether.
The final decision shall officially be issued by the Ministry of Interior, alone.
The National Audiovisual Media Council:The Council has become a media watchdog.
Censorship motives
In Lebanon, censorship practices are either politically, religiously or morally motivated.
The Virtual Museum of Censorship explains:
Political reasons: regarding foreign relations with friendly countries, the censor pays considerable attention to the political sensitivities of Arab regimes and endeavors to safeguard diplomatic relations with these countries as well as banning attacks on the Palestinian cause and Arabs in general.
Films on the civil war have been routinely censored since the nineties on the basis that referring to the conflict threatens civil peace”.
Israel: regarding relations with enemy states, censorship is firstly based on a national law that calls for the boycott of all Israeli products.
Secondly, there is censorship of all forms of publicity or compassion for Israel : this boycott was initially observed by the entire Arab League.
Today, only Lebanon and Syria adhere to it stringently(...)
Religion: General Security will send creative works it thinks might upset religious sensitivities to their respective governing bodies (usually the Catholic Information Center or the Dar-al-Fatwa, which is Lebanon’s highest Sunni Muslim authority).
Scenes or topics that question the ability of religion to counter evil and offensive scenes are removed.
Obscene and Immoral content: regarding censorship material which offends public morals, contains scenes of nudity, sex and foul language are strictly censored and the censor generally determines the extent to which the film or work does not offend public morals.
Also, works that promote homosexuality are prohibited but violent scenes or scenes depicting drug use are allowed.
Twitter reactions
On Twitter, the initiative was welcomed:
@SultanAlQassemi: This is a brilliant idea: The Virtual Museum of Censorship (Lebanon) censorshiplebanon.org via @Sandmonkey Every Gulf state needs one
@ramseygeorge: This is fantastic
Can democracy exist in Islamic societies?
This was the topic of conversation between Bahraini bloggers today.
Bahraini artist Al Shaikh raised the issue when he tweeted :
@Anas_Al_Shaikh: It is difficult to separate between what is political and what is religious in Islamic societies and this is why democracy will never succeed even if we write the best constitutions and accept the peaceful rotation of power
Fearless Ba7rainia replies:
@fearlessbahrain: Democracy is the solution and the remedy for such problems. If laws are developed, people will improve too in a natural way.
A civil society is our people's savior
Bahraini journalist Abbas Busafwan has another take. He responds to Al Shaikh's original tweet saying:
@abbasbusafwan: This conclusion is really painful. It could be a generalisation.
Perhaps Turkey's example is a success
Al Shaikh answers:
@Anas_Al_Shaikh: Turkey did not balance between religious and political issues.
For instance, Turkey has rights for gays, and I saw them myself protesting on the famous Taksim street
And Ahmed Al-haddad adds:
@DiabloHaddad: Turkey isn't today what it was during the rule of Ataturk. The famous Erdogan took Turkey to the pre-Ataturk era
In reply, Busafwan jokes:
@abbasbusafwan: I think that Saudi Arabia is the best example of democracy, Shura, Human rights, free Press, and balancing between religion and politics
Abu Yousif agrees that politics and religion don't mix:
@xronos2: I agree. We shouldn't mix religion with politics for they don't agree and then we would become a repressive regime like Iran
And Abu Karim says we should improve what we already have instead of importing a Western-style democracy:
@AbuKarim1: Our problem is that we want to implement Western theories on our societies instead of searching in what we have and modernising it
Lightening the skin is a common practice in Africa where the sale of skin lightening products is legal in many countries.
However, the use of these creams is not safe: stretch marks, pimples, hair, hypertension and diabetes are all risks user take.
In Senegal, a whitening product named Khess Petch is creating controversy on the web.
Kiné Fatim Diop explains in 'A whiter skin in 15 days':
Completely white, is how one translates the Wolof expression Khess Petch, the name of a new cream supposedly with skin whitening qualities.
Amadou Bakhaw DIAW on the site Ndarinfo, writes in 'The Khess Petch campaign, an insult to our identity':
Twenty days ago, a new product called Khess Petch appeared in the Dakar greater area, on more than 100 billboards of 12 square meters each.
With her blog post, 'A very clear skin at any cost: Understanding the phenomena in Africa', Carole Ouédraogo on the website NextAfrique explains that this phenomenon is common in many African countries:
The researchers estimate that roughly 25 % of women in Bamako, Mali use the skin lightening products... in South Africa 35% ... in Senegal 52% ...
And she adds:
Women in Senegal associate light skin with beauty, elegance and high social status.
On the blog A Toubab in Dakar, a blog post entitled 'The Xessalisation a.k.a the stupid quest for whiteness' tries to answer the question Why whiten your skin?:
Some believe that Senegalese man love clear skin, so somewomen whiten their skin to please them.
Other talk of aninferiority complex …
Blogger Fatou on Blackbeautybag goes further in his post 'Skin Whitening: Practices, Challenges and Accoutability':
These issues are related to sequels from slavery and colonialism.
From a psychological point of view, the past has left its mark on many people.
Remarks like: YOU ARE BLACK AS THE NIGHT, IF YOU ARE TOO BLACK, NO MAN WILL WANT YOU, and the list goes on and on...
One of the first counters from the blogger community is explained by Kiné Fatim Diop:
Rapidly, a citizen awareness project exposing the risks of the cream grew on social networks.
Launched online on the 8 September, a petition calling for the Ministry of Health to put a halt to the advertising campaign, gathered more than 1,000 signatures in four days.
@K_Sociial on Twitter mused:
@K_Sociaal: I will soon create : Nioul kouk you will see.
The girls will become blue! ...
Bloggers and infographics designers took the idea to task and organized a counter-campaign: We see your Khess Petch (completely white) campaign and we raise its counter: Nioul Kouk (completely black in wolof).
A student from Hainan University threw his shoe at Maoist commentator Sima Nan on October 7, 2012, to protest against the absence of rights to free speech in China.
Before he threw the shoe, he said, even if your talk is not good, you can go back to your hotel.
If I argue against it, certainly I will be locked up in a tiny dark room.
The student took the action during a Question and Answer session.
Below is a video showing the incident with a brief transcription of the student's remarks:
I am also a student here.
I want to make a few points.
Secondly, I need freedom and democracy is a means to protect freedom. Thirdly, I have to say, your talk against democracy has invaded my freedom. We are not equally able to exercise our freedom of speech.
The four points that you have mentioned, I cannot go against them because of political correctness.
Even if your talk is not good, you can go back to your hotel.
If I argue against it, certainly I will be locked up in a tiny dark room.
Please don't interrupt me.
You should have the manners not to interrupt me.
Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe at you?
As my freedom is harmed in this country, I am here to protect my freedom.
Another student describes the scene in his blog:
The talk started at 7:30. At the beginning Sima Nan kept praising our university headmaster Li Jianbao, he is really good at flattering.
Then he pretended to be very open minded said that he was aware that some people wanted to throw things at him and invited them to throw stuff.
Since he had not started talking, people were not ready to throw things.
Then he promised that he would focus on making four points and leave more time for exchange.
I was too naive to believe him.
His talk was long, boring and full of mistakes.
His four points were: 1.
The party leaders have great achievements; 3. Without the party society would be in chaos; 4.
People's democracy should not be detached from party leadership.
In the middle of his talk, someone tried to enter the hall but was stopped by the security guards.
The climax was unexpected.
Sima Nan finally had enough of his talk after one and a half hours.
The Q & A session started.
In front of me a man dressed in orange sport wear started talking.
His main point was about freedom and equality.
He said: Today we don't have equality in our rights to speak. I have no freedom.
What you have said are politically correct theories. When you are done, you go back to your hotel.
If I argue against that I would be locked up in a tiny dark room (This is all I can remember, sorry).
Then Sima Nan said that it was not a question. The student then replied, Here comes my question, can I throw my shoe?
Then he threw a sports shoe to the stage with determination.
I clapped my hand without being aware of that…
Sima Nan is a Maoist and in the past few years he has kept praising the North Korean model in China to advocate for a stricter approach to foreign policy.
He has also propagated a lot of hate speech against liberals, accusing them of being traitors of the country.
Many have applauded the student's courageous act, but some are also worried about the student's safety.
Below is my pick of the online discussion :
慕容雪村: Sima Nan calls himself an intellectual and upholds Maoist ideology.
He has probably forgotten about the torture and insult intellectuals went though in the Mao Era - they were forced to wear tall hats and rally on the street, beaten by belts with copper locks, forced into labour on cattle farms to reflect upon their wrongs.
Zhang Zhixin had his throat cut, Wang Shiwei was buried in a well after a secret execution.
Lao She and Fu Lei committed suicide… Throwing shoe at him is like a reward.
吴钩1975: Many are debating about the student's act on Weibo.
Some clapped their hands, some criticized the student for infringing other's rights.
We should have some consensus in understanding the nature of throwing shoes.
I don't agree that throwing shoes is an attack.
It is just a form of protest by the weak side in a situation when the power is not equal.
It is quite commonly seen in western countries when people throw eggs at government officials. Don't label the act.
十年砍柴: One should not cheer for the student.
In western countries, throwing eggs and shoes are common forms of expression and the punishment is light.
But in China, the risk is very high.
This time Sima Nan does not have the power to punish the student.
But if other hot blooded students are encouraged and decide to throw shoes at those who have real authority, the price is too huge.
Campus Divas For Rich Men is a Facebook page dedicated to hooking up female Kenyan university students under the age of 26 with rich men of any age.
The page has used the slogan Money can buy us.”
After receiving coverage on Kenya’s radio stations such as Kiss 100, Hot 96 and Classic 105 as well as exclusive coverage by Standard Newspaper, Daily Nation and Kenya’s KTN and K24 television stations; netizens created the following hashtags to discuss the Facebook page and share their opinions about it: #campusdivasforirchmen, #HakunaKituUtafanya (there is nothing to do), #CandidatesBetterThanRomney, #TeamMafisi , #wordszawazito , #Kiss100 and #KOT.

Other netizens took to their blogs and YouTube to either condemn or support this bold move in a predominantly conservative society.
The debate about the page has brought up issue such as social media monitoring, HIV/AIDS, religion and African customs, opportunities for Kenyan youth, poverty, greed and peer pressure among Kenyan university students.
The page which was created on 3rd July 2012, has already garnered 50,684 ‘likes’ with 65,830 visitors talking about it.
Kenyanlist, a Kenyan blogger, points out that:
But Solomonirush says that the page is all but a ploy by some canny netizens to take advantage of young Kenyan students.
The blogger reports:
My investigations reveal that this page, and probably others of the same kind, is administrated by canny people seeking to make money.
I have also seen other pages where dating and sex is the subject of concern, and due to the high number of likes by the audience, they charge to do advertisements on the page.
The cunning administrators expose the young students, who are willing to adventure, into perils of sexual abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and kidnapping.
The social media buzz about the page has led those opposing it to create a Facebook group called Anti-Campus Divas for Rich Men.
A Kenyan blogger, Kenya-post, reports:
The second group, Anti-Campus Divas for Rich Men operates on contrary principles of the first one.
As the first preaches sex, sex, sex and cash, it promotes chastity and encourages young people to abstain.
Whereas the first group rides high with over 20,000 likes in there Facebook page, the Anti- Campus Divas for Rich Men only has 5,000.
Other Facebook pages opposed to Campus Divas For Rich Men include Decent Divas Against Campus Divas for Rich Men and Dislike Campus Divas for Rich Men, Campus Divas For Broke Men With Rich Love.
A number of Kenyans on Twitter have condemned hypocrisy over their reactions and stated that Kenyans need to vote for leaders who will increase the Higher Education Loans Board Allowance for less well off partners to be able to date the girls:
@clansewe: To all Kenyans railing against the 'Campus Divas for Rich Men page, stop your hypocrisy.
We all Kenyans have put cash above everything!
@kevoice: We will vote 4 leaders who will increase the HELB allowance so that we can be able to date Campus Divas 4 Rich Men. #TujipangeKisiasa
@mwendembae: @lionsroar101 So now there is a fb page called anti-campus divas for rich men.
Ha, I'm amused.”was bound to happen #idlers
@thatguydavy: Campus divas for rich men......and you wonder why hurricanes are named after women!
@mpalele: The sad part abt this Campus Divas for Rich Men is that they think 50K , coffee java and a trip 2 naivasha is the definition of a rich man.
@rmresh: Campus Divas For Rich Men....desparation at its best.... @nochiel: @savvykenya Please be warned that the abhorrent Campus Divas For Rich Men page is using your old profile pic
KTN Kenya, a television station in Kenya, used the YouTube platform to portray the Facebook page as a prostitution ring and campus students interviewed say that this is nothing out of the ordinary:
Campus Divas For Rich Men is so far the boldest move in discussing matters involving Kenyan youth and sexuality openly in such a traditionally conservative society.

After witnessing its biggest protest, the anonymous organizers of the Dignity March called for another one.
Tens of thousands showed up in the areas of Mishref and Sabah Al-Salem protesting the Kuwaiti ruler's amendment of the voting law, which now allows a citizen to vote for one candidate instead of four.
Protesters did not find the Amir's decree constitutional and believe the new law is made to play with the coming elections in December and to weaken the opposition that won most of the parliament's seats earlier this year.
Like the previous march, Sunday's protest witnessed smoke and tear gas bombs and several arrests of protesters, who were later released.
Who is leading the protests?
In the past few years, protests were criticized because they were led by opposition MPs.
Lately, the youth tried to be the leaders of those protests. This shift got bigger numbers to show up for those dignity marches.
What is interesting though is that an anonymous Twitter account is the one deciding dates of both marches and the meeting points.
The account @KarametWatan tweeted a message on the 24th of October to Twitter not to revel their identity to the Kuwaiti authorities:
We the people of Kuwait ask you to protect the privacy of our account details of @karametwatan from all/any officials seeking the information of the owners and/or IP addresses of the persons using and posting from the mentioned account.
We are responsible for the organization of a march called Dignity of a Nation in Kuwait, the largest ever march in the history of Kuwait calling for democracy, human rights, and fight against corruption.
The turn-out reached over 150,000 (around 11.5% of citizens of Kuwait) that stunned the government.
In return the government ordered their forces to attack the peaceful demonstration in a brutal manner that was never been seen before for no reason.
Over 100 people were injured and over 50 were detained in an unlawful manner.
We do not feel safe and your protection of our privacy is pivotal.
In a comment on having a Twitter account organizing those major marches, Hamad Al-Sabah wrote:
@hmalsabah: Am I the only one that is uneasy about the fact that thousands of people in #Kuwait are obeying the commands of some anonymous Twitter acct?
Should Bahrainis support Kuwaitis?
Considering the sectarian remarks and support of Kuwaiti opposition figures for the Bahraini regime against the February 14th revolution, the Shia of Kuwait do not want to protest next to the opposition.
This, in result, influenced the Shia of Bahrain and started a discussion on whether Bahrainis should or should not support Kuwaiti marches.
In comment on this topic, Bahraini Human Rights Defender Maryam AlKhawaja wrote:
@MARYAMALKHAWAJA: yes, i support anyone with righteous demands regardless of whether they support mine or not.
@MARYAMALKHAWAJA: there r many of whom supported the bahrain protests who r taking part in the kuwaiti protests as well. but thats not the point
Another Bahraini activist, Ahmed Al-haddad, from the European-Bahraini Organization for Human Rights wrote :
@DiabloHaddad: If you think you have the right to consider the Kuwaiti struggle as of Muslim Brotherhood and sectarian, then others have the right to consider yours as Shia and sectarian too.
Other objections
Aside from the sectarian conflict, there were others who showed objection to the current protests.
Hamad Al-Sabah, who thinks the coming parliament can solve this crisis instead of protests, tweeted:
@hmalsabah: Let me reiterate that I believe that the protesters have a just cause, but I don't support their methods.
It can easily be solved peacefully
In reply, Fawaz Al-Matroud wrote: @FawazAM: people often mistake mob rule and political freedom.
Just because lots of people break the law together, doesn't make them right.
@HisHersQ8: The Amir has a point when it came to illegal protests.
Democracies all around the world stops any illegal protests

Did Jordanians crackdown on Kuwaitis?
Weeks ago, an anonymous Twitter user named Mujtahidd tweeted about Jordan sending troops to repress Kuwaiti protesters.
The popular and controversial Twitter user got Salafi MP Walid AlTabtabai to tweet the news.
Yesterday, in the protest, former MP and opposition frontman Musalam Al-Barrak gave a controversial speech.
The MP was jailed last week for defaming the Amir but got released in two days due to the big protests that took place in his support.
In this video, Al-Barrak says: Security men are our brothers. If they beat you, do not react. But if they are Jordanian or Palestinian security men, then we will step on them.
In reaction, Jordan's foreign ministry made a statement denying the accusations.
The Amir's reply
Ethiopia was among four African countries that were elected as members of the United Nations Human Rights Council on 12 November, 2012.
Other countries that were elected for a three-year term are Argentina, Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire, Estonia, Gabon, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Venezuela.
However, Ethiopia’s election to Human Rights Council did not go down well with most Ethiopians.
Writing about the election the Ethiopian satirist Abe Tokichaw wrote in Amharic :
Ethiopian blogger and journalist Eskinder Nega was sentenced to 18 years in jail with 23 other activists on On 13 July, 2012.

Ethiopia has been elected to be a member the United Nations Human Rights Council.
Which Ethiopia?
Which Human Right?
Which United Nations Human Rights Council?
Is it not worrisome that an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture is not shared by our government?
If our government had any Ethiopian sense of discomfiture, they would have rejected when they got elected as a member the United Nations Human Rights Council!
They would have admitted that the Ethiopian government would not fit in the Human Rights Council but our government never had an Ethiopian sense of discomfiture and accepted the membership to United Nations Human Rights Council gladly!
They even went on to declare that the Ethiopian government has a good human right record!
Zerihun Tesfaye, an exiled journalist and blogger, described the conundrum of Ethiopia’s election in an extended Amharic note on Facebook:
Let me chant, I can’t, I can’t as she has forgotten my cause!
Says a local songster.
I find it easy to join this local songster and chant with him when we fall upon international organizations and governments who deafen their ears to our cause!
But paradoxically, sometimes international organizations have a better understanding than Ethiopians themselves, about horrendous human right situations in Ethiopia and we feel better as we consider the international community is recognizing our great efforts.
Sometimes we even think the international community is part of the revolution we aspire to in Ethiopia and our hearts fill with joy!
So through journalism we used to report a lot on human rights abuse in Ethiopia.
For instance, if we report fifty innocent Ethiopians are jailed in a famous prison called Kality” some of the international community members correct us with more accurate number (120) of innocent prisoners including their names!
Then we feel these people are with us and hope good things are yet to come!
But when I heard of the news of Ethiopia’s election to the United Nations Human Rights Council last evening, the hymn of our local songster rang a bell!
Are these intergovernmental human rights organizations trying to destroy our optimism?
Or do they think a bad-mannered government will get better when it becomes a member of United Nations Human Rights Council?
Nowadays I feel everybody has become politically correct to everybody!
But the worse thing is still we need their help!
And another concerned netizen, Yohanes Molla, wrote :
There is a local proverb which says: A fool makes a donkey carry red meat and sends her along with a hyena!
So the hyena will chomp through the red meat and later turn on the donkey!
However, when I woke up this morning I could not escape this story!
It keeps coming back to me and makes my day horrific!
So what could better describe Ethiopia’s election to United Nations Human Rights Council other than the proverb I cited above!
Jawar Mohammed wrote a detailed analysis of how Ethiopia secured a seat in the council.
But Daniel Berehane disagreed with those opposing Ethiopia's membership to the council:
I see no anomaly with Ethiopia being elected to the UN Human Rights Council. Both Ethiopia and the Council have good Constitutions.
They both have capacity (political, financial, etc) limitations implementing it.
Perfect match.
Human rights groups have been criticizing Ethiopia as one of the most serious human rights violators in Africa with huge number of dissidents, activists and journalists languishing in jail.
The reports have not been received well by some netizens.
It was in 1896 that Ethiopian forces led by Emperor Menelik II had defeated an Italian army with better contemporary military technology at the Battle of Adwa.
Subsequently, the victorious Emperor had brought in a range of technologies including railway to transform his country.
For his triumph at Adwa and for his endeavor to change Ethiopia in his own ways, a statue in his honor was erected at the center of Addis Ababa called Arada.
The statute of Emperor Menelik II in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Almost forty years later, in 1935, the Italians launched a new but a prearranged military campaign endorsed by their then belligerent leaders.
The Italians managed to have a brief military occupation of Ethiopia but faced a staunch resistance from Ethiopians.
Pope Abune Petros, who was among the first Popes of Ethiopian Orthodox Church, was the leading figure of the resistance in Ethiopia.
The Italians never liked what he was doing as a patriot and tried to stop him.
He was forced to appear before General Rodolfo Graziani to submit and declare the Ethiopian patriots as bandits.
He refused to comply with their demand and condemned the aggressors instead. He asked Ethiopians to struggle for their freedom. Finally, the Italians executed him in public.
As it was done with Emperor Menelik II, a statue of Abune Petros was built at the center of Addis Ababa as reminiscent of his unwavering stand for his country.
However, unconfirmed reports are circulating online that the two iconic statues found on an historical thoroughfare might get wrecked due to an Addid Ababa rail tunnel construction project.
The reports have not been received well by some netizens.
The statute of Pope Abune Petros in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Daniel Kiberet, a blogger who usually write on culture, history and spirituality of Ethiopia, asks :
Will the Addis Ababa rail lines construction destroy the statues of Emperor Menelik II & martybishop Abune Petros?
If the answer to this question is yes, our stance for the rail lines construction would be different!
Our development should not come at the expense of the statues of forefathers of Ethiopia who have given their life for the country!
What we put in for development should reflect on what we already have, it should not destroy what we have.
We might need vehicles but the vehicles should not cut off our feet.
Whether we like it or not Ethiopia is a country with rich history and heritage and these are foundations for our survival and continuation.
So constructing rail lines at the cost of Ethiopia’s iconic figures is like going to a barber shop for hair cut after amputating one’s head!
The project group should think thrice before they decide to demolish these statutes.
Destroying a figure of a man who had built the first railway in Ethiopia a century ago to construct rail lines is a complete sarcasm!
Abush Zekaryas relates an incident related to the recent controversy, which erupted in Italy after a small town east of Rome built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, General Rodolfo Graziani, using public funds.
While some Italians built a memorial to a Fascist military leader, there is a rumor that Ethiopians are set to demolish the iconic statues of Menelik II and Abune Petros!
What an irony - this is the difference and this is the progress!
And Aderegen, an anonymous group of bloggers, posted on their blog :
What we are asking is Why are these kinds of projects not preplanned?
Why are the statues and historical places of our forefathers who have contributed a lot for Ethiopia not given due emphasis during planning?
Or is there a conspiracy against Ethiopia’s history?
However, pro-government media, Fana Broadcasting Corporate, has a self contradictory story on their website denying the iconic statues will be demolished for rail lines construction! :
The rail lines will be contracted without doing any damage to the statues.
However, as the Addis Ababa rail tunnel project passes through the iconic thoroughfare it will momentarily dig up the Abune Petros statue and it will not get anywhere near the statue of Menelik II.
All the rumors revolving around this are baseless.
This is the second time in a year that the Ethiopian government has sparked controversy involving a statue.
Kwame Nkrumah's statue, which was unveiled at the African Union (AU) headquarters, which was built with help of the Chinese government, has also sparked anger amongst Ethiopians as many Ethiopians feel that the country's former leader Haile Selassie also deserved recognition.
It has been three months since Meles Zenawi, the late Ethiopian Prime Minister, was formally declared dead at the age of 57 after months of speculation as to his whereabouts.
However, Meles Zenawi’s ghost shows no sign of loosening its grip over Ethiopians, through his portraits in the streets of Addis Ababa and almost all major cities, towns and rural villages.
As his legacy continues to be discussed in various international mainstream media, Ethiopians have been taking to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to reflect on his legacy.
Discussing unpleasant facts of Zenawi's legacy, Kirubel Teshome wonders why many Ethiopians fail to put Meles Zenawi’s legacy in context on the ground.
Portrait of the late Meles Zenawi at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

I used to wonder about people who bitterly hate Genet Zewde while she was a minister of Education and love Meles, People who hate Bereket Simon and admire Meles, those who detest Ethiopian Television and have kind word for Meles, those who despise Ethiopian Telecom and adore Meles.
Now that he is dead and we are told that he has been the thinker and doer of all the undertakings the country does the past two decades, can you at least have the decency to get of them and blame the man who is behind all these degenerations and denounce the legacy he built?
If he takes all the praise to himself, should he not be entitled to solely take all the blame as well?
On one of major unpleasant chapters in Zenawi's legacy, Abiye Teklemariam writes:
An Ethiopian court just convicted Bekele Garba, Olbana Lellisa and others of committing acts of terrorism.
This is the country we have, this is the country we have!
I am sure many of the people who were singing the praises of our late PM immediately after his death doesn’t even know who these people are.
However, some consider Meles Zenawi a visionary leader and believe that his legacy should be maintained. In a Facebook post, Jossy Romanat recounts a conversation he had about the legacy of Meles Zenawi with his friend: A Sunday conversation between Me and My Friend (MF).
MF: Do you think PM.
Meles Zenawi was a great leader?
ME: Yes indeed!
He was a great leader and probably the best Ethiopia has seen so far.
However, this doesn’t mean he wasn’t irreplaceable, as you always believe. MF:- If you think PM.
Meles was a great leader, do you support the idea of naming different institutions after his name?
Like the renaissance dam” to be named Meles Zenawi dam” and his image to be featured on the 100 Birr bill ?
ME: - There is no problem with naming things after a great leader at all.
For example, I was happy to see that Mekelle University named its new camps in Quiha as Meles Zenawi Institute of Technology” I also heard the same story from Jigjiga University.
And then, it seems many Universities, offices, towns and villages are busy naming whatever thing they have after Meles.
It sounds like they are in completion as to who wins the game” of the day well, and this could go beyond the limit.
For example, yesterday I heard that one of the oldest high schools in Tigray (which was named after one of the past Ethiopian heroes) has been changed to Meles Zenawi high school” – If this is true, it is ridiculous and disrespecting PM. Meles.
Besides, don’t we have other local heroes who should be recognized at the local level, at least?
Can’t we just give whatever we want for the new ones and keep the old ones as they are.
Regarding the renaissance dam, well I believe it is appropriate to name the dam after Meles as it is believed to be one of his ambitious plans and had full energy and commitment for its accomplishment.
But then, I fear that this could be against Meles’s belief because when he decided to name the dam renaissance dam” he probably had a good reason for that.
But still completely in support of the idea of Meles Zenawi Dam”.
As to featuring Meles’s image on any of the Ethiopia banknotes/bills, I do not think it is a good idea.
The Ethiopian ruling party, EPRDF, has had to endure an endless censure for using the name and pictures of Meles Zenawi to unite the country under his vision.
However, some people feel that the party is abusing the late leader to the maximum.
In an open memo, Kirubel Teshome asks the widow of Meles Zenawi to stop cheap adoration of her dead husband:
Open memo to W/ro Azeb Mesfin: Can you please, please, please, tell the Addis Ababa .A city administration to stop violating the wish of the late PM. You openly told Ethiopians and the world that Meles was not a kind of person that indulges individual fame or cult.
You revealed how he would have disliked to see all this images of him being a wall paper of the city.
I am sure, by now, you may have noticed how the city administration have been relentless in advancing against his legacy by painting the town with pictures of the late PM.
I wonder why they dont wish to let him have peace at least on his death?
It is also against his legacy to see cleaner and greener Addis.
Can you please call for the immediate collection of his images from the walls, fences and buildings of Addis?
It would be a favor that the people of Addis will not forget!
Since his death, the late prime minister has been praised for the economic growth Ethiopia has claimed to have recorded over the past two decades.
By the same token, he has also been criticized for jailing political activists and journalists, using vaguely defined terrorism offenses.
Ethiopians across the world are celebrating TeamEthiopia, their national Soccer team, who fought a hard draw against defending champions Zambia in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in Nelspruit, South Africa.
Besides the beauty of the Ethiopian game and the composure the players showed after a long absence from the AFCON tournament, Ethiopian politics was at the centre of online discussion.
Ethiopian fans in the stadium displayed various placards and flags representing different political interests.

In a bid to create a sense of deja vu for Ethiopians the blog Addis Rumble published a few historical photos from old AFCON tournaments in which Ethiopia had participated.
In the pictorial post titled, The Ethiopian comeback it wrote:
This week Ethiopia is making a surprise comeback at the 2013 Cup of Nations in South Africa after knocking out neighboring rivals Sudan through an aggregate 5-5 draw in the final qualification round.
In the days after the qualification was secured in October last year, Addis seemed like a transformed city.
Previously you would hardly notice any football celebrations in the cityscape (other than of the usual English Premier League teams) but following the qualification most of the capital’s blue taxis and mini-buses – usually the best way of distilling public opinion – started displaying posters of the national team with a ‘Yes We Can’ text added.
The occasion was also packed with interesting Ethiopian political tidbits.
Mohamed Ademo, a blogger based in New York wrote on Facebook about how different groups stood behind one team despite their variation on the political and cultural spectrum:
Sport brings people together.
The cheerful Oromo crowd in South Africa today is a good example of that.
In the states, rarely do we see both sides (Oromo and other Ethiopians) cheering for the same team.
We have separate sporting tournaments and federations.
For Ethiopia's football fans in South Africa, the choice today was between OLF flag, the defacto Oromo flag, and the EPRDF (Ethiopia's ruling party) flag.
As you have said so eloquently, whether the Oromo and non-Oromo fans of Team Ethiopia displayed different flags didn't matter. They both supported one team.
For far too long, at international sporting events and bazaars, a monolithic image of Ethiopia have been presented to the world.
An Ethiopia with 3000 years of history that is still a christian island, has one flag, and speaks only Amharic.
But in reality, Ethiopia is a truly diverse nation with divergent aspirations and historical experiences.
As a result, contending national sentiments (isms) have emerged.
Under previous Ethiopian regimes, for example, the use of Afan Oromo in public spaces and government offices was banned.
In EPRDF's Ethiopia, while linguistic and cultural rights are - at least in theory - respected, wearing or displaying an OLF flag amounts to an act of terrorism.
What you saw today (the bitching and moaning about Oromo flag from those who still want to control the narrative of Ethiopia) is an extension of that false sense of unity.
I concur with you that, at the absence of national consensus, the way forward is to recognize our differences and respect people's rights to identify however they see fit.
In the same vein, our Oromo activists should also stop pouncing on every chance to question the nationalism of those who are passionate football fans - and chose to look beyond politics.
All the while, it's imperative to stay civil and use this opportune moment to ask: who is Ethiopian, what's the Ethiopian identity, does the EPRDF flag represent the aspirations of the diverse people of Ethiopia, does waving OLF flag automatically make one a secessionist, why do Oromos love the OLF flag, why are non-Oromo Ethiopians so scared of assertive Oromo nationalism etc.

On Twitter, under the hashtags of #TeamEthiopia and #Eritrea, there was also a great deal of discussion about sport and politics!
Kweschn Media tweeted:
While #Zambia's fans waved only 1 flag, #Ethiopia's side had more than 2 flags.
But for Zerihun it would have been great for Eritreans if Eritrea was still a part of Ethiopia.
Mentioning the alleged failed coup attempt by Eritrean rebel soldiers, he tweeted:
If you hadn't been allowed to secede, you could have enjoyed the game with us :) #Ethiopia makes fun of today's #Eritrea Coup #TeamEthiopia
Ethiopia will face Burkina Faso in the second match of group C of the AFCON tournament while Zambia will play Nigeria.

What is it like to be a student at the Indigenous University of Venezuela ?
Three students from the department of edu-communication recently took part in a workshop led by Rising Voices in order to learn how to take better digital photographs and how to upload and share them on the internet
These three students are part of an effort to showcase this unique university designed to provide an intercultural and experimental form of education to students from Venezuela's indigenous communities.
By accessing the university's satellite connection, which was provided by the government program called Infocentros , the students are able to access the internet to share images of activities, facilities, and the stunning nature that surrounds the 2,000-hectare campus located in the state of Bolívar.
To read more about the university and the workshop held in February 2013, please read the post on the Rising Voices blog.
These are some of the photographs taken by the students and uploaded to the university's Flickr account.

Rosie Alves is a young Angolan blogger and cronista living in Luanda.
The crónica is a Portuguese writing form that is very suited to blogging - originally published in newspapers, they are tales, sometimes true and sometimes fictionalized, that convey a point or a conceit in a very short form. In her blog Sweet Cliché, Alves writes short tales, often about love and intimate encounters.
(Blogspot warns readers of the adult nature of her blog). Here's an excerpt from her most popular recent post Matei o meu amor - I killed my love:
I like to write narrative crónicas - that are sometimes made up only of dialogue. They come very close to short stories.
They are more committed to daily events, that is, banal, common events.
I like to mix things up and explore new territory.
GV: When did you start blogging?
Why do you write?
I decided to blog in 2010.
Writing calms me.
Every time I write, I feel that I am taking a load off of my shoulders.
And my tongue (lol).
For me, it is the best therapy.
GV: You write quite a bit about love, intimacy, and sex.
How are these topics dealt with by Angolan society? Are they taboo?
Is there erotic literature in Angola?
Angolan society is quite conservative in what relates to these themes.
(This explains why, after Spain, Angola is the country that least visits my blog.) There are many taboos in Angola.
In the old days, we could say that it was a question of conservatism.
Now with all of the transformations ongoing in our society, I see no reason for taboos.
I don't know of any erotic literature in Angola (at least published and distributed).
The closest to this that I've read was the work of the poet Paula Tavares 'Ritos de Passagem' (Rites of Passage).
I am used to hearing people say that Angolan society is not prepared for this kind of topic.
That's true, it is not.
And at the rate things are going, it will never be...
GV: Can you tell us what it is like to be a young woman in Luanda?
It hasn't been easy, here there is much discrimination and disrespect for women.
At four years old, I really wanted to read a storybook that my dad gave me, so he took me to a tutor who helped me read and write before I went to primary school.
I would go there every day, with my backpack on my back.
Even up until now, they were the most beautiful moments I've lived.
GV: How would you describe your generation in Angola?
My generation is living through great changes.
It is a very able generation, full of dreamers and people with a lot of potential.
Too bad few really know their own .
On the other hand, we're very competitive, we cannot see those around us and come together for the same cause.
Few know the meaning of the words union and solidarity.
We have more access to information, and even so we act as though we live in the stone age.
In Angola, there's the phrase a young person who does not party is not a young person. Youth today only wants to party. Without generalizing, because of course there are exceptions.
GV: Do you fit into a larger blogging scene in Angola?
I think so.
I have online peers, the Angolan blogosphere grows by the day.
It is where we converse, trade ideas, and experiences.
And not just there, I have peers in other countries around the world.
What should I call him?- Call him love.
GV: Tell us about your writing process.
What are your greatest challenges?
Generally, I pick up my mobile and I begin to write and in less than two hours, I finish. Sometimes I spend two weeks developing a text, and it even really frustrates me.
One of my great challenges, if not the only, is to make the reader find himself/herself in what I write, and I can say that I have achieved that based on the feedback I receive.
GV: Who are your readers, do you know?
How do people react to what you write?
I can say that many people read it.
With that I mean: all ages groups, in the most diverse group of countries.
It is strange, but according to the statistics, the country that most visits my blog is the US.
There are those who have told me they read via Google Translator.
The majority congratulates me, gives me suggestions, and encourages me to carry on.
Obviously there are always those who do not like it or take it the wrong way, I've even been challenged by someone telling me that I should take care with what I write.
GV: What are your aspirations for the future?
I am a person full of dreams, and if I start to recount all of my aspirations here, I will not even finish today.
But one of them, and really special, is to become a cronista in a newspaper or a magazine.
It would be fantastic.
A public service announcement promoting condom use to combat the spread of HIV and other diseases in Kenya was recently pulled from the airwaves after the TV spot caused an uproar among the country's religious leaders.
The advert, which shows a woman advising her married friend to use a condoms while engaging in an extramarital affair, was sponsored by Kenya's health ministry and foreign assistance agencies USAid and UKAid.
The United Nations estimates about 1.6 million people out of the country's population of 41.6 million are living with HIV.
Christian and Muslim clergy condemned the advert as encouraging infidelity.
Despite the advert being pulled from TV, it is still available on YouTube:
The Squared Factor blogger called the public service announcement spot on in a post titled Sikio la kufa halisikii Condom .
The title, which loosely translates to a dying ear does not respond to a condom, is a play on the proverb a dying ear does not respond to medication:
I will not beat around this bush.
And I frown at those clamoring for the recent TV ad titled weka condom mpangoni , to be withdrawn from the airwaves.
The message of this particular ad has unexpectedly tugged at the hem of society’s skirt: if you can’t abstain or commit to one partner, then use a condom if you care about your loved ones.
Caring in this context alluding to avoiding pre marital pregnancies, and contracting STI’s- among them HIV and the related adverse effects it has on the family and society at large.
Kenyans took to Twitter to discuss the TV spot under the #CondomMpangoni hashtag, with many coming out on both sides of the argument.
victor-MUFC (‏@victorbmc) wrote that he didn't like the advert:
‏@victorbmc: That ad is nasty RT @MacOtani: Wow so now that the #CondomMpangoni advert has been removed from our screens we are safe huh?! #SwalaNyeti
Mathias Ndeta (‏@MNdeta) told Kenyans who are against the spot to face up to the truth:
‏@MNdeta: In my opinion the #CondomMpangoni ad should stay put, those against it are just pretenders, let's face the reality.
z' Ghost Buster (‏@TheMumBi) warned:
‏@TheMumBi: We stick our heads in the sand too much.
Amen to the #CondomMpangoni ad ..got us talking about stuff we avoid talking about.
Paul (‏@M45Paul) argued that the decision to pull the advert ended up promoting it even more:
‏@M45Paul: Banning #CondomMpangoni ad is getting it more airtime that it'd have got in normal runs.
Pastor Wa (‏@Pastor_Wa) advised:
‏@Pastor_Wa: And for everyone that watches that ad, your heart must be provoked enough to say, 'I'm better than this' #CondomMpangoni
Kizzy K* (‏@boobykizzy) asked:
‏@boobykizzy: #condommpangoni =>what happend to dignity, morals and the likes? should media be blamed? should we address this issue?
Finally, AverageKenyan (‏@AverageKenyan) noted:
‏@AverageKenyan: #Condommpangoni, we are not in denial, the complex African matrix doesn't support public declaration of infidelity however much it's a reality
Several opposition leaders were arrested in Djibouti, a small, but strategically important country in the Horn of Africa, after demonstrations which followed the February 22, 2013 general elections.
The elections saw yet another victory for the party in power, the People's Rally for Progress.
President Ismail Omar Guelleh, who has ruled since 1999, received 80% of votes cast, leading to allegations of fraud on a massive scale.
The arrests followed the demonstrations about allegations of massive fraud .
According to the Djiboutian League of Human Rights organisation and the International Federation of Human Rights, 90 people were retained in the famously tough Gabode Central Prison.
Arrests were still continuing at the time of writing, April 2013.
Spokesperson for opposition party Union for National Salvation, Daher Ahmed Farah, was sentenced to two months in the same closed prison for calling for rebellion after the election results were announced.
The following video shows fighting in the streets between opposition demonstrators and the police (via Dillipress):
Elections in Djibouti have still not resulted in a real political alternative for power.
Ismaïl Omar Gelleh has been president of the republic since April 9, 1999, and his ideologically conservative party, the People's Rally for Progress, has been in power since the country gained independence.
James Schneider from Think Africa Press has always believed that the elections only gave the appearance of democracy:
His most recent re-election, in 2011, came after he changed the constitution to be allowed to run for a third time; the vote took place without election observers and Guelleh won practically unopposed after the opposition withdrew citing harassment and the unfair nature of the poll Guelleh’s illusion will have worked, at least in the short term: he will still have power but now with the veneer of a parliamentary opposition.
Indeed, many people have much to gain from the electoral illusion.
But sadly, this group is unlikely to include most ordinary Djiboutians.
After all, you cannot improve freedom, development and wellbeing with illusions alone.
The party in power is contesting these allegations of fraud.
Abdi Ismail Hersi, head of the independent National Electoral Commission, has stated that the elections took place in a transparent manner.
The citizens of Djibouti were able to carry out their civic duties in total transparency.
On its facebook page , the opposition party reported that arrests of opposition members were still continuing in the city of Arhiba:
Djibouti may be a country few in the West know about, yet Western foreign policymakers have placed disproportionate emphasis upon the tiny nation as a strategic base for their operations in the Horn of Africa – particularly in combating piracy and the militant Islamists al-Shabaab in Somalia.
Perhaps understandably, considering the higher profile crises on its doorstep, the West has treated Djibouti as little more than a tool in its arsenal – as a military base, launch pad for drone strikes, or venue for regional diplomacy – rather than a situation worth addressing in its own right.
A man dressed in a red dress with a veil on his head was paraded by security forces through the streets of Marivan in the Kurdistan province of Iran on Monday, April 15, 2013.
A local court decided this would be the punishment for three men, reportedly found guilty in domestic disputes.
The exact circumstances are unclear, but the mere idea of this punishment has angered many.
Women in Marivan held a protest against the sentence on Tuesday, saying it is more humiliating to women than it is to the convicted men.
According to one human rights activist, security forces physically attacked protesters .
A video shows women marching through the streets. Shared on the Facebook page 'Kurd Men For Equality'
Online, several Kurdish men have photographed themselves dressed as women as part of a Facebook campaign to say, Being a woman is not an instrument to punish or humiliate anybody.
The photos appear on a Facebook page named Kurd Men for Equality.
To show my solidarity and support to the womanhood and their suffers and torments during the history mostly have done by men . as we have faced recently a stupid judges order to punish a person by putting on him the feminine customs, so it is one of the times that we should gather around each other and condemn this stupidity, brutality and inhumanity against the womanhood; the half of society as well as at least half of the human being on the earth.
I am supporting womanhood by the at least I can do for them.
The Facebook page of the Women's Association of Marivan also condemned the act and wrote :
Security forces dragged a convicted Marvani’s man in the city.
They dressed him as a woman and wished by this act to humiliate him.
The Women's Association of Marivan condemn this action and consider it an insult to women.
Kurdish women protested against this act .
Mohmmad Mostafai, an Iranian lawyer and human rights defender says
Iran’s judiciary has no right to order such punishment which goes against human dignity.
Dressing convicts like women is not something you can find in the laws of the Islamic Republic.
History repeats itself
More than three years ago, Iranian authorities attempted to use the same method of humiliation against a student activist, but failed.
Back then, Iranian authorities claimed that Majid Tavakoli dressed as a woman to escape after delivering a speech in Tehran on Student Day.
However, human rights activists in Iran published a report from an eyewitness saying: All the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of immoral means against student and civil activists in Iran.”
At the time, hundreds of Iranian men photographed themselves dressed as women in hijab to support Tavakoli.
Today, October 26, was the day Saudi activists chose to protest against the driving ban on women in the Kingdom.
As social networks were buzzing under increasing number of reports of women driving across the country, a brilliant a capella remake of Bob Marley's No Woman, No Cry spread at the speed of light, in a sound support of brave women challenging conservative sexist legislation and pseudo-scientific justification of them being prohibited to enjoy freedom of movement:

Blogging Ghana's proposed Social Media Hub.
Photo used with permission.
Internet penetration in Ghana is about 14 percent and has been on the up and up for the last decade as more Ghanaians, especially young people, have hooked up to the web.
As a result, the number of Ghanaians on various social media platforms is also increasing rapidly, and some now see a need for a physical social media hub to facilitate the activities of the many people who use social media or want to learn about it.
Enter Blogging Ghana, the country's largest organization of bloggers and social media enthusiasts with more than 100 members.
The group launched a campaign on January 20, 2014 to establish Ghana's first ever social media hub, explaining on their website:
A physical meeting place, a hub, will go a long way to provide a platform for the experienced bloggers in the organisation to train students and professionals on how to use blogging for creating #MoreStories and use social media to advance their agenda as citizens in Ghana.
Africa on the Blog, a multi-author blog by people of African heritage, which is supported by Babs Saul and Sarah Arrow, explained the history of blogging in Ghana:
The blogging and social media scene in Ghana has improved in the last five years.
The West African country has seen the number of bloggers in the country grow from just a handful in 2005 to several hundreds this year.
This trend was facilitated by a bold step taken by a Swedish blogger who had moved to Ghana some five years ago.
Kajsa Hallberg Adu who is now the Chair of Ghana’s biggest association of bloggers brought all the bloggers who were active online under one roof to discuss their passion.
With time, this small group of internet users decided to introduce blogging and the use of social media tools to many other people who may be interested but just didn’t know how.
This selfish desire to spread such knowledge lead to what has today become the nation’s biggest blogging and social media event.
Edward Amartey-Tagoe, the director of corporate services at Blogging Ghana, also recounted how things were half a decade ago:
Some five years ago, there were only a handful of bloggers in Ghana, since then, bloggers and Internet enthusiasts have been organised under one umbrella body to build capacity, learn and share ideas from one another.
Today, we are an influential organisation with a yearly event and awards ceremony who produce local content online on blogs and on various social media channels.
We want to share our skills and create #morestories!
ENews Ghana published the campaign on their website:
Bloggers in Ghana are creating Ghana’s first Social Media hub for bloggers and social media enthusiasts to meet, interact and share more local content from and we think it will make a great feature on GOOD.
Social Media is growing in Ghana and we (Blogging Ghana) has over the past 5 years been a leader in Ghana.
In 2012, with funding from USAID, UKAID, EU & DANIDA, we used social media to cover Ghana’s elections; raising awareness of the issues and empowering politicians and citizens.
We also in 2013 organised Ghana’s first social media awards which was huge success.
We want to do more and get more Ghanaians to use social media to tell their stories.
We want to overcome the internet and power challenges bloggers face.
We have therefore launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a haven/hub with a co-blogging space to and create the much needed local content.
It makes sense for a social media organization to use our online network and do crowd-sourcing to fulfill our dreams.
We think Ghana in ready for a meeting place for social media enthusiasts and we cannot wait to create #morestories about Ghana for the world to read!
Award-winning blogger Macjordan (@Macjordan) expressed his support for the social media hub on his blog:
BloggingGhana is pleased to launch an Indiegogo campaign towards the creation of a Social Media Hub in Ghana for bloggers and citizen journalists to be trained in Social Media and increase local content creation.
BloggingGhana – Ghana’s largest community/network of bloggers, citizen journalists and social media enthusiasts is reaching out to all and sundry to chip-in and support this worthy cause.
I’m very pleased and honored to be a part of this organization and would appreciate your support in any way.
Are languages free?
Today is the International Mother Language Day, an annual event in UNESCO member states to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism.
This is mostly the international recognition of the Language Movement Day called ‘Ekushey February', which is commemorated in Bangladesh since 1952.
The date of 21st February was chosen in homage to a number of 'language martyrs' from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) who were shot on 21st February 1952 in Dhaka, during public protest.
They were demonstrating to establish their mother language Bangla as a national language along with Urdu, which was chosen as the sole official language in the then newly created Pakistan.
Photo: Shaheed Minar, a solemn and symbolic sculpture erected in the place of the massacre.
The monument is the symbol of Bangladesh Nationalism.
How important is the mother language?
Our mother tongue is more than a language, a soul inside us.
It is an armory of the human mind; an archive of the history.
We invent the world through language.
Mrunalini feats her mother tongue Telugu:
How sweet our languages are, how proud they make us.
How much we miss talking in our mother tongue.
Especially, when we are away from it.”
Ripon Kumar Biswas in Bangladesh watchdog says:
Mother tongue is the language of nature, which is intimately related to the individual because it is structured and upheld by local laws of nature, which structure the physiology of the individual.”
But it is even more than that.
One does not inhabit a country; one inhabits a language.
That is why some times we see nationalism sparking in the world based on languages and language matters!
The freedom of languages in the world:
Thousands of local languages used as the daily means of expression are absent from education systems, the media, publishing and the public domain in general because of state policies.
We learn better in our mother tongue when it is taught in school (Mother tongue Dilemma –UNESCO News letter).
But this is not the case of all minority languages.
476 million of world’s illiterate people speak minority languages and live in countries where children are mostly not taught in their mother language.
From Southern Azerbaijan under Iranian rule BayBak, Voice of a Nation says:
It is more than 80 years that Iranian Fars authority has banned other nationalities language, such as Turks (majority in Iran), Arabs, Baluchs, Turkmens and Kurds.
Every year in 21st of February all nationalities celebrate the International Mother Language Day named by UNESCO.
But as before, of the day of celebration Iranian police will ride on the crowd and will arrest many.
Regarding news from Southern Azerbaijan, preparations for the 21st of February are continuing widely compare to last year.
Also thousands of flyers been spread in Azerbaijan’s major cities.
Capital Tebriz has been well prepared and the time for demonstration been set.”
The Unesco Courier:
Several thousand years old, the Ainu language spoken in northern Japan was dying out due to political pressure from the central government.
At the end of the 20th century, this trend was reversed.
While Ainu’s future is still not guaranteed because it isn’t taught in schools, the resurgence of interest is undeniable.
Sid writes in Picked Politics:
International Mother Language Day deserves celebration in Zambia.
The country has worked hard to establish and maintain political unity over the years.
But as other societies are learning too late, it would be a tragedy if this hard-fought unity should be maintained at the expense of the variety of languages and dialects that have long called these lands home.”
Is your mother tongue facing extinction?
About 27 percent of the world's languages (about 6000) are threatened to be extinct.
The Foundation for Endangered Languages says 83 percent of the world's languages are restricted to single countries, making them more vulnerable to the policies of a single government.
Abhinaba Basu at Geek Gyan says:
A lot of people speaking English natively forget the importance of mother language due to its predominance.
They take their language for granted.
However, each year a bunch of languages become extinct, the latest being Eyak, which got extinct exactly a month ago with the death of Marie Smith Jones the last native Eyak speaking person.
I believe that if we don't actively try to preserve our mother language they will slowly become extinct.
One of the most important things to preserve a language is to ensure that they are better covered by technology.”
Using ICT in Mother Language advocacy:
Citizen media is a great tool to promote own languages.
According to Technorati there are more than 100 million blogs out there.
A previous year’s report show that about 37% blogs are in Japanese followed by English (36%), Chinese (8%), Spanish(3%), Italian (3%), Portuguese (2%), French(2%) among others.
And there are other growing language communities and they will rise eventually.
There are ICT based advocacy sites like Bisharat which promotes research, advocacy, and networking relating to use of African languages in software and web content.

Ethiopians marked April Fools’ Day on Twitter with a steady stream of fake news headlines that imitated the lies of state-owned Ethiopian Television (ETv), the only national TV station in the African country.

The opposition rejected the results and international observers said the election fell short of international standards.
