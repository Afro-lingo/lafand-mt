Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist.
Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.
Kathleen Mpofu — one of Moyo's lawyers — said the journalist will go on trial April 28.
The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding," Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.
It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense."
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media
Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported.
Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.
We just want to see that there's law and order.
If somebody has committed a crime or is percied, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system.
That's our position," Mangwana said.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.
MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial. That is our position throughout till the end of the case.
All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial," Moyo said.
Moyo, a Zimbabwean national, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
Zimbabwe Government Orders Vaccinated Workers Back to Work.
Zimbabwes government has ordered civil servants who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to immediately report for duty after more than a year of working from home, citing a declining in new cases of the virus in the country.
Authorities also announced any government workers without proof of vaccination will be barred from workplaces and face punishments, including a freeze on their salaries.
In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.
Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.
This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off.
In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to," she said.
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.
A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.
So if the Public Service Commission wants to bar civil servants who are not vaccinated, they are in breach of contract and its unacceptable.
Secondly, civil servants have a right to dignity, they have right to make choices.
No one can be forced foreign substances to be inserted into their bodies," he noted.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.
It is something that we are strongly against. We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory that goes around when people are saying we are being forced to be vaccinated.
We really have to get the buy in of people: spread the gospel of vaccines, how they work and then encourage people to get vaccinated and not force them to get vaccinated," he pointed out.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.
Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.
Not because they want to protect themselves, but they want to protect their colleagues at work.
Scientific evidence has it that if you are fully vaccinated it comes with a mild attack.
Why not take up that? There is nothing wrong or sinister about it," he said.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" — an entity with no known legal status.
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.
Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank.
The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk," he added.
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP.
Every state has the right to defend its business assets," he added.
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow.
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee.
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said.
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.
No questions asked
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.
Russia has its interests.
It doesn't ask questions," he added.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions."
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said.
They didn't have what it took to succeed," she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.
If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed," Doxsee said.
If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."
Cyclone Batsirai Weakens After Hitting Madagascar, Floods Feared
Cyclone Batsirai weakened overnight but floods were still expected due to heavy rain after it hit eastern Madagascar with strong winds, the island's meteorological office said Sunday.
Batsirai has weakened," Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening.
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.
But "localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains," it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday.
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.
It reached the island as an "intense tropical cyclone", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP.
The national meteorological office has said it fears "significant and widespread damage."
Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.
He said his office has accommodation sites, food and medical care ready for victims, as well as search and rescue plans already in place.
Very serious threat'
The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present "a very serious threat" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days.
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly tropical storm Ana late last month.
In the eastern coastal town of Vatomandry, more than 200 people were crammed in one room in a Chinese-owned concrete building.
Families slept on mats or mattresses.
Community leader Thierry Louison Leaby lamented the lack of clean water after the water utility company turned off supplies ahead of the cyclone.
People are cooking with dirty water," he said, amid fears of a diarrhea outbreak.
Outside plastic dishes and buckets were placed in a line to catch rainwater dripping from the corrugated roofing sheets.
The government must absolutely help us. We have not been given anything," he said.
Residents who chose to remain in their homes used sandbags and yellow jerrycans to buttress their roofs.
Cyclone still 'dangerous'
Other residents of Vatomandry were stockpiling supplies in preparation for the storm.
We have been stocking up for a week, rice but also grains because with the electricity cuts we cannot keep meat or fish," said Odette Nirina, a 65-year-old hotelier in Vatomandry.
I have also stocked up on coal. Here we are used to cyclones," she told AFP.
Winds of more than 50 kph pummeled Vatomandry on Saturday morning, accompanied by intermittent rain.
The disaster agency said the cyclone was expected to remain "dangerous" as it swept across the large island overnight and in the morning.
Flooding is expected due to excessive rainfall in the east, southeast and central regions of the country, it warned.
The United Nations was ramping up its preparedness with aid agencies, placing rescue aircraft on standby and stockpiling humanitarian supplies.
At least 131,000 people were affected by Ana across Madagascar in late January.
Close to 60 people were killed, mostly in the capital Antananarivo.
That storm also hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, causing dozens of deaths.
The U.N.'s World Food Program pointed to estimates from national authorities that some 595,000 people could be directly affected by Batsirai, and 150,000 more might be displaced due to new landslides and flooding.
The storm poses a risk to at least 4.4 million people in one way or another, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.
US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.
Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee.
If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people," he said.
For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time.
The more you preach, the better for them," he said.
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.
Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church," Abanulo said.
They love to sing, they love to dance.
The liturgy can last for two hours.
They don't worry about that."
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church.
As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica.
Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.
They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us," he said.
Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region.
There, the seminaries are "fairly full," said the Rev.
Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church falling numbers.
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership.
What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country," Gaunt said.
Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center.
This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama.
His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line.
After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.
He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories," said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988.
For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. "There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that.
… It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict," she said.
It's a lot different now."
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate paster in the Diocese of Oakland, Califonia, where his ministry focused on the fast growing Nigerian Catholic Community.
Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.
Culture shocks
When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, "Where is West Virginia?"
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.
What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country," Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004.
Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and "rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank.
… She thought I was dirty." Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming.
She's now a U.S. citizen and says,
It feels like home."
One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall.
I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world," she said.
Now I love it.
I do my meditations to that."
During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.
For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation.
She recalled thinking, "Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine."
She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.
Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve.
To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.
Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.
People were telling me 'Father, don't go there.
The people there are rednecks,'" he said.
But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, "There are no rednecks here.
All I see are Jesus necks."
US to Lift Travel Ban on 8 Southern African Countries
The U.S. will lift travel restrictions to eight southern African countries on New Year's Eve, the White House announced Friday.
The restrictions, imposed last month, were meant to blunt the spread of the COVID omicron variant.
The Nov. 29 ban barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who had recently been in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said on Twitter that the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Munoz said the temporary travel bans bought scientists necessary time to study the new virus variant and conclude that the current vaccinations are effective in blunting its impact.
Omicron is now spreading rapidly throughout the U.S., including among the vaccinated, but a huge majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated.
The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron," Munoz wrote on Twitter.
Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas.
But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.
Many countries have been eager for the investment, but mounting levels of debt over the past five years are raising doubts about the long-term prospects for more expensive infrastructure projects.
China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down.
Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.
The research looks at loan commitments which get "disbursed to borrowers as projects are implemented."
In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.
Uganda now owes China $200 million for its only international airport, fanning fears that China could seize it.
Both countries have rejected speculation in African media outlets of a Chinese takeover.
Loan repayment measures Neighboring Kenya had received a $4.5 billion loan to build a railway from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, and China indicates it will redo the terms after a committee of the African countrys parliament found that operating losses and debt to Chinese banks were straining taxpayers.
Some analysts have warned that opaque lending terms means China could eventually seize infrastructure should countries struggle to meet repayments
U.S. and British officials say, "debt traps," where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time.
Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire "significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera."
Sri Lanka earlier this year passed legislation that critics say will give China control over a key deep-water port that Beijing financed.
But that has not happened so far in Africa, where Chinese diplomats reject seizures are a part of Beijings strategy.
Not a single project in Africa has ever been "confiscated" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans.
On the contrary, China firmly supports and is willing to continue our efforts to improve Africa's capacity for home-driven development," stated the Chinese Embassy in Uganda.
Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA.
Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms.
China will probably "keep kicking the can down the road" until creditors find the means to settle the loans, Bulelani Jili, an African studies Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, told VOA.
To confiscate any assets, including minerals, would "confirm peoples initial biases of China as a neocolonial actor," Jili said, and risk upsetting diplomatic ties with "some of the few friends that China has on the global stage."
From the China side, its about getting access to new possible markets and expanding both economic activity — also the diplomatic relation," he said.
Chinese loan concerns
China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.
It is trying to "equal the U.S." as a donor country, he said.
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.
Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as "no strings attached," which has been attractive for many countries.
But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.
China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another," wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article.
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.
Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already "sobered down" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said.
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.
Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview.
Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while," Sun said.
China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary.
International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening "their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs
in exchange for loans," wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies.
Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking "what did we agree to do" and "how much do we owe" China.
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.
The cases were discovered among around 600 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on two flights Friday before the Dutch government halted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they also would seek to contact travelers who had arrived from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe since Monday and urge them to take a test as soon as possible.
The passengers from Friday's flights were kept separated from other travelers and those who tested positive are being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.
A spokesperson for the health ministry said it would not be known until later Saturday whether any of passengers are infected with the new variant.
A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.
Rules on the company's website said passengers had to present a negative COVID-19 "rapid antigen" test result taken 24 hours before departure but were not required to show proof of vaccination.
Really Weird' Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.
Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 a.m., almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam, but said she then found out she was standing right next to a man who knew he had tested positive for an infection.
It was really weird.
There was no coordination.
There were too few people and there really wasnt anybody who took control."
Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said.
Ive been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days.
It's a little scary the idea that you've been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive."
The Dutch flight ban does not mean that all flights from southern Africa to the Netherlands are halted, as Dutch citizens are allowed to return home, while EU citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.
Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel.
KLM will continue flights to the region, but travelers need to stay in quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.
The new variant has been detected just as many European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases.
The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its health care system.
EU to Suspend Travel From Southern Africa Over New COVID Variant
European Union states have agreed to suspend travel from southern Africa after the detection of a new COVID-19 variant, the presidency of the EU said Friday.
A committee of health experts from all 27 EU states "agreed on the need to activate the emergency break & impose temporary restriction on all travel into EU from southern Africa," the Slovenian presidency of the EU said on Twitter.
Restrictions will apply to Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said on Twitter.
An EU official said that EU governments have also been asked to discourage travel to those countries.
Each of the 27 EU countries is free to apply the new measures when it prefers. Some are already applying restrictions.
EU officials said that no decision had yet been made on other countries in other parts of the world where cases were detected, which include Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium, an EU country.
Global alarm
The new coronavirus variant, first detected in South Africa, has caused global alarm as researchers seek to find out if it is vaccine-resistant.
Marc Van Ranst, the virologist who detected the new variant in Belgium, told Reuters it was more likely the infected woman had contracted the variant in Belgium rather than while traveling outside Europe.
She had been in Egypt earlier in November but developed symptoms only 11 days after her return to Belgium. She is not vaccinated.
Switzerland imposed on Friday a requirement of 10-day quarantine and a negative test for travelers from Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong, in addition to travel bans on southern African countries.
Italy Imposes Entry Ban on Eight Southern African States
Italy imposed an entry ban Friday on people who have visited any one of eight southern African states in the last 14 days, because of the spread of a new COVID-19 variant there.
Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza signed an executive order banning entry of travelers from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini.
Our scientists are studying the new B.1.1.529 variant.
In the meantime, we will adopt the greatest possible caution," Speranza said.
Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change.
Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change.
Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030.
Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy," Mnangagwa said.
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use.
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license.
The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation.
Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on.
But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy.
In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster.
We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife," Nyapokoto said.
Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation.
Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems.
Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining.
That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow," Nyapokoto said.
He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy.
So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe.
The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming.
What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation.
We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields," Zamasiya said.
The Environmental Management Agency in Zimbabwe has been fining people caught cutting or burning forests. But so far, that hasnt stopped the trees from coming down.
Young Africans Struggle With Jobs, Education Amid Pandemic
The future looked promising for Tinashe Mapuranga, an intern at a leading bank in Zimbabwe who appeared set to get a staff position as soon as he completed his college degree.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Amid the lockdowns, the 24-year-old was one of the first to be laid off and has no idea when he'll be able to get his degree because of frequent school closures.
It has really affected me a lot in my studies.
I have no money to buy data and I don't have a personal laptop to study online and keep up like what others are doing," said Mapuranga, who lives with his mother in Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class area southeast of Harare, the capital.
I was supposed to finish in November or December 2021, but as of now, we haven't completed much of the work," he said.
Truly speaking, I am not sure when I will finish the degree. I can't wait to graduate and find a job and do something tangible in life."
Mapuranga spends most of his time at home, tending a tiny vegetable garden that is the family's main source of food.
His mother ekes out a living traveling to South Africa to sell things like stone carvings and brooms on the streets, a trade also badly hit by the pandemic.
We've been trying to hustle to get some money," he said.
I tried to do a small business selling cooking gas but the authorities chased us away from the streets.
My father passed away.
My mother is into informal business, but it's also down with these lockdowns.
Things are not well right now. It's tough."
Mapuranga's situation might look dire, but he says he's concerned about some of his unemployed peers who have fallen into alcohol, drugs and prostitution.
Many youths have lost hope," he said.
Across Africa, many others like Mapuranga are battling the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, losing jobs and seeing their education disrupted, a survey of people aged 18-24 in 15 countries.
The pandemic increased the already-high level of unemployment among the group, according to preliminary findings of the second annual Africa Youth Survey.
Nearly 20% of the 4,500 respondents said they became unemployed because of the pandemic and 37% were forced to stop or pause their education.
Another 8% saw their pay docked, 18% had to move back home and 10% said they had to care for family members, according to the survey, which was commissioned by the Johannesburg-based Ichikowitz Family Foundation, whose founder, Ivor Ichikowitz, runs Paramount Group, an aerospace, security and military contractor.
Of the 1.3 billion people in Africa's 54 countries, an estimated 250 million are aged 18-24.
The study was conducted in major urban and trading centers in Angola, Congo, The Republic of Congo, Ethopia, Gabon, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique
Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda and Zambia.
The researchers for PSB Insights, a global polling company, were nationals of each country where the survey took place and went door-to-door for in-depth, face-to-face interviews.
People surveyed said the pandemic caused substantial disruptions to their schooling, emphasizing the need for more computers and internet access in Africa for online education.
Bola Badejo, 29, saw her salary at the broadcast station where she worked in Abuja, Nigeria, cut in half, and she complained that she could not make it on the equivalent of $146 a month.
I was already poor and I was working just for the sake of doing the job," she said. Then, in April 202, she was laid off.
I fell into depression because the whole thing was really sad. I felt I had nowhere to go," Badejo said.
After seven months without a job, she started a home cleaning business, and that has boosted her outlook, she said.
Badejo is typical of many who have found different ways to support themselves.
In 2020, about 40% of those surveyed expressed optimism about the future.
The pandemic dented that confidence, lowering it to 31%, according to the survey.
Uganda has had two lockdowns since April 2020, the second of which was relaxed in July. But businesses involving close human interaction — bars, gyms and nightclubs — remain closed by presidential order, leaving many young people without work.
Ronald Maathe, a 25-year-old janitor at a gym outside Uganda's capital of Kampala, shook his head sorrowfully when saying that his monthly salary is now the equivalent of $43.
That's half of what he used to earn before the pandemic.
After I pay the rent, I am left with almost nothing," he said.
The half salary doesn't do anything."
His face lights up when describing how he makes ends meet by selling passion fruit — or grenadillas — that he buys from farmers near the border with Congo.
He makes a small profit on every sack of fruit he sells in Kampala.
My business is still small.
But I have a dream," he said.
If I can get someone to hold my hand, and give me a loan to expand my business, that's what I want.
I am not waiting for the government to help me."
Red Cross: 48,000 People Confirmed Missing Across Africa
The International Committee of the Red Cross says more than 48,000 people are missing across Africa, and at least 21,600 are minors.
Most of the registered disappearances — widely believed to be a fraction of the continents wider, undocumented humanitarian tragedy — are linked to armed conflict, violence, disasters and migration across the continent.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says the number of people coming forward to report missing persons is on the rise in Africa.
Amaya Fernandez, the humanitarian organizations adviser on the missing and their families for Western Africa, says the cause of the increasing numbers is two-fold.
On one hand, [it's] due to the fact we are trying to register more systematically cases of missing persons throughout the region.
But also, certainly, [it's] due to the increased violence and conflict experienced on the continent, which increases at the same time the likelihood of people going missing.
Looking at our figures, almost half of the missing persons have been recorded underage and most of them are men.
Among the women ... we can see that the majority are minors," she said.
The ICRC finding shows that 39,360 of the 48,000 missing people are from seven countries with armed conflicts.
According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, 20 countries in Africa have armed conflict.
Out of the 20, 10 are witnessing high-intensity armed conflicts.
Fernandez says the ongoing conflict in some African countries has created more pain and suffering for families of missing persons.
Humanitarian consequences... caused by protracted armed conflicts are often... reflected in most of the interviews.
For instance, half of the families interviewed in Nigeria reported that their relatives had gone missing in 2014-2015.
[In] South Sudan, [the] majority of the families were looking for people that went missing between 2013 and 2016.
In Libya, families reported that they were looking for missing relatives from the late '70s until the present day, and the same goes for families in Ethiopia and Uganda," she said.
Some experts see the need to train community workers and security agencies on the importance of information sharing to help locate missing persons.
Zimbabwes assistant police commissioner Crispen Lifa says his country and the region need a data management system to follow up on the missing person cases.
There is a need to have a database which should be continuously updated so that all missing persons, and even those that are deceased... is captured in a database by police stations.
At the end of the day, that information has to be put in place... [so] if you want to check across the country the number of missing persons, [you] would quickly get that information from a central point," he said.
Fauziya Hussein's brother went missing in June after a Kenyan court released him.
The 39-year-old was accused of terrorism-related issues, but the court found him innocent and ordered the police to release him.
His sister, Fauziya Hussein, says they never saw him again.
I know they still have him. At every point [of his detention], my brother got a chance to make a phone call. He called my mother.
So, if he was released, why didnt he call my mother?
So, I know for a fact they did not release him," she said.
According to Hussein, police told her they released her brother.
The ICRC calls on African governments to prevent disappearances and help with search and identification, and addressing families needs.

Olympics: Post-Bolt Era in 100m Begins in Tokyo
The post-Usain Bolt era in the men's Olympic 100 meters began on Saturday in Tokyo with Dorian Keletela, who is competing as part of the Olympic Refugee team, advancing to the next round with a personal best 10.33 seconds.
Bolt won three straight titles from Beijing in 2008 and his retirement in 2017 has left something of a vacuum in the showpiece athletics event, with no one stepping up to fill the Jamaican's shoes.
On Saturday, amid stifling temperatures that hovered above 30 degrees Celsius, sprinters took the track as they began their attempts to succeed world-record holder Bolt.
Keletela, 22, is one of those athletes.
Originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he moved to Portugal in 2016 following the death of his parents due to conflict in his homeland and ran a personal best 10.33 to advance to the next round later on Saturday.
am very, very proud of this and I am very, very proud of this team.
It gives me a lot of strength to go on," Keletela said after the race.
You can do ... anything, whether you are a refugee or not."
Others who progressed from the preliminary heats include Zimbabwe's Ngoni Makusha, who got off the block fast to win his heat in 10.32, and Oman's Barakat Al Harthi, who posted 10.27s to win his race.
There were three preliminary heats overall and the first three in each heat qualify to round one, along with the athlete who posts the next fastest time.
The world's top sprinters enter the equation later Saturday, with the United States, who have won more golds in the event than all other nations combined, determined to take Bolt's mantle and regain their supremacy.
Their last gold medal win in the event came via Justin Gatlin in 2004.
Contenders include Trayvon Bromell, whose 9.77 second run in Florida last month is the fastest of the year and propels him into the top tier of favorites in the race.
His compatriot Ronnie Baker is probably his closest rival for podium positions and finished second to him at the U.S. trials with a time of 9.85.
Canada's Andre De Grasse, who won bronze in the 100m in Rio five years ago, will be looking to go for the title this time around while South African sprinter Akani Simbine, fifth in Brazil and boasting the second-fastest time of the year, will also be in the running.
Bolt's former training partner, 2012 silver medalist Yohan Blake, the second-fastest man in history, will carry his nation's hopes on his shoulders.
South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday.
Last month the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) torpedoed Zuma's latest bid to have lead prosecutor Billy Downer taken off the case after accusing him of bias and leaking of confidential information to a journalist in contravention of the national prosecution act, among other complaints.
The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.
The spokesman of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi told a press briefing that Zuma's instructions to his legal team to institute private prosecution "will now be put into operation in the next few days."
He also said Zuma's legal team has filed a reconsideration application to the president of the SCA, a petition to hear the appeal.
Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.
The deal case has dogged Zuma since he was sacked as deputy president of the country in 2005. He said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.
On Monday the long-delayed trail is set to get underway and Zuma will be present in court.
Manyi said Zuma, who turns 80 on Tuesday, is applying for a postponement because "it is very clear that the conditions for a fair trail are non-existent."
On Monday his team will also respond to the supplementary affidavit served by the National Prosecution Authority where they seek to introduce new evidence in the trial.
All His Excellency President Zuma really wants is his day in court, in a fair trial and certainly not in a forum which is being rigged by the State," Manyi said.
South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation.
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor.
Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces.
Leaza Jernberg is a Johannesburg-based independent researcher and consultant on diplomacy.
The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable.
And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like," Jernberg said.
So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government."
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters.
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin.
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.
He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma," Calland said.
It was a corrupt relationship.
It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts.
And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa.
But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts.
I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment," Calland said.
Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak.
And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China.
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive.
In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse," Jernberg said.
When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future.
Ina Gouws is a political science lecturer at South Africas University of the Free State.
These kinds of things down the road, become problematic," Gouws said.
If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community."
While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.
Divided America: America's Beauty Hasn't Faded. Has its Greatness?
Americans agree on this much: They are disgusted with politics.
They look toward Washington and see a broken federal government.
A place where politicians seem more interested in self-preservation than We the People.
Things don't seem much better in state capitals, and, who knows?
Lead-tainted water may be pouring out of their kitchen faucet next.
Yet Americans say they still believe in America, the experiment in democracy that the founders described as a place where the government should protect the rights of ordinary people to life, liberty and the persuit of hapiness.
There's something at the core of America they long for, even if it's hard to define and seems distant in 2016.
Donald Trump proclaims he will "make America great again.
' Hillary Clinton counters that America "has never stopped being great.''
But what does that even mean?
And who gets to define greatness?
A billionaire businessman, a former secretary of state - or an aging musician in New Orleans?
What about the woman in Illinois who served in the U.S. military in Afghanistan?
Or the industrial worker worried about his job in Alabama?
The Associated Press interviewed a wide range of Americans to get a sense of what they think about the nation's greatness in the twilight of President Barrack Obama's eight years in office.
The responses were as different as Americans themselves, yet a theme emerged: Compared to other nations, the United States is at least good, probably even great.
But there's a lot of work to be done.
Yes, America is great.
It could be a lot better if the politicians weren't fighting each other all the time ...,'' said Rodney Kimball, a 74-year-old stove dealer in West Bethel, Maine.
America is divided by political party, choice of media, income, gender, race or ethnic group, religious faith (or not), generation, geography and general outlook on the country's future.
Pundits have proclaimed the electorate angry and wondered if the nation can ever recover the sense of unity experienced in the immediate aftermath of the al-Qaida attacks that took place 15 years ago this September.
The current dearth of confidence in the nation's politics and government is striking.
I think that America as an idea is one of the most beautiful ideas that the world has ever known.
I think that American opportunity and ingenuity has built some of the most incredible technologies and innovations today,'' said Allene Swanson, 22, of Chicago.
For some, real success has always seemed out of reach.
The old textile mill across town is a reminder, dark and empty because labor was cheaper in Southeast Asia or Latin America; the manufacturing plant on the outskirts of the city uses steel imported from China.
Employment has rebounded since the great recession, but wages are stagnant.
Forget saving for a home - millions work more than one job just to keep food on the table and the lights on.
What happened to the American dream? That's what is being asked in places like inner city St. Louis, home to 32-year-old Craig House.
He's lives with his grandmother in a sea of burned-out buildings and abandoned schools not far from a hip, trendy part of town.
America has always been great, just not for me and my people. For us it's been the worst ever,'' said House, shaking his head as he takes a long drag off his cigarette.
People come from all over the world, Arabs own this, that. Black man don't own nothing.''
Known as "Deacon'' in his native New Orleans, 74-year-old guitarist John Moore remembers a time when America was headed in the right direction, when everything seemed to be coming together.
It was in the 1960s, when black people like Moore were seeing an end to racial segregation; when women were gaining equality;
When politicians were taking a stand to end poverty despite the turmoil of protests over the Vietnam War.
Those were the best years,'' said Moore, tears welling in his eyes in the living room-turned-recording studio of his shotgun house.
And then they were destroyed right before my very eyes when they assassinated all of our Leaders.
Robert Kennedy, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Malcom X. All of our leaders.
And you know that was the end of all hope, we had no more hope.
Hope returned, at least for some, in 2008 when a mixed-race lawyer with a foreign-sounding name won the White House.
