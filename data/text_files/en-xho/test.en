In February, Hassans administration lifted bans on four media outlets: Mseto, Mawio, Mwanahalisi and Tanzania Daima.
They had been shuttered for offenses related to their coverage of alleged corruption, according to Amnesty International.
And Hassan has instructed the Ministry of Information, Communication and Information Technology to work with media stakeholders and others on reviewing laws and possibly loosening restrictions.
Melo is among those being asked to weigh in on what he calls "draconian" measures such as the 2015 Cybercrimes Act and 2016 Media Services Act.
Ive been part of the team that has been reviewing the laws, said Melo, who had previously felt their bite.
He was convicted in April 2020 of obstructing police investigations, and paid a fine of 3 million Tanzanian shillings, or $1,300, rather than face a year behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
CPJ, which honored Melo with its 2019 International Press Freedom Award, noted that the "charge stemmed from Melos alleged refusal to disclose the identities of whistleblowers on the Jamii Forums platform.
Melo told VOA that Jamii Forums, founded as a for-profit business, now is a nongovernmental organization.
We are focusing on good governance, accountability and democracy, he said.
Since Hassan took office, Melo said, "people on the cyberspace can now at least criticize the government or critically analyze whatever kind of statement that comes from any political figure.
At the moment, journalists are now writing stories that could not be written in the past six years."
When it comes to news media, "indeed, the environment is slowly opening up," agreed Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher.
Based in Nairobi, he monitors Tanzania and Uganda.
Amnesty praised Tanzanias lifting of the newspaper ban in February but also said the government "must do more to guarantee media freedom going forward."
A free press, Ebole told VOA, "would mean Tanzanians looking into the future with most hope in terms of expressing themselves and getting information – and information that would benefit them in all aspects of their lives, whether its economic, social and cultural."
We are somehow optimistic, Melo said of journalists and rights activists. But, he cautioned, "the laws are still there, really draconian laws.
If they are not amended, they can be used by anyone who is against us."
Separately, a Tanzanian government spokesman told VOA that measures could be loosened – to a point.
You cannot have a profession without rules to govern, like a tire moving without any control, spokesman Greyson Msigwa said in a recent interview.
We must reach a place that we all agree that we need to protect the interests of media and the people as well.
Extremist Rebels Launch Deadly Attack in Northeast Nigeria
Islamic extremist rebels have killed at least seven people in an attack in northeast Borno state in Nigeria, witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
The rebels attacked Kautukari village in the Chibok area of Borno on Tuesday evening, said residents.
The attack happened at the same time that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the state to meet with survivors of jihadi violence.
The Chibok area is 115 kilometers (71 miles) away from Maiduguri, the state capital, where Guterres met with former militants being reintegrated into society and thousands of people displaced by the insurgency.
They came in large number with superior firepower (and) took over the community, said Hassan Chibok, a community leader.
Troops from a nearby military base were deployed to repel the attack but "the damage had been done," Chibok said, adding that "casualties are up to 10."
Another resident Yana Galang said at least seven people were killed in the latest violence before the Nigerian military intervened.
Nigerian police did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the attack.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 206 million people, continues to grapple with a 10-year-old insurgency in the northeast by Islamic extremist rebels of Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province.
The extremists are fighting to establish Shariah law and to stop Western education.
More than 35,000 people have died and millions have been displaced by the extremist violence, according to the U.N. Development Program.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier this week that the war against the extremists is "approaching its conclusion," citing continued military airstrikes and the mass defection of thousands of the fighters, some of whom analysts say are laying down their arms because of infighting within the jihadi group.
The violence, however, continues in border communities and areas closer to the Lake Chad region, the stronghold of the Islamic State-linked group, ISWAP.
Things are getting worse in Kautukari village in Chibok and adjourning areas closer to the forest, said community leader Chibok, saying the extremists' presence near the forest is a contributing factor.
Reporting Under Attack in South Sudan, Sudan.
Journalists in both Sudan and South Sudan say threats, intimidation and arbitrary arrests are part of everyday life, limiting their ability to inform the public.
South Sudan ranks 128th and Sudan ranks 151st out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders annual World Press Freedom Index, released Tuesday to coincide with the United Nations annual recognition of World Press Freedom Day.
The bigger the number, the worse the environment for news media.
Irene Ayaa of the Association for Media Development in South Sudan says government censorship in her country is widespread.
Last month, we registered four articles removed from newspapers, she said.
Between January and March alone, security personnel removed dozens of articles from the Juba Monitor, Anna Namiriano, editor-in-chief of an English-language daily, told South Sudan in Focus.
They removed stories and we left the space blank.
They say why we are not listening to them, so on 17th of March, they suspended the newspaper."
In February, a handful of journalists were briefly detained for covering a press conference by opposition lawmakers in parliament.
A Juba Monitor newspaper article about the incident was removed by security agents at the printing plant.
We dont have freedom of the press in the country, Namiriano said.
The solution is let us do our work as media houses. We have the code of conduct, we have the media law to guide us, and removal of stories is really very bad.
South Sudans information minister, Michael Makuei, insists press freedom is alive and well in his country.
South Sudan is the only place where journalists are free, where they enjoy absolute freedom according to the law.
I say, 'according to the law,' because there is nothing absolute in this world," Makuei told South Sudan in Focus.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights refutes that assertion.
In a report issued last October, it said the government is harassing activists, journalists and their families, limiting their activities and targeting their work and finances.
South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, according to the commission.
South Sudan has a lot of work to do to establish and solidify the institutions that are critical to a well-functioning democratic state, David Renz, charge
daffaires for the U.S. Embassy in South Sudan, said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the U.S. remains deeply concerned about the state of press freedom in South Sudan.
We have seen some of the local radio stations shut down over very trivial matters, Renz said. "And we also are aware that journalists of radio and television and even social media are self-censored" and wary of local and national governments actions "to penalize journalists who say things the government would prefer that they not say."
Further complications from coup
In Sudan, journalists in the capital city of Khartoum say harassment and threats have increased since the October 25 military takeover.
Shoggi Abdulazeem, an investigative journalist in Sudan, said he received a death threat in November and was warned not to speak to international media.
I was hosting live on Al Jazeera and after leaving their office, eight armed security men followed me in a pickup.
They surrounded my car," Abdulazeem said.
He told South Sudan in Focus he was blindfolded and moved around "for more than two hours" and was ordered "not to criticize the military again."
Covering pro-democracy protests in Sudan continues to be a dangerous endeavor, Abdulazeem said.
Many newspapers, TV channels and radio stations received directives not to host or conduct interviews with some named individuals who criticize military leaders, Abdulazeem said.
He added, "There are intelligence officers who are assigned to monitor this situation."
Aisha Assamani, an executive member of the independent Sudanese Media Network, told South Sudan in Focus he has recorded more than 10 attacks on journalists and media houses since last year's coup.
"They are targeting freedom of speech with so much excessive force, Assamani said.
"The majority of our journalists now are fearful and their lives are in danger.
Most of them remain anonymous due to the danger of the situation."
On December 30, Sudanese security forces stormed the offices of three television stations — al-Arabiya, al-Hadath and al-Sharq — firing tear gas, assaulting staff and destroying broadcast equipment, according to local news media.
That same day, security forces detained al-Sharq correspondents Maha Al-Talb and Sally
Othman for hours before releasing them.
On January 16, Sudanese authorities withdrew the broadcast license of Al Jazeera Live and closed its office in Khartoum.
A letter from the Information Ministry to the director of Al Jazeera television in Sudan attributed the closing to an "unprofessional approach" and media content that "harmed the countrys higher interests and national security." The Doha-based network condemned the closure.
In February, Sudanese authorities arrested a group of BBC reporters in Khartoum and questioned them for several hours before releasing them.
VOA repeatedly called Sudans government for comment, but those calls — to Brigadier General Attahir Abu Haja, press advisor to military leader Abdul Fattah al-Burhan — went unanswered.
Michael Atit reported from Khartoum, Sudan; Deng Ghai Deng and Manyang David Mayar reported from Juba, South Sudan.
At Least 30 Burundian AU Soldiers Killed in Al-Shabab Attack, Official Says
At least 30 Burundian soldiers were killed and 20 others injured in Tuesday's attack by al-Shabab militants on an African Union base in southern Somalia, according to a Burundian official.
The official, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to media, told VOA Somali that 10 soldiers died on the spot, and the rest of the soldiers succumbed to their wounds.
He confirmed that other soldiers are still missing.
Al-Shabab said it killed 173 soldiers in the attack on the AU base in the village of El-Baraf, about 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu.
The casualty figure has not been independently verified.
A separate source told VOA Somali that 161 soldiers were at the camp at the time of attack.
The Burundian official confirmed that number.
The Burundian official told VOA Somali that the soldiers had intelligence al-Shabab was gathering in a nearby village about 48 hours prior to the attack.
He said the soldiers prepared to defend themselves and dug trenches.
He said what caught the soldiers by surprise was the enormity of al-Shabab explosives detonated at the camp. He said the militants used three truck bombs, one of which fell into a ditch.
He estimated the militants detonated about 20 kilograms of explosives, and that 450 militants overran the camp.
The official said the suicide truck bombs caused most of the casualties.
Earlier, the government of Burundi reported 10 of their soldiers were killed, with five others missing and 25 injured.
Burundi also said 20 al-Shabab militants were killed in the attack.
On Twitter, Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye said there are no words strong enough to condemn the terrorist attack against the Burundian contingent.
He wrote, "I join with all of Africa which has just lost sons and daughters … to console the hard-hit families."
The African Union, the Somali government and the embassy of the United States in Mogadishu have all strongly condemned the al-Shabab attack.
AU chief Moussa Faki Mahamat paid tribute to the Burundian soldiers killed, and said the "heinous" attack will not lessen support of AU forces to Somalia.
The Somali ministry of foreign affairs called on the international community to increase and provide higher-end capability to Somali security forces and AU forces so they can effectively combat terrorism in Somalia.
The U.S. embassy in Mogadishu said the U.S. extends condolences to the families of the troops killed and wished a quick recovery to those injured.
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, told VOA that Tuesday's fighting at the camp was the heaviest the area has seen.
Fighting like this never happened in this area, he said, explaining that the violence also killed two civilians and injured 10 others.
It was heavy fighting.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, gave it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to the Somali government.
The mission's mandate runs through the end of 2024.

South Africa Urges Africa’s First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.
This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax.
South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.
Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production.
Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.
So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them," he said.
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.
He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired.
And more are due to expire in June and July.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.
We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now.
As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days," he said.
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.
This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform.
This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.
How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?
Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security," said Terblanche.
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.
We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination.
Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.
We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic," she said.
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives.
Disinformation, Censorship, Trigger Global Retreat of Press Freedom.
Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and propaganda is having a disastrous effect on independent news around the world, a new report finds.
In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda.
The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level.
In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new, said Clayton
Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA.
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom.
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war."
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.
It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia, Clayton said.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.
But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia, Clayton said.
At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine.
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention.
The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive."
President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime, RSF's country file states.
Rising authoritarianism.
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.
Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence."
Afghanistan ranked 154th.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.
Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks, the group saidClayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.
When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect, he said.
It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same.
US is not perfect.
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index.
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.
We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them.
An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event," said Beth
A few bright spots.
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.
If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media, he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index.
Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places.
But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms.
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism."
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June.
In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.
The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image, he said.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University.
As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region, said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added.
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.
In my view, this is all window-dressing, said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.
It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer.
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation.
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.
I want to, many do, but we're scared, said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.
Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi.
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war.
A terrifying experience, he says.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims.
Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat.
And to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates.
Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business.
These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path."
It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes, he said.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence.
That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says.
Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act.
Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012.
A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad."
He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said. "I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.
That period of my life has passed, he said.
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups.
Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself.
Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.

Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. Five suicide
attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism.
When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.
I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story, the 42-year-old journalist said.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.
She countered with a better offer.
I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect, she said.
I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense.
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to.
Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA.
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.
If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said.
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war.
It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily.
The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.
There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting, she said.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting.
Knowing the local language is an important part of that.
When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust, she said.
If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything.
It grants you a very beautiful kind of access.
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out, she said.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.
Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you, she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria ,
And interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.
While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the came refused to talk to them,
" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.
Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents, Sancha said.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.
Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines, Abbas said.
It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues.
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.
The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East,
that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region," Abbas said.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.
We talk about all these issues that men normally would not speak about, she said.
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed.
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country.
It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed "Death to America, Death to Israel" slogans.
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize.
What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians, Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs.
Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
And former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century "are null and void".
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by
Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
Stop your vicious deeds.
You know well that we are people of action and reaction," Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran.
Our responses are painful.
You create conditions for your own destruction.
We will not leave you alone ...
You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action."
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program.
Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.
In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its "Kheibar Buster" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles).
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list.
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.
For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.
And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%.
A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.
Third places Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray
Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.
If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good, says clinical psychologist Dr.
Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.
It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways, Espinola says.
So, places like third places can allow us to do that.
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place
a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other places in their community that they visit regularly.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community, says Cox.
They're much more likely to engage in other activities there.
They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country,
And anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.
And many are open most days of the week.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.
I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential, Cox says.
But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees. …
They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other. …
I don't know where else they would have gone — maybe a church, but maybe not — to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops."
Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems?
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.
There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.
They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity.
That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.
Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity.
So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things."
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."
The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.
A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in.
That also shapes our immune system… it's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.
There are other things that go into that equation."
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.
Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says.
Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.
One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines.
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.
But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.
It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system."
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.
Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.
The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids aagainst new things that then come along.
World Bank, Nike Team Up for 'The Girl Effect' Initiative
The Adolescent Girls Initiative partners the World Bank, the Nike Foundation and governments of developing and developed nations to empower girls in poor countries.
The two-year-old program is helping girls in Asia, Africa and the Middle East gain the education and skills they need to transition into the workforce.
My name is Sanchita. I come from a small village called Ishwarpur in Bangladesh, American actress Anne Hathaway delivered her lines as powerfully from behind
podium at the World Bank as she does on the silver screen, telling the story of an impoverished girl.
When a baby is born in Ishwarpur, families desperately hope it will be a boy, she continued.
It has been this way for as long as anyone can remember.
It is believed that boys will contribute to the family income in a place where people are very poor.
These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative.
Who benefits?A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.
They were just a few of the girls who benefit from training and education programs that help them transition from school to employment.
Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.
Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world, explained Hathaway.
I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.'
Girl powerThe Girl Effect" is what the Adolescent Girls Initiative wants to see happen for 600 million girls in developing countries.
Overall, an estimated one-third of young women in developing nations are not employed and not in school.
World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.
If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates, Zoellick said.
The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty.
Current operations The Adolescent Girls Initiative public-private partnership, with its $20 million in funds, is already at
work in seven countries, with plans to expand to Haiti and Yemen.
Mayra Buvinic talks about the Adolescent Girls Initiative.
So where we are in Liberia and Nepal, young women are completing the first rounds of training, explained Mayra Buvinic, director of Gender and Development at the World Bank.
In South Sudan, 100 adolescent girls' clubs will have opened in four states by the end of this month.
In Jordan, female community college graduates are gaining access to vouchers.
In Afghanistan, Lao PDR and Rwanda, assessments are being completed, and the projects will be launched at the end of this quarter.
Thanks and praise Kebbeh Kamara tells the audience how she's benefited from the World Bank/Nike initiative
Kebbeh Kamara said she has benefited from training in Greater Monrovia, Liberia.
Wearing a pink dress and sporty black headband decorated with rhinestones, she addressed the World Bank audience from the stage.
I learned how to start a business, how to earn money on your own, how to be self-sustainable, she said, "how to save money and what to spend money for.
Sarah Poni Saturnino, 19, of Juba, Southern Sudan, told VOA she is enjoying her first trip to the United States and all the empowerment training and activities.
She said she hopes to take the lessons she has learned here in workshops back to the Adolescent Girls Initiative clubs in Southern Sudan.
I learned about how to express yourself.
Eye contact.
Speak loud," explained Saturnino.
This way can give me really a voice to speak in front of people.
And even if I go back home, I'm not longer Sarah again -- I'm somebody now."
Somebody who has earned the admiration of a fellow Southern Sudanese citizen, child-soldier-turned-rapper Emmanuel Jal.
A supporter of the Adolescent Girls Initiative, Jal performed at the World Bank event.
The girls joined him on stage, beaming as they danced behind him -- as did at least one World Bank official -- while the audience of staffers in business suits took to their feet and raised their hands in the air as well.
Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that
the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.
She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.
Striving for peace in the region.
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.
The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict, said Rostagno.
Deteriorating situation amid global concern.
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.
A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us, said Rostagno.
I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today.
The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.
months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.
They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access," said Rostagno.
Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice.
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life.
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.
We waged a war that shouldn't have happened, he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.
We waged a war that shouldn't have happened, he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.
God have mercy on us, he said.The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday.
The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons he said.
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid.
Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating "a democratic and just society without racial divisions.
He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa.
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.
I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world, he said.
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.
It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur, Tutu said.
Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.
But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly "shut up."
I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed, he said.
I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better.
Many say his voice will be missed.
Malawi's Jacaranda School for Orphans Celebrates Christmas.
The management for the Jacaranda School for Orphans in Malawis commercial capital Blantyre recently hosted a party for its students as it closed for Christmas and New Years Day holidays.
Around 500 people including students, staff members and others from surrounding areas attended the event, which was held at the schools premises in Chigumula area.
The party included gifts, Santa Claus, and a "dancing show case" by the students.
The school management told VOA that the yearly celebration has been a school tradition for the past 13years.
The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: "[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents.
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children.
So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas.
And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."
No media source currently available.
Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to "a nice meal" from the students.
We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables.
And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people," he said.
One of the students, Eddah Zimba, said, "The celebrations are really cool, ...
I have enjoyed myself.
I have eaten, and now I am here dancing.
What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.
This party has brought a change in my life.
I have learned that we have to have a heart for sharing one another as the Father Christmas was doing, he said.
Founded in 2002, the Jacaranda School for Orphans is the only one in Malawi which provides free primary, secondary and tertiary education to children without parents.
A Malawian woman, Marie Da Silva, started the school after she returned from the United States where she spent nineteen years working as a nanny.
Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015.
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate.
More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the
2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University
of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.
This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance.
We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals.
In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time," said Mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.
My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy,
We may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation, said Mwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered
2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse."
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.
My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi.
We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible," said Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year.
Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily.
Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.
We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not.
And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need.
And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative," said Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are
far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services.
She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030.
Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.
I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy.
HIV testing is supposed to be private.
No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them," said Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.
Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions, said Makonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed."
I fear it could end up into fights.
You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed.
So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily," said Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.
Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup.
I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family.
[Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately," said Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people.
The organization says it worked well.
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi.
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water.
But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.
The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky.
We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water.
There are so many risks.
You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us."
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river.
But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.
These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked.
This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.
They punished some of them, but you know they would sometimes climb trees just to look at older women like us taking a bath," she explains.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.
Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.
January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015].
That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be," Mateyu said.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks.
The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.

Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre.
The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene."
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.
I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it.
My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me.
But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace]," said Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.
As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public.
This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter," said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.
At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children, said Ligomeka.
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of
Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.
Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event.
There was a possibility that something was going to be published.
And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem," said Kanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful.
But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty.
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years.
The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015.
The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.
Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature,
that is why this call for manufacturing, he said.
Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better.
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods.
This, he says, encourages investment.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly.
UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community.
And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain.
They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals.
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development.
That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.
We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities, Davis said.
These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development.
And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow.
Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.
And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals.
They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the
Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said.
Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way.
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials.
Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.
Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.
In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.
Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].
So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out."
Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.
Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.
It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, "Msowoya said.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.
Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted.
The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses."
Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.
There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours, noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu.
We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.
There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.
But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted.
WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it.
In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food.
So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate.
The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing, she said.
We need more assistance now.
We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries.
About half of these people are in Zimbabwe.
The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates.
It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. "We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said.
If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there.
The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas.
Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October.
But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.
Canadian PM Impressed With African Development Plan - 2002-04-05
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien says he is impressed with the progress being made towards implementing an African development plan.
Mr. Chretien made the remarks Sunday after meeting with South African President Thabo Mbeki and other regional leaders in Pretoria.
Mr. Chretien, the current chairman of the group of the seven most industrialized nations plus Russia, is visiting Africa to discuss the New Partnership for Africa's Development, known as NEPAD.
He said NEPAD will be one of the top agendas at the June G-8 summit in Kananaskis, Canada.
The G-8 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia.
Mr. Chretien says topics such as human rights, democracy the rule of law, transparency and good governance will be discussed at the G8 summit.
NEPAD outlines objectives of promoting democracy and good governance in Africa in return for Western economic assistance. It
seeks to achieve an annual growth rate of seven-percent on the African continent by 2015.
South African President Mbeki said he is convinced that Africa is ready for NEPAD saying there has been definite progress toward democracy in the continent.
Later, Mr. Chretien and Mr. Mbeki were joined by presidents Festus Mogae of Botswana, Bakili Muluzu of Malawi, Joaquim
Chissano of Mozambique, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Benjamin Makapa of Tanzania and Vice President Enoch Kavindele of Zambia.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who won re-election in disputed voting last month, was not invited.
Reuters news agency reports the Canadian prime minister who has already visited Morocco, Algeria and Nigeria on his
six-nation tour will visit Ethiopia and Senegal after South Africa.
Some information for this report provided by Reuters and AFP.
Child Labor in Malawi - 2002-02-28
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.
It says these children risk being abused.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre.
They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas.
He says, "Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization.
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.
Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates.
He said, "We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates.
There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. "
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country.
These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child, he said, "you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education.
So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. "
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs.
We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child.
At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. "
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.
Over 60 per cent of Malawis nearly 11 million people live below the poverty line.
Malawi Court Convicts 12 People in Albino Attack
A high court in Malawi has convicted five people of murder for the 2018 killing of a 22-year-old albino man, including the victims brother.
The court convicted seven other people of selling the victim's body parts.
Malawi officials say more than 170 albinos have been attacked in the country since 2014 by people who believe their body parts bring luck and wealth.
Family members of the deceased, MacDonald Masambuka, left the courtroom Thursday with hopes of justice being served after the court convicted all 12 people accused in his death.
Family members, including Masambukas mother, appeared calm and composed as Judge Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga read the judgments.
Those convicted included a Catholic priest, Father Thomas Muhosa, police officer Chikondi Chileka, clinician Lumbani Kamanga, and the deceaseds brother, Cassim Masambuka.
Charges included murder, extracting human tissues, causing harm to a person with disability, and trafficking in persons.
Kamanga convicted the victims brother and four others of murder.
The court convicted seven other people, including the priest and police officer, of selling the victim's body parts.
Business with tissue According to the court, Muhosha, Chileka and others offered to conduct business using human tissue extracted from a human corpse.
The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.
She said Masambuka is the latest victim of violent attacks on persons with albinism who have not been protected by the community.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case. He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.
Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust — that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him," Kayuni said.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.
Enticement Court documents show that Masambuka was enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found a girl for him to marry.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him. Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.
We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients, Chamkakala said.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.
Serious sentencing'
Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.
When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case," Simbota said.
The high court is expected to sentence the perpetrators on May 30.
In another case, a high court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old man to life in prison for the 2020 murder of a 14-year-old-boy with albinism in Phalombe district.
Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.
Though "everybody's got the right to demonstrate," there have "been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence,"
Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview.
Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government.
They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start.
Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court.
Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police.
Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols.
The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.
Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around.
There's really nothing that we see coming out of it," James said.
But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. …
We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy:
We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums.
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption.
Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine.
With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who had predicted 3.1% growth for 2019, offered a sobering update to Zimbabwe's parliament in early August.
The revised 2019 GDP growth is expected to be negative, Reuters news service reported him as saying.
Ncube did not provide any updated figure.
Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.
South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16.
Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people.
But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans.
They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read,
Stop killing our people,'" she said. "...
So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate.
But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning.
Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat.
They found nothing, she said.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.
I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least, she told VOA, after returning home to Harare.
Because seven security details coming over after midnight and questioning me about a demonstration and placards that I wasn't going to be able to give them, was something else.
I didn't understand it. It left me really terrified."
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday.
She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal.
But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.
I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do, he said.
However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves.
This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression.
Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.
This means the continuation of a limited civic space. Because this has happened since 2016.
There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space.
And it is targeted to people like civil society organizations, the media, hindering the freedom of speech, the freedom of association."
Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns.
A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court.
Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.
Zimbabweans Claim Police Brutality During Economic Protests
Zimbabweans defied a police ban Friday and held demonstrations to protest the country's deteriorating economy.
Despite the High Court ban on planned protests, members of the Movement for Democratic Change took to the streets and clashed with police.
Some of the injured accused police of derailing protests, which they said were meant to persuade President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to breathe life into Zimbabwe's moribund economy.
With tears on her cheeks, 32-year-old Tafadzwa Bvuta said her degree had not helped her get anything for her three children.
They beat us up, she said of the police. "What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person.
Where will we go and survive?
Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"
Make Nyashanu, 27, said he would continue protesting because he is miserable about being unemployed.
He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators — even elderly ones and people not protesting.
Is this democracy? he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos.
The opposition said it will hold another protest Monday in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, and will go to other cities and places until the government addresses the economy.
Government response
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa called the protests counterproductive, saying January's demonstrations against fuel price increases resulted in $20 million to $30 million in losses for businesses from looting and non-productive days.
Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner, she said.
I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation.
Daniel Molokhele, the spokesman for the opposition, said his party was against Mnangagwa leading talks and accused him of stealing Zimbabwe's last election in 2018.
He said the protests would continue until Zimbabwe's economy gets back on track.
UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare.
The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.
We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe.
While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform
process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans," Colville said.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care.
Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear.
But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.
There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders.
We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago," Colville said.
So, it is clearly a very tense situation.
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.
The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products, Cudjoe told VOA.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against
Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude.
The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa.
In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight.
At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday.
The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.
Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food, said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."
There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world.
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries.
African governments must find a way of responding," he said.
It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.
Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities]
like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine," Kanyama said.
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.
He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – "is trying to offer some debt relief."
Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis," Kanyama added.

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic.
Zimbabwes government says it is launching a "national vaccination blitz" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year.
The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases.
Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant.
We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible.
We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally.
The situation might change.
So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination," Balde said.
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month.
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind.
Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date.
The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so," Ndlovu said.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.
The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.
Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns.
He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing.
After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up.
But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us.
The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up.
What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers.
There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures," Chimbetete said.
Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance.
It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity.
Finland Crowned World's Happiest Nation for Fifth Year
Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year running, in an annual U.N.-sponsored index that again ranked Afghanistan as the unhappiest, followed closely by Lebanon.
Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania recorded the biggest boosts in wellbeing.
The largest falls in the World Happiness table, released on Friday, came in Lebanon, Venezuela and Afghanistan.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August.
U.N. agency UNICEF estimates one million children under five could die of hunger this winter if not aided.
This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims," co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said.
The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data.
It assigns a happiness score on a scale of zero to 10, based on an average of data over a three-year period.
This latest edition was completed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch.
The United States rose three places to 16th, one ahead of Britain, while France climbed to 20th, its highest ranking yet.
As well as a personal sense of wellbeing, based on Gallup polls in each country, the happiness score takes account of GDP, social support, personal freedom and levels of corruption.
This year the authors also used data from social media to compare people's emotions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic.
They found "strong increases in anxiety and sadness" in 18 countries but a fall in feelings of anger.
The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing," report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote.
World leaders should take heed."
The report raised some eyebrows when it first placed Finland at the top of its listings in 2018.
Many of the Nordic country's 5.5 million people describe themselves as taciturn and prone to melancholy, and admit to eyeing public displays of joyfulness with suspicion.
But the country of vast forests and lakes is also known for its well-functioning public services, ubiquitous saunas, widespread trust in authority and low levels of crime and inequality.
