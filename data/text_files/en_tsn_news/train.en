He has actually relaxed the numbers for gatherings and religious gatherings and that is a potential risk.
As long as they follow precautions I think that’s the key thing.
So it really comes down to individuals taking responsibility, individual church leaders following protocols.
Stead adds: I’m concerned about on-site alcohol consumption.
From the hospital perspective, there is no doubt that when people are drinking they [are] not social distancing.
Their masks are off.
Pubs and shebeens are probably the places where social distancing happens the least.
We are concerned that its likely that alcohol is going to be flowing fairly freely during Easter and that we may see a couple of weeks later COVID-19 numbers increasing.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has paid tribute to legendary news anchor Noxolo Grootboom, who presented her last news bulletin on Tuesday evening after 37 years.
Earlier, the presidency postponed the President’s address to the nation on the COVID-19 Easter weekend restrictions by half an hour to allow South Africans to watch Grootboom do what she does best for the last time.
Ramaphosa says the news anchor was outstanding in her service to the nation.
I wish to pay tribute to Miss Grootboom as an outstanding journalist who throughout her 37 years of distinguished service bought historic events in our country and across the world into the living rooms our nation.
We wish Miss Grootboom well and thank her for her many years service, he added.
Grootboom has been trending on social media with many South Africans wishing her well in her retirement.
Her colleagues have also bid farewell to the news icon who is best known for her sign off, ndinithanda nonke emakhaya.
A farewell fit for a queen.
Imagine one day telling your children: One day long ago, the president at the time wanted to talk to Mzansi, but then he moved his time so that your gogo, the TV Queen of News, could first read her TV news bulletin one final time on the public broadcaster.
You are a legend.
Its not just what you have done behind that camera for over 30 years, it is also your beautiful heart.
Enjoy retirement but may the nation never actually let you retire. Redi Tlhabi, March 30, 2021
A reassuring voice even in uncertain times.
Thank you Mam Noxolo Grootboom.
You have set the bar high.
Enjoy your retirement, you have earned it .
US first lady Jill Biden is getting her own biographical comic book, joining women like Vice President Kamala Harris, nun Mother Theresa and country star Dolly Parton in TidalWave Comics Female Force series.
The 69-year-old community college educator and author will be the subject of the 22-page Female Force: Jill Biden, which will be released in print and digitally on April 7.
A matching colouring book will also be released.
Biden, who has long advocated for military families, community colleges and women’s education, is the latest addition to the biographical comic series, dedicated to inspirational women.
Previous subjects also include former first lady Michelle Obama, singer Cher and actress Betty White.
We believe that it is important for readers to have inspiring role models, to learn about extraordinary individuals that have overcome challenges to make a difference in the world, TidalWave Comics said in a statement.
Menachem Rosensaft, the son of two Holocaust survivors who became an international lawyer specialising in genocide, has spent much of his life trying to reconcile the horrors of the past with his Jewish faith.
Rosensaft was born in 1948 in military barracks housing displaced persons, including survivors like his mother of the nearby Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp.
His father survived five camps, including Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.
Around 50 000 prisoners died at Bergen-Belsen, among them Anne Frank.
When British forces freed the camp in 1945, they found some 60 000 survivors, but nearly 14 000 died within two months from disease and malnutrition.
Rosensaft, an American, has turned to poetry to reflect in verse not only on the Holocaust but also recent attempts at genocide, such as in Bosnia and Rwanda, and also tackles racism and intolerance.
We know there are neo-Nazi forces, there are white supremacist forces in all parts of the world who, if allowed to, will perpetrate horrific acts, crimes against humanity, genocide against the other, Rosensaft said in a video interview from his home in New Jersey.
And the other can be Jews, Roma, Muslims, it can be the immigrant and the LGBTQ community and we all have to be on guard.
His book of verse, Poems Born in Bergen-Belsen, is being published in April by Kelsay Books to coincide with Yom Hashoah, the Jewish day of remembrance for Holocaust victims on April 9 and the anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen on April 15, 1945.
Rosensaft, who has visited Bergen-Belsen more than 25 times, wrestles in some of the 82 poems with what he called ghosts of those who will not leave places where they were killed.
I try to figure out in my own head what has happened to them, what are they doing, what is going on with the landscape which they still inhabit because they dont have a cemetery, they dont have a graveyard, he said.
Their graveyard is the sky.
He writes of clean-shaven guards humming Mozart as they select who will live and who will die and then ending their shift with a bored smile before dinner.
Children inhabit many poems, inspired by his half-brother Benjamin, who at five-and-a-half years old was killed alongside his father and grandparents on arrival at Auschwitz in 1943.
As guards herded them to the gas chamber, Benjamin asked his mother if they were going to live or die.
She did not answer
Benjamin would be 83 today.
When Rosensafts mother died in 1997, he realised that the only place Benjamin now lived was inside him.
I see his face, I try to imagine his voice, I try to imagine his pain, his fear, his anguish and the one thing I know is that if I didnt remember him he would disappear, Rosensaft said.
He said he writes about children killed in the Holocaust to give them a measure of immortality.
A religiously committed Jew, Rosensafts relationship with God is troubled.
One poem, Psalm 13, Post-Auschwitz, starts by telling God:
You hid Your face, ignored your world, while flesh-fueled flames pierced the skyt, and ends telling him: It is too late.
Athletic shoemaker Nike Inc on Monday sued a New York-based company that produced Satan Shoes purported to contain a drop of human blood as part of a collaboration with Old Town Road rapper Lil Nas X.
Nike said in the lawsuit that the company, MSCHF Product Studio Inc, infringed on and diluted its trademark with the black-and-red, devil-themed shoes, which went on sale online on Monday.
The shoes are customized Nike Air Max 97 sneakers that contain red ink and one drop of human blood in the sole, according to a website describing the 666 pairs of limited edition shoes.
Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa says the R300 million which was meant to help support the creative industry as part of the Presidential Employment Stimulus Package programme did not disappear but was overcommitted.
He says the department will conduct a forensic investigation to get to the bottom of the issue.
Mthethwa says the National Arts Councils Chief Executive Officer, Rosemary Mangope, and Chief Financial Officer, Clifton Changfoot, are on suspension over the matter.
This is after they failed to explain to the council about the mismanagement of funds.
Mthethwa says a team has already been appointed to start work on a forensic investigation.
That number is slightly below estimations that suggested the movie could reach $19.5 million over the weekend, but it’s an impressive haul nonetheless.
The anime action adventure, from Funimation and Aniplex, has been a massive commercial hit in international markets such as Japan, where it currently ranks as the highest-grossing movie ever with $365 million.
In total, Demon Slayer has surpassed the $400 million mark.
Box office analysts have been encouraged by the one-two punch of Mortal Kombat and Demon Slayer, especially since only 50% of cinemas in the country have reopened.
Multiplexes that have been able to welcome back patrons have been capping attendance in line with government guidelines.
In Los Angeles, for example, that means 50% capacity or 200 people.
In New York, theaters will be able to operate at 33% capacity starting on Monday.
This weekend is another very good step, said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy FranchiseRe.
Movie going should start to normalize in early June.
Overseas, Mortal Kombat collected $6.3 million from 37 foreign territories, brings its international tally to $27.6 million.
The film, produced by New Line Cinemas for a modest $55 million, has generated $50 million globally to date.
Among other wide releases, Godzilla vs. Kong landed in third place with $4.2 million from 2 856 venues.
After four weeks in theaters, the Warner Bros. and Legendary monster mashup has amassed $86.5 million.
The film, which is available on HBO Max through the end of April, has surpassed $400 million at the global box office.
With those ticket sales, it has surpassed Christopher Nolan’s confusing sci-fi spectacle Tenet ($363 million) as the highest-grossing Hollywood blockbuster since the pandemic hit.
It’s evident that Godzilla vs. Kong is reigniting movie going everywhere and that audiences are more than ready to return to theaters, where and when its safe, for a big screen experience like this one, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution.
The pandemic-delayed Academy Awards ceremony takes place at a Los Angeles rail station on Sunday on what could be a historic night packed with surprises, not just around the winners but the event itself.
We just want the whole thing, right out of the gate, to announce itself as being different, said Steven Soderbergh, one of a trio of producers.
Few of the winners seem to be locked down after an extended awards season, but Nomadland Chinese-born Chloe Zhaos slow- burn quasi-documentary about the traveling community of American van dwellers is seen as the front runner for taking home best picture.
The winners are chosen in a secret ballot by the 9 000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
With the slogan Bring your movie love, producers say Sundays show will aim both to encourage people to get back into movie theatres after the long coronavirus closures, and have the look and feel of a film.
It’s trying to be like a movie, except that the Oscars is a TV show about the movies.
So I’m really curious about that, said Hammond.
Up-and-coming musicians in Durban have come together to hold open-air busking performances in public spaces as part of the Independent Artists Busking Project.
The initiative provides a platform for musicians who have been struggling to earn a living during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Artist Sandy B has turned to online platforms to host virtual gigs, saying it’s been an opportunity to draw in global audiences.
But he’s lamented on how COVID-19 relief funding is managed for struggling artists.
As I’m talking to you now, I’m even feeling emotional.
It’s not nice because you stand in front of a big audience somewhere abroad and say all these nice things and the way we are treated as South African artists is not nice.
We have built our own profile sometimes, most of us without even pressurizing the government.
Even when these funds are being distributed you get shocked that people who are beneficiaries are new in the industry, one or 2 years old.
Or some new companies and so on.
The Denis Hurley Centres director, Raymond Perrier, says music plays a powerful role in bringing together people from all walks of life.
I think its really important in South Africa today to bring together all citizens of this country so they can share a space and share an experience.
We’re getting closer to Freedom Day and we remember that wonderful moment in 1994 all kinds of South Africans came together to vote and in the same way music brings people together.
But we also have to remember that during this terrible time of COVID musicians and artists are some of the people who haven’t been able to make a living.
so giving them a chance to make a living to be able to perform their art and make some money is also really important.
artists cry foul after struggling to access COVID-19 relief fund, Dr Sipho Sithole.
In commemoration of the Soweto Uprising, renowned theatre creator Jerry Pooe and music director Mondli Ngcobo, are putting together 1976 The Musical.
This will form part of the 45th anniversary of the June 16th commemorations.
Lead actors include Dawn King, Baby Cele, Khaya Dladla, and Wiseman Mncube.
The theatre production company has made a call for auditions.
They will take place on Monday at the Durban Music School.
Jerry Pooe who is the Director for 1976 The Musical says, It will be different because we are going to be mordenizing it.
It’s going to be happening at this period of time but of course with the reflections of 1976 and it’s going to be also having a lot of videos and images, lots of images.
So, it’s really going to be a big production with the support of multimedia in it.
Jerry Pooe discusses the theatre production.

American rapper and actor Earl Simmons, known by his stage name DMX or Dark Man X, will be mourned by fans around the world in a livestreamed event from Brooklyns Barclays Centre on Saturday.
Simmons, 50, died on April 9 after suffering a heart attack a week earlier, which many media outlets initially attributed to a drug overdose.
The memorial at the Barclays Centre will be closed to the public but will be streamed live on DMXs YouTube account at 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT).
A second event will be broadcast live on BET Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET (1830 GMT) from an undisclosed church in the New York City area.

The Yonkers, New York natives’ career had been marked by legal troubles and prison time, and a well-publicised struggle with drug addiction.
The musician’s family, in a statement to People magazine, said he died at New York’s White Plains Hospital with family by his side.
Fans had gathered for days before his death, holding prayer vigils outside the suburban New York hospital, where he had been reported on life support and in a coma.

Along with being mourned by fans around the world, his death spurred an outpouring of condolences from stars such as Chance the Rapper who said on social media, Rest in Heaven DMX.
Healthcare workers took time out from their hectic and heavy schedules to de-stress in Durban today.
They participated in an inter-hospital tournament.
Under the banner Caring for Caregivers, nurses and doctors from 10 public and private health facilities played sports such as soccer and netball.
More than 700 healthcare workers have succumbed to COVID-19 related complications since April last year.
We are hoping to bring them together and be the one team we have seen them during COVID-19 they are working together, saving our lives.
Some have lost their lives during this time.
We want to express how thankful we are and we are appreciative about the work they have done, says Samukelisiwe Mnguni, one of the Medi-Splash Sport Tournament organisers.
Government has now begun registering the elderly and those with comorbidities for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Healthcare workers have been prioritised, but with the third wave looming, doctors say it’s up to the public to delay it or prevent the spread by adhering to all COVID-19 protocols.
We don’t know if we will get a third wave or not. with God’s grace we hope it doesn’t come.
But it all depends on you and I, what we do to save the population from the third wave, says Dr Stephen Simango.
Healthcare practitioners shared their experiences of working during a pandemic.
It was a tricky situation for us because it’s something we have never experienced before but with the grace of God, we managed to take good care of them (patients).
It wasn’t about us but taking good care of our patients we are there with them, holding their hands because we were actually like a family to them and proving them with all their needs, says Thozama Lwana, a nurse.
Pharmacist Sphamandla Made adds: It’s been a very tough year especially with COVID-19 coming along so this is the opportunity to meet up with old friends and family because we treat them like family.
So it’s great to be outside to be playing and free again.
Participants were awarded prizes for their service to the community.
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s unwitting appearance in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was named one of the years worst performances by voters for the annual Razzie prizes on Saturday.
The Razzies, or Golden Raspberry Awards, were created in 1980 and serve as an antidote to Hollywood’s glitzy Oscar’s ceremony, which take place on Sunday.
Giuliani was named the worst supporting actor for his brief appearance in Sacha Baron Cohens Borat mockumentary sequel.
The former mayor was unknowingly filmed in a hotel room with an actress pretending to be a reporter.
Giuliani has said nothing inappropriate happened.
Absolute Proof, a movie by My Pillow Chief Executive Mike Lindell, was voted the years worst picture.
The film featured baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election.
Lindell, a vocal supporter of former US President Donald Trump, also was named worst actor.
Music, a movie directed by musician Sia about a young girl with autism, won the most Razzies overall, with three including worst actress for Kate Hudson.
Razzie winners were chosen by 1 097 members from more than two dozen countries.
Members sign up online and pay a $40 membership fee.
The City of Tshwane says it wants to take control of the neglected Women’s Living Heritage Monument at Lillian Ngoyi Square in Pretoria.
The monument remains closed, four years after its launch.
The delays were due to disputes between appointed service providers and sub-contractors.
The multi-million rand facility was also declared a fire hazard.
The City believes it can take better care of the monument and wants to take over the facility from the Gauteng Department of Sport, Arts, Culture, and Recreation.
The monument aims to celebrate and preserve the history of women who played a role in the liberation struggle of South Africa.
Unveiled in 2016 by former President Jacob Zuma, the heritage site features statues of four struggle stalwarts, Lillian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Sophie de Bruyn, and Rahima Moosa, who led the historic 1956 Women’s March to the Union Buildings.
It was also set to have a leadership and development training centre and to boost tourism activity in the capital.
This week, Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams conducted an oversight visit at the facility and indicated that the city wanted to take over the facility.
We did indicate to the provincial government as the City of Tshwane that we are interested in taking over the project
but then if we are going to take over it becomes our project as the city.
Then we’ll be able to fix and make sure it’s in good condition because one of the key pillars here in Tshwane which were mentioned by the mayor during his state of the capital address is that we want to attract tourism and we do see this monument as one of the key sites that would drive that tourism drive.
We want to get onto it, so the city is interested in running this project, says spokesperson, Sipho Stuurman.
Squabbles between appointed contractors are cited as the main reason for the delay.
The condition of the building has since worsened due to vandalism.
It was also declared a fire hazard by the city’s fire department, which declined to grant a certificate of occupancy.
The situation currently with the monument is that it is not in a good state since the monument was launched in 2016, the building does not have an occupancy certificate but also the building does not have full-time staff who make sure its in good condition or offer security.
The building is not compliant with a number of building regulations, there’s also electrical cabling of the building that has been vandalized, several things in the building have been vandalized.
So, it’s not in a good state to be occupied, explains Stuurman.
It costs the provincial department of Sports, Arts Culture and Recreation at least R2 million annually for the maintenance and upkeep of the unused facility.
The Democratic Alliance in the Gauteng Legislature has called on MEC, Mbali Hlophe, to prioritise the project in honour of the historical legacy of women.
We feel that this is like money being thrown down a bottomless pit.
It’s something they need to prioritise; some of the things they are prioritising are not benefitting the arts and heritage within the province.
Maybe the department must start prioritising these things and ensure that the Gauteng community gets the value of these institutions, says Democratic Alliance’s Kingsol Chabalala.
The department denies the facility has been neglected.
In a statement, it says it is focusing on outstanding issues to get the occupancy certificate .
Spokesperson, Nomazwe Ntlokwana, says the facility should be fully operational in August.
A mobile breast cancer screening unit at George in the Southern Cape is providing women with the opportunity to go for a mammogram and breast ultrasound in a safe and convenient, out-of-hospital environment.
The unit, nicknamed Dolly, is the only one of its kind in South Africa.
It is operated by an all-female staff.
One in every 25 women is likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.
Radiologist Dr. Nikoli van Zyl says all women should have regular self-examinations and go for screening if they find any abnormalities.
She says it is very important that women over the age of 40 go for yearly screenings.
Dr. Van Zyl says they are encouraging early detection through their Screen-Her- Save Her campaign.
You diagnose cancer, preferably even before the patient is aware of a lump.
The earlier you detect it, the more treatment options you have and the better the outcome, the end for the patient.
That’s why we want to push the mammography and ultrasound awareness in the community.
It’s not for women who feel a lump, not only for women who have a family history of breast cancer, it’s for every single woman above the age of 40.
State-of-the-art equipment and highly specialised personnel offer patients fast and efficient radiology services.
One of the patients, Annelize Richards, says she will definitely recommend the service provided.
My experience has been great.
The ladies are so professional and so friendly.
With us ladies, this type of examination is so uncomfortable, but they make you feel at ease.
So, the moment they start with you their friendly
you feel at ease and forget you had any discomfort.
But the services don’t stop at the mobile unit.
The staff and ambassadors go the extra mile to support and guide patients who have tested positive.
Dr. Van Zyl says the Screen-Her-Save-Her Facebook group is also available to patients and their family members.
We have patients who have had cancer, who have recently gone through this whole process, who are available for newly-diagnosed patients to just speak to them and share their experience, because you can’t tell someone what its like unless you’ve been through it.
The mobile unit will be visiting more towns in the region over the next couple of months, including George, Knysna, Plettenberg Bay, Oudtshoorn, and Riversdale.
The Academy Awards, or Oscars, will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday and broadcast live on ABC television.
The South African-made documentary My Octopus Teacher, which won the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) for Best Documentary, is also nominated for an Oscar.
The film was directed by Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed and features diver Craig Foster as he befriends an octopus living in the kelp forests in the waters of False Bay.
Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate published a photograph of their youngest child Louis to mark his third birthday on Friday.
The photograph was taken by Kate at Kensington Palace, the family’s home in London, shortly before Louis left for his first day at a nearby nursery school.
The picture showed Louis smiling on a red bicycle with a school bag strapped on his back.
Tokyo will not host its motor show this year because of the global pandemic, organizers said on Thursday, underscoring Japan’s struggle to contain both a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak and the widening economic fall-out.
The cancellation comes as the government is expected to issue a third state of emergency for Tokyo and a number of other prefectures that could last for about two weeks, according to media reports.
The halting of the auto show, a marquee event of the country’s most important industry, is also likely to raise more questions about the government’s insistence that the relayed Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer.
The chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, said the group felt it was difficult to provide a safe environment amid surging coronavirus cases.
The show is normally held around late October to early November.
Such cancellations are bad news for an economy that like many around the world, has been badly hit by the pandemic.
Some analysts said another state of emergency could push Japan back into recession if retailers are asked to close during the Golden Week holidays, which start next week and run through early May.
The risk of a double-dip recession has clearly heightened, said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas Securities.
The impact of imposing curbs on Tokyo and Osaka alone would be quite big.
Japan has so far avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic that has plagued many Western countries, with total cases so far about 540 000 and a death toll of 9 707.
But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, coming just three months before the planned start of the Tokyo Olympics and amid a sluggish vaccination roll out.
Tokyo 2020 organizers said a policeman who worked with the Olympic torch relay in western Kagawa prefecture had tested positive for the virus.
With thousands of new cases resulting from highly infectious strain of the virus, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday the government will decide this week whether to declare the state of emergency for major parts of the country.
The governors of Tokyo’s neighbouring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures will request the same emergency measures as the capital, the Nikkei newspaper reported.
Four western prefectures are also seeking emergency measures, media have reported, bringing businesses in the large swathes of the country under tighter operating hours.
The government is considering imposing the curbs from April 25 to May 11, Jiji news agency reported.
It is also expected to weigh stronger curbs than those issued last time in January, such as requests for department stores and other big retailers to close.
We need to take stronger and more targeted steps than before including requests (for shops) to close, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency on Thursday.
Tokyo reported 861 new cases on Thursday, the most since January 29 during the third wave of the pandemic and previous state of emergency.
Osaka prefecture reported 1 167, down slightly from a record.
Japan’s economy has emerged from last year’s severe slump thanks to robust exports.
But analysts expect GDP to have shrunk in the first quarter due to the hit to consumption from the second emergency curbs that rolled out in January and say a second consecutive contraction in Q2 that would constitute a recession is possible.
The timing is not good, as it would hit service spending during the spring leisure season, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, of the latest curbs.
Tsunoda cut his forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 0.5% quarter-on-quarter rise, half the previously projected pace.
Four thousand people will attend the BRIT Awards next month, in what organisers of Britain’s pop music honours said would be the first major indoor music event with a live audience as the country emerges from COVID-19 lockdown.
The ceremony, to be held on May 11 at London’s O2 Arena, will form part of the UK governments Events Research Programme, looking at whether major events can take place in closed environments without social distancing.
This means audience members, of which 2 500 will be keyworkers who will be gifted tickets, will not have to wear facemasks inside the arena but will have to provide proof of a negative lateral flow test result to enter the venue.
They will also have to take a test after the ceremony and provide contact details as part of the country’s COVID-19 test and trace system.
This has been a long tough year for everyone and I’m delighted the night will honour the key worker heroes who have cared for us so well during that time and continue to do so, singer Dua Lipa, who is nominated for four awards, said in a statement.
They are quite simply an inspiration.
The BRIT Awards are always special, and this will truly make it a night to remember.
Lipa is among several singers who will perform at the event, the first live music show at the O2 in more than a year.
Under Prime Minister Boris Johnsons phased roadmap out of lockdown, entertainment venues can re-open their doors next month.
Not only will we be celebrating the brilliant music and artists that have helped us through the pandemic, but we hope it will provide a path for the return of live music that fans and artists have so sorely missed, said Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry and the BRITs.
We’re buzzing about the show and working closely with government, the O2 and all our partners to ensure all safety measures and guidelines are adhered to.
Behind an inconspicuous black door on a stairwell in New York’s 28th Street subway station, the person in the know will find cocktail lounge La Noxe.
The roughly 46-square-metre dimly lit bar is an oasis from the street noise and the screeching of the trains as they grind to a halt.
I think it’s almost a bit like Alice in Wonderland-esque, said La Noxe founder, Jey Perie.
The energy that you have in the subway, there’s like a very tough energy, like people going from A to B, and then the rush and you’re underground.
And then you enter here and it’s more like velvet and warm colors and flowers and carpets, he said.
I like the dichotomy of it, that contrast between the roughness of the New York streets and energy, then here it’s very peaceful.
Perie said he was initially hesitant to set up the bar in the space because it was so small.
But I fell in love with the location and the fact that its inside of a subway station is insane and its very unique, he said.
Like many restaurants and bars affected by the pandemic, La Noxe (pronounced La Noche) was originally slated to open in March 2020 but delayed its opening until last October.
Perie says the novelty bars popularity is now another challenge and that it has a 2 000-person waiting list.
The problem is, we’re tiny, he said.
Only like 10 people, 12 people can be here at the same time and (with) reduced hours due to COVID, we can now only operate from like 5 p.m., 6 p.m. to midnight.
Perie, who was born in the south of France and has lived in Barcelona, Hong Kong and Tokyo, said he fell in love with New York because of its diversity.
Luxury carmaker Ferrari on Wednesday unveiled initial details of its new supercar, the first of three new models it has promised for the coming months.
An aggressive roll-out plan of new models, which was not delayed last year by the COVID-19 pandemic, has been a key part of the company’s recent strategy to support growth.
The Shakespeare Schools Festival of South Africa that got off to a disappointing opening earlier this week due to the devastating fire in Cape Town has resumed.
The opening was cancelled after the emergency situation in the Mother City, but the eleventh edition is now in full force until the weekend.
About 15 schools and amateur groups are presenting abridged versions of well-known Shakespeare plays at the Artscape Theatre, in the heart of Cape Town.
Five troupes are simultaneously playing at the Masque Theatre in Muizenberg.
The event, which promotes life skills by focusing on literacy, classic literature and the arts, is also streamed to Russia, Estonia and Malawi.
Over the years it has become Africa’s largest Shakespeare youth drama programme.
Some of the highlights every year are productions by the De La Bat School for the Deaf that uses South African Sign Language and shows by the Pioneer School for the Visually Impaired.
Teamwork at its best!
A super congrats to this talented cast!
The Academy Awards are really touted as one of the most important sparkly nights delivering glamour, Ehrlich, who is dressing a celebrity for an Oscars party, said.
And I think it’s safe to say that after the year that we’ve all endured that a little bit of glamour and a little bit of sparkle is needed.
Among Ehrlich’s selection of dresses are classic intricately embroidered gowns, sparkling sequined dresses and a tailored suit looks she expects to see at the Oscars.
With no red carpet to walk down so far this awards season, many celebrities have dressed up and posed sometimes in their gardens for pre-event shoots.
(The BAFTA) ceremony at an empty Royal Albert Hall certainly gave pause for thought and put the emphasis squarely on talent, while reminding us of the joys of cinema.
South African crime fiction author, Deon Meyer, has received Frances’s top cultural award, Chevailer des Arts et des Lettres or Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters.
French ambassador to South Africa Aurlien Lechevallier bestowed the award on him on behalf of the French President, at Glenelly Estate in Stellenbosch.
Meyer has published 15 novels and three short story collections.
His books have been translated into 27 languages and published in more than 40 countries.
His appointment as Knight of Arts and Letters is in recognition of his work and his special relationship with France, reflected in many of his books.
Meyer has described the honour as humbling.
Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, the world’s oldest monarch, turns 95 on Wednesday, but there will be no public celebrations of an occasion that comes just days after she bade a sad farewell to her husband of seven decades at his funeral.
Prince Philip, whom Elizabeth married in 1947, died on April 9 at the age of 99.
The royals paid their final respects to the family’s patriarch at his funeral on Saturday at Windsor Castle.
Because of COVID-19 restrictions, the queen sat alone during the sombre service for Philip, who she had described as her strength and stay.
Elizabeth, who is also the world’s longest-reigning monarch, will be at the castle for her birthday, which traditionally passes off with little or no ceremony.
However, this year, with the royals marking two weeks of mourning, it will pass off with even less public show: there will be no gun salutes at the Tower of London nor the capital’s Hyde Park which usually occur on the queen’s birthday.
The queen also has an official birthday, which is usually celebrated with greater pomp on the second Saturday in June.
Philips’s death has robbed Elizabeth of her closest and most trusted confidante, who had been beside her throughout her record-breaking 69-year reign.
It also came just as she grappled with one of the gravest crises to hit the royal family in decades, allegations of racism and neglect by it from her grandson Prince Harry and Meghan, his American wife.
Newspapers have suggested that family members would be visiting the queen over the coming days to ensure she would not be left alone while mourning her late husband.
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson declined to comment, saying all family matters after the funeral would be private.
Elizabeth, who was born on April 21, 1926, in Bruton Street, central London, grew up not expecting to become queen.
Her father, George VI, only took the crown when his elder brother Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
She ascended to the throne in 1952 at the age of 25, and surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as Britain’s longest reigning monarch in September 2015.
Elizabeth is also queen of 15 former British colonies including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Protesting Free State artists have ended their 40-day sit-in at the Performing Arts Centre of the Free State in Bloemfontein after the appointment of interim acting CEO, Sharon Snell.
Artists have been protesting against alleged corruption and mismanagement at the centre.
They demanded the implementation of the 2018 Morar report, which implicated senior staff members at the Centre as well as a board member.
They also wanted the sacking of the acting PACOFS CEO, Meshack Xaba, who is allegedly implicated in the investigation report.
Free State artists demand relief funds and an end to graft.
The Free State Coordinator of the Cultural and Creative Industries Federation, Mbuyiselo Nqodi, says they welcome Snell’s appointment.
We will give the new CEO a chance to be able to settle in and be able to see what else she is going to do in terms of advancing what were complaining about.
But it is not entirely on her hands because this week we are getting a report from the Portfolio Committee on their visits and what and how they concluded with the institution on what to do.
But end of this week, we are going to get that report we understand that it going to be a long process the issue of the disciplining of Mr Xaba.
In late March, the group had demanded decisive intervention from government.
On Sunday, the threatened to intensify their action until their demands are met.
The Ditsobotla Local Municipality in Lichtenburg in the North West says it’ll step up security at the local cemetery, following the theft of a bust of Boer War General, Koos De La Rey, over the weekend.
Heritage Potchefstroom has raised serious concern about the theft.
It is believed that the copper bust was stolen with the aim of melting it.
De La Rey was a general during the second Anglo-Boer War and was shot and killed by police in September 1914, when they mistook him for a member of a criminal gang.
Heritage Potchefstoom Chairperson, Johan Wolfvaart, says incidents such as these lead to the erosion of the country’s history.
It illustrates the narratives of South African history and of course the most important thing about it that we must learn from it.
So the loss of every heritage site or building is a complete lost to the people of South Africa basically.
So that is why it must be preserved, explains Wolfvaart.
The Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge(FAK) has indicated that they will sponsor a replica of the bust made from material that has no economic value.
The CEO of FAK Dr Danie Langner says they will also assist to repair the grave.
We will repair the grave with the replica of General De La Rey later this year with the help of Jack Miller, adds Langner.
The Ditsobotla Local Municipality in Lichtenburg says it will ensure that the graves are fenced in order to curb theft and vandalism.
Spokesperson Pius Batsile says they have never had security at the grave site as they’ve never had cases of vandalism before.
There has been never a security at that grave side because we have not experienced any vandalism before.
That is why it has been a shortfall; actually an oversight from our side.
But moving forward, we are intending we are going to put proper security at that side, says Batsile.
North West police says no criminal case has been registered yet.
Reporting by Syllvester Serame.
The Federation for Afrikaans Culture Organisations (FAK) is still hoping to find the bronze bust of Boer General Koos de la Rey.
The bust was stolen from his grave in the Lichtenburg cemetery, in the North West, at the weekend.
The bronze bust of the iconic South African Boer War leader was made in 1917.
The grave was also vandalised.
A case of theft and vandalism has been opened by the FAK.
Project manager at the FAK, Johan Janse van Vuuren, says the loss of the bronze bust is a tragedy.
He says they are visiting all scrap metal businesses in the area in an attempt to locate the stolen artefact.
Van Vuuren says even if they find the original bust, they have already commissioned an artist to make a replica from less valuable material to restore the grave.
He says heritage sites are becoming targets for vandals.
Afrikaners are quite angry at this stage.
We are at a place where it’s a bad situation for us but we aren’t giving up.
We are going forward and if our heritage sites get vandalised we will make a plan to restore it.
Anyone with information about the whereabouts of the bust are requested to contact the police.
The involvement of women in traditional male circumcision is back in the spotlight.
The protracted debate has been revived by the recently released book titled Zajik Izinto by author Siphokazi Vannessa Mpofu.
Mpofu believes the involvement of women in this rite of passage of Xhosa boys into men could save lives as some of the initiates die during this ritual.
Every year, during the initiation season the Eastern Cape Province experiences deaths of initiates.
Mpofu says it is up to each generation to choose whether to build or destroy.
She maintains that women can play a crucial role in changing the status quo.
I am a firstborn girl and a firstborn girl in our tradition is considered as a man, as someone who speaks and negotiates with his brothers.
Mpofu says the generational gap between parents and their children often leads to misunderstandings.
Somehow, we clash. Us and our children.
We clash because of the times.
So, we need to communicate about things.
We need to sit down and understand each other as parents and the children of today for the generations to come.
Whatever we are doing, we are doing to correct the things that we did not like that were done by our parents for the generations to come.
The idea of women becoming involved is gaining traction.
Cultural Activist, Mncedi Liwani says women have a significant role in traditional circumcision.
What we are accepting is the intervention of mothers that they must come to the fore and culturally, they have a responsibility, especially in the Xhosa culture.
They have a responsibility whilst they are growing these boys.
They are giving them guidance for them to be proper men.
Now, if the women of this country could embrace their responsibility, first of becoming mothers to our boys, and we, as men, can take and teach them how to be good men, if ever we can do such, I think we will be in a good position to say, parents of our time have produced a good fabric of society.
Traditional leaders say women have always been part of this rite of passage, but with limitations.
Chairperson of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Langa Mavuso says, Mothers prepare boys for medical fitness of initiates, whether or not they do not have underlying diseases and so on, the beer is prepared by women, the diet for initiates is prepared by women and everything that would make sure that the boy becomes well, it is a woman that drives that, even the grass cutting for thatching the house is done by women.
So, it is not correct to say women do not have a role in initiation.
The pandemic is also creating difficulties with the custom.
With the winter initiation season cancelled last year while the summer initiation season was suspended halfway due to a high infection rate among initiates in December, a decision is still to be made about the coming winter season.
Jose Maponyane, the centre manager of Boulders Mall in Midrand, says the incident of him arguing with a customer was taken out of context.
This was heard during a hearing at the CRL Commission, where Maponyane appeared to tell his side of the story, following a complaint by Ndebele activist, Thando Mahlangu.
In March, Maponyane allegedly forced Mahlangu to leave the mall for being dressed in traditional regalia.
Mahlangu was inside a store at the mall when he was told that his dress code was inappropriate.
Maponyane was suspended shortly after a video of the altercation went viral on social media.
The CRL Commission summoned Maponyane to allow him the opportunity to explain the sequence of events that occurred at the Boulders Mall on 24 March.
Maponyane told the commission that he apologised profusely for the incident, however, he feels that the incident was taken out of context when the argument got heated.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere apology to Mr Mahlangu with regard to the humiliation and pain and suffering occurred as a result of the incident that happened on the 24th.
It’s unfortunate that the incident was misinterpreted as I had a cordial discussion with Mr Mahlangu before the video was taken, which was taken out of context.
I deeply regret the incident except that the treatment of Mr Mahlangu was totally devoid of principles of human dignity and equality that underpins our constitution.
Maponyane says that prior to the video being taken, he had a cordial conversation with Mahlangu where he asked him to cover up more of his body because other customers were feeling uncomfortable around him.
He says Mahlangu then repeatedly refused to cover up his body and thats when he asked him to leave when the video was taken.
The security came back to me and said, Sir, the gentleman refuses to cover and then I was obligated, as a centre manager, to go and address the situation.
So, I went there and had a cordial discussion with Mr Mahlangu.
When I asked him to cover because this is a public space, he said no, I am not going to cover because it is my tradition and I said, but you are exposing your underwear and an argument ensued.
I then said this is a public space and there are kids in the mall and people are already complaining and if you don’t want to, then I will have to ask security to escort you out.
CRL Chairperson, Professor David Mosoma, says it pains him to have seen such a heated argument over traditional attire.
I sit here with a very painful heart because I would have expected this behaviour or this interaction not between people who themselves have suffered so much in the loss of their culture and their identity.
Mosoma says the commission will study all the evidence of the incident and then make remedial recommendations later in April.
Discussion on preserving and celebrating African culture and history.
Crowds will return to Madrid’s Las Ventas bullring for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic next month for a charity bullfight to raise money for matadors left jobless by COVID-19, officials said on Saturday.
Almost all of Spain’s bullrings, or plazas, have remained closed for the last year due to lockdown restrictions plunging the controversial spectacle and its matadors into financial crisis.
A maximum of 6,000 people will be allowed in to watch the May 2 bullfight, Madrids regional government said.
That is equivalent to 40% capacity as the arena is considered the world’s most important bullring by fans.
Face masks will be mandatory and strict social distancing measures will be in place at the event.
Major bullfighting festivals such as San Isidro, Sevillas April Fair, and Pamplonas San Fermin in July were cancelled last year, with bulls being sent from ranches straight to the slaughterhouse.
But even before lockdown bans brought bullfighting to a virtual standstill, the traditional emblem of Spanish culture had been struggling for survival in recent years.
Attitudes towards bullfighting differ among Spaniards with some considering it an essential part of the culture while others say it is a cruel spectacle.
A 2019 poll for El Espaol, an online newspaper, found 56.4% of Spaniards opposed bullfighting, while 24.7% supported it and 18.9% were indifferent.
Stellenbosch Wine Routes celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, a milestone it shares with the birth of the South African wine tourism industry.
The Wine Route was developed in 1971.
Offering the highest density of premium wines in the country, Stellenbosch Wine Routes paved the way for the creation of the country’s wine tourism industry
The industry contributes R7.2 billion to GDP annually.
Johan Malan from the Simonsig Estate says the wine route has grown tremendously over the years, attracting overseas and local guests.
I think the biggest visionary that happened in these 50 years is the fact that it helped to spread the culture of wine drinking.
And also what happened later is the fact that restaurants started up on the wine estates, brought the food and wine together and that made Stellenbosch the culinary capital of South Africa.
If you look at the top 10 restaurants in the country, four are based on the Stellenbosch wine route.
The UK bids a final farewell to Prince Philip at a ceremonial funeral.
Prince Philip died last week Friday at Windsor Castle with the Queen reportedly by his side.
Meghan, the wife of Britain’s Prince Harry, will watch the funeral of Prince Philip at her home in California on Saturday after she was advised by her doctor not to travel while pregnant, a source familiar with the situation said.
Meghan will watch as Harry walks in procession behind the coffin of the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth and alongside other members of the royal family, including his father Prince Charles and brother Prince William.
The funeral, to be held at the St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Harry and Meghan married in 2018, will mark the first time the prince has met his family since the couple gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey in March.
In it they accused one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and said Meghan’s pleas for help when she felt suicidal had been ignored.
The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Meghan, known officially as the Duchess of Sussex, had hoped to attend the funeral
but she was not cleared for travel by her physician.
Much media attention will focus on the royal’s behaviour towards Harry.
The two princes will walk in the procession behind Philip’s four children and separated by their cousin Peter Phillips.
Harry and Meghan moved to Los Angeles and quit royal duties last year.
The couple also provided a wreath that included flowers such as the national flower of Greece to represent Philip’s heritage, and Sea Holly to reflect his ties to the navy.
The card was handwritten by Meghan.
When Prince Philip’s coffin is conveyed to church for his funeral service, it will be taken in a specially-commissioned Land Rover that the British royal himself helped design.
Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth, died last week aged 99 and his funeral will be held entirely at Windsor Castle on Saturday, with no public allowed.
Although the event has been scaled down because of COVID-19 restrictions, many traditional elements will remain, with a military procession inside the castle and pallbearers from units with close links to Philip.
However, in place of the usual hearse, Philip’s body will be taken from its current resting place to St Georges Chapel on a Land Rover Defender which has been modified to carry a coffin in keeping with Philips original plans for the funeral.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Monday it was fitting that Philip would be taken to his final resting place on a Land Rover, with a long wheelbase and a capacious rear cabin, which the prince had helped design.
The Jaguar Land Rover will be used to transport the coffin of Britain’s Prince Philip.
South African jazz pianist, Moses Taiwa Molelekwa, would have turned 48 today.
He died 20 years ago.
On 13 February 2001, the bodies of Molelekwa and his wife Florence Mtoba were found in an office which they shared in Johannesburg.
They had an eight-year-old son at the time.
His father, Jerry, says he’s still struggling to find closure.
It’s easy for people to say just find closure.
It’s not a robot you know. Its emotions you know
So, I still have a lot of questions and they’ve not been addressed even in the report.
The conclusion is that he killed his wife and then killed himself, but I don’t see any substance to that.
When I look at the report, it doesn’t state actually, just gives a statement but its not saying this is the object that was used, says Molelekwa.
A music academy has established in his honour.
Molelekwa played with the likes of the late Miriam Makeba and Jonas Gwangwa in the 1980s.
Molelekwa named Herbie Hancock, Bheki Mseleku and Abdullah Ibrahim as major influences on his music.
Thembelihle Dunjana says Molelekwa’s music lives through young artists.
Queen Elizabeth will bid a final farewell to Prince Philip, her husband of more than seven decades, at a ceremonial funeral on Saturday, with the nation set to fall silent to mark the passing of a pivotal figure in the British monarchy.
There will be no public procession, all the congregation will wear masks, and the queen, who says the death has left a huge void, will sit alone.
She’s the queen, she will behave with the extraordinary dignity and extraordinary courage that she always does.
And at the same time, she is saying farewell to someone to who she was married for 73 years, said Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who will help officiate at the service.
He said he expected the funeral to resonate with the millions of people around the world who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.
I think there will be tears in many homes because other names will be on their minds, faces they’ve lost that they don’t see again, funerals they couldn’t go to as many haven’t been able to go to this one because it is limited to 30 in the congregation, he said.
That will break many a heart.
He called on the British public to pray for the monarch.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had been by his wife’s side throughout her record-breaking 69-year reign, died peacefully at the age of 99 last week at the castle where the royal couple had been staying during a recent lockdown.
A decorated Royal Navy veteran of World War Two, his funeral, much of which was planned in meticulous detail by the prince himself, has a strong military feel, with personnel from across the armed forces playing prominent roles.
Army bands, Navy pipers and Royal Marine buglers will take part, while his coffin will be conveyed from its resting place inside the castle to the chapel on the back of a specially-converted Land Rover that he helped design himself.
At 1400 GMT, before the service starts, there will be a minutes silence.
The congregation will be limited to members of the royal family and Philips family, with no place for political figures such as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will watch the event on television where it will be broadcast live.
The entire event will be held within the walls of Windsor Castle and the public have been asked not to congregate outside or at any other royal residences to show their respects.
With a reputation for a tough, no-nonsense attitude and a propensity for occasional gaffes, Philip was credited with helping his wife, who he married in 1947, modernise the monarchy in the changing post-war period, and to deal with the many crises that befell the institution.
Last month, the royals faced their greatest such tumult in decades when Prince Harry, grandson of Elizabeth and Philip, gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey with his wife Meghan, who is not attending the funeral as she is heavily pregnant and was advised not to travel.
This is a funeral.
The arrangements have been agreed, and they represent her majesty’s wishes.
The palace has emphasised that while the occasion would have the due pageantry that marks the passing of a senior royal, it remained an occasion for a mourning family to mark the passing of a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.
The couples second son Prince Andrew has said his mother was being stoical in the face of a loss that she had described as having left a huge void in her life.
It’s a great loss, he said
I think the way I would put it is, we’ve lost almost the grandfather of the nation.
Garrett Bradleys award-winning documentary Time may be about incarceration, but, according to the director, its really a love story.
The Oscar-nominated film follows Fox Rich over several decades as she fights for her jailed husband Rob, serving a 60-year sentence for a bank robbery the couple carried out in the 1990s, to be released from prison in Louisiana.
I went into the project with the intention of extending the conversation around incarceration from a woman’s point of view, from a family’s point of view, Bradley told Reuters in an interview from California.
I would say that Time is first and foremost a love story that’s rooted in Fox Rich, the family matriarch who dedicates 21 years of her life and her family’s life to re-uniting her family.
Following a previous film on the same theme, Bradley began filming Time with Rich and her sons in 2017 with the aim of releasing a 13-minute short.
On the last day, Rich, who served a three-and-a-half-year sentence for the robbery, gave her more than 100 hours of her own footage to use.
The result is old video diaries woven in with recent material, in which Rich is seen caring for her family over the years without her husband around.
I like to think that there isn’t anything in the film that doesn’t speak to love and to unity and self-definition, Bradley said.
Facebook Incs independent oversight board said on Friday it had extended the timeline for deciding whether to uphold former US President Donald Trump’s indefinite suspension from Facebook and Instagram.
The board, created by Facebook in response to criticism over its handling of problematic content, wrote in a tweet that it would announce the decision in the coming weeks.
Facebook indefinitely blocked Trump’s access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.
It later handed the case to the board.
The board, which would usually have 90 days to make a decision, had been expected to announce its ruling in the coming days.
But the board said its extension of the cases public comment period meant it needed more time to review the input.
The board has said it had received more than 9 000 comments on the Trump case, more than for any other case.
Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez and former New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez called off their engagement because we are better as friends, announcing the breakup on Thursday just months after denying their four-year relationship was on the rocks.
We have realised we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so, Lopez, 51, also known by her nickname J.Lo, and Rodriguez, 45, known as A-Rod, said in a joint statement.
The African Continental Free Trade Area is a project of the African Union (AU).
Founded in 2018, it’s described as a framework through which to deliver inclusive and sustainable growth.
By July 2019, 54 of the AUs 55 member states had signed the agreement, with Eritrea the only holdout.
While negotiations are still ongoing, the trade agreement officially commenced on 1 January this year.
The idea is that it will be rolled out over three phases.
The World Bank imagines it as a means to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty.
But will it?
The experience of the EU could help show the way both in terms of the upside, as well as potential pitfalls.
In terms of success, the EU has contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.
It has also promoted economic convergence between its wealthier and poorer constituent parts.
When the EU was awarded the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize the committee argued that through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners.
It highlighted a number of achievements including the EUs contribution to the introduction of democracy in Greece, Spain and Portugal, the strengthening of democracy in
Eastern Europe and overcoming the division between East and West as well as ethnically based national conflicts.
In terms of pitfalls, the EU has seen its fair share of detractors and crises.
For example, questions were asked about its heavyhanded response during the Greek debt crisis and more recently about its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
But the EU has shown great resilience even in the face of losing one of its largest members, the UK, through Brexit.
Before becoming full members of the EU, candidate countries have had to meet strict criteria in terms of governance and economic conditions amongst other factors.
Its exclusivity is part of the reason for its success.
The main objectives of Africa’s free trade area are to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of businesspersons and investments.
There are tantalising opportunities for the plucking.
Currently, a massively underperforming Africa accounts for just 2% of global trade.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD)suggests that, if the trade pact is fully implemented, the GDP of most African countries could rise by 1% to 3% once all tariffs are removed
The World Bank estimates the pact will boost regional income by 7%, or $450 billion, speed up wage growth for women, and lift wages by 10.3% for unskilled workers and 9.8% for skilled workers.
Some thorny issues still need to be thrashed out.
These include bringing down existing tariffs.
For example, oranges imported from South Africa for sale in a supermarket in Kenya currently attract a 25% tariff.
Another unresolved issue is finding consensus over rules of origin.
Africa needs to overcome some other challenges too.
A temporary spike in prices should not instigate a removal of stimulatory policies from central banks.
Our report focuses on this precise issue
Among the key findings, governments failed to adopt key measures to enhance accountability.
We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects, Lopez and Rodriguez said.
One of the biggest celebrity couples in the United States for the past four years and sometimes known in the media as J-Rod, Lopez and Rodriguez said they would largely remain mum about the split out of respect for their children from previous relationships.
We wish the best for each other and one another’s children.
Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support, Lopez and Rodriguez said.
In March, they denied reports they had split, saying they were working through some things.
At the time, celebrity website TMZ, the New York Posts Page Six and multiple entertainment sites cited unidentified sources close to the couple as saying the pair had called off their engagement.
Rodriguez and the Love Don’t Cost a Thing singer, who sang at US President Joe Bidens inauguration in January, began dating in early 2017 and announced their engagement in March 2019.
Late last year, Lopez said the couple had postponed their wedding twice because of the pandemic.
She began her career as a dancer and a singer and produced and starred in the 2019 movie Hustlers.
She has appeared in other movies and on television.
Rodriguez retired in 2016 after a 22-year career in which he hit 696 home runs, placing him fourth on Major League Baseball’s all-time home run list.
In Nashville, Tennessee, the traditional home of country songs, the Academy of Country Music will hold its annual awards show on Sunday, incorporating small venue live broadcasts from classic genre landmarks.
With the coronavirus pandemic still ongoing, for a second year the awards will take place in multiple smaller sites around Nashville rather than the usual Las Vegas venue.
The 56th ACM Awards will, however, feature mostly in-person performances before live audiences including at Nashville’s emblematic Grand Ole Opry House.
The ACM award show is set to air Sunday at 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT) on CBS and Paramount+, with a line-up of more than two dozen performers, including co-hosts Keith Urban and Mickey Guyton, as well as genre stars Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Maren Morris and Luke Combs.
Urban, the 2019 Entertainer of the Year winner, returns after hosting last year, while ACM nominee Guyton will be the first Black woman to host the ceremony.
I’m beyond thrilled to be co-hosting with my friend Mickey, Urban said in a statement.
I love that everyone will get to see her infectious energy and uber creative spirit in full light.
Guyton’s performance of her critically acclaimed song What Are You Gonna Tell Her at last years show featured Urban as a surprise guest on piano.
She was nominated for new female artist of the year and will sing her single, Black Like Me.
Morris and Chris Stapleton lead this years nominations, with six each.
Morris got nods for The Bones as both song of the year and single of the year.
Stapleton, a nominee for both best male artist and entertainer, is also up for song of the year for Starting Over as both artist and songwriter.
Miranda Lambert follows with five nominations.
She is the most nominated female artist in the Academy history, with a total of 68 in her lifetime.
This time around, her Blue Bird is nominated for single, video and song of the year.
The 2020 show saw an unprecedented tie for entertainer of the year between Carrie Underwood and Thomas Rhett.
Rhett has been nominated for the same award this year, alongside previous winner Bryan, as well as Combs, Stapleton and Eric Church.
Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years.
We’re running out of sperm.
We’ve never had so few donors as during the last year, said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg’s University Hospital.
The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around six months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Its stressful that we can’t get a clear time or date for treatment, said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old maths teacher from southern Sweden.
Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy.
She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage.
It’s a national phenomenon. Thurin Kjellberg said.
We’ve run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm, she added, naming the three most populous areas of the country.
Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.
But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100 000 Swedish crowns ($11 785), making it unaffordable for many.
Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden’s national health service.
The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.
Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of six women.
Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.
Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around eight months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing.
If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors, Kitlinski said.
Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results.
In the meantime, the shortage lingers.
We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward, Thurin Kjellberg said.
The story of a Ndebele man clad in traditional regalia being asked to leave a mall has come full circle.
A video of his encounter at the mall went viral late last month.
The matter is now in front of the CRL Rights Commission, which has described the incident as a national crisis.
Thando Mahlangu was confronted by the Boulders Mall Centre Manager, Jose Maponyane, inside the Clicks Store and was told that the Ndebele traditional attire he was wearing was neither decent nor appropriate.
Maponyane could be heard in the video saying he would not condone the outfit at in my mall.
Lets cut the long story short, we’ve got a right of admission.
I don’t condone this in my mall.
So, ngicela uphume (please leave), Mapoyane could be heard saying.
Mahlangu was quick to remind Maponyane that his attire was African in Africa, to which Maponyane insisted that the attire was not descend in a public space.
The mall management has since said it regrets the humiliation suffered by Mahlangu and has since suspended the implicated centre manager.
Saddest reality in Africa, I was subjected to inside the @Clicks_SA store at The Boulders Shopping Center.
Only because of the center manager, who said it was his shopping complex.
I was told that I’m wearing inappropriate I must go & Omega risk solutions harassed me.
The 35-year-old cultural activist says this wasn’t his first humiliation.
The whole experience took me back to the incident that happened of a Gautrain.
, I was once kicked out of a Gautrain, for wearing isiNdebele traditional attire and speaking in isiNdebele, for believing in isiNdebele.
Redefine Properties, which owns the Boulders Mall in Midrand, says it has personally apologised to Mahlangu.
The commission today summoned Redefine Properties to a hearing to find out what remedial action they are taking following the incident.
Company CEO, Andrew Konig says they are conducting an internal investigation.
We deeply regret the incident and we have taken a lot of remedial action and this incident has held up a mirror for us to reflect on all our actions and our staffs actions.
We have publicly acknowledged that Redefine has distanced itself from the centre ‘managers actions and we do not condone what happened and we understand that Mr Mahlangu and his lady partner were treated inappropriately.
Konig said the Property group had also personally apologised to Thando Mahlangu as well as the Ndebele Council for the incident.
We have directly engaged with Mr Mahlangu and his advisors and Thursday was our last engagement with them and on Friday, a delegation of Redefine went to the royal council and we sat with the council and we humbled ourselves and paid deep respect to the Ndebele nation, as well as apologised for the incident at The Boulders.
We are happy to report that we left feeling that we achieved our objective to seek atonement for our actions.
CRL Chairperson, Professor David Mosoma says the commission will speak to all the parties involved in the incident and then make remedial recommendations later this month.
The importance of this is to ensure that there is a cultural diverse appreciation of cultures and religions.
We think, on the basis of that, we will not be able to give recommendations today, because we need to speak to Mr Maponyane and we request you to bring him on the 19th.
So, on that day, we will focus on him and the issues the commissioners have raised to try and understand where he is coming from.
Advocacy organisation Global Citizen has called on governments, businesses, and philanthropists to pledge more funds to help get at least two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses for lower-income countries amid the pandemic.
Reports indicate that several African countries may not receive enough COVID-19 vaccines to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus.
Global Citizen says donations to raise money for COVID-19 vaccines can be made during the global streaming concert on May the 8th.
Singers, Jennifer Lopez, Selena Gomez, the Foo Fighters and Eddie Vedder will be among those due to appear in the Vax Live Concert.
Global Citizen Director for Southern and East Africa, Chebet Chikumbu, says the event is in a broadcast format.
We have been able to collaborate with world leaders, artists, the business community and powered by our global citizens to ensure that we can witness a financial commitment being made towards this very important endeavour.
Global Citizen is calling for equitable vaccine rollout.
VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World will be hosted by singer Selena Gomez and also feature the Foo Fighters and Eddie Vedder, according to organiser Global Citizen, an international advocacy group.
VAX LIVE: The Concert to Reunite the World will be hosted by singer Selena Gomez and also feature the Foo Fighters and Eddie Vedder, according to organiser Global Citizen, an international advocacy group.
This is really an opportunity to call on world leaders to make sure that the 27 million heroic healthcare workers around the world that don’t yet have access to a vaccine can get access over the coming months, Global Citizen Chief Executive Hugh Evans told Reuters.
The event will also campaign for fair and equal access to vaccines for all.
The reality is that right now many of the wealthiest nations are starting to stockpile vaccines, said Evans, adding the broadcast would urge nations to donate excess doses and give financial support to the Covax facility, backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
Covax aims to secure 2 billion vaccine doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021.
The great news is there have already been many nations around the world that are starting to donate doses, Evans said.
Australia, for example, donated a million doses to Papua New Guinea.
We know the Norwegian government decided to make a donation of doses.
There’s really great momentum that is building, he added.
It’s been reported that most African countries will not have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses to vaccinate the at least 60% of their populations needed to achieve herd immunity and defeat the virus.
As a result, Global Citizen is calling on governments, companies and philanthropists to pledge more funds to get at least two billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as tests and treatments, to lower-income countries to safeguard their citizens.
To this end, the Vax Live concert, a first of its kind, will get under way in May.
It is a global broadcast event to call on world leaders to commit to equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, so that we can end the pandemic for everyone, everywhere.
Chebet Chikumbu who is Global Citizens Regional Director for East and Southern Africa shares more.
Britain’s Queen Elizabeth returned to royal duties on Tuesday, four days after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in an event to mark the retirement of her households most senior official, PA Media reported.
The Queen hosted a ceremony as the Earl Peel stepped down as Lord Chamberlain, the report added.
Philip, who had been at the Queen’s side throughout her 69-year reign, died at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99.
His funeral will be held on Saturday.
The Duke of Edinburgh, as he was officially known, married Elizabeth in 1947.
In recent years, the Queen has reduced her official engagements and passed many royal duties and patronages to Prince Charles, his son William and other senior royals.
But she still carries out the most symbolic royal duties, such as the opening of parliament.
Prince William, second in line to the British throne, hailed his late grandfather Prince Philip for his dutiful service ahead of his funeral on Saturday.
William, known as the Duke of Cambridge, said Philip was an extraordinary man whose life had been defined by service, but that he would have wanted members of the royal family to get on with their jobs.
I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job, William, 38, said in a statement on Monday.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man and part of an extraordinary generation.
William said he felt lucky to have had Philips’s example to guide him, and praised his grandfather for showing great kindness to his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.
Philip, husband of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II who had been at her side throughout her 69-year reign, died at Windsor Castle on Friday, aged 99.
Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will quarantine in accordance with coronavirus guidelines so that he can attend the ceremonial funeral at Windsor Castle.
Prince Harry returns to UK ahead of Prince Philips funeral.
The couple left Britain for a new life in the United States after a public rift with the royal family and a falling-out with the tabloid press.
On Monday, Harry praised Philip for his devotion to granny Queen Elizabeth II, and described the late duke as a mischievous host who could captivate his guests with unpredictable remarks.
Prince William and Prince Harry pay tribute to their grandfather.
Colourful lanterns and ornate Ramadan decorations filled the streets of Jerusalem on Monday as Palestinians prepared for a holy month freer of COVID-19 restrictions than at the height of the pandemic.
Ahead of Ramadans expected start on Tuesday, the mood in the Old City was far more joyful than last year when prayers were suspended at the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islams third holiest site.
Although Jerusalem is still without foreign tourists, far more people were roaming the Old City, where shops reported brisk business.
Because of coronavirus, the situation has been bad for the merchants and the people.
Now with the coronavirus vaccination, the situation got better, said one shopper, Mohammad Abu Sbeih.
Israel has included Palestinians in East Jerusalem in its swift rollout of vaccines.
It annexed the eastern half of the city after capturing it along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.
But it is unclear if Palestinians from the occupied West Bank will be able to come to Al-Aqsa during Ramadan, as in previous years.
An Israeli military official said no decision had been made on holiday permits.
The situation may be complicated by the far slower pace of vaccinations carried out by the Palestinian authorities than in Israel, which has faced international calls to ensure that Palestinians are inoculated.
In the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Authority said it would allow more shops to open at night and for Ramadan night prayers to be held in mosques, except on the busiest day of the week, Friday, when they would take place outside.
But it imposed a COVID-19 night-time curfew on movements between cities, villages and refugee camps.
It also banned restaurants from holding iftars the breaking of the fast at sunset and stores selling sweet pastries from opening their doors to customers, saying they could only make deliveries.
In Gaza, shoppers filled markets despite a recent threefold increase in daily infections.
That forced the Gaza health authorities to close schools, impose night curfews and ban large gatherings, but fell short of a total lockdown.
This year, we brought goods from Egypt and China, and there is a massive turnout by people, said storekeeper Hatem El-Helo as loudspeakers echoed with Egyptian songs celebrating Ramadan.
People want to bring joy into their homes.
Scrolling through the comments made on YouTube on Fela Anikulapo-Kutis music, one comes across remarks such as: The greatest unknown musician who ever lived, Why isn’t Fela’s music more widely known?
His music beats everything I’ve ever heard before and why am I so late to this?
The truth is that during Fela’s extraordinary lifetime, the Nigerians notoriety as an engaged citizen fighting for social justice was what usually attracted attention and not his music .
His public persona as a cultural renegade, an incorrigible iconoclast and social rebel hugged the headlines.
Not his intoxicating blend of Yoruba trance music, highlife-derived harmonies and African American funk and jazz.
He was artistically ahead of his time.
And nearly 30 years since his passing, the world is still playing catch up.
Fela was a social and cultural misfit during the prime years of his career.
He was blacklisted on radio.
The DJs who played his records were considered brave.
These defiant on-air personalities included Lagos Jacob Akinyemi Johnson (JAJ), who broke the mould in the 1980s.
It also didn’t help matters that Fela’s complex music compositions sometimes ran for over half an hour.
According to Fela, the value of music exceeded its entertainment appeal.
In his view, music had a spiritual dimension and so commercial considerations were secondary.
As I wrote in a recent essay, his temperament was uncompromising.
Fela Kuti is one of many prominent names nominated for induction into the prestigious Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.
Other big-name acts include Tina Turner, Foo Fighters and Iron Maiden.
We are already late in catching on during his colourful lifetime.
It does feel embarrassing.
But now there’s an opportunity, with the benefit of hindsight, to revaluate, redefine and bestow his due accolades.
Kuti’s recent nomination for a spot in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is a great start.
The common mans middle finger
Fela was special and he stood out in his music, lifestyle and activism.
There he was, always uniquely dressed in embroidered brocades and African-inspired prints.
Fela Kuti performed on stage with his band Egypt 80.
There was none like him then, and even now.
Fela was an avatar, an anomaly and a pioneer all at once.
And the ripples he left in his wake are still felt around the world.
Fela was difficult to love.
He always seemed too hot to handle.
He seemed out of place and was uncompromising in his art, politics and vision.
He was wild, uncontrollable and spontaneous.
This was a guy who had the sheer audacity to marry 27 women in a single day.
He was accommodating to a fault.
Hoodlums and common criminals were often able to seek and find refuge under his protection.
He found joy in poking at the finer sensibilities of decent society.
Fela was born middle-class, but on many occasions, he rejected classism.
He reportedly used luxury Mercedes Benz cars as transport for firewood, spinach and other indignities, to demystify affluence.
Due to his behaviour, his music was shunned by polite society and the political class.
Instead, he became famous for his serial transgressions, arrests, state-sanctioned physical assaults, 300 court appearances and spells of imprisonment.
He always referred to himself as abami eda, meaning the weird one.
It was true.
He was as weird as they come, and wasn’t afraid to revel in it.
And now, his robust life has become myth.
All we have left is a legacy of astonishing music.
We must now develop the language and critical tools to describe and analyse the potency of his work.
We must also begin to honour his music and cultural accomplishments.
Fela’s Afrobeat’s legacy.
There are reservations about how appropriate Fela’s possible induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is.
He created a genre of music that defies standard systems of categorisation.
It was the only way he could create art.
A tricky legacy.
It comprises a seductive fusion of diverse musical genres, politics, pan-Africanism, eroticism and funky, spirited grooves and attitudes.
You cannot separate one from the other.
And that is why his fans and imitators can only come up with a shallower, globally acclaimed subgenre Afrobeats.
Although, Felas work influenced todays Afrobeats, it is still a reduction of the original form.
Theres a wide gulf between Afrobeat and Afrobeats.
Felas work stands out in terms of musical proficiency, ideological rigour and spiritual potency.
Judgement in the matter between DJ Nkosinathi Maphumulo, popularly known as Black Coffee, and former wife Mbalenhle Mlotshwa has been reserved.
The Randburg Magistrates Court heard an application for a protection order, preventing Black Coffee from entering his former marital home.
Mlotshwa, popularly known as Enhle Mbali, applied for the protection order after she accused Maphumulo of domestic violence.
The two took to the courts following an alleged altercation in their home in March.
Maphumulo allegedly slapped Enhle Mbali on the wrist after a disagreement.
It is believed Maphumulo was unhappy with a birthday celebration held at the home.
Individuals, who came to support the actress, took a stance against Gender-Based Violence.
Family representative, Themba Mhinga, says Mlotshwa is seeking protection from the courts.
We believe that it is essential right now for all women, regardless of whether they have been to court or not, to be supported if they and when they come across any issue that is gender-based violence relate, explains Dr Moetse.
The DJ is opposing the protection order.
Nature conservation officials have finally been able to determine the gender of the baby white rhino that was born at the Rietvlei Nature Reserve in Pretoria two weeks ago.
The calf is a male and will be named Alpha.
Rietvlei Nature Reserve discovers a newborn rhino calf.
MMC for Environmental and Agricultural Management in the City of Tshwane, Dana Wannenburg, says rhino names are determined alphabetically, and Alpha is the first to be born since the last name, Zulu, was allocated.
Currently, Alphas mother, India, is keeping him well away from humans.
But as we head into the winter months, and with conservation officials running a supplementary feeding programme, young Alpha will become more used to human contact.
It will become much easier for the public to see him when they visit the reserve, adds Wannenburg.
The reserve said last week that Alphas birth reflected the success of their Rhino Conservation Programme, which dates back to the 80s.
The South African-made documentary My Octopus Teacher has won the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) for Best Documentary.
The awards presentation ceremony, held in London, had no audience due to COVID-19 restrictions and was streamed live.
We would like to dedicate this award to the nomadic community who so generously welcomed us into their lives, Zhao, who won the director category, said in her acceptance speech.
Thank you for showing us that ageing is a beautiful part of life, a journey that we should all cherish and celebrate.
How we treat our elders says a lot of about who we are as a society and we need to do better.
Outstanding British film went to #MeToo revenge movie Promising Young Woman, which also won original screenplay.
The academy also paid tribute to Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband, who died on Friday, aged 99.
Philip was named BAFTAs first president in 1959.
His grandson Prince William is BAFTAs current president.
Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi director Ang Lee received the BAFTA Fellowship, the academy’s top honour, for his contribution to film.
Prince Harry arrived back in Britain on Sunday ahead of his grandfathers funeral in Windsor, the Sun newspaper reported, citing an eye witness.
Andrew joined his siblings Charles, Anne and Edward in saying they had taken strength from the outpouring of affection and would rally around their mother in her time of grief.
You know it’s going to happen
but you are never really ready, Anne said in a statement.
Andrew called his father a remarkable man after he left a private church service in Windsor, near where Philip died on Friday aged 99.
I think the way I would put it is we’ve lost almost the grandfather of the nation.
Prince Edward echoed that, saying: He might have been our father, grandfather, father-in-law but he meant so much to so many other people.
Edwards wife, Sophie, told well-wishers of Philips final moments.
It was right for him.
It was so gentle.
It was just like somebody took him by the hand and off he went, she said.
Very, very peaceful.
And that’s all you want for somebody isn’t it?
US pays tribute to Prince Phillip.
Andrew has rarely been seen in public since he stepped down from official duties in 2019 over the controversy surrounding his association with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein.
At Canterbury Cathedral, the Archbishop of Canterbury prayed for those who found that the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip was officially known, had left a very great gap in their lives.
As part of eight days of national mourning, people gathered outside Windsor Castle and other royal palaces to leave flowers, while religious and political leaders expressed support for the queen, the world’s oldest and longest-reigning monarch.
A note attached to a Royal Navy peak cap left amongst flowers at Windsor, a tribute to Philips service in the navy, read: God bless you Sir, you were an example to us all.
A Greek prince, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she ascended to the throne.
The prince will be given a ceremonial royal funeral rather than a state funeral.
There will be no public processions, and it will be held entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle and limited to 30 mourners.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not attend.
Former British Prime Minister John Major, who was in office from 1990 to 1997 and who was guardian to Princes William and Harry after their mother Diana died, said he hoped the funeral would help reunite the family after it was rocked last month by an interview given by Harry and his wife Meghan to Oprah Winfrey.
During the interview, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that an unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their unborn childs skin might be.
Harry will return from the United States, where the couple now live, to attend the funeral while Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, will not, on her doctors advice.
The friction that we are told has arisen is a friction better ended as speedily as possible, Major said.
Condolence messages are pouring in on social media following the death of AKAs fiance.
The 22-year-old passed away on Sunday morning in Cape Town.
While unconfirmed reports have pointed to a suicide, the Forbes and Tembe families did not divulge Anele Tembe’s cause of death but only said she had been in a tragic incident.
The families have issued a statement expressing regret over her death describing it as untimely.
The families say they are still in shock.
Tembe’s body was found on a street in Cape Town.
She allegedly jumped to her death from the top of a hotel building.
Police have opened an inquest docket.
Tembe’s fiancé, Kiernan Forbes, known to his fans as AKA, is said to be inconsolable.
The Tembe and Forbes families described Anele as an exceptional and gifted young woman who had a promising life ahead of her.
Tembe is said to have had depression and had tried taking her life last year but didn’t go through with it after the police intervened.
This is literally just last night at @ayepyep CPT .
I can confirm that rapper AKA’s fiance Nellie was involved in a fatal incident in Capetown.
The rappers management is not at liberty to share any further details and have requested that we give the family time to deal with the shock.
I’m told AKA is grief stricken.
South Africans have been sending condolences to the artist and both families.
Some have even thrown witchcraft accusations, against AKAs former love interests, into the mix.
A claim slated by many, who even urged the accused women to sue.
Can you guys leave Zinhle out of AKA situation for once please?
You cant even spell her name correct.
Please leave Zinhle and Bonang out of this Nellie situation Lets be respectful
And let the loved ones handle this in peace.
People saying there’s no way Nellie could’ve committed suicide considering she was about to get married and seemed happy shows how much people don’t understand depression
We are a sad generation with happy pictures
This Nellie situation makes me realize that you can lose someone you love at any time.
It’s really important to appreciate them while they’re still alive
Mega, my heart bleeds for you
Truth is, people are silently going through a lot.
Be kind always, because everyone is fighting a battle no one knows about, and above all else, take care of your mental health.
Nellie your life is something else.
RIP Nellie. This song made me understand the love u gave Kiernan.
Nellie looked so happy.
If she was depressed, you wouldn’t know. which goes to show that you never really know what someone is dealing with.
I pray for her family, friends, AKA and everyone who was close to her.
Just like that?
My condolences to her family and Kiernan Forbes.
May God strengthen you all.
I’m out of words.
Condolences to Tembe and Kiernan families. RIP Nellie .
I don’t even want to imagine what Kiernan is going through right now.
That one, destroys me more.
A Kimberley woman, in the Northern Cape, has started a project dubbed Beanies for KH.
The project knits beanies, booties and blankets for premature babies born at Robert Sobukwe Hospital.
Due to its success, orphanages, and social service centres are also now benefiting.
Judi Jooste’s friend started the project to suppress her cigarette cravings, by knitting.
In no time she had stacks of little beanies and jerseys for premature babies.
Ten years later, the project has grown and is now donating toiletry packs to mothers.
When you have a premature baby, you don’t know in advance that you’re going to be in hospital for up to three months.
They run out of toiletries, out of everything.
Then we started asking TJE communities for donations of toiletries to make up a little package consisting of basic things like things that we take for granted, deodorants, the toothbrush.
We don’t think about those but when you are in hospital, especially now in COVID times, no one can come and visit you.
They can’t bring you this stuff and you can’t even go out for basic things that will make your life easier, says Jooste who is leading the project.
Jooste says old-age homes around Kimberley have joined hands with her.
Elderly women knit these little jerseys and blankets for leisure, but wool is in short supply.
There were ladies who started knitting projects in the old age homes.
They realise that if they bring those ladies out of their rooms to sit in a lounge and to be social, they become much brighter, much more involved and happier.
So then, we started asking for wool and that is, at this stage also, a big need, a ball of wool, explains Jooste.
Apart from clothing premature babies, the project also donates knitted dolls to Robert Sobukwe’s oncology childrens ward.
Report by Motlalepule Morake:
Beanies for KH is an initiative aimed at helping premature babies.
American music star Taylor Swift released a re-recording of her 2008 hit album Fearless on Friday, as the Grammy Award winner seeks to take back control of her early catalogue.
Fearless (Taylors Version) features 26 tracks, including six previously unreleased songs from the vault.
It has all of the original albums 13 songs and six more from the records platinum version.
It also features single Today Was a Fairytale and a remix bonus track of Love Story (Taylors Version) by Swedish producer Elvira.
It was the night things changed, Swift wrote to her 153 million Instagram followers announcing the albums release.
The 31-year-old, who has won 11 Grammy Awards, said in February she would release a re-recording of Fearless following a long-running dispute with her former record company Big Machine and music executive Scooter Braun over the rights to some of her biggest hits.
Braun bought Big Machine in 2019 after Swift left the label in 2018 for a new deal with Universal Music Group.
Last year, he sold Swift’s master recordings to a private equity company in a deal reported to be worth more than $300 million.
Swift released Fearless as an 18-year-old and the album, her second, catapulted her to global stardom as well as winning her the coveted album of the year award at the Grammys.
Critics said her fans would be pleased with the re-recording, with the singer staying loyal to the original version 13 years on.
Music website NME said the re-recording celebrates and stays true to Swifts Fearless-era.
Production here is crisper and warmer than that of the original, and Swifts vocals are, understandably, more mature, it wrote.
Listening back to the whole album has a similar effect to reading back an old diary especially as these songs are steeped in nostalgia given the prominence on first release.
The archbishop of Chiles capital Santiago, Celestino Aos, has been hospitalised after testing positive for the coronavirus, the Roman Catholic Church in Chile wrote in a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday.
Aos, 76, and Monsignor Alberto Lorenzelli, the auxiliary bishop of Santiago, were confirmed by the church as having tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week.
Both had received two doses of the Sinovac vaccine being administered by the Chilean health authorities, the church said, with the second dose administered on March 11.
The church said in its Saturday statement that Aos was admitted to a university hospital in the capital on medical advice and in a preventive manner.
Although the effects of the disease are moderate, they need to be addressed with specialised equipment to avoid possible complications, the statement said, adding that Lorenzelli’s condition had not changed.
A recent study by the University of Chile of national vaccination data and contagion rates suggested that the Sinovac vaccine was 54% effective at preventing coronavirus contagion two weeks after two doses are administered.
A broader, real-world study of the efficacy of the Sinovac and Pfizer vaccines being administered in Chiles rapid mass vaccination campaign will be published in the coming week by the government.
Aos, who is from Spain, was appointed Santiago’s archbishop by Pope Francis in December 2019 as the Vatican sought to turn the page on a sexual abuse scandal that has shaken its standing and eroded support in the conservative Latin American nation.
Aos’s predecessor, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, faces multiple charges that he helped cover up sexual abuse of children by Chilean clergymen.
He denies the charges.
South Africa’s largest urban nature reserve, the Rietvlei Nature Reserve, discovered a new born rhino calf this past week.
The reserve is ecstatic over its new discovery.
Rhinos are endangered in South Africa because of obviously poaching.
So its very good that they are breeding.
You know rhinos breed every three years.
The mother would have a calf maybe every three years and then shell chase the old baby away, then shell have a new baby. So they don’t breed like every year.
So it takes long for them to have calves, so its very important, says Conservationist, Jeanri Weidenman.
The calf’s gender is yet to be determined as its mother is still overprotective.
As soon as that mother is not overprotective anymore, she will come out with that calf into the areas.
But people are really driving into Rietvlei, seeing all the different rhinos and the species that we’ve got here, says Environment and Agriculture MMC, Dana Wanenburg.
Despite interruptions by COVID-19 in 2020, 394 rhinos were still poached.
This is, however, a sharp decline in poaching, the lowest in 10 years, according to the Department of Environment Forestry and Fisheries 2020 Rhino Poaching Report.
The Rietvlei Nature Reserve only had one encounter with poachers back in 2018.
As a precautionary measure, they dehorn their rhinos.
We haven’t had any incident in the past two years with poaching.
We’ve been very lucky.
We’ve been dehorning the rhinos and we’ve been upping our security as well, explains Weidenman.
Visitor numbers at the reserve remain limited due to COVID-19 regulations.
Britain’s Prince Charles paid a personal tribute on Saturday to his dear papa Prince Philip, saying the royal family missed him enormously and that the 99-year-old would have been amazed at the touching reaction across the world to his death.
As you can imagine, my family and I miss my father enormously. Charles, the couples eldest son and heir to the throne, said outside his Highgrove House home in west England.
My dear papa was a very special person who I think above all else would have been amazed by the reaction and the touching things that have been said about him and from that point of view we are, my family, deeply grateful for all that.
It will sustain us in this particular loss and at this particularly sad time.
Tributes continue to pour in for the late Prince Philip.
At the conclusion of the service, Philip will be interred in the Royal Vault.
Exact details of who will attending were not released, but among those present will be Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey alongside Meghan last month plunged the royal family into its greatest crisis in decades.
Bustling New York City may not seem a bee-friendly place, but its high-rise rooftops and tiny gardens are buzzing with honey makers threatened by pesticides in rural areas.
About 2.4 million Italian honeybees waited in a white van to be taken to their new homes early Friday.
It was parked near the Dakota Apartments by Central Park, where John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono has lived since 1973.
This is the first year that we’ve done this outside The Dakota, said Andrew Cot, president of the New York City Beekeepers Association.
We heard that Yoko likes honey.
Cot, who founded Andrews Honey, drove up from Georgia to deliver the bees.
The van held 200 wood and screen packages, each with about 12 000 bees.
A steady stream of beekeepers lined up to pick up their 3 lb packages which cost $159 or $205, depending on when they placed their order.
Bees are sold by weight, like cheese, he said.
Some buyers stuffed the packages in bags, while Ray Sage strapped two boxes of bees to his bicycle to ride to his hive on the Lower East Side.
I have to just ride really slowly and carefully.
Sometimes I think of it as I’m training to be Danish and I never become Danish, he said.
The number of urban beekeepers has grown quickly, with many hives now found on the rooftops of skyscrapers and office buildings, Cote said.
New York legalised beekeeping in 2010 and has hundreds of registered hives, according to the Department of Health.
Bee populations are in sharp decline worldwide, partly because of excessive pesticides and chemicals in rural areas, and a lack of crop variety.
New York does not have this problem, making it a healthy bee habitat, said Alan Markowitz, a Bronx resident who is a beekeeper at La Finca del Sur Community Garden, run by women of colour.
A third of what you put in your mouth needs a pollinator.
And in the city, believe it or not, bees do well because there’s less pesticides generally, said the former farmer.
Having a lot of variety is wonderful for bees.
A website and memorial mosaic benches have been unveiled at Jubilee Square in Simons Town in Cape Town to mark the forced removal of people under the apartheid eras Group Areas Act.
Simons Town was declared a white area in 1967, although forced removals started taking place two years earlier.
Residents from Luyolo, Red Hill, Dido Valley and Glencairn were forcefully relocated to the Cape Flats.
A place where people from all races lived, worked and played.
This is how former residents of areas including Red Hill, Dido Valley, the Kloof, Glencairn and Luyolo Village remember Simons Town.
That’s until the Group Areas Act ripped them away from the place they called home.
Thousands of people were forcefully moved to various areas across the Cape Flats.
These include Ocean View, Grassy Park and Gugulethu.
Today, the Simons Town Museum, together with the Phoenix Committee unveiled the benches and also a website, to memorialise the injustice of the forced removals and to honour those whose lives were irrevocable changed.
Simons Town Museum and former resident Margaret Constant says: I was probably 7 or 8 years old when we got forcibly removed out of Simons Town.
And for me, it was very hard because when we moved to Ocean View, we had no freedom, into a flat and we stayed in the middle.
My dad’s brother still stayed at the municipal cottages, and every holiday, I used to go back because I couldn’t handle the fact that I was forced out of Simons Town which was a community where everybody knew one another.
It was safe and everybody knew each other.
The mosaic benches, which depict specific streets from which people were evicted, were unveiled by some of the former residents affected by the forced removals.
Mzimkhulu Mamptua, a former Luyolo resident says: It was terrible to be quite honest.
Because when I noticed good people are being taken into trucks that couldn’t even take everything, people’s belongings, it was the one thing that broke my heart.
I was 7 at that time in 1965, I was born in 1958 when I had a tricycle, you know a bicycle with one wheel in the front and two at the back, it couldn’t fit in the bakkie.
We are remembering the forced removal of people under the apartheid eras Group Areas Act.
Simons Town is rich in maritime history and home to the largest naval base in South Africa.
But some believe not enough has been done to preserve the history of the forced removals.
Or the injustices of apartheid on communities who once lived here.
Former residents have been encouraged to contribute to the website to preserve their history.
Popular medical doctor and broadcaster, Sindi van Zyl, has passed on.
The 45-year-old had been in hospital for a while after contracting COVID-19 in February.
Dr Sindi couldn’t breathe on her own and was on life support.
She passed away on Saturday morning in Johannesburg.
Dr Sindi’s passing leaves all of us cold and sad.
She lived an exemplary life of giving, selflessness and grace.
To her family, especially her kids, condolences.
We share your loss.
South Africans recently banded together and raised money to assist with her medical bills, which were piling up due to the high cost of being on a ventilator.
They raised close to R1.5 million.
The Van Zyl family humbly thank everyone who stood together with them recently to help raise funds for Sindi’s hospital bill, in addition to the national outpour of prayer, love and support for her, says her family in a statement confirming her passing.
What a devastating loss!
Dr Sindi’s generosity & kindness made Twitter a safer community for many of us.
She shared her full humanity with us and was a reminder that compassion is more important than being right.
May Gods Grace comfort her loved ones.
May she rest in peace.
Van Zyl became popular by using her medical knowledge to challenge taboos around HIV and Aids as well as educate social media users on health matters.
She also offered support and advice to those who reached out to her for help.
I had the pleasure of meeting her a few years ago.
Had lunch with her & her husband.
I was touched by the love she radiated.
A truly beautiful soul.
Much love to Marinus, her kids, family & friends.
She was loved, is loved.
Love and light to the Van Zyl’s.
Not only was she a beacon of love and light on her Kaya FM show Sidebar with Sindi and all her social media platforms, but she genuinely loved and gave endlessly to all she knew with grace and kindness.
She modelled the love and grace that she knew in Jesus, adds her family.
Van Zyl is also known for her love for her family and beautiful things.
The self-proclaimed lover of things leaves behind her husband Marinus and two children, Nandi and Manie.
Her family has asked for prayer and privacy as it mourns her passing.
Details of her memorial and funeral will be confirmed at a later stage.
Today we are saddened to learn that Dr Sindi passed away.
She was one of the most beautiful souls on Twitter and her life’s mission was to mend lives.
May her amazing soul rest in peace.
Its very seldom that you meet somebody who’s kindness goes past her smile.
What a genuinely beautiful soul, may Dr. Sindi van Zyl’s soul rest in beautiful peace.
We really loved everything she was about.
A monkey sanctuary at Plettenberg Bay in the Southern Cape is ensuring that the animals in their care own the land they live on.
Monkey land Primate Sanctuary is the world’s first free-roaming, multi-species primate sanctuary, covering an area of 12 hectares of indigenous forest and providing ex-captive primates with a healthier, more natural lifestyle.
Home to over 550 primates including gibbons, howler monkeys, vervet monkeys, langurs, sakis, capuchins, squirrel monkeys, spider monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs and the critically endangered black and white ruffed lemurs.
Monkeylands Founder and CEO, Tony Blignaut, says due to the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis in the tourism industry, they realised future shareholders might not have the same passion for the animals they do and could decide to develop the land into something else.
He says they are now busy with a Buy a square metre of land for primates campaign, to buy the 216 000 square metre property from the owners.
The land-owning company gave us a bond to tide us over until we raise the money, which we are busy doing now through social media and anyway we can and its doing well.
People are buying square metres, it only costs R90 to buy a square metre for the monkeys.
And that’s progressing at a rapid rate.
So that’s where we are now.
Its the first-ever land ownership deal for animals.

It’s just a really sad moment, London resident Victoria Hasler told Reuters.
Wed known he had been ill for quite a long time and its just really sad.
And were just really sorry to the royal family for their sad news.
As news broke of Philips death, radio and television broadcasts were interrupted with the national anthem God Save The Queen.
Union flags were half-masted at all royal residences and British government building.
Very sad news.
He is a lovely guy and very sad for the monarchy, Adam Carr, a London resident, told Reuters.
Philips sharp wit and dedication to his duty earned him widespread popularity in Britain, but he was also criticised for off-the-cuff racist and sexist remarks.
Some people laid flowers beside a British flag outside Buckingham Palace and at the ancient walls of Windsor Castle, though the government urged people not to bring flowers to royal residences.
With the safety and wellbeing of the public in mind, and in accordance with government guidelines, members of the public are asked not to gather in crowds, Buckingham Palace said.
Those wishing to express their condolences are asked to do so in the safest way possible, and not to gather at Royal Residences.
A Cabinet Office spokesperson requested that floral tributes should not be laid at Royal Residences at this time.
The funeral arrangements for Philip, who always dismissed unnecessary pomp during his lifetime, are yet to be confirmed by Elizabeth who remains at Windsor Castle.
Details will be confirmed in due course.
Social media users have taken to Twitter to share their favourite songs, movies and memories of the late American rapper and actor Earl Simmons, known by the stage name DMX.
DMX died on Friday after suffering a heart attack.
He was 50 years old.
Some described his music as inspirational, while others said his songs were anthems that reminded them of their youth.
One of my favorite performances in one of my favorite films was given by DMX.
If you haven’t seen BELLY in a while or at all, gift yourself with his talent in that film this weekend.
Rest easy, Rest in Power, Rest in peace.
Thank you for the inspirational music through my youth.
Condolences to the Earl Simmons family, the world just lost a legend.
So I'm not going to say goodbye my nigga.
Instead, I would rather Focus on the time we spent together, that's what matters.
Hopefully you'll finally get to see Kato and your beloved grandma again.
When Mike Tyson walked out to DMX's intro.
The best walkout I have ever seen.
The energy and the ferocity will never be matched!
DMX was also known for his spiritual believes.
It is said he always prayed before and after every live performance.
This Prayer hits even harder now, hopefully he rests in the Lord's Bossom.
He was one of the greatest artists to ever touch the mic.
Hip hop is mourning today with the loss of such a legendary music icon.
Magashule has made it very clear that he has no intention to step aside.
He was asked to consult different senior leaders of the party, (and) he only consulted those who support his idea of not stepping aside.
So, they want to make this thing a technical issue, as if it is not clear, as if the criteria of who should step aside is not clear, whereas it is clear.
There is only one way in which someone can actually face charges.
It is if they are charged by any of the authorities within South Africa, says Mathekga.
Supra Mahumapelo defiant.
Meanwhile, former ANC Chairperson and former Premier of the North West province Supra Mahumapelo says he is still a member of the party.
Mahumapelo and acting North West Secretary of the ANC Women’s League, Bitsa Lenkopane, have lodged appeals against their five-year suspension from the governing party.
The two were found guilty of misconduct after allegedly convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in Mareetsane near Mahikeng in 2020.
Supra speaks out following suspension from the ANC:
Former President, Thabo Mbeki, says what many witnesses have told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture shows that the African continent has serious leadership challenges.
He was delivering his annual lecture at the University of South Africa in Pretoria.
Mbeki, who also paid tribute to former UNISA Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Mandla Makhanya, said strong leadership with integrity and high ethical morals were needed on the continent.
In the context of the proceedings of the Zondo Commission on State Capture, in this particular challenge about leadership, much of the inability of the continent to maximise its huge potential can be ascribed to a death in the right caliber of leadership on our continent; honourable men and women of vision and integrity whose committed to their people and their countries, says the former South African president.
On Thursday, African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa conceded that the governing party was slow in its response to the allegations of state capture.
He expressed regret over the delay in instituting a probe into the Guptas influence on the executive through Parliaments committees in 2016.
However, denied that this was due to deliberate resistance.
Former Transnet Group CEO, Siyabonga Gama, will take the stand at the Zondo Commission on Friday.
Former African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson and former Premier of the North West province Supra Mahumapelo says he is still a member of the party.
Mahumapelo was reacting to his suspension from the party for five years by the disciplinary committee.
Mahumapelo and Acting Provincial Secretary of the ANC Women’s League Bitsa Lenkopane are both charged with misconduct, after allegedly convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in Mareetsane near Mahikeng in 2020.
He says he has appealed the verdict of the Interim Provincial Disciplinary Committee.
EXCLUSIVE: Supra Mahumapelo speaks out following suspension from the ANC:
Mahumapelo says the ANC should not suspend members who are being accused of corruption.
He says the step-aside resolution will divide the party.
When you look at that resolution, I think we made a mistake as the ANC.
We didn’t take the resolutions to the lawyers to scrutinise them and make sure that every resolution complies with the law.
Look at what happened to Bongo.
Bongo won the case.
If Bongo was removed on the basis that he was formally charged.
It would have been injustice on him, says Mahumapelo.
He made the comments during an exclusive interview with SABC News.
Mahumapelo says members of the IPC hate him.
There are some of the comrades who are in these structures, who hate me with passion, it’s not political its personal.
The IPC has accused Mahumapelo of creating and promoting disunity among members of the party.
Meanwhile, the ANC says it will outline the process of its step-aside resolution, for party members facing criminal charges, on Friday.
The 30 day deadline for party leaders charged with corruption to step aside or face suspension from the party expires on Friday.
They include ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule and Member of Parliament, Bongani Bongo.
The ANCs National Executive Council decided at the end of March to implement the resolution that was taken at the party’s 54th conference at Nasrec in 2017.
Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says the party will issue a statement on Friday.
We have spoken about the issue of 30 days.
We have a meeting with the National Working Committee on Monday.
We have an NEC on Saturday and we will issue a statement tomorrow outlining those processes, says Mabe.
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says he regrets that the party delayed investigating allegations of state capture through parliaments committees in 2016, but he denies that this was due to deliberate resistance.
Testifying on his second day at the State Capture Commission as President of the ANC, Ramaphosa dealt with issues relating to political party funding, including his CR17 campaign, party discipline as well as efforts by the party to renew itself.
Ramaphosa has defended the need for Members of Parliament to toe the line, saying their seat is by virtue of the party’s ticket.
Summary of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosas testimony at the State Capture Inquiry.
Dealing with the issue of his ANC presidential campaign, Ramaphosa reiterated that the CR17 fund managers did not tell him who gave the campaign money as they did not want him to be beholden to donors.
He denied reports that the campaign raised R1 billion which was used for buying votes from delegates attending the ANCs National Conference in December 2017.
It was said a billion rands was raised.
It was never a billion rands.
I am told that the money that was raised was some R300 million, but never a billion or so.
I don’t know the facts because they literally kept it away from me.
I said to my comrades right from the beginning I never want to be part of a campaign that is going to descend into all these deviant types of behaviours that we talk about in the ANC-like vote-buying.
State Capture Inquiry: Ramaphosa on the party’s delay in investing the Gupta family.
The president went on to say that with increasing negative media coverage of the Gupta family and Bosasa, both of which made donations towards the ANC, and its election campaigns, should have been probed sooner.
In dealing with how to rid the party of fraud and corruption, Ramaphosa says the leadership has the will and the means to do so.
Chairperson the difficulty has always been the person is charged then at the same time they are disciplined they stand trial and the disciplinary process has been done and concluded and they are found not guilty in court what do you then do you go back so for instance if the charge was theft in the ANC and the charge is theft in the state what then do you do when they are found not guilty, says Ramaphosa.
The ANC now requires those facing serious charges to step aside, clear their names and present themselves at the party’s Integrity Committee.
Ramaphosa has ended his testimony as Head of the ANC.
He will appear to give evidence as Head of State at the end of May.
Herman Mashaba says the management of South Africa’s failing and ageing passenger rail services must be decentralised to allow qualified provinces and metros to operate rail services within their areas to provide services to the communities that they serve.
62.Mashaba visited the derelict Greenview Train Station, in Mamelodi East, in Pretoria on Thursday.
He plans to ask Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to investigate why the R102 million station is now derelict.
The station was built in 2011 but never occupied even though the railway track that passes the station still carries passenger trains.
Our President @Herman Mashaba just arrived at the Greenview train station in Mamelodi!
The building of the Greenview Train station can be seen from a far, but close up, it is a dysfunctional shell with the roof, aluminium windows, door frames, steel, rail tracks and other trimmings stolen by criminals.
The station that promised so much to the Mpomolong community, next to it, delivered more poverty.
He says the private sector must also be given the opportunity to operate privatised rail services on the rail network.
Mashaba says he was shocked when he heard about the Greenview Train Station.
When I was told about this, I said it’s not possible.
Though I’ve experienced, more especially looking at our infrastructure, how the ANC government has destroyed our infrastructure over the last 27 years.
As you’ve heard early on, well take it up with Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula.
The building of the Greenview Train Station was part of a R373-million investment of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) to double the rail tracks between Eerste Fabrieke and Greenview and upgrade the Mamelodi Gardens and Pienaarspoort stations.
Thabo Thobejane-Mphela is unemployed and has been living in an informal area adjoining the derelict station.
He says if the project was finished it would have changed the lives of the community.
Remember if the station works its job opportunity for others, says Thobejane-Mphela.
Thobejane-Mphela says the train station could have presented business opportunities for people and employment for cleaners and security guards.
He says community members often have to travel far to get transport.
They go far, there is the last station there, Pienaarspoort.
But if the station was working, it was going to be easy, adds Thobejane-Mphela .
Prasa indicated to SABC News they will only be able to comment later on the issue.
Mashaba says across South Africa, formerly functional train stations have followed the route of Greenview, having either been gutted by criminals or have fallen into disrepair.
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that it is untrue that his election at the party’s 54th national conference in 2017 was bought.
Ramaphosa continues with his testimony on Thursday afternoon.
The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has commended the private prosecution against National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise.
Modise is on trial for alleged animal cruelty that took place on her farm while she was still the Premier of the North West.
She is charged with six counts of animal cruelty relating to animals that died on her farm in 2014.
The party says this is both good stewardship and a demonstration that no one is above the law.
ACDP senior member of parliament Steve Swarts says the case reflects the highest form of accountability.
We as ACDP we believe that this is a measure of society to the most vulnerable including its animals, says Swarts.
We also believe that none is above the law including the speaker of the national assembly-the honourable Thandi Modise, adds Swarts.
Thandi Modise’s animal cruelty case back in court
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has defended the need for party MPs to toe the party line.
Ramaphosa says it is practice the world over that parties exercise discipline over their members who are taken to Parliament on a party list and it is only in exceptional cases where he believes that members should vote with their conscience.
The ANC President said a number of considerations need to be weighed up as a collective by the caucus.
You have got to look very closely at the consequences of that action.
Because if you vote to remove a President in a vote of no confidence, what then ensues.
Members have to ask themselves, is that what we want and certainly if that is the desire that is collectively agreed to then that is what has be opted for, explains Ramaphosa.
The ANC President says the issue of political party discipline is controversial and continues to plague even mature democracies.
Ramaphosa says a tension exists in South Africa’s constitutional framework that often makes the matter tricky to navigate.
Regret over Gupta Leaks
Ramaphosa has also expressed regret that the ANC delayed in investigating state capture through Parliaments committees when the allegations first emerged.
However, the President has denied that this was due to deliberate resistance.
Ramaphosa was responding to questions as to why the ANC chose to rebuff a proposal by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in March of that year that Parliament probe the allegations emerging from media reports on the Gupta family.
The ANC at the time made a counter proposal that those who had any knowledge of the matter go to the police or the Public Protector.
The thinking would have been which of the structures that we have in the state that would have greater effectiveness of investigating these matters and coming to a conclusion that prosecutorial processes should commence.
It was thought at the time that other institutions [like] the Public Protector, the South African Police Service (SAPS) may have had a better grip on all these matters, explains Ramaphosa.
On Wednesday, Ramaphosa said the governing party’s internal party funding guidelines were not suited for the time we live in.
Ramaphosa dealt with the risks of corruption attached to the lack of transparency in the donations and funding political parties receive.
He said this was why the Political Party Funding Act that came in force at the beginning of April, was necessary.
However, he added the funding of internal party campaigns needed to be looked at.
Below is Ramaphosa’s opening statement made on Wednesday:
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted that the ruling party was delayed in its reaction to emerging evidence on the Gupta family’s influence in the country.
Ramaphosa says the emails shedding light on this, known as the Gupta Leaks, had presented a flood of evidence, which required Parliament to begin its work on the matter.
Ramaphosa is testifying for a second day at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in his capacity as the leader of the governing party.
The Gupta leaks in 2017 presented a flood of evidence which could see the 2012 ANC National Conference resolution of more activist parliamentarians activated according to Ramaphosa
The Gupta leak emails were a flood of evidence that required the Parliament to start doing its work.
Ramaphosa says he regrets that the ANC delayed in investigating state capture through parliaments committees but denies that this was due to deliberate resistance.
Ramaphosa was responding to questions on why the ANC chose to rebuff a proposal by the DA in March of that year that parliament probe the allegations emerging from media reports on the Gupta family.
The thinking would have been which of the structures that we have in the state that would have greater effectiveness of investigating these matters and coming to a conclusion that prosecutorial processes should comment it was through at the time that other institutions the Public Protector, the Police may have had a better grip on all these matters, he says.
Ramaphosa says the emergence of the Gupta leaks had activated Parliament’s role to respond to the evidence.
Once these Gupta leak emails came out, it became clear to many of us that there needed to be a response of some sort.
The ANC knew that it needed to get to the bottom of this on a number of other structures.
This would have been in line with what Parliament needed to do at that time because a flood of evidence was now becoming evident and available, explains President Ramaphosa.
On Wednesday, he was quizzed on the impact of cadre deployment.
Ramaphosa said he was not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.
The ANC has taken this position knowing that the organisation itself would be placed under great scrutiny and that the process of examining these matters will be difficult and painful for the ANC.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption, said Ramaphosa.
Political analyst at the North West University, Professor Andre Duvenhage, says he expects a fight back from Supra Mahumapelo, following his five-year suspension from the ANC.
Mahumapelo and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League, Bitsa Lenkopane, were suspended from the governing party yesterday.
They were both found guilty of misconduct for convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee in Mareetsane near Mahikeng last year.
Duvenhage says he foresees Mahumapelo and the so-called RET forces in the ANC forming a breakaway party from the ANC.
He’s going to fight back, he’s going to mobilise.
I think, maybe a stronger scenario at this point is a break-away from the ANC.
I think the room and the space, for the RET group is becoming smaller and smaller.
And as a result of that, the option for them jumping ship is becoming bigger and bigger, says Duvenhage.
Political analyst, Barry Hanyane, believes Mahumapelo’s influence within the provincial ANC ranks has come to an end.
The former Premier has been put under the bus; even if he were to appeal it is pretty much the end of his influence in the province.
Even if he were to appeal, for a mere fact that he’s been cast out as someone who’s rebellious and someone where perhaps would want to revive suspended for five years from the ANC.
Whether there’s an appeal or not, it spells a death knell for his political career especially in his province, says Hanyane.
Mahumapelo is expected to hold a press briefing on Thursday afternoon
ANC alliance partners in the North West say they hope other members of the party will learn from Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party.
The African National Congress (ANCs) Mangaung region in the Free State has thrown its weight behind the National Executive Committees (NEC) resolution that members who are charged with corruption should step aside.
The Regions Deputy Convener, Sabelo Pitso, has told a media briefing at the party’s provincial headquarters in Bloemfontein that no one is above the ANC.
He urged party members not to allow themselves to be manipulated by forces that are not willing to subject themselves to organisational discipline.
True cadres of and members of the ANC always voluntarily subject themselves to organisational discipline.
This is exactly what Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma did in the past irrespective of personal wishes and preferences.
Once the NEC took a decision to recall them, they never sought to influence the gullible branches to cause confusion, disability and disorder, adds Pitso.
In the Free State to date, three of the five regions have rejected the imminent stepping down of the party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule.
They are Fezile Dabi, Lejweleputswa and Maluti-A-Phofung.
The Fezile Dabi region has gone as far as threating to interdict the ANCs NECs step-aside decision.
Magashule is one of ANC leaders who face fraud and corruption charges.
Friday is D-Day for them to step down from their leadership positions.
Failure to do so will lead to their suspension from the governing party.
SABC News Samkele Maseko elaborates on the Fezile Dabi regions stance:
ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is testifying for a second day at the State Capture Inquiry.
Yesterday while answering questions on the impact of cadre deployment on the functioning of the state, Ramaphosa said a balance needs to be struck between establishing a professional public service and delivering, what he says, is the ANC’s developmental mandate.
He told the commission that appointments in the state should be made in an open manner so that state capture never again happens in South Africa.
Today he is expected to answer questions about his 2017 ANC Presidential Campaign.
1He will also be questioned about the Gupta brothers amid claims that they showered some ANC members with gifts and money.
The alliance partners of the African National Congress (ANC) in the North West say they hope other members of the party will learn from Supra Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party.
The former chairperson of the ANC and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League, Bitsa Lenkopane, were suspended for five years from the ANC on Wednesday.
Cosatu Provincial Secretary, Kopano Konopi, says, we feel that it is high time the ANC becomes decisive on issues of discipline and demonstrate to all its members that discipline is something that must be obeyed in the ANC.
All the resolutions and constitution of the ANC must be respected, including the respect of the leadership that is leading the ANC at the time.
We hope that members of the ANC will see that the ANC is serious in instilling discipline in the organisation, adds Konopi.
Sanco’s provincial secretary, Packet Seaketso says, it clearly shows that nobody is above the organisation.
We are aware that they have a right to appeal their decision to the highest decision- making body, which is the national executive committee (NEC) disciplinary committee.
But the fact of the matter is nobody can do as he pleases or as he wishes in the ANC, without the ANC taking a decision.
Supra Mahumapelo is suspended from ANC for five years.
Mahumapelo says he will respond to his suspension from the ANC in a media briefing on Thursday.
He says he heard about his suspension through the media.
Meanwhile, during his address to his supporters on Sunday, he accused the ANC of violating the Constitution, saying some of the party’s resolutions are in conflict with the law.
He urged the ANC NEC to suspend its step-aside resolution until the party’s next national conference.
In the video below, Mahumapelo briefs branches on recent suspension of a number of prominent ANC members:
The ANC leader in the Western Cape Provincial Legislature, Cameron Dugmore, has accused the DA of applying double standards in dealing with party members.
This follows Bonginkosi Madikizelas resignation as the DA provincial leader and the Western Cape Transport MEC.
Madikizela falsely claimed that he had a B Com degree.
177. He’s said the so-called expos had everything to do with his ambitions to become the DAs Mayoral candidate.
He was initially suspended for two weeks as party leader and provincial cabinet minister.
Madikizela apologises for qualifications saga.
Dugmore says more consistency is required from the DA.
They have one way of dealing with Black leaders in the DA and another way of dealing with White leaders almost two separate standards that they apply nothing has been said about the allegations on Saldanha mayor in terms of the allegations that he fabricated his CV and we also know the history in George in the way that the DA dealt with mayor Malvin Naik, says Dugmore.
The DA in the Western Cape has welcomed Madikizela’s resignation.
DA Provincial Chairperson, Jaco Londt, says the provinces Community Safety Minister, Albert Fritz, will remain the acting provincial leader until the party elects an interim leader at its provincial council on May 29.
Londt elaborates on the DAs view over Madikizela’s resignation.
It is not yet clear why she stepped down from the position.
Her deputy, Arlene Adams, will assume her role.
African National Legislature (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to be quizzed about his 2017 ANC Presidential Campaign at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Thursday.
In his testimony on Wednesday, Ramaphosa acknowledged that the ANC had not done enough to deal with the phenomenon of state capture when it first reared its head in 2011.
He also defended the cadre deployment policy of the governing party saying there was nothing wrong with it in principle.
He alluded to the matter declaring that the guidelines for internal party funding are not suited for the present time and need revision.
He will also be questioned about the Gupta brothers in light of revelations of gifts and monies some ANC members are alleged to have received from them.
Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture had tongues wagging on social media as South Africans shared their views on the proceedings in Braamfontein.
The alliance partners of the ANC say they hope other members of the ANC will learn from Supra Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party.
Mahumapelo and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League Bitsa Lenkopane have been suspended for five years from the ANC.
They were both charged with conduct, after allegedly convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee in Mareetsane near Mahikeng last year.
Cosatu’s Provincial Secretary, Kopano Konopi, says, We feel that it is high time the ANC becomes decisive on issues of discipline and demonstrates to all its members that discipline is something that must be obeyed in the ANC, and(that)all the resolutions and constitution of the ANC must be respected, including the respect of the leadership that is leading the ANC at the time, irrespective of whether it is the interim leadership or it is the leadership that is elected at the congress.
We hope that members of the ANC will see that the ANC is serious in instilling discipline in the organisation.
Sanco’s Provincial Secretary, Packet Seaketso, the decision to suspend the two officials shows nobody is above the organisation.
We are aware that they have a right to appeal their decision to the highest decision making body, which is the National Executive Committee Disciplinary Committee.
But the fact of the matter is nobody can do as he pleases or as he wishes in the ANC, without the ANC taking a decision.
BREAKING NEWS: Supra Mahumapelo suspended from ANC for 5 years.
Political parties have called on State Capture Commission Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo not to favour ANC President, Cyril Rampahosa as he makes his appearance.
The parties have vowed to picket for the duration of Ramaphosa’s testimony at the commission.
Ramaphosa is to continue testifying at the commission in Johannesburg on Thursday.
DA leader, John Steenhuisen, says Ramaphosa should come clean at the commission.
I’m hoping to hear a full disclosure about the ANC’s policy of cadre deployment and how it lasted to the very part of enabling the state capture to take place.
Many government departments cannot deliver even on the most basic mandates.
And cadre deployment part of that people are not put into position on their ability to do their job and serve citizens, but their ability to channel money.
According to Ramaphosa the ANC did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture.
He says it was only in hindsight what was taking place became clear.
In his opening statement, Ramaphosa said he was not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption.
Ramaphosa said the party did not take much cognisance when the phenomenon of state capture was first raised by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula at a 2011 National Executive Committee meeting.
Mbalula said he had been informed of his cabinet appointment, by Ajay Gupta, before it took place.
He says subsequent interventions by then-Parliamentary Whip, the late Jackson Mthembu and then-Secretary General Gwede Mantashe, were inadequate.
It had shortcomings in living up to the expectations of the people of South Africa in relation to enforcing accountability and engendering a culture of effective consequence management as the leadership of the ANC duly elected at the 54th Conference.
State Capture Inquiry Commission hears evidence from the President of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa.
The ANC Disciplinary Committee in the North West has found both former premier Supra Mahumapelo and ANC Women’s League Acting Secretary, Bitsa Lenkopane guilty of misconduct.
Chairperson of the ANC Provincial Disciplinary Committee, Wendy Matsemela, says both Mahumapelo and Lenkopane have been suspended from the party for five years.
Both the above-mentioned respondents have been found guilty as charged.
The committee, therefore, concluded on the following: That both members are hereby suspended from the ANC for a period of five years with immediate effect.
And that both the respondents must be removed from the lists of public representatives of the ANC.
Mahumapelo and Lenkopane had held a meeting in Mareetsane village in the Ratlou municipality near an event organised by the party’s Interim Provincial Committee.
Matsemela says the disciplinary committee has further recommended that both Mahumapelo and Lenkopane, attend a political leadership programme.
Comrade Supra Mahumapelo (to) undergo a mentorship programme of political leadership under the former president of the ANC and the Republic of South Africa, Comrade Thabo Mbeki for a period of three years.
Comrade Bitsa Lenkopane, be also placed under a mentorship programme under comrade veteran Barbra Masikela to assist her for a period of five years.
Supra Mahumapelo suspended from ANC for 5 years.
The African National Congress (ANC) did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture, according to party President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Ramaphosa made this acknowledgment at the State Capture Commission on Wednesday.
Questioned about the ANCs development and deployment policy, Ramaphosa defended it saying it is not unique to the party and could not be faulted in principle.
The policy has been blamed for breeding conditions for state capture, promoting factionalism, and poor service delivery.
Cadre deployment cannot be faulted in principle.
It’s a common feature of democratic practice around the world and I think if properly described and not diluted through various other intents and forms, it is a useful process used by governing parties around the world to make sure that the mandate that they are given by the populace is carried out.
But we would concede that there are weaknesses in its practical implementation, that makes the case for greater clarity both within political parties and the state.
On the issue of a number of appointments made to SOE boards by Former President Jacob Zuma, allegedly with the aim of capturing the state, Ramaphosa pleaded ignorance.
He said it was possible to make appointments without going through the Deployment Committee as he himself as state president had done in error and some were made before he became party deputy president.
Ramaphosa will return to the stand on Thursday to continue his testimony.
The policy has often come under fire for the poor levels of service delivery by the ANC government due to some officials being unqualified to perform their work, a situation that Ramaphosa does acknowledge as occurred in some instances.
ANC Deployment Committee plays a recommendation and reactive role.
Earlier, Ramaphosa said he is not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.
He has reiterated the ANC and governments support for the work of the Commission as part of strengthening the country’s democracy.
Nevertheless, the ANC maintains that this commission is a necessary part of the broader social effort of ending all forms of state capture and corruption, says Ramaphosa.
Ramaphosa says the party has for a long time recognised the risk presented by the lack of regulation with respect to political funding.
Ramaphosa says despite the risks, any successful multiparty democracy requires funding in order to meet the needs of the electorate.
He says parties need funding from their own members, from individuals and businesses.
The ANC President says before the enactment of the Political Funding Act which came into effect on the 1st of April 2021, there were few restrictions on funding which the Act seeks to address.
The lack of transparency with respect to political funding increases the potential for corruption and the exercise of improper influence on political activity and government processes.
It wants to resolve this problem that the ANC resolved at its 54th conference that the ANC should champion the introduction of a comprehensive system of public funding of the representatives of political parties in the different spheres of government and civil society, he adds.
Ramaphosa says the party did not do enough to fight corruption and state capture.
He has acknowledged that the party did not take much cognisance when the matter was first raised by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula at a 2011 National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.
He says although there were subsequent interventions on the issue by then-Parliamentary Whip, the late Jackson Mthembu and then secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, these were inadequate.
It had shortcomings in living up to the expectations of the people of South Africa in relation to enforcing accountability and engendering a culture of effective consequence management.
As the leadership of the ANC duly elected at the 54th Conference, we acknowledge these shortcomings as an organisation.
African National Congress (ANC) president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that the ANC has, over the course of several years, recognised the existence of corruption within the state, its own ranks and other parts of society.
He added that the party could, and should, have done more to prevent the abuse of power and resources.
Ramaphosa continues with his testimony at the commission on Wednesday afternoon.
In his opening statement to the State Capture Commission, Ramaphosa dealt with the risks of corruption attached to the lack of transparency in the donations and funding political parties receive.
I said as President in the absence of clear appropriate and realistic guidelines, our leadership contests will continue to play themselves out in the shadows, in conditions of secrecy and mistrust encouraging patronage and factionalism.
Ramaphosa says the issue of state capture has been a matter of great political contestation for several years within the governing party.
Ramaphosa’s much anticipated two-part appearance is due to focus on among others his tenure as party Deputy President, as well as his role as the chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee.
Ramaphosa says the party has taken a number of resolutions to prevent corruption.
The ANC has, over the course of several years, recognised the existence of corruption within the state, its own ranks and other parts of society.
It has taken a number of resolutions on measures to prevent corruption, including on issues relating to state capture.
We must acknowledge that the issue of state capture has been a matter of great political contestation within the ANC’s differences over whether state capture existed, its extent and form and what should be done about it, adds the President.
African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says he is not at the State Capture Commission to make excuses for the governing party or defend the indefensible.
The ANC President has begun testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.
Ramaphosa’s much anticipated two-part appearance before the Commission is expected to focus on among others his tenure as party deputy president, including his role as the chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee.
Commission Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has thanked Ramaphosa for agreeing to testify in Wednesday’s proceedings.
Mr President, we are happy that you are here, representing the ruling party.
We are happy that the President of the party is the one who comes to give evidence to the commission.
I also want to say that your appearance before this commission is not a result of a decision taken recently, it is a decision that was taken in 2018 as you will remember, says Zondo.
Ramaphosa has reiterated the ANC and governments support for the work of the Commission as part of strengthening the country’s democracy.
Change of dates for Ramaphosa’s May appearance.
Meanwhile, Judge Zondo says Ramaphosass office will be advised on the change of dates in May for the President to appear before the commission.
Ramaphosa was due to appear before the commission on the 13th and 14th of May to provide evidence as the President of the country and the Deputy President during the Jacob Zuma administration.
Mr President, currently you are due to return to the commission wearing your cap as President of the country in mid-May.
But I indicated that we will have to advise your office that those dates will have to be moved towards later in May.
Because there are still a number of witnesses that the commission would still like to hear [from], adds Zondo.
The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is to hear evidence from the President of the ANC Cyril Ramaphosa.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has outlined their expectations ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture on Wednesday, saying they want the African National Congress (ANCs) Cadre Deployment Policy to be addressed.
DA leader John Steenhuisen says he will be attending this morning’s sitting of the commission to watch President Ramaphosa’s testimony.
Steenhuisen says the policy has allowed for state capture to continue for several years.
We would like to get to the bottom of the cadre deployment policy.
It has hollowed out the state and opened the door for state capture to take place in South Africa.
A large part of the problem that we sit with is massive failures such as Eskom, SAA, Denel. Virtually every other SOE in the country is as a result of that policy.
Meanwhile, the ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Ramaphosa’s appearance.
ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will finally appear before the State Capture Commission later this morning.
Ramaphosa’s appearance before commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will be in two-parts.
For the next two days, he will testify as the leader of the governing party and next month, will give evidence as the president of the country and the deputy president during the Jacob Zuma administration.
As ANC president, today and tomorrow, Ramaphosa will among others testify on what happened during his tenure as party deputy president, especially on his role as the Chairperson of the ANC Cadre Deployment Committee between 2013 and 2016.
The committee was responsible for, among others, the selection of public representatives, some of whom are said to be at the centre of the state capture.
Lobby group, Afriforum had since applied to question Ramaphosa on his role as the chair of the committee.
And after passing this hurdle, next month President Ramaphosa will face another gruelling cross examination on his role as the country’s second in command.
As former deputy president and now president of the country, Ramaphosa will, among others, try to rebut Brian Molefe’s testimony that he had been involved in state capture and the peddling of political influence for personal benefit.
Molefe said Ramaphosa used his position as the country’s deputy president to protect and secure lucrative coal deals for mining giant Glencore after it gave him a stake and appointed him chairperson.
He also said Ramaphosa and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan brought back loadshedding at Eskom when they took over in 2018, saying they forced out skilled executives as part of a ploy to collapse the power utility and pave the way for its privatisation.
Meanwhile, the ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance before the commission on Wednesday and Thursday.
ANC National Executive Committee member, Nomvula Mokonyane, says the ANC President knows what he is expected to respond to and will be able to put things into perspective.
The ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance before the commission on Wednesday.
Ramaphosa, who will testify in his capacity as ANC president, is expected to be questioned about his tenure as deputy president of the ANC and the country.
He is also expected to tell the commission what he knows about the alleged state capture said to have taken place during the Zuma administration.
ANC National Executive Committee member, Nomvula Mokonyane, expresses confidence in the leader of the governing party.
Mokonyane also touched on the party’s step aside resolution, describing it as a sensitive issue.
The resolution stipulates that ANC members who are charged with serious crimes including corruption should step aside until their court cases are finalised.
Party Secretary-General Ace Magashule is among those expected to step aside by the end of the month.
Anything that seeks to divide the ANC needs careful management and what is of importance is for us in the leadership of the ANC to reflect on how we manage the implementation of resolutions.
This is not the only resolution, there are many other resolutions that we to give our all in dealing with them, says Mokonyane.
Various ANC stakeholders have asked the party’s NEC to rethink the resolution, with some saying it should be suspended until at least the next ANC national conference or general council.
ANC Women’s League says the Step Aside resolution will further fracture the party:
Gauteng ANC Deputy Chairperson and Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, has apologised on behalf of the governing party for how it has treated ANC MP, Jacqui Mofokeng.
Lesufi says Mofokeng was overlooked by the organisation she served and loved.
He was speaking at Mofokeng and her daughter Thato’s funeral service in Centurion, south of Pretoria.
The former Gauteng MPL passed away at her home last Thursday, a day after her daughter succumbed to COVID-19.
Relatives say Mofokeng had recuperated and couldn’t handle the passing of her only child.
Lesufi described her as an exceptional worker, who got little recognition.
Comrade Jacqui loved this movement but I must declare that this movement also hurt comrade Jacqui.
Her choice to leave the province to go to Cape Town was not an easy choice.
To her was it was a healing process and to get out of the poisonous situation that continued to undermine her, says the ANC Deputy Gauteng Chairperson.
Jacqui Mofokeng and daughter laid to rest
Mofokeng was also described as a strong advocate for the protection of women and children as well as other vulnerable groups.
In Parliament, in a short time she’s been there we’re going to miss her because she was in three committees and she was felt in those three committees.
Newcomer as she was there of course nobody in police matter would beat Jacqui because she started long time ago.
So really, we’ve lost a woman, a woman we thought was still looking forward to some years helping push Parliament where it can be, said the Speaker of Parliament, Thandi Modise.
Her family described her as their pillar of strength and a lover of finer things.
It’s a double take, her and her daughter at the same time and we accept our fate that it’s a COVID environment and were of those who mourn in our country for this carnage, which I hope will stop very soon.
She was a snappy dresser. She had a bright mind and all her life she’s been fighting gender oppression, family representative, Justice Dikgang Mosekene, said.
Mofokeng has been laid to rest at the Lyttleton cemetery.
She’s survived by her mother, a brother and sister.
Her daughters remains will be cremated on Wednesday.
Former Mineral Resources Minister, Mosebenzi Zwane has admitted to the State Capture Commission that he appointed two advisers without any knowledge of what they were doing for a living.
He told the commission that Malcolm Mabaso and Kueban Moodley were appointed as his advisers because he could trust them.
Both Mabaso and Moodley were in business with one of the Gupta brother’s business associates, Salim Essa but Zwane insists that he wasn’t aware of their business interests.
He told the commission that Mabaso was appointed due to his good grasp of legal matters despite not having a legal qualification.
Asked what kind of business Mabaso was doing, Zwane responded I think he had done communications, but I can’t remember his proper qualifications.
Zwane has told the State Capture Commission that he had to use the Gupta’s private plane while on an official trip from Switzerland to India because he was sick.
Zwane travelled to India to meet investors despite losing his voice, while on a trip to Switzerland.
Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo asked Zwane why he couldn’t cancel his trip if he was sick.
I didn’t cancel the trip despite not feeling well because it was an issue that will go away tomorrow (sic).
EFF leader, Julius Malema, has encouraged all South Africans to fight for the land in order to work it and produce food for the nation.
Malema was addressing party members at Freedom Day celebrations in Atteridgeville west of Pretoria.
He says if freedom is anything to be celebrated, it must mean that all citizens have access to the land.
He says its uncalled for that 90%of the land is still in the hands of the minority groups in South Africa.
Yet we are called upon to celebrate Freedom Day landlessness, without food, he added.
Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi talks about land injustice .
On the upcoming election, the EFF leader says while the party is ready, it will take a lot of effort and determination for his party to make it to the top during the upcoming local government elections because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Government announced last week that the elections will be taking place on October 27.
Malema had called for the elections to be postponed until 2024, saying that holding the elections this year would deprive opposition parties from campaigning freely and fairly.
When we say let’s postpone the elections, we want to see the behaviour of the pandemic, because elections are rallies; elections are door to door.
How can you do elections without door to door?
President Cyril Ramaphosa has reminded South Africans that participating in Local Government Elections will give them an opportunity to get rid of corrupt leaders.
He was delivering the keynote address in Botshabelo in the Free State to celebrate Freedom Day.
Tuesday marks 27 years since the first democratic elections in South Africa on 27 April 1994.
Ramaphosa also says the country’s leaders must use the day to reflect on the missteps that have been taken place over the last 27 years.
He says the leaders must understand that the dream of 1994 is yet to be fulfilled.
It cannot be after 27 years of our democracy; our people are still being deprived of even the most basic services such as water and sanitation because of poor planning and incompetence of some of us.
Due to mismanagement or corruption of some of us, it cannot be that access to housing, education and decent health care are being undermined because those tasked with service delivery do not care enough.
The President says the fact that the dream of 1994 has not yet been fulfilled and has led to frustrations among South Africans.
When we resort to violent demonstrations when we resort to burning, looting and the destruction of property; we are undermining the very cause that we seek to advance.
We are also undermining the democracy that our Constitution offers to us.
Ramaphosa has promised to visit the troubled Winburg in the Free State after the 2021 Freedom Day commemoration was moved from Winburg to Botshabelo.
He says the change of plans was for logistical reasons.
Ramaphosa has committed to visit the area this year to listen to the concerns of the community members.
As the country commemorates Freedom Day, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has paid tribute to the late struggle icon, Charlotte Maxeke and the first ANC President John Langalibalele Dube.
Zikalala was speaking in Ohlange north of Durban.
He laid a wreath on the grave of Dube along with the Dube family.
He says the two leaders have paved the way for today’s generation to enjoy freedom.
We came here because this year marks 150 years since the birth of Mme Charlote Maxeke, but it is 150 years since the birth of Baba John Langalibalele Dube.
To us, he is one of those who are the symbol of freedom, he is one of those who are the path finders of our liberation struggle.
We are here today knowing quite well that South Africa has attained and achieved a lot under the democratic dispensation.
Contrary to many things that are said, we are living in a South Africa that enjoys equality and that would not have happened before 1994.
EFF leader Julius Malema has encouraged all South Africans to fight for the land in order to work it and produce food for the nation.
Malema is at Atteridgeville in Pretoria, commemorating Freedom Day along with thousands of EFF supporters at the Capital city.
He says its uncalled for that 90% of the land is still in the hands of the minority groups in South Africa.
The African National Congress (ANC)
Youth League in Limpopo has weighed in on the party’s step aside resolution.
It has called on the ANC National Executive Committee to reconsider the decision, saying it will deepen divisions in the party.
The resolution stipulates that ANC members who are charged with serious crimes, including corruption, should step aside until their court cases are finalised.
ANC NEC Members charged with corruption or other serious crimes must step aside within 30 days.
The leagues spokesperson, Nyiko Bembani, says the resolution is a witch-hunt aimed at eliminating political enemies in the party.
The ANC Youth League in Limpopo calls on the ANC NEC to carefully consider the possible consequences of the implementation of the step aside principle as it might have far-reaching ramifications on the state of the organisation.
We call on the African National Congress National Executive Committee, a structure of the apex of the organisation, to trickle down the guidelines at the national general council before implementing these guidelines.
On Monday, Fezile Dabi regional co-ordinator in the Free State, Reagan Booysens, said the region will interdict the stance on the step aside resolution.
The region said it had consulted all the ANC branches in the province in making sure that the party’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, gets the maximum support that according to Booysens he deserves.
ANC Fezile Dabi region says it will interdict NEC if Ace Magashule steps aside.
This comes as the 30-day period during which Magashule must step aside, fast runs out.
Magashule is facing corruption charges among others.
Addressing the media in Parys, Booysens said: We are going to interdict that (step aside) thing, we just waiting for the due date and we are going to interdict that decision.
We know the decisions we took at Nasrec and branches are talking about interdicting, because of the decisions they took in Nasrec.
Ekhuruleni ANC wants NEC to rethink the Step Aside resolution.
Nomachule Gigaba made it clear that she would rather not have testified at the State Capture Commission.
With her estranged husband Malusi’s failure to have her affidavit declared inadmissible, Nomachule was forced to take the stand.
She revealed that Malusi referred to the Guptas as his unofficial advisors when he was Minister of Public Enterprises.
He also received cash and various gifts and benefits from the family, including a BMW andR4.5million for their wedding and honeymoon in 2014.
In an attempt to have Nomachule’s affidavit be found inadmissible, Gigaba’s lawyers had cited marital privilege as a reason why communications between the two should not be aired in public as well as the acrimonious nature of the couples on-going divorce proceedings.
Malusi ‘Gigaba’s lawyer Richard Solomons, argued, Communications that took place between Mr and Mrs Gigaba within the marital privilege context should not be aired in public.
Secondly, we say because the acrimonious nature of the divorce proceedings, there is an inherent risk in the evidence and the veracity of the evidence that she will give and that will impact upon questions of credibility.
State Capture Inquiry: Malusi Gigaba’s application to cross-examine his estranged wife.
Zondo also dismissed Malusi Gigaba’s bid to have proceedings in camera saying he would hear his application to cross examine her at a later stage.
So, it was a very reluctant Nomachule who took the stand on Monday evening.
Her lawyer Mpati Qofa read a letter she had addressed to Zondo.
That is the first part to say I am unhappy with aspects of my affidavit for the reasons I have already announced and then she goes further to say that I come here with absolute respect for the commission and a civic duty I take very seriously.
And she says, that being the case, I am married t to Mr Gigaba still.
She testified that a couple of months before Malusi became Public Enterprises Minister in October 2010, he told her that he had been told by Ajay Gupta he would get the position.
Responding to State Commission Evidence Leader Anton Myburgh, Nomachule says the frequency of his visits to the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home subsequently increased and he referred to the brothers as his unofficial advisors.
He would differentiate them from the advisors that he had from the DPE, which I knew his legal advisor and Thami Msomi as well.
Asked by Myburg, did he tell you who these unofficial advisors were? Nomachule responded, yes, he told me.
Myburg further asked, what did he say? to which Nomachule responded, he had responded, It was the Guptas.
Ajay and his brothers which I don’t know all by name.
I am only familiar with Ajay more than the other ones.
Nomachule said that Malusi Gigaba had told her that the Gupta brother had advised him about work, about things that they were supposed to do.
She says she was told by her husband that the Guptas did not like then-Eskom-CEO Brian Dames and wanted him replaced.
She says this was just one of a number of appointments that Malusi was told to make.
He told me that the Guptas did not like him and he did not understand why they did not like him and I think they told him there would be a new restructuring, someone else will move to Eskom, then Brian Dames will leave and I did not know how the process would happen.
A few months later it happened.
Nomachule says Malusi received cash, various gifts and benefits from the Guptas over the years including a BMW and millions of rands to pay for the couples 2014 wedding and honeymoon.
She testified to seeing Malusi collecting bags of cash from the Gupta residence on a number of occasions, echoing the testimony of one of Malusi’s bodyguard in testimony to the commission.
State Capture Inquiry: Commission hears evidence from Nomachule Gigaba.
Nomachule Gigaba continues testifying at the State Capture Inquiry in Johannesburg.
The estranged wife of former Public Enterprises and Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, is giving the commission information about her husband’s dealings during his time in office.
She has told the State Capture Commission that her husband regarded the Gupta brothers as his unofficial advisors.
Former cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba’s estranged wife, Nomachule, has told the State Capture Commission that a couple of months before her husband became Public Enterprises Minister in October 2010, he mentioned to her that Ajay Gupta told him that he would get the position.
Noma Gigaba took the stand after Commission Chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, dismissed her husband’s application to prevent her from testifying.
Noma Gigaba received a summons to the inquiry after she declined to appear two weeks ago.
Her lawyer Mpati Qofa read a letter by Gigaba where she raised her concerns about her treatment at the hands of the Commission evidence leaders, the contents of some of her submissions and her continued marital status.
Qofa says according to her client, parts of her affidavit to the Commission are inaccurate.
Her husband, Malusi, tried stopping her from testifying, asking the commission to declare her affidavit inadmissible.
However, the inquiry dismissed the bid and is due to hear his application to cross-examine Noma at a later stage.
The State Capture Commission has rejected the application of former cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba that his estranged wife Nomachule’s affidavit be found inadmissible.
Malusi Gigaba’s lawyers had cited marital privilege as a reason why communications between the two should not be aired in public as well as the acrimonious nature of the couples on-going divorce proceedings.
The former ministers lawyer Richard Solomons says Nomachule is a reluctant witness as summons have been issued against her to appear before the commission and that her testimony may not be accurate.
Malusi Gigaba’s bid to have proceedings in camera should Nomachule be allowed to testify was also rejected by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo.
An application to cross-examine her will be held at another stage.
Communications that took place between Mr and Mrs Gigaba within the marital privilege context should not be aired in public.
Nomachule Gigaba is currently testifying.
Summons were issued against her after she withdrew her scheduled appearance before the commission nearly two weeks ago, citing unhappiness with the conduct of the commission through her lawyers.
She was expected to shed light on her estranged husband’s relations with the controversial Gupta brothers.
The Guptas are accused of having influenced some state decisions and securing backroom deals at state-owned companies, among other claims.
The ANC in the Eastern Cape believes the late party stalwart Steve Tshwete would have been disappointed with state of the sport in country, had he still been alive.
Tshwete died on this day 19 years ago and the ANC in the province held a wreath laying ceremony in his honour.
Mr Fix It, as he was affectionately known was the first Minister of Sport and Recreation in a democratic South Africa and was known for spearheading transformation in all sporting codes.
ANC Eastern Cape Chairperson, Oscar Mabuyane, says Tshwete would definitely not be impressed with the quality of the national soccer team’s game.
Definitely, his bones must be turning in his grave.
You can’t have Bafana Bafana not qualifying in this day and age with all the resources that they are exposed to if you were to compare him with the team of 1996, says Mabuyane.
The Tshwete family appreciated the ANC’s gesture.
I think my family, my son next to me is happy and we are all happy as a family, his widow, Pam Tshwete said.
ANC EC lays wreaths at Steve Tshwetes grave.
His son, Mayihlome, added: It represents a great deal for the family, remember I was raised by a mother and a father who always tried to remind us that the ANC doesn’t owe you anything, the ANC is the means for you to serve the people so for the province to do this for us as a family and as a community even though we did not ask for it speaks to the great value that they saw in my father.
The Premier and the chairperson spoke quiet eloquently about having to take some of the principles that my father represented and keep it going in this new generation.
Tshwete was 63 at the time of his passing.
He was serving as Minister of Safety and Security under the Mbeki administration.
Tshwete spent 15 years on Robben Island, after being found guilty of belonging to a banned organisation.
Shortly after his release in 1978, he returned home and became a teacher until his was deployed to national government.
The late ANC MPL and activist Jacqui Mofokeng has been described as a champion of anti-women abuse campaigns.
Mofokeng died at her home last week Thursday, a day after her daughter, Thato, succumbed to COVID-19-related complications.
ANC Women’s League members were among those in a drive-by memorial service at her home in Pretoria.
Women clad in ANC colours arrived at Mofokeng’s home, chanting struggle songs as they passed by the house to drop off flowers.
there’s no evidence or clear sign of a third wave; we still need to remain vigilant.
If we look at the test positivity rate nationally, it is still fairly stable.
We currently averaging just under 4% of positive tests and thats a 12% decrease compared to a week ago.
Northern Cape is still slightly above 10%.
In terms of the hospitalisation trend across the country, most provinces are showing a decline except for two provinces; Free State has shown an increase of 19% in the last week and the Northern Cape has also shown a slight increase of 16% compared to a week ago, he says.
Dr Suliman says while the positivity rate in South Africa is looking good, the country has to wait to see the impact of the Easter holidays.
Its looking quite good this past week, the number of new confirmed across the country is just over 1 000 on average per day and thats a decline of 8% compared to a week ago.
The seven-day average of just over 1 000 new cases is in fact the lowest its been since late May 2020.
With the recent easing of restrictions and the current holiday period, we will just have to wait and see if it will have any effect on the infection rates.
If we look at the curves of all the provinces, all of them have shown slight spikes in the last couple of weeks.
None of them are still on a sustained decline, he explains.
Discussing South Africas COVID-19 status with Dr Ridhwaan Suliman:
The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture says it understands that the public wants it to complete its hearings and work but says an extension is needed to do it properly.
The Commission announced on Thursday morning it would be applying to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria for a three month extension of its deadline.
Oral evidence will be completed by the end of July, while the report will be finalised by the end of September.
The Commission was supposed to have finished oral hearings by the end of last month.
DCJ says the commission will still continue to hear the evidence of other 5or 6 implicated witnesses including the evidence of the President in his capacity as the President of ANC and the President of the country.
Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the extension is important given that they have to hear evidence from another six implicated people including President Cyril Ramaphosa.
But the one thing I will not do is this, I will not end the work of the Commission in an irresponsible manner.
I am going to repeat that, I will not end the work of the Commission in an irresponsible manner, just because I want to satisfy those that demand that the Commission should finish its work.
When [we] started at this Commission, I made it quite clear that this Commission would do its work properly.
In seeking to complete hearings of oral evidence we will act properly and in [a] responsible manner, adds Zondo.
Today’s proceedings below.
The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture is to apply to the High Court this afternoon for an extension of its hearings.
The Commission wants an extension from July to September.
Commission chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo elaborates why they went beyond their June deadline.
The assessment that was made was made in good faith but it just did not work out.
The evidence that still needed to be heard beyond the end of March was very important evidence, it included the evidence of former senior executives of SOEs such as Transnet and Eskom.
DCJ says the commission did not have hearings recently and that its term will come to an end at the end of June, he says when the commission applied for the extension from the end of March to the end of June.
The Commission resumed today with oral evidence from former Transnet CFO Anoj Singh and will also hear evidence from former public enterprise minister Malusi Gigaba tonight.
Zondo this week announced that the Commission has limited time to wrap up its oral evidence and dismissed most of the applications for leave to cross-examine.
Some political parties say there is nothing to celebrate this Youth Day if more than 60% of young people are unemployed and trapped in poverty.
Exactly 45 years ago on this day, thousands of young people took to the streets to protest the mandatory use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in Black schools.
Many of them were killed, some were arrested while others including their leader Tsietsi Mashinini, went into exile.
Until 1994, many of them were killed in the struggle against the apartheid oppressive regime, while hundreds of those who left the country, joined liberation armies of the African National Congress (ANC), Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and Azanian Peoples Organisation (Azapo).
Decades later, some political parties say life is still tough for young people even under the democracy,citing unemployment and their daily struggle to overcome poverty.
Democratic Alliance leader, John Steenhuisen, says only his party has what it takes to turn the situation around.
DA commemorates Youth Day:
Congress of the People spokesperson, Dennis Bloem, says to overcome youth unemployment, government needs to introduce a training scheme for young people.
Zama Ntshona, from the African Transformation Movement (ATM), says all the challenges that the 1976 generation was fighting against during apartheid, remain.
The National Freedom Partys Secretary General, Canaan Mdhletshe, says government should make it easy for young people to open their businesses and realise their potential.
The concerns and suggestions come as government continues efforts to find a solution to the staggering youth unemployment rate.
During his Youth Day address, President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the National Pathway Management Network to assist in reducing high youth unemployment.
The initiative brings together eight government departments to form a network of support for the country’s youth to find ways to access the economy.
President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Youth Day address in the video below:
Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, has appealed to the youth of South Africa not to give up and to continue to educate themselves.
Malema was speaking at Horskool Uitsig in Centurion, Pretoria, in commemoration of the June 1976 student uprising.
He says education is the key to success and therefore the youth must grab that opportunity.
Malema says the youth should draw inspiration from the likes of the late struggle icon, Hector Pieterson, who died this day in 1976.
He left us with enough material to revive us, to equip us, to inspire us as Black people and to continue the good fight.
We are not the type that will just sit back and say we complain, thats not why we are here.
We are here to say to every White man, there is a place for every Black person in South Africa including here, he says.
The EFF leader says Petersons death must be solely blamed on former South African Prime Minister, John Vorster.
He says Vorster presided over the death of many young people in the country, for merely fighting for their rights as young people.
They don’t repeat the name, they don’t hypnotise you with the name of a murder who killed our people in 1976.
John Vorster is responsible for 1976, John Vorster is responsible for the murder of Hector Peterson.
And AKK those who came after him, because they did not prosecute him they too have got blood of Hector Peterson, he told EFF supporters.
EFF marks Youth Day in Centurion:
Vaccine woes.
Malema also touched on the countrys vaccine challenges.
He says his party will picket outside the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) headquarters in Pretoria on Friday next week.
It will be demanding that the Chinese vaccine and that of Russia be approved for use in South Africa.
He says the delay by government in driving the vaccination process is going to cost a lot of lives.
The EFF leader says should they not be happy, they will stage a sit-in at the house of SAHPRA CEO, Dr Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela until their call is headed.
After picketing there next week Friday, they have seven days to approve the Russian vaccine and the Chinese vaccine, failure to do so, were do stage a sleep in at the house of the CEO of SAHPRA until they protect us, it is personal like that.
It is personal like that.
We are going to her house, we want her to approve Sputnik and Chinese vaccine to add on what we have now, he says.
South Africa is currently using the Johnson and Johnson and the Pfizer vaccine is the second phase of its vaccination programme.
The young people of South Africa are in a permanent state of depression and hopelessness.
Largely because we have given up the baton.
All revolutions across the world were led by decisive, united and radical young people.
The fact that our country is in a speedy state of demise is one that cannot be argued anymore.
The rate of youth unemployment speaks volumes.
This dizzying 46.3% unemployment rate of young people was coming COVID-19 or not.
Savanna and the Yanos (culture of excessive youth partying) have taken over, the revolution is happening there.
But what about the realities that will still remain even after a night of groove?
The true liberation of this country will not happen for as long as we are still stuck in the delusion of drunkenness and twerking.
As we commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Soweto massacre, which has been renamed
Notwithstanding the fact that, as youth, we are within a permanent stage of depression and hopelessness, our brothers and sisters need to realise that no one is going to come to our rescue.
We have given too much power to old political careerists to destroy our future.
These people are busy building and cementing their careers and in doing so, they will make sure that young people do not emerge because they know clearly that once we take power we will make sure that all criminals rot in jail.
The future belongs to us.
All our current leaders will not be with us on earth in 2063.
We are the ones who will have to account to the next generations as to why did we allow criminals to lead us and destroy the future.
COVID, a blessing
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for young people in the country as it necessitated the urgency of technological adoption and integration into our lives.
The old generation is still struggling with even clicking a link to join a virtual meeting.
This is a field for young people to play in.
Let us forget the obsession of looking for jobs because that was relevant until the end of the third industrial revolution.
This fourth revolution requires us to be innovative and bring about sustainable solutions.
As the electoral system opens for individual candidates, young people should be ready to run for all positions, even if it means challenging a pensioner of a political organisation that you belong in.
We need to declare ageism an enemy in public service and government.
The time for young people is now!
I do not believe that when Solomon Mahlangu said we should continue the struggle he meant that we should do exactly what we saw destroying him.
The enemy we are facing today does not have a specific colour.
We need to contest power and challenge ageism everywhere.
The only way to win is to forcefully and strategically contest and take power.
We are dreaming if we think that we are going to be given space by the same people who are responsible for our suffering.
We need to take up space forcefully and strategically so, not by destroying the little that we have.
Young people are capable, singayisusa nomanini na!
By Kabelo Mahlobogwane, businessman, unionist and public speaker.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the launch of the National Pathway Management Network to assist in reducing the countrys high youth unemployment rate.
The initiative brings together eight government departments that will support the youth in finding their way into the economy.
Speaking virtually at governments Youth Day event, Ramaphosa says the network will complement governments efforts to create spaces where young people can access information, opportunities and support.
I want to make a call to young South Africans to register on SA YOUTH MOBI, you can create a profile of yourself, view opportunities for learning and earning and receive support through multiple channels.
SA YOUTH MOBI has been zero-rated by all mobile networks so that it can be accessed by young people across the country at no cost, all you need is a mobile phone or a computer.
Youth Day 2021 celebrations:
Earlier, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala condemned racial violence at schools.
The Premier was one of the speakers at the Youth Day commemorations in Pietermaritzburg.
Zikalala’s statements follow the violent clash between white and black parents this week at the Witbank Technical High School after a racist incident.
We note the disappointing incidents of racial intolerance that some of our schools 26 years into democracy.
We want to affirm that ours is a truly non-racial society wherein schools in society and in all areas people must enjoy society including access to quality education wherever they want.
Premier Zikalala speaks to SABC reporter Simphiwe Makhanya.
Zikalala also condemned the attacks against the LGBTQI community following the stabbing, rape and killing of 21-year-old Anele Bengu of KwaMakhuta, south of Durban
Reflection 45 years on.
According to Sport, Arts and Culture, Minister Nathi Mthethwa the country reflects today on whether there has been any progress since the youth took a stand against the apartheid system 45 years ago.
Minister Mthethwa speaks to SABC reporter Simphiwe Makhanya.
It is through them that we meet 45 years later and reflect on the road which we have traversed since 1994 and asking ourselves questions whether what they fought for whether the stand they took has borne any fruits.
NYDA laments funding crisis at higher education institutions
National Youth Development Agency CEO Waseem Carrim has lamented the funding crisis young people face at the countrys higher education institutions.
He was also speaking at governments hybrid Youth Day event.
He says students recurring protests at the beginning of each year must come to an end.
Carrim speaks to SABC reporter Simphiwe Makhanya:
It is important to say that young people work hard they struggle through school and they obtain their bachelors passes only to arrive at the gates of higher learning institutions only to be told that there is no money.
Young people gathered under the banner of asinamali, our only crime is to be poor in this country.
We must urgently fast-track the commission on higher education and the task team so that we end the crisis of funding for students so that come 2022 every young person who is academically qualified my have a place at an institution of higher learning.
Drugs and substance abuse among youth
Among young people who attended the National Youth Day commemoration in Pietermaritzburg, many say there is hope for the future.
However, there are also fears as more young people are falling victims to drugs and substance abuse.
Prineesa Govender and Mampho Moshoeshoe say their greatest concern is gender-based violence.
One of the struggles we face is trying to raise ourselves because people dont want to listen to and they think whatever we say will always be wrong.
Or it doesnt mean anything, so we would like to empower our voices, and we would like people to listen to what we say.
Because we are the future and we think we will make this country better.
My fears about being a young person is the fact that young people these days dont take life seriously.
They just live for the moment.
It hurts to see young people wasting their lives drinking.
Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members are gathering at the Horskool Uitsig in Centurion this morning where their leader, Julius Malema is expected to address them as part of Youth Day celebrations.
The EFF South Africa will mark Youth Day at Horskool Uitsig in Centurion.
This is after a video went viral last week of the pupil being manhandled by a white security guard because the child was wearing EFF regalia as part of career day.
The party chose the school as the venue, following an incident where a learner wearing EFF regalia was allegedly assaulted by a security guard recently.
Yesterday, Malema took to Twitter indicating that he will not adhere to the level 3 lockdown restriction announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa last night and will continue with the partys programs in preparation for the October municipal elections.
We are proceeding tomorrow.
You @CyrilRamaphosa can’t call for elections and close the political space.
Only fools will listen to stupidity.
How do you close once-off political events and allow schools to continue if there's a crises.
EFF General Secretary Marshall Dlamini says this commemoration is taking place at this school to showcase that they are not scared to be anywhere in the country.
On a career day, a young man who was wearing EFF regalia showing the aspiration of being an EFF future activist was violently removed from the school by the racist security guard.
Because they think they have the authority of where black people must be in this country and dictate our movement, we are here to show them that we are not scared of them.
Marshall Dlamini speaks to reporter Natasha Phiri:
President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered a virtual keynote address at Youth Day celebrations in Pietermaritzburg, in KwaZulu-Natal, with the event being a hybrid event due to new lockdown regulations.
South Africans commemorate Youth Day on Wednesday, 16 June.
This day remembers the Soweto youth uprising of June 16, 1976 following a directive from the then Bantu Education Department that Afrikaans had to be used on an equal basis with English as a language of instruction in secondary schools.
Pupils from Black schools across the country responded to it with a series of demonstrations.
The protests soon turned violent.
Unofficial figures put the death toll of the protest at 176, while the government said 23 pupils lost their lives that day.
That generation of young people is lauded for its leadership and bravery in confronting the apartheid regime.
While the current crop of young people has also spearheaded campaigns such as the #FeesMustFall and #RhodesMustFall movements, which some student leaders said was aimed at dismantling the anti-Black system that maintains Black oppression, there have been concerns about a perceived leadership vacuum in the youth space.
In this special Youth Day podcast, SABC News Producer, Lebo Tshangela, speaks to Political Analyst TK Pooe, Youth Labs Managing Director Pearl Pillay, and Fees Must Fall student leader Mcebo Dlamini about the leadership vacuumBelow is the full podcast:
The State Capture Commission has dismissed AfriForums application to cross-examine ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa because it was outside of the commissions rules.
Justice Raymond Zondo says for a person to apply for leave to cross-examine, that person must be implicated by the witness.
AfriForum told Zondo they wanted to question Ramaphosa about cadre deployment and decisions that were taken when he was chairman of the cadre deployment committee.
AfriForum wants Ramaphosa to answer on ANCs cadre deployment policy:
AfriForum legal counsel, Mia du Plessis, failed to convince Zondo.
It is the ANC view that the cadre deployment is inconsistent with the view of fairness and transparency and merits in the appointments of individuals to public entities.
When advocate Pretorious proposed to President Ramaphosa there has been evidence that the deployment policy goes far beyond merit, President Ramaphosa denied this and stated that the deployment commission merely recommends.
In this regard chair, we would like to hear from President Ramaphosa.
The commission will continue to hear more applications on Wednesday.
State Capture Commission hears applications for leave to cross-examine various witnesses:
President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that todays Youth Day celebrations in Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal will go ahead but will be a hybrid event compliant with level three of the lockdown.
He announced that the country would enter level three with effect from midnight.
SA moves to lockdown level three.
The theme for Youth Day this year is The year of Charlotte Maxeke: Growing youth employment for an inclusive and transformed society.
President Ramaphosa says there will be a significantly reduced number of people attending the Pietermaritzburg event and he will give a virtual address.
Level three lockdown:
The litmus test for President Ramaphosa’s address to the nations will be what he has to offer the youth.
Already the President had said youth unemployment is governments biggest concern.
Two weeks ago, Statistics SA released the national unemployment figures.
It painted a dull picture with the official unemployment rate growing to a record high of 32,6 percent.
The population group with the highest unemployment rate is the youth, with 63,3 percent of people between the ages of 15 and 24 being unemployed, and 41,3 percent for the age group 25 and 34.
COVID-19 regulations are to be enforced in Pietermaritzburg for the commemoration.
The event is expected to have a limited number of guests and key stakeholders, mainly youth.
Meanwhile, DA Leader John Steenhuisen is expected to address the youth from Mitchells Plain on the Cape Flats during the Partys Youth Day commemorations, encouraging young South Africans to turn up for their future.
However, the event will now have to comply with level three lockdown restrictions.
Among the issues, Steenhuisen is expected to address is the youth unemployment rate.
Today is National Youth Day in South Africa, where the country commemorates the June 16 1976 Uprising that began in Soweto and spread across South Africa profoundly changing the socio-political landscape of the country.
President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the days keynote address virtually at 11:30 am.
The events, which triggered that uprising in South Africa, can be traced back to policies of the apartheid government that resulted in the introduction of the Bantu Education Act in 1953.
The rise of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) and the formation of the South African Students Organisation (SASO) raised the political consciousness of many students, with others joining the older guard political parties of the time.
When the apartheid government forced Afrikaans alongside English as a compulsory medium of instruction in schools in 1974, young Black learners began to mobilise.
On 16 June 1976, between 3 000 and 10 000 students mobilised by the South African Students Movements Action Committee supported by the BCM marched peacefully to demonstrate and protest against the governments directive.
While some of them lost their lives, others lived to tell the tale and are serving in various sectors of the countrys economy.
As the country reflects on the events of that day and the victory that followed, SABC Digital News highlights three of the many leaders who emerged from the uprising.
Below is a brief summary of them:
The State Capture Commission is listening to implicated parties applications for leave to cross-examine those who have accused them of wrongdoing.
Below are the proceedings:
African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte, has received a memorandum of demands from protesting ANC workers.
ANC employees have been picketing outside the party offices across the country, including Luthuli House in Johannesburg, over the party’s failure to pay salaries.
Demonstrators say they haven’t been paid their May salary which is now over 20 days late.
Employees at @MYANC Headquarters Luthuli House are picketing over the party’s failure to pay salaries.
Duarte addressed members, saying negotiations will continue.
No salaries will be reduced and if we need, at all, to undergo any restructuring it will be with you and you will be part of the decision that we take.
We thank you for conducting the picket and raising your concerns in a disciplined manner.
We call on ANC members to continue with their constructive engagement until all the matters you have raised are resolved.
So we will continue with the negotiations and continue to discuss, says Duarte.
Chairperson of the ANC Staff Representative in the Western Cape, Mvusi Mdala, says they are giving the employer a week to respond to their demands.
Part of our demands is that the employer is not paying the provident fund, whereas they are deducting money from us as employees, and also is not paying UIF, whereas they are deducting money from us, continuously our medical aid is being suspended, even today our good morning was a message from the medical aid indicating to us that our medical aid has been suspended, explains Mdala.
The workers say late payments have been happening for the last 10 years.
Earlier on Tuesday, ANCs Treasurer-General, Paul Mashatile, admitted that the governing party is facing financial constraints, which are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mashatile says the party has lost most of its funders:
As COVID-19 infections continue to rapidly increase and with fears that the country is officially on a third wave, President Cyril Ramaphosa will be locked in several meetings on Tuesday in a bid to find a better response to the pandemic.
South Africa is on Alert Level two of the national lockdown.
But it seems regulations under this level are failing to curb the fast-increasing number of infections.
For the past seven days, the country recorded COVID-19 infections well over 20 000 prompting government to take action.
COVID-19 weekly stats with Dr Ridhwaan Suliman:
Today, President Ramaphosa will have back-to-back meetings to respond to the fast-increasing numbers.
Firstly later this morning, he will convene a meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council where the Department of Health will make a presentation.
Later in the day, he will preside over the meeting of all Premiers and in the afternoon he will chair the Cabinet.
At the end of all these meetings, the President may be expected to update the nation on a day still to be communicated.

The African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile has admitted that the governing party is facing financial constraints which are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Tuesday, ANC staff members will embark on a nationwide picket at lunchtime, over the partys failure to pay salaries on time.
The ANC has been experiencing financial problems with reports that it owes the South African Revenue Service (SARS) R80 million in Pay As You Earn (PAYE) deductions.
The party is also in arrears by at least 28 months or around R140 million on its provident fund, which is deducted from workers salaries.
Dozens of protesting workers are expected to hand over their memorandum of demands at the partys headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg on Tuesday.
Mashatile says the party has lost most of its funders.
We are struggling with cash flow, the ANC has never really had an abundance of cash, weve always got money from donors and since the pandemic funding has been coming very slow because companies are not doing so well.
Some of them have closed down.
It’s a difficult environment
But we do try our best to raise funds
Sometimes we get funding a bit late
and we end up paying salaries late.
He adds: In the current economic environment it has not been easy to get any evidence most of our investments are also affected.
But there is another problem now: the new act which requires disclosure beyond 100k you donate to a political party you must disclose so some people are uncomfortable with that
so they are slowly pulling back and we do struggle in that regard.
In the video below, ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte confirmed a month ago that the party is facing financial problems:
African National Congress (ANC) staff members will embark on a nationwide picket at lunch-time on Tuesday, over the governing partys failure to pay their salaries on time.
The ANC has been experiencing financial problems with reports that it owed the South African Revenue Service (SARS) R80 million in Pay As You Earn deductions.
In the video below ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile explained how the party was planning to raise some funds.
The party was also in arrears by at least 28 months or around R140 million on its provident fund which was deducted from workers’ salaries.
Dozens of protesting workers are expected to hand over their memorandum of demands at the partys headquarters, Luthuli House in Johannesburg.
ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says they have encouraged all their provincial leaders to receive memoranda from workers.
ANC statement on staff salary payments.
In 2020, the ANC blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for its failure to pay staff salaries.
The Electoral Commission (IEC) has issued a reminder that this is the final week for public comment on the inquiry to ensure free and fair elections during COVID-19.
South Africans are scheduled to go to the polls in local government elections in October.
However there have been some calls for the elections to be postponed until the pandemic has subsided.
Launch of 2021 municipal elections:
The inquiry is headed by Justice Dikgang Moseneke.
People can give their opinions by emailing freeandfiar@elections.org.za or sending a voice note to 063 863 4623.
Submissions must be made by this Friday.
Earlier this month the IEC Chief Electoral Officer, Sy Mamabolo said the 2021 upcoming Local Government Elections (LGE)will be the most complex in the history of democratic South Africa.
He told guests at the launch of the Municipal Elections, that they are expecting more than 10 000 councilors to be elected into the different municipalities across the country.
Mamabolo added that this years Local Government Elections tag line is Every Voice Together which underlines the possibilities for South Africa where every voice comes together.
Municipal Elections involve 4 725 unique elections and thus unique ballot paper configuration consisting of the following.
4 468 ward elections, 205 municipality elections in council and eight PR elections in metro councils and 44 district council elections across the country, Mamabolo explained.
The Al Jamah political party is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to place the country back to Level 5 of the lockdown even if its for one or two weeks.
This comes as the country enters the third wave of coronavirus infections with daily new infections rising steeply in a number of provinces.
Al Jamah Leader, Ganief Hendricks, says the country still remains in a coronavirus war zone.
Hendricks also wants the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to be prohibited.
Al Jamah still feels today that we are in a war situation.
For the past year, we supported the president with regards to each time of extending the state of Disaster, and we still supporting the President wherever we can.
We are now in the third wave and people are dying like flies.
And we feel that the President must ignore the official opposition party (DA) and focus on only saving lives.
And he shouldn’t worry about saving livelihoods because we are in a war situation.
We cannot let lives be lost just to save an extra job or two.
So, Al Jamah’s position is that there should be a complete lockdown that we must move to level five, maybe just for a week or two, and secondly, there must be a complete alcohol ban because it has been proven that alcohol is causing much harm.
And the President has given into the captains of the wine industry and that was the big mistake.
We also feel that there must be a ban on cigarettes just like it was in level five.
So we are in a war situation and we need to throw everything at defeating the pandemic, says Hendricks.
President Ramaphosa raises concern about a possible third wave of coronavirus infections in SA:
The state has now added a charge of racketeering to the charge sheet of the former eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede, and her 21 co-accused.
The amended indictment was handed in when Gumede, eThekwini Municipal Manager, Sipho Nzuza, other officials, four councillors, and eight business people appeared in the Durban High Court.
Other charges include fraud and corruption.
The case stems from a 2017 Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400 million.
NPA Spokesperson, Natasha Kara, says the case has been postponed to give the defence a chance to request further particulars.
Based on this amended indictment and the court has given a date of 30th of November.
By that time we anticipate that the state would have responded to the requests for further particulars.
What was also important today was that the matter was set down for the possible trial date of 18 July 2022.
NPA says it is ready for trial against the former eThekwini mayor:
The fraud and corruption trial of former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede is expected to start on July 18, 2022 in the Durban High Court.
Gumede is being charged together with 21 other accused which include business people, councillors and municipal officials.
The case stems from a Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400 million in 2017.
The court has postponed the case to November 30 for another pre-trial hearing.
Gumede has appeared at the Durban High Court:
In March, it was reported that according to the indictment the State listed Robert Abbu, accused number one, amongst the key role players.
Former supply chain manager at the eThekwini Municipality Sandile Ngcobo, senior African National Congress (ANC)councillor Mondli Mthembu, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and suspended eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza are also listed as key players in the matter.
Details contained in the indictment state that Abbu, in 2017, was appointed by Nzuza as Head of Special Projects without following proper procedures, a position that the State alleges had not previously existed.
As the country celebrates Youth Day on Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa has acknowledged that the struggles of South Africas youth are many.
In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa says the greatest struggle young people wage is against unemployment, worsened under the COVID-19 pandemic.
He says creating more opportunities and supporting young people to access these is governments foremost priority.
President Ramaphosa has expressed concern about the diminishing awareness of the events of June 16, 45 years ago amongst the so-called Generation Z born after 1997.
He says society has a collective responsibility to ensure the message of that day and the sacrifices of the 1976 generation are not lost.
Ramaphosa says tackling youth unemployment requires accelerating economic growth, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, and building the capability of the state to fulfil its developmental role.
He says government will this week launch a range of additional measures to create opportunities for the youth.
South Africa’s unemployment rate hits new all-time high.
Final preparations are being made to an area outside the Durban High Court where supporters of former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will gather.
Gumede and 21 other accused are due to appear in court on Monday, on charges of fraud and corruption in connection with a Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400 million in 2017.
Case against Zandile Gumede and 21 others moved to the Durban High Court.
The tent and stage where supporters will wait outside court has been set up.
Security has been beefed up around the High Court.
Spokesperson for Gumede supporters Ntando Khuzwayo says the group outside court will abide by COVD-19 regulations.
Meanwhile, in March it was reported that according to the indictment, the State listed Robert Abbu, accused number one, amongst the key role players.
Former supply chain manager at the eThekwini Municipality Sandile Ngcobo, senior African National Congress (ANC)councillor Mondli Mthembu, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and suspended eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza are also listed as key players in the matter.
Embattled former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and 21 other accused are expected to appear before the Durban High Court for a pre-trial hearing Monday.
The charges stem from 2017 Durban Solid Waste tender amounting to over R400 million.
Spokesperson for Gumedes supporters, Ntando Khuzwayo says although supporters will be out in their numbers they will adhere to COVID-19 regulations.
Its a pre-trial conference so the parties are in court theyre going to try to reduce disputes before the matter goes to trial so we cannot pre-empt what is going to happen inside the courts but outside we can tell you that were expecting scores of people to come and show their support for Gumede.
We also have other provinces who have indicated that they also sending people over to show solidarity to her or the safety and Corbett regulation or going to be adhered to.
In March it was reported that according to the indictment, the state listed Robert Abbu, accused number one, amongst the key role players.
Former supply chain manager at the eThekwini Municipality Sandile Ngcobo, senior African National Congress (ANC)councillor Mondli Mthembu, former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and suspended eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza are also listed as key players in the matter.
Details contained in the indictment state that Abbu, in 2017, was appointed by Nzuza as Head of Special Projects without following proper procedures, a position that the state alleges had not previously existed.
And that Nzuza was instructed by Gumede to do so.
The state further notes that shortly after his appointment, Abbu requested to deviate from the formal process of the municipality to invite quotations from suppliers for the new DSW contract.
The state said that it intends to rely on the cellphone records of Gumede, Mthembu and Abbu detailing frequent communications, where the alleged Durban Solid Waste tender decisions were made.
It is believed that the cellphone records will link Gumede with some service providers who are also accused in the case.
The indictment further alleges that Gumede, Nzuza and several councillors received illicit payments during the new DSW contract.
The papers also revealed that a sum of about a R100 000 was transferred into the bank account of the African National Congress in the eThekwini Region, allegedly in favour of Gumede.
As the debate on the latest developments at South African Airways (SAA) continues to take place political parties have mixed views on the public-private partnership which saw SAA owning 49% of the company and Takatso Consortium taking the 51% stake.
Some raised questions that politically exposed individuals like Jabu Moleketi and Popo Molefe had influence in Takatso Consortium being appointed as the private equity partner.
Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan has refuted any allegations that African National Congress (ANC) aligned businessmen influenced the deal.
Minister Gordhan has hindered too shrouded these agreements in complete secrecy but very serious questions remain now that he has made a very general announcement, how these agreements tie in crucially to the PMFA requirements, who benefits from the agreements and particurlary ANC cadres and the conflict of lift.
There are many questions here, says Chaleb Cachalia, Democratic Alliance.
SAA private sector ownership deal raising concerns
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have a standing resolution that SOEs must be squarely in the hands of the government.
Eskom is collapsing.
Where are you?
Denel is collapsing where are you?
And SAA is dead.
SA Express is gone.
Mango is gone and yet Pravin is declared the best minister by white owned minister.
If it was Gigaba, there would be marches, says Julius Malema, EFF leader.
The IFPs Inkosi Mzamo Buthelezi says the party supports governments move to partially sell SAA shares in order to protect taxpayers money from being used further to bail out the airline.
The IFP welcomes the sale of SAA with 51% equity partner, this a very for tax payers.
This is a step in the right direction that government has taken this bold decision in addressing SOEs.
We call for close attention on Takatso Consortium, says Buthelezi.
The political landscape divided over the sale of 51% of South African Airways to Takatso Consortium
Political Analyst, Khaya Sithole says this is a matter of waiting and see how things will turn out at SAA moving forward.
Talking about what are the possible further challenges that SAA could find itself facing going forward this after this purchase by Takatso Consortium, says Sithole.
Attempts to get a view from the ANC were unsuccessful.
However the governing party has a standing resolution of public-private partnerships in order to rescue failing state-owned enterprises like SAA and power utility Eskom.

Maimane spoke to the media outside of the Constitutional Court on Friday as the country marked a year since an order to Parliament that the country’s electoral system must be changed to allow independent candidates to participate in National and Provincial elections.
He says the elections must go ahead.
We want to be able to make written submissions and we want to make oral submissions.
I got confirmation from Justice Moseneke to say, they have invited us now, formally to come and do that.
So we are awaiting our date, to be able to come and achieve both those things.
Our submissions are done, says Maimane.

A member of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal has taken legal action against ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte and the National Youth Task Team(NYTT).
32-year-old Qiniso Matinisa from oThongathi, north of Durban, says Duarte and the NYTT have allowed people over the age of 35 to remain in the youth leagues provincial structures.
In court papers, Matinisa says all youth league structures, including those in provinces, lapsed some years ago and that there are some members of the structures who are now older than 35.
Provinces have a leadership whose term of office lapsed.
Secondly, they have members older than 35 years, but theyre presiding over the youth league.
That’s where I’m asking ANC clarity of how can you say people over 35 must excuse themselves in NYTT, but when it comes to provinces you don’t do the same.
Efforts to get a comment from the ANC were unsuccessful.
The matter is expected to be heard in the South Gauteng High Court on 18 August 2021.
The 8th regional elective conference of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Mopani region in Limpopo has been postponed from this weekend to next weekend.
The conference was scheduled to start on Friday.
ANC in the Mopanis regional Spokesperson, Sonia Ngobeni, says the conference has been postponed to finalize the adjudication of an appeal process and clear a verification report.
Our 8th regional conference was scheduled for the 11th to the 13th of this month.
The conference has been postponed to the 18th until the 20th of June because of minor issues that have to be finalized.
One of the adjudication of appeal processes was not concluded, says Ngobeni.
Its almost a month since the second phase of theCOVID-19 vaccination campaign started on 17 May.
Members of Parliament over the age of 60 are among the 5 million people in this category who qualify to be vaccinated.
The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Lechesa Tsenoli, and Health Committee Chairperson Sibongiseni Dhlomo have been encouraging other MPs over the age of 60 to register to be vaccinated.
On Monday, Dhlomo had his chance to receive his first dose in his home town of Mbumbulu in KwaZulu-Natal.
I got vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine on the 7th of June and today on the 11th of June, I am doing oversight visit in Gauteng.
I feel ok.
I have never had any side effects.
Even on the same day of my vaccination, I drove myself home.
I am encouraging all those who are 60 years and above to go for all those life-saving interventions by the Department of Health.
Dhlomo is encouraging those who experience side effects from the vaccine to act quickly.
If you do feel any symptoms of dizziness, tiredness, itchiness of the body, report those as soon as you can.
Otherwise, I feeling great.
I am visiting sights here in Gauteng.
I am actually happy that I got vaccinated in the most rural part of Kwazulu Natal called Mbumbulu.
And we are grateful to the Department that continues to give us support, even in other rural parts of the country despite the challenges of this vaccine.
Go for it; you will be saved.
Tsenoli was vaccinated at a Cape Town hospital on Wednesday morning.
Today is my second morning following getting the vaccination, and I am feeling great.
I went there confident that I could handle a needle, which is one thing that I dont fear.
I do acupuncture, so the needle does not scare me anyway.
So, its been great that the Department of Health has been rolling out this programme in the way it does throughout the country.
And that I personally have now gotten it, has somewhat lifted my confidence.
I didn’t actually realise that I was anxious to get it.
Now that I got it I feel upbeat and its been great.
I haven’t felt anything untoward that I cant handle.
The Deputy Speaker says he is happy to contribute towards the much-needed population immunity in the fight against COVID-19.
I wish others can have the courage to go ahead and do it as well.
It is necessary to at least take the first step as a preventative step, so that the second one when it comes, must add to the immunity my body requires to withstand any attack on the virus.
At my age, I need my health to be the best it can be and I guess also that I contribute to general immunity in the population.
Tsenoli says he is one of the high-risk vulnerable groups.
I do have comorbidity
but I am glad that some of the colleagues have done so too.
A friend also sent me a message from Durban.
He went to the church in the neighbourhood which was used as a base.
He too was very excited when he sent me the message and appreciated the settings in the province in Umlazi in different places for the over 60, to be able to go and get their injections next to where they live.
Its a great initiative, I think.
It makes for the necessity to combat the disease so that we can get as close to living our normal lives as we can.
However, we need to be patient.
This requires as many of us to (vaccinate).
Tsenoli also reflected on those who knowingly spread the coronavirus.
Two people were fired.
Their case was that they knowingly went to places of work with COVID-19 and therefore this was dangerous to other people they worked with.
The court found against them and so decided that the employer was within their right to fire them.
So we have to be conscious that there are consequences for acting irresponsibly when we do know we have COVID to go and join crowds and other places where we should not be and thus spreading the virus.
Its dangerous, its not worth it.
Not all of us have the health ability to withstand disease and so we place many people at risk.
Its a simple human action when we comply with the restrictions of staying out of crowds and limiting any interaction with a broad big numbers of people.
It is also appropriate that we sanitise, wash our hands and ensure that we keep our masks,- covering our noses which is not what usually happens in certain instances.
But largely many people do comply and its great.
DA National Spokesperson Siviwe Gwarube says some of the partys 23 MPs who are over the age of 60 have also been vaccinated.
Many of them are looking forward to getting their jabs and they are looking forward to leading by example by getting their jabs.
A number of them have already had their first jab and will be waiting to get their second jabs as part of the vaccinations process.
It is once again disappointing that the vaccination process is not as fast as it should be, simply because we know that it is the only way that we can cushion ourselves against the impact of the third wave and we encourage all people who are over the age of 60, who are health care-workers to get their vaccinations as quickly as possible as quickly as they can.
Other Members of Parliament over the age of 60 who have registered to be vaccinated, include United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa, Congress of the People (Cope) leader, Mosioua Lekota and former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
Holomisa says he is still waiting to receive his notification.
I confirm that I did register for vaccination last month.
But up to date, nobody has contacted me to advise me as to when must I go for vaccination.
Remember that people my age have been declared endangered species but the government is failing us.
I dont know whether we should organise a Toyi-Toyi so that they can hear us as people over 60 years because this is a government that normally listens when people burn tyres and Toyi-Toyi.
Maybe we should consider that.
Lekota says he has also not yet received any notification and Prince Buthelezis office says he has not yet been vaccinated.
92-year-old Buthelezi has fully recovered after testing positive for COVID-19 last year.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is finalising a Private Members Bill to amend the Referendums Act to enable Premiers to call a provincial referendum on crucial service delivery issues.
The DA is finalising a Bill to amend the Referendums Act to give effect to the Constitutional powers of Premiers to call a provincial referendum.
Greater devolution of powers to Provinces is necessary for better policing, rails and electricity generation.
Party Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone says in its current form, the Referendums Act only allows for the President to call a referendum.
She says the draft Bill seeks to address this omission.
Mazzone says an amendment will enable Premiers to ensure that their residents can make their voices heard on important issues.
The DA says the government has failed in addressing issues such as rail transport, police deployment and electricity generation.
Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has announced Takatso Consortium as the new strategic equity partner for South African Airways.
Takatso will own 51% of the restructured airline, while the government will hold a 49% stake.
The government says it will not be putting any more money into the new airline.
Takatso will invest just over R3-billion in the new SAA.
Gordhan says government will have a 33% representation in the airlines management while the operational capability will come from SAA staff and the Takatso Consortium.
He says a memorandum of understanding between government and Takatso has been signed.
Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan announces equity partner for SAA.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) has raised concerns about the partnership between Takatso Consortium and the South African Airways.
DAs Alf Lees says it remains to be seen how this will work out.
Interesting thing is that it appears that the 51% shareholding is being gifted to this particular consortium at no cost to the consortium.
In other words, they are giving it free and we would ask the question as to how come this particular consortium is given a gift of 51% of the shares at SAA when it hasn’t been a public call for a request for proposals.
The Freedom Front Plus (FF+) says they have been advocating for the privatisation of SAA.FF+ member of Parliament, Wouter Wessels, says this is a good move even though there are concerns.
In order for the taxpayer to no longer foot the bill for this failed airline, the bailout should stop.
We do, however, question this specific partnership, the amount of money and we also have to question if they would be a further need for guarantees to get the airline flying again.
That would be unacceptable as government debt is out of control.
Gidon Norvick of Takatso Consortium says the due diligence which will be done on the new SAA in the coming weeks will also include an evaluation of the airlines subsidiaries to assess their viability.
Takatso is also expected to discuss the details of an employee share scheme aimed at ensuring that employees also have a stake in the new business.
Desmond Latham on SAAs decision to use incoming capital to boost its subsidiaries:
It is understood that the chairperson of the board of the new SAA and the majority of the executive team will be South African.
We’ve got all the insight and knowledge and the national interest that government brings.
We’ve got the capital, financial insight and African experience that Harith has and from a Global point of view, we have an incredible depth of experience in the airline industry.
We’ve got a lot to do and its certainly keeping us up at night.
We’ve got to figure out which routes to fly, we’ve got to figure out what planes we want to fly, we’ve got to understand the subsidiaries of SAA a lot more than we currently do, Novick elaborates.
One analyst says the partial privatisation of the troubled national carrier is an important step in the economic reform process.
The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) says while its happy that the new deal would help create jobs in the sector, it has a lot of unanswered questions about its members at SAA and at subsidiaries like Mango and SAA Technical.
SACCAs Christopher Shabangu says, We really, as labour, have to be involved and understand what is going on these are the people that have lost everything.

Congress of the People (COPE) leader Mosioua Lekota says he has been to the Electoral Commission (IEC), participating in the inquiry led by former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke on whether or not the country is ready to conduct local government elections (LGE) under the coronavirus period.
Lekota says, according to the Constitution of the country, every five years there must be local government elections and that cant be ignored.
He adds that lack of service delivery at the municipality level leaves South Africans with no choice but to head to the polls for the much-needed change.
The COPE leader spoke to the media outside of the Constitutional Court, as the country marks a year since an order to Parliament that the countrys electoral system must be changed to allow independent candidates to participate in National and Provincial elections.
Five years of this current government has passed.
We must now go and give the people an opportunity to elect who they want, who is going to be capable of correcting the conditions under which they live in.
I was personally part of the meeting of the IEC and I did say that we must go and vote.
Meanwhile, answering questions in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa appealed to South Africans to give the Electoral Commission and the Moseneke Inquiry time to determine whether the conditions are conducive for free and fair elections this year.
He said no other date has been determined for holding the elections other than October 27 which he announced earlier this year.
President Ramaphosa suggested that at this stage, there is no reason to believe that the date for local government elections would be shifted.

The National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shamila Batohi says they require financial evidence from the United Arab Emirates of members of the Gupta family who are wanted in South Africa on charges of corruption, money laundering and fraud.
The NPAs Investigating Directorate issued warrants of arrests for the Guptas last week and asked Interpol for assistance to get them deported to South Africa.
The Guptas are believed to have fled to the UAE in early 2018 as criminal investigations for alleged corruption accelerated.
Batohi says the suspects bank records will help them with their investigation into the corruption they committed in South Africa.
She says there will be legal processes with regards to the extradition.
Hopefully once that happens there would be legal processes with regard to the extradition of those persons.
To put it very very simply that is essentially what it means.
It means Interpol working to assisting and tracing these persons and the whereabouts have been established work with the local authority to effect the arrest.
The Gupta name has become synonymous with accusations of state capture in SA.
The family faces allegations of corruption at parastatals and provincial governments, to the tune of around R49 billion.
Ratification of treaties
Earlier on Friday, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola said the UAE is not cooperating with South Africa, in accordance with the extradition treaty ratified by the two countries.
The agreement between South Africa and the UAE on extradition and legal assistance in criminal matters was signed in 2018.
Lamola says South Africa will continue to pursue this matter until justice is served.
Irrespective of the fact that both South Africa and the UAE ratified this convention, regrettably we have to date not experienced a level of appreciation and cooperation which is required in terms of the convention in the fight against corruption from the UAE.
However, we will continue to pursue our counterparts through diplomatic channels in order to reach the desired levels of cooperation to enable our law enforcement agencies to bring to justice persons of interest of any investigations they are pursuing.
Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola to update the nation on ratification of treaties regarding extradition and mutual legal assistance between SA and the United Arab Emirates.
Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe says government has noted that load shedding presents a massive risk to the economy.
The Minister says crucial steps had to be followed on the path to better energy supply.
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a partial liberalisation of the energy sector on Thursday, lifting governments limit on self-generation of power from one megawatt to 100 megawatts.
Mantashe says the achievement of energy security is one of the key economic interventions in the recovery and reconstruction plan but concedes that its long overdue.
Im interested in Eskom recovering, developing its capacity and doing well.
Now when you run entities you must have rules and there will be chaos if you break these rules.
That is why we took long engagement(s).
When the President was twisting my arm l had to concede because you are a Minister, people who have ideas must put their ideas before you and your team reaches a particular determination, says Mantashe.
Mantashe was speaking on the SABCs The Watchdog programme hosted by Vuyo Mvoko:
Meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) president Sipho Pityana says companies are willing to work with labour, government and civil society to assist in moving South Africa out of the energy crisis it currently faces.
Pityana was responding to President Ramaphosas announcement of a partial liberalisation of the energy sector.
Eskom is expected to continue with Stage three load shedding until the end of this week.
The video below looks at the amendment to Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulations Act:
The challenge to the rules of the National Assembly by which heads of Chapter Nine institutions can be removed from office has entered a new phase.
Following a challenge by the Public Protector which was heard from Monday to Wednesday, the Western Cape High Court has started hearing a challenge by the group, Democracy In Action (DIA).
The DIA has introduced a new challenge that was not raised by the Public Protector.
They say the new rules are unconstitutional because they did not involve public participation.
The DIA has been openly supporting the Public Protector in her legal troubles.
The organisation has already raised thousands of rands to help her cover some of the personal costs imposed by courts.
Their legal representative, Advocate Vuyani Ngalwana, says the making of the rules is a law making process and should, therefore, have been canvassed with a wide range of South Africans.
DIA is arguing that Parliament has no power to pass rule:
Like the Public Protector earlier this week, the DIA has also argued that the appointment of a judge by the Speaker was unconstitutional.
Based on the rules, Speaker Thandi Modise had appointed a panel of experts led by retired Judge Bess Nkabinde to advise her on whether there were grounds for a parliamentary investigation.
Ngalwana says the Speaker has no such authority.
He says the department has not been successful to secure the shortfall from National Treasury.
Mthethwa was addressing the media in Pretoria in response to concerns raised by artists over the stimulus package.
Management was not doing things alone.
An oversight body was there and people have to answer to that in particular.
In the past few weeks while this whole thing was unfolding, we’ve been trying to see where we can get additional funds to cover the short fall, because, ladies and gentlemen, the problem R300 million is the shortfall.
As the minister ultimately responsible, I want to issue an unconditional apology to the sector as whole for being let down by our entities in this instance by the National Arts Council and in the process, exposing the most vulnerable sector in our society during this period of COVID-19, the Minister says.
Mthethwa says there will also be a review of payments.
This includes those who’ve received multiple funds for their companies.
Kwaito legend, Arthur Mafokate, was accused of claiming funds using multiple companies, but refutes the allegations.
Mthethwa hopes the review will assist in addressing the shortfall.
There is a process of investigating duplications, or of people who may be in a process or possibility of getting more within their area.
Because of the adjustments which are being done with regards to the shortfall, a lot of things are being reviewed even people who have been promised to get money from multi sources, he explains.
Acting Director General in the Sport, Arts and Culture Department, Vusithemba Ndima, says 505 beneficiaries have been paid up to now from the R300 million thats at the centre of the artists anger.
Ndima says a further 315 applications are being processed and payments will be made by the end of this week.
He was also addressing the media in Pretoria.
This week they’ve received about 318 that will be paid in the next three days.
That will then say numerically we will have paid 823 beneficiaries.
And the balance that will be left will 385.
I just thought that it’s very important that we clarify that despite all the trails that we going through work is continuing, says the acting DG.
Artists vow to continue with sit-in over COVID-19 relief fund.
Its a premise so unexpected, so curious, that it just might have enticed audiences to watch Nobody, a revenge thriller that sees an otherwise unassuming Odenkirk (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul) kick ass and take names.
Nobody debuted atop domestic box office charts, generating $6.7 million from 2,460 venues.
Its a solid but not stellar start as movie theaters in Los Angeles and around the country begin to reopen in earnest.
Directed by Ilya Naishuller, Nobody was well received by critics and audiences.
It centers on a mild-mannered suburban dad who goes into vigilante mode after someone breaks into his house.
At the international box office, Nobody added another $5 million, boosting its worldwide haul to $11.7 million.
With solid word-of-mouth and without notable competition, Nobody is primed to stick around on the big screen before Universal puts the film on premium video-on-demand in a matter of weeks.
The budget was $16 million, so it shouldn’t be difficult to get out of the red.
Though Nobody easily topped box office charts in the US, the film was hardly the biggest winner of the weekend.
Outside of North America, Godzilla vs. Kong kicked off internationally with a massive $121 million from 28 countries.
The Warner Bros. movie pitting the iconic monsters against each other in the matchup for the ages had an especially impressive start in China, where it amassed $70.3 million over the three-day stretch.
Ticket sales for Godzilla vs. Kong, a co-production with Legendary Entertainment, mark the biggest opening weekend in China for a non-local film.
That could bode well as the film gears up to open in the US on Wednesday in theaters and on HBO Max.
Aside from Godzilla vs. Kong (March 31) and another Warners title, video game adaptation Mortal Kombat (April 16), domestic movie theater marquees will be light on new releases in early spring.
that’s because Disney majorly overhauled its film calendar last week, delaying or amending plans for several titles, including Black Widow, Emma Stones Cruella, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Pixars Luca.
In perhaps the biggest blow to cinema operators, Black Widow was pushed from May 7 to July 9.
The Marvel superhero adventure will premiere simultaneously in theaters and on Disney Plus for a premium $30 rental fee.
Cruella, an origin story for the 101 Dalmatians villain, will similarly launch theatrically and on the company’s streaming platform when it arrives on May 28.
Disney has tested several hybrid strategies amid the pandemic, most recently with the animated adventure Raya and the Last Dragon.
The animated adventure, currently in theaters, slipped to second place on box office charts with $3.5 million in its fourth weekend of release.
So far the film, which is also available to Disney Plus subscribers on Premier Access, has made $28 million in US theaters and $82 million globally.
Tom and Jerry came in third place with $2.5 million from 2,464 locations.
After five weeks in theaters, the Warner Bros. live-action-animated hybrid has amassed $37 million.
At No. 4, Lionsgate’s sci-fi fantasy film Chaos Walking pulled in $1.18 million for a domestic tally of $11.3 million.
The Courier, a Cold War drama led by Benedict Cumberbatch and Rachel Brosnahan, rounded out the top five with $1 million, bringing its overall ticket sales to $3.4 million.
Human Rights violations against those who live with disabilities have resulted in the establishment of the Zozibini Nangamso Foundation for the physically challenged in the Eastern Cape.
The foundation, which has been established by youth, aims to address challenges such as discrimination, sexual and physical abuse, inaccessibility of buildings and public transport for people living with disabilities in the OR Tambo district.
Access to government services is another major challenge facing this population.
Ill-treatment of people living with disabilities is still rife especially in rural areas such as the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo Districts.
Access to education, sexual abuse, and misuse of their social grant are some of the challenges facing those living with disabilities.
The establishment of Zozibini Nangamso Foundation for the Physically Challenged seeks to fight for the rights of this neglected population.
Founder Sisona Mditshane says, I have an experience.
I have been discriminated against at school even by the older people telling me that I have one eye and all that.
So, I feel like if I create this foundation can bring back the confidence of the people who are disabled.
And I can bring back the confidence to know that they are capable of doing anything with the disability or not.
Wheelchair-bound Zebron Ntsiba says accessing government buildings and using public transport is a challenge for him.
Our main challenge is inaccessible buildings here in Mthatha.
We cannot go to the second or third floor.
That is when you realise that really you are disabled because you cannot go to the offices.
Activist Pinky Mkhathala says rejection at home and at workplaces remains a pain for most people living with disabilities.
We are even rejected by our own families.
Sometimes, if you are physically challenged, you feel more pain when people do not want to take us as the people with disabilities.
We ask the government at least to help us not to sit at home doing nothing, but to have a job.
Because if we apply for jobs, they do not even recognise us.
Social Development MEC, Siphokazi Mani-Lusithi has applauded the foundation for advocating for the rights of those living with disabilities.
People living with disabilities want the government to put into practice what is enshrined in the constitution in terms of recognising them.
They feel excluded in many government programmes, especially those living in rural areas.
About 50km outside South Africa’s biggest city, Johannesburg, lies one of the most important sites in human prehistory: the Cradle of Humankind.
Here, at sites like the Sterkfontein Caves, Swartkrans, Drimolen and Kromdraai, researchers have unearthed amazing fossil evidence from the Plio-Pleistocene (the last five million years).
It is especially famous for the discovery of fossilised hominin ancient human remains.
But there is a more recent and largely neglected layer to the landscape’s history.
My colleagues and I set out to investigate some archaeological traces found in part of the Cradle of Humankind.
We focused on a stone-walled structure on a hill known as Driefontein; the name also given to the site we studied.
Our findings suggest that the Driefontein stone-walled structure was a residential area.
It appears similar to settlements found elsewhere in South Africa’s North West province and parts of Botswana dating to between AD 1450 and 1700, though certain features possibly suggest a later date.
These findings place the settlements occupation broadly within the Tswana period.
This refers to roughly the last 500 years of history when Tswana communities, a southern African ethnic group, arose.
While the prehistoric sequence of the Cradle of Humankind operates at several levels spanning a very long period of time, a disproportionate amount of resources have been allocated to studies concerning human evolution and early stone tool technologies.
While this has global significance, our work is important, too, because it sheds light on heritage traces that reveal much about people’s daily lives.
It also helps us understand local, traumatic pasts which involved colonial oppression, land dispossession and racial policies.
Cultural remains such as those found at Driefontein allow archaeology to peel back historical discourse to reveal people’s pasts that are not preserved in any other way.
Our work at the settlement involved an intensive mapping programme conducted over four successive visits.
Initially we determined the overall size of the settlement, in order to plan our field programme, and then we examined the layout of the homesteads dry-packed stone-walled architecture.
To record the site, maps were produced using a combination of handheld GPSs and a Trimble Station; these use satellites to record geo-specific points that can be rendered digitally to resemble the settlement’s structure and features.
An enclosure inside the western settlement likely used as a kraal for livestock.
Mapping the site is informative; as building designs today differ between people and over time, so did past stone-walled structures.
By studying the layout of the settlement, we can then attempt to determine who occupied the site and when.
Archaeologists have been doing this from the 1960s and there is a fairly good record of what the different types of sites look like.
By examining the structure of Driefontein, we could then match its architecture to typologies developed over the past 60 years and determine when it was occupied.
We can also infer the use of different areas of the site.
There are other ways of doing this, such as through ceramic analysis or archaeological excavations, but at Driefontein very few items remain on the surface and there is no excavatable deposit.
However, two middens were identified.
These were used as dump sites and often contain valuable archaeological material such as ceramic sherds, food waste, and personal ornaments.
Unfortunately, at Driefontein this was not the case; this meant that studying the walls layout was the only viable way of learning more about the history of the site.
Driefontein includes two distinct areas; what we call west and east.
Both have large circular structures outside the main walled area.
These may have been kraals (enclosures) for livestock.
The main portions of the two areas both have an internal walled area with separate smaller enclosures attached.
Around this is a discontinuous and scalloping boundary wall.
Between it and the inner enclosure are up to 20 individual huts, including several with outside terraces.
These are indicated by upright rocks erected in a circular shape with extensions where terraces exist.
There are also grain bin foundations in the vicinity of several huts, which are similar in construction to the huts but are far smaller.
Upright rocks indicate the presence of a hut, since disappeared, with this one possessing a front terrace.
Based on the evidence, as well as the middens and a small collection of earthenware ceramics, the Driefontein stone-walled structure was a residential area.
The structure appears similar to settlements dating to between AD 1450 and 1700.
However, certain features notably the upright rocks around the huts and lintels in the outside circular structures have been identified at sites with a later date.
This possibly suggests that Driefontein is younger than we may expect.
Though the settlements occupation falls within the Tswana period, naming the occupants as Tswana is complicated.
That’s because Tswana history is not linear or direct.
Rather, there are periods of migration, political growth, and assimilation.
Tswana origins are also unclear
At times, oral histories note multiple lineages and totems with several different groups appearing and blending with others.
When looking back at early archaeological sequences, such as may be the case at Driefontein, identifying Tswana groups is, for these reasons, quite challenging.
Nonetheless, based on the evidence, we believe Driefontein was likely occupied by Tswana-like groups after about AD 1450.
This project was done with the involvement of the current landowners of the Nirox Sculpture Park and Project 58, where the site is located.
Their interest in the site and openness to researchers is what ultimately led to us learning more of the region’s prehistory.
Our work is far from over
Future studies at Driefontein will help to further acknowledge more recent complex histories, identities and pasts that overlay the deep-time sequences preserved in the Cradle of Humankinds cave systems. Tim Forssman, Senior lecturer, University of Pretoria.
The community of New Brighton in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape has launched an art project to skill youngsters and also keep them off the streets.
The area used to be a tourist hub and the community is hoping the new project will help boost that sector in the Red Location area.
One of the children involved in the project, 12-year-old Mbali Mandlingosi says she loves being part of the project.
I love drawing and painting
I also come here on the weekend so I can meet my friends.
The project has young artists showing their skills.
Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, on Sunday launched a book of photographic portraits taken during Britain’s COVID-19 lockdowns that she said would provide a lasting record of the pandemic.
Kate, who is married to Prince William, the Queens grandson and second in line to the throne, began the project with the National Portrait Gallery last year, inviting people to submit photos taken during Britain’s first coronavirus lockdown.
A panel of judges including Kate chose 100 portraits from over 31,000 entries, which were shown in digital and community exhibitions before the book was announced.
Still, I wanted to use the power of photography to create a lasting record of what we were all experiencing to capture individuals’ stories and document significant moments for families and communities as we lived through the pandemic, Kate wrote in the introduction to the book.
The book, called Hold Still: A Portrait of Our Nation in 2020, will be available from May 7, exactly a year after the project began.
Net proceeds will be split between the National Portrait Gallery and the British mental health charity Mind.
Music fans in Barcelona had rapid COVID-19 tests ahead of attending a rock concert on Saturday in a trial that, if successful, could provide a route to recovery for the ravaged live music industry in Spain and beyond.
