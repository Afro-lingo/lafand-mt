South Africa’s Standard Bank, an affiliate of ICBC, was also going to fund the project but announced in 2017 it was pulling out, saying it had started reducing its carbon footprint annually as much as possible.
“We reduce our own carbon footprint as much as possible each year. We have funded far more renewable energy generation than coal-fired power. We will apply very stringent conditions to any future funding of non-renewable energy,” said the bank.
The African Development Bank (AfDB) had at some point also considered financing the plant, while America’s General Electric (GE) was to provide what it termed “clean coal technology,” which would bring down pollution.
Both entities, however, have since ditched plans to fund the project as well as other coal projects around the world going forward.
Newly elected United States President Joe Biden following his inauguration early this year underscored the seriousness of the threat posed by the continued exploitation of unclean energy sources such as coal by signing a treaty that saw America rejoin the Paris Agreement.
He also reversed his predecessor Donald Trump’s decision to exit the binding international treaty on climate change.
The US also intends to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030.
Such moves have meant entities involved in projects responsible for the massive production of greenhouse gases have to change tack.
National Environmental Complaints Committee (NECC) secretary John Chumo said the institution is advocating for companies to embrace “the new world order” and move to green energy.
“If you want to finance energy, finance clean energy,” he said.
“Sustainable development is where you can balance between development and conservation. If it is negative to the environment, then that is not development,” added Mr Chumo.
Concerns over the damage that mining, transportation and manufacturing have on the environment have seen lenders pull out of projects.
Thomas Reuters Foundation recently reported that 263 charities have urged banks not to finance a $3.5 billion (Sh374 billion) oil pipeline that links Uganda to the Tanzanian coast.
They are concerned that the project could lead to the loss of community land and livelihoods, contribute to environmental destruction and cause a surge in carbon emissions.
France’s Total and China National Offshore Oil Corporation are due to start work on the 1,445km pipeline from western Uganda through neighbouring Tanzania to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga.
Over the past year or so, digital transformation accelerated at an unprecedented rate in societies around the world.
Whether we were working, learning, or staying in touch with friends and family, being online became more critical than ever.
Even as vast numbers of people were adapting to their new realities, it became increasingly apparent that equally large numbers of people were shut out from being able to do so.
Given that the theme of this year’s Telecommunication & Information Society Day, which took place on 17 May, is "Accelerating Digital Transformation in challenging times," it’s worth examining how big that gap is and how it can be bridged.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, approximately 800-million people are not connected to the mobile internet.
Of those, some 520-million can access the mobile internet but don’t, because of factors such as smartphone penetration and lack of skills while 270-million cannot access the mobile internet because they don’t have the requisite coverage.
Across the region, 4G broadband coverage is at just 21 percent.
The figures are even more stark when it comes to fixed-line internet connectivity.
According to figures from research firm Ovum, there are just 6.6-million fixed-line internet subscriptions in Sub-Saharan Africa.
A total of 433 million litres of petrol were imported through OTS for the April-May cycle.
M-Pesa, and even pay our bills using digital money.
The other form of currency, which has been introduced in the country, but has not been fully accepted is cryptocurrency.
This means that with Sh1000, you can decide to buy shares at the Nairobi Securities Exchange.
“You simply store the value of money in the shares. So, when you buy 100 shares of Safaricom using Sh1,000, that means the value of your money is in the shares that you have bought,” said Bichiang’a.
According to Bichiang’a, money can also be an idea.
For one to make money, one needs to come up with an idea that can generate money.
And this is where creativity kicks in.
Wealth can be determined by how much one is able to generate.
He said even M-Pesa money transfer platform itself was an idea that has made Safaricom one of the biggest companies in East and Central Africa.
“By coming up with an idea, it means the idea can now fade and earn income which can then be stored in properties or invaluable means of owning wealth,” Bichiang’a said.
Nairobi motorists will pay Sh126.37 per litre for petrol after the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) increased prices by Sh3.56 per litre.
It is, however, a relief for Diesel and Kerosene consumers with prices unchanged.
Diesel in Nairobi will, from midnight, retail at Sh107.66 per litre while Kerosene will be sold at Sh97.85 per litre.
In Mombasa, petrol will retail at Sh123.95 per litre while Diesel and Kerosene will go for Sh105.27 and Sh95.46 per litre respectively.
In a statement, EPRA said the average landed cost of imported petrol decreased by 0.57 per cent from US$491.50 per cubic metre in March 2021 to US$488.69 per cubic metre in April 2021.
Last month, the regulator bowed to pressure from the public to retain prices of fuel in the April-May adjustments.
Prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene remained unchanged at Sh122.81 in Nairobi, diesel Sh107.66 and kerosene at Sh97.85 for the one month to May 14
When it retained April-May prices at the same level as March-April, Epra and the Petroleum Ministry had brokered a deal with oil marketing companies to slash their margins.
Thehe oil firms were later compensated by the National Treasury.
The companies took a Sh4.44 cut per litre of petrol.
The cut was less on Kerosene at Sh3.47 and diesel at Sh2.28 per litre.
In all, it is estimated that the total amount taken form the marketers was Sh1.34 billion.
While Treasury refunded the lost margins in the course of last month, there was an extra cost of Sh0.50 per litre of fuel, said to be the administrative cost of processing and disbursing the compensation to the oil marketing companies.
The marketers and the petroleum Ministry had at an April 15 meeting agreed that the Sh0.50 per litre was a prudent cost incurred in the delivery of petroleum products to Kenyans and would be recovered during the May-June pricing cycle
“The administration fee incurred by cargo buyers during this process is considered a prudent cost and shall be included in the import cost build of the OTS cargoes to be considered in the May-June 2021 pricing cycle,” reads the minute of the meeting signed by Andrew Kamau PS Petroleum and Daniel Kiptoo acting chief executive Epra.
MPesa has now become the leading revenue stream for Safaricom, beating voice that has traditionally been the company’s mainstay.
The mobile money service earned Safaricom Sh82.65 billion while voice service generated Sh82.55 billion in the year that ended March 31.
This performance came even as the telco reported a 6.8 per cent drop in profit after tax to Sh68.6 billion compared to Sh73.6 billion reported the previous year.
The profit was held down by Central Bank’s directive to mobile operators to offer mobile money transactions under Sh1,000 free of charge last year as well as the poor state of the economy due to Covid-19.
However, Peter Ndegwa, the Safaricom chief executive said the company’s earnings were better than anticipated as the company and the economy appeared to head into recovery in the second half of the financial year.
We’ve faced quite a turbulent year but our business has delivered on the higher end of the guidance range,” he said while releasing the results yesterday.
The company had projected to make pre-tax profit of between Sh91 billion and Sh94 billion for the year, a 10 per cent drop from the previous year.
However, it reported even better results at Sh96.16 billion in earnings before interest and tax.
“The recovery in the second half of the year was driven by the return to charging on M-Pesa transactions in the fourth quarter, double-digit growth in mobile data, fixed data growth alongside growth in consumers and usage,” said Ndegwa.
Safaricom recorded Sh250 billion in total service revenue, a marginal decline of 0.3 per cent.
Overall, M-Pesa revenue fell by Sh1.8 billion in the last financial year from Sh84.44 billion made in the previous year, the largest drop in recent years.
The most affected revenue streams were in mobile money transfers and payments, which reported Sh4.2 billion and Sh1.7 billion drop in earnings for the year.
The telco said about 1.7 billion M-Pesa transactions with a value of Sh4.4 trillion were zero-rated.
At the same time, revenue from voice fell by Sh4 billion from Sh86.53 billion while SMS revenue grew 11.7 per cent to Sh13.6 billion as at the end of the financial year.
The firm now counts 31.4 million one-month active customers as at the end of last year and 28.3 million on M-Pesa.
Safaricom further realised Sh4.2 billion in earnings from sports betting in the period under review, marking a 12 per cent increase compared to last year.
This was largely attributed to a decision by the High Court earlier this year that lifted a ban on outdoor advertising on betting and the resumption of sporting activities towards the end of the financial year.
At the same time, increased demand for internet connectivity saw the company’s revenues from mobile data and usage in the home fibre segment hit new highs.
Mobile data revenue stood at Sh44.7 billion, an increase of Sh4.6 billion compared to the figure reported during a similar period last year.
The number of active customers on the company’s fibre to the home business rose to 137,400 as at the end of last year, up from 104,500 in the previous year.
“Fixed service and wholesale transit revenue grew six per cent year-on-year to Sh9.5 billion supported by growth in fibre to the home revenue, which grew 49 per cent to Sh3.5 billion,” said Dilip Pal, the chief finance officer.
“This was driven by working and schooling from home trends across our customers and increased penetration of homes connected.”
Pal further said a reduction in capital expenditure by 3.2 per cent to Sh34.9 billion as well as a similar drop in operating expenditure to Sh46 billion managed to stem some of the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the bottom line.
The company has proposed to pay Sh36.8 billion in dividends for the year, which is 34 per cent less than the Sh56 billion it paid out the previous year.
Chinese firms fight over Sh20 billion dam on River Nyando
The planned construction of a Sh20 billion water dam along Kisumu’s River Nyando has hit a false start after two Chinese companies that bid for the job opened a vicious legal battle over the award of the tender.
China Gezhouba, one of the firms that bid for the job, has moved to the procurement review board to contest award of the tender to China Jiangxi Economic Cooperation citing irregularities in the tendering process.
China Gezhouba, which placed a Sh19.2 billion bid for the job reckons that the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority’s (NWHSA) decision to award the contract to China Jiangxi was irregular and unfair as the rival firm had placed a higher bid of Sh19.9 billion.
Public procurement regulations require that prequalification to evaluate a bidder’s ability to perform the contract obligations is done before the process moves to the technical and financial evaluation stage which awards the contract to ‘the lowest evaluated bidder.’
In its appeal to the Public Procurement Administration Review Board (PPARB), China Gezhouba argues that the water harvesting authority did not pick the lowest bidder for the Nyando dam works, causing it to lose the job.
But the National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority has responded to the appeal arguing that China Gezhouba had failed to meet all the contract requirements and therefore did not make it to the final round of the tendering.
“The Act provides that the successful tender is one with the lowest evaluated price,... In this case the applicant was not the lowest evaluated tender and was therefore not denied his rightful advance to the technical and financial evaluation stages.”
The water harvesting authority says China Gezhouba had, among other things, submitted documents in Chinese whose translation to English language had not been certified.
The firm also failed to commit to buy at least 40 per cent of the supplies used in construction of the dam from local firms, the water harvesting authority says adding that the petitioner also failed to demonstrate capacity through proof of ownership of earthmovers and other equipment for the job.
China Gezhouba is also said to have failed to provide evidence of permanent residency in Kenya.
The water harvesting authority says it is for these reasons that China Gezhoub’s bid was declared non-responsive and did not proceed to the technical and financial evaluation stage.
But China Gezhouba has refuted the claims insisting it had complied with all the requirements set out by the water authority in the tender documents.
In its filings at the PPARB, the company wants the board to direct the water authority to evaluate the bids afresh, this time round taking into consideration the documents it had submitted.
“The reason provided by the procuring entity… are incorrect and misleading and were arrived at by misapprehending the tender documents submitted by the applicant,” China Gezhouba says in its filing at the PPARB.
China Gezhouba claims that award of the tender to China Jiangxi was contrary to provisions of the Procurement Act and the Constitution that require procuring entities to ensure cost-effectiveness.
“The award of the tender to the second respondent (China Jiangxi) did not meet the constitutional threshold of fairness, equity, transparency and competitiveness… neither was it in compliance with the principles set out in Section three of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act,” the company says.
China Gezhouba is not new to Kenya’s construction market and has won multi-billion shilling tenders for construction of major works, including Thwake Dam in Makueni County as well as the Northern Collector Tunnel in Murang'a County.
Sharon Obonyo, the water authority's Chief Executive, in a replying affidavit filed with PPARB insists that China Gezhouba had failed to follow the guidelines that the authority had provided when it invited bids for construction of the dam.
Ms Obonyo says there are disparities between the documents that China Gezhouba submitted in its appeal to the PPARB and what it had submitted to the authority during the tendering.
“The documents presented to PPARB are in some instances misleading and total forgeries as the same are different from the documents submitted in the bid document,” the authority says.
Ms Obonyo also says China Gezhouba had sent its commitment to source 40 per cent of supplies locally after the bids had been opened.
She insists China Gezhouba had sent an email with the letter on April 9 at 5.40pm while the bids had been opened earlier in the day at 9.00am.
She accused the firm of tampering with the emails filed with the procurement review board as evidence to show that it had sent the email earlier.
“I have noted with extreme concern that the applicant’s email screengrab… has been tampered with and is a pure forgery,” Ms Obonyo says in her affidavit.
“Specifically, a keen examination of the applicant’s exhibit… shows that the same has been tampered with to mislead the board to perceive as if the email was sent on Friday April 9, 2021 at 7.40am instead of… 17.40 hours by inculcating into the email screen grab a clear alteration or deletion of the number 1 and addition of the suffix AM."
She added that because of failure to submit all the requirements, China Gezhouba was dismissed as a non-responsive bidder and hence its bid was not considered.
“From the foregoing, the applicant did not meet the preliminary responsiveness and mandatory requirements… the applicant’s bid could therefore not proceed for technical evaluation,” says Ms Obonyo.
Other firms that bid for the job were SBI International Holdings at Sh26 billion and Just Nice Construction at Sh22 billion.
The Soin-Koru dam, which has been in the works for years, is supposed to be put up along the River Nyando in Kisumu County to contain perennial flooding as well as improve water access for residents.
It is also expected to expand rice farming in Kano Plains.
In the tender documents, the authority said it was working with a budget of Sh23 billion, including taxes, to build the government-financed dam.
“The Soin-Koru Dam is a multi-purpose project that will reduce the perennial flooding on the lower reaches of River Nyando. It will also supply water for domestic, irrigation and hydropower generation,” it said.
The dam with a water storage capacity of 93.7 million cubic metres will provide 72,000 cubic metres of water per day for domestic and institutional use.
The water authority had started the tender process last year but was forced back to the drawing board after all the bidders failed to meet minimum set standards.
It restarted the process earlier this year that culminated in the award of the tender on April 15.
Parts of Kisumu, Kericho and Nandi counties are expected to benefit from the water supplied by the dam which will be located at the border of Kisumu and Kericho counties.
“Flooding is a frequent phenomenon in the lower reaches of the Nyando River Basin and poses problems to the communities especially in the lower zones of the river basin,” said the authority in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) lodged with the National Environment Management Authority.
A 2009 report by the Ministry of Water quantified the impact of floods on the lower reaches of River Nyando, noting that it displaced 5,000 people annually and left them with losses of about Sh49 million due to damage to property.
Kisumu County Government recently said it requires about Sh400 million to repair roads destroyed by flooding following recent rains.
The Nyando flooding also interfered with the seasonal patterns of agriculture, threatening livelihoods and food security in the area, according to the water authority.
The flood water also destroys infrastructure as well as a general disruption of socio-economic activities, with the residents required to evacuate from their homes whenever there are heavy rains.
“Apart from constant flooding, the lower reaches of the Nyando River are also plagued by prolonged drought spells resulting in scarcity of water for irrigation,” said the authority in the ESIA.
“During the period, the Nyando River flow is low and a number of irrigation schemes in the area cannot operate at full capacity, especially in lowers areas of Kano Plain where there are rice paddies.”
It added that water from the dam had potential to increase the area under irrigation from 1,800 hectares to 5,170 hectares in and around Ahero and West Kano Irrigation schemes.
The free M-Pesa transactions for amounts below Sh1,000 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year weighed down on Safaricom’s overall earnings for the year ended 2020.
The telco reported a 6.8 per cent drop in profit after tax of Sh68.7 billion for the year ended March 2021 from Sh73.7 billion in the previous period.
During this period, Safaricom enabled Kenyans to reduce the impact of the pandemic by waiving fees for transactions below a Sh1,000, which saw free transactions worth Sh4.4 billion processed.
Service revenue, mostly from voice and data, recorded a marginal decline of 0.3 per cent to close at Sh250.35 billion driven by double-digit growth in mobile data business, which grew by 11.5 per cent to Sh44.79 billion.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, some companies implemented work-from-home arrangements that helped boost Internet usage.
M-Pesa and voice revenue declined marginally, with M-Pesa recording a 2.1 per cent drop to Sh82. 64 billion and voice dropping by 4.6 per cent to Sh82.55 billion.
“We remained resilient in a disruptive year, demonstrating strong operational capacity, diligence and commitment in supporting the country, our customers and shareholders through this uncertain time,” Peter Ndegwa, Safaricom CEO.
“Our immediate focus in the year has been to ensure that network capacity, operations and financial services are prioritized to limit disruptions.”
M-Pesa accounted for 33 per cent of the total service revenue down from 33.6 per cent last year, impacted by the waiver of the peer-to-peer transactions fees.
Speaking during the virtual release of the results, Safaricom Chairman Michael Joseph said the telco has embarked on a journey that will see it turn into a purpose-led company.
“This will see our attention in the coming months shifting to areas such as the agriculture, education, healthcare, support for Small and Medium Enterprises and regional expansion,” he added.
On regional expansion, Safaricom is leveraging on a new consortium to make an entry into the vast Ethiopian telecommunications market, to help it grow its revenues and market share to a new high.
In a statement released in April, the Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) said Safaricom was one of the members of a consortium that includes Vodacom Group Ltd (South Africa), Vodafone Group Plc (UK), CDC Group Plc (UK) and Sumitomo Corporation (Japan) that submitted bids for a nationwide telecommunication service licence.
The licence will allow the winning bidder (s) to roll out telecommunication services in competition with the State-run Ethio Telecom on voice and data across Ethiopia’s 112 million citizens.
“Under these licences, service providers will have the right to provide any telecommunication service including voice, text and data using any technology whether fixed or wireless anywhere within Ethiopia and to send and receive telecommunications to and from outside Ethiopia,” stated the ECA while inviting for bids.
The winning consortium will be allowed to have an initial licence term of at least 15 years with the possibility of renewal.
The company will pay Sh18 billion in dividends, which is Sh0.45 per share.
Ndegwa said they estimate earnings before Interest to be in the range Sh105 – 108 billion in 2022.
A charter flight operated by a Romanian airliner lands at the Moi International airport in Mombasa.
The uptake of chartered flights in the local market has been slow, denying operators an important revenue stream.
According to players in the industry, high costs drive away potential customers, who prefer the cheaper scheduled flights.
“Charter flights are relatively more expensive than regular scheduled flights. One has to cater for costs of the empty return legs,” says Kenya Airways acting Chief Commercial Officer Julius Thairu.
He, however, notes that the narrative is slowly changing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has made social distancing the norm.
“Over the last one year, there has been aggressive competition as airlines enter this space to utilise their idle capacity due to the pandemic. They are competing with traditional charter airlines whose operating models and years of experience make them more price-competitive.”
According to Thairu, during the peak of the pandemic, London had a high demand as Heathrow remained open to international flights.
Currently, China and Central Africa have a high demand for charter flights.
Last year, Kenya Airways converted some of its passenger aircraft into cargo planes, targeting fresh produce business.
One of the planes, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, flew from Nairobi to London in April last year with 40 tonnes of fresh produce consisting of vegetables and flowers.
Bluebird Aviation and Safarilink Airline say the uptake of chartered services are now common especially with international tourists seeking to venture into places like the Masai Mara National Reserve and Laikipia County.
The uptake for repatriation and special flights for both passenger and cargo, especially for the Covid-19 vaccine, also presents a lifeline to the aviation industry.
According to the International Air Transport Association, industry losses topped $84 billion (Sh9 trillion) in 2020, with a prediction of a fragile 2021 as passenger revenues plummet.
Before the lifting of recent travel restrictions, which barred travel in and out of Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, Nakuru and Kajiado counties, Skyward based some of its aircraft outside Nairobi to serve routes such as Malindi, Mombasa, Eldoret, Lamu and Lodwar.
“Charter flights is an alternative we are open to since commercial flights are restricted by the Covid-19 containment measures,” says Kelvin Mwasi, Skyward commercial manager.
Bluebird Aviation also confirms it has recorded increased demand for its private charter flights since the outbreak of the pandemic.
General Manager Captain Hussein Mohammed says while the usual private charterers have maintained their demand, albeit, at a reduced frequency, there has been an increase of clients.
World Marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge with Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala at the Nairobi National Park on January 8, 2021.
The government has hinted at a new model of business for the tourism sector which might see convention centres, national parks and game reserves managed by private agencies.
Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala, while addressing the European Union Green Diplomacy Webinar yesterday, said the sector cannot run the business as usual owing to the pandemic.
He said the industry has learnt more from Covid-19, which should inform changes on its business models.
“The pandemic has taught us lessons. We have woken up to a new reality that we must change. Nobody is left out and anybody going to open up after the pandemic must be refreshed,” he said.
The CS said the sector was eyeing new investments and exploring fresh business models that will ease entry into new markets and reduce operating costs as part of the transformative agenda to revitalise the business.
“Why is everything being done by one entity? Why don’t we outsource?” he posed.
Mr Balala noted that public-private partnerships offer good examples of how this new model can work - even questioning why the State still manages key facilities.
“Why does the government run a convention bureau or facility? Why don’t we outsource and make it more efficient,” he asked.
“Why does the government run a national park? These are the things that need to be corrected, and this is the time to think again.”
This new model will also see the government cut down on the number of institutions in the sector.
Balala said the idea is to have a lean team, and rely heavily on technology.
“How do you ensure you are lean, effective and efficient? These things need to be rethought,” he said.
If we continue with the same models as before the pandemic, I do not think we will be able to progress.
The CS said the adoption of technology post-Covid-19 should go beyond Facebook and Twitter, noting that the whole business economy depends on applications.
“Actually sales applications. That is why the investment of broadband capacity and smartphones is very key,” said Balala.
He observed that the government can adequately maximise its 6,000 staff without stretching them with the deployment of drones.
He said Covid-19 has taught the sector the importance of the domestic market - necessitating a change in the business model.
“Nobody imagined that there is a market called the domestic market. Not only Kenya; we tried it but a lot of countries never appreciated their local and domestic clientele who are the people around you,” he said.
Bipartisan MPs spearheading minimum reforms before next year’s elections have identified at least ten non-controversial proposals in the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill to pursue through a parliamentary route.
The creation of a Prime Minister’s position and two deputies, increase in allocation of funds to counties, creation of ward fund, restructuring the electoral agency, re-looking security laws and expediting corruption cases are top on their agenda.
Other issues include the number of constituencies, equalisation fund to the counties, the two-thirds gender rule and seven-year tax break for youthful entrepreneurs.
The group of 13 members from the National Assembly and Senate will have a luncheon in Nairobi on Tuesday to deliberate the zero draft being worked on by their technical team.
They will then start consensus-building.
A similar process was done in 1997 through the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG) that led to peaceful elections the same year.
The caucus’s move is informed by recent High Court judgement that declared BBI-driven Constitution of Kenya Bill 2020 unconstitutional.
A five-judge bench comprising Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Teresia Matheka, Chacha Mwita and Jairus Ngaah declared BBI illegal, null and void, thus halting the political baby-child of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Handshake partner ODM leader Raila Odinga.
Former National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale said the move sought to fast-track the reform process ahead of the 2022 General Election.
“Key among the reforms is a review of the electoral and security laws, including the role of police in elections, to stop what we recently witnessed in the some by-elections. We will then incorporate the pro-people ideas in the BBI Bill,” said Duale.
He added that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) should be fully constituted one year to the General Election. He added they would also seek to have the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) in the law.
Justice George Odunga, presiding Judge, Justice Joel Ngugi and Justice Jairus Ngaah during the delivery of Judgement by a five-Judge Bench on the Constitutionalism of BBI and Petition seeking to stop IEBC from conducting a referendum to implement the BBI Bill.
Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior told TheSunday Standard that apart from restructuring the IEBC, they would review other electoral laws, including conduct of elections, nominations, and dispute resolution.
He said they were still mulling over bringing the Executive into Parliament and whether it would need a referendum.
“We will look at all the issues and review what can pass and avoid those that need a referendum because it is not easy to hold it before elections,” he said.
The group brings together senators Kilonzo Jr, James Orengo (Siaya), Mithika Linturi (Meru), Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) and Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho).
Legislators include Gatundu South’s Moses Kuria, Abdulswamad Nassir (Mvita), Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Shadrack Mose (Kitutu Masaba), Soipan Tuya (Narok Woman Rep), Cecily Mbarire (nominated) and Otiende Amolo (Rarieda).
Kuria said the creation a Prime Minister’s position through a parliamentary process was feasible given that all they need is to create a position of a chief minister and rename it.
“There is nothing that stops Parliament from creating the position,” said Kuria.
The BBI process had sought to change at least 78 clauses of the Constitution but Sakaja said they had isolated those that were controversial and would ask different stakeholders what their irreducible minimums were.
“Issues like doing away with an Ombudsman in the Judiciary, creation of 70 constituencies, two-thirds top up in the National Assembly and Senate and the issue of male and female senator reverting to woman representative as it was are controversial but we will navigate through them,” Sakaja said.
The strengthening of provisions on the formula of creating constituencies in Article 89 to ensure equality of vote and increase constituencies by 70 and let IEBC determine the distribution in strict adherence to the formula was also on the table.
“This will be a deliberative and consensus-building process over the next two weeks that will have people sitting together. A Constitution is about the people and should ideally be a consensus document,” said Sakaja.
However, Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi accused a section of leaders in government and Opposition of scheming to scuttle the BBI reforms agenda.
“Those who cobbled together the IPPG talks did so with the objective of scuttling the clamour for comprehensive reforms and they succeeded. That is why it took us another decade to realise the reforms we were fighting for in 1997,” said Wandayi.
Wandayi, also the ODM secretary for political affairs, said they were wary of the new move.
“We are going to reject those attempts until the matter of BBI is concluded in the courts,” He added that any attempts to dismember the BBI through the IPPG would be rejected.
Prof Hassan Mwakimako, a board member of Muhuri, which also petitioned the BBI process in court, said Parliament slept on the job.
“They have woken up whereas we called on them from the word go to take charge of the process; now they are trying to reinvent the wheel.”
Elegeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to visit every region in the company of his deputy to foster unity in the country.
Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen on Saturday, May 29, told President Uhuru Kenyatta that elected leaders don’t have to be his friends to be recipients of development.
Murkomen termed as “unfortunate” remarks by President Kenyatta during his meeting with Luo Nyanza leaders on Friday, where he urged them to “take advantage of the Handshake” to get development projects.
Kenyatta met the Luo Nyanza leaders at State House, Nairobi ahead of Madaraka Day celebrations to be held in Kisumu on Tuesday, June 1.
Murkomen said development projects initiated by the national government should be independent of political alignments.
“Why should development of any part of Kenya be dependent on personal relationships with the President?” the senator posed on Twitter on Saturday.
Murkomen said uncompleted development projects in Rift Valley are likely to be abandoned because of the tense relationship between President Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto.
“No wonder projects like Arror, Kimwarer, Itare, Bosto, Keben, Londiani Hospital have been killed,” he alleged.
The lawmaker urged President Kenyatta to meet leaders from all regions in the company of his deputy to symbolise that the Executive arm of government is united.
Since independence, areas perceived to be opposed to the government of the day have been starved of development.
This has led to uneven development across the regions with regions that have produced presidents more developed compared to regions that have not.
President Uhuru Kenyatta and Former Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga lead Kenyans in signing the BBI form during the National launch of the BBI signatures collection exercise at KICC in Nairobi County.
Even as the Court of Appeal hears the case against the determination of the five-judge Bench that paralysed the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020, on May 13, Kenya is racing against time in its preparation for the next General Election.
Sustained focus on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), has however made it look as if the normal electoral processes and timelines were on hold.
The country could easily find itself in a time bind, if key players do not begin paying attention to the elections, separate from the amendment Bill.
Both the Constitution and the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 expect that in less than 12 months’ time from now, the country will be on the final lap of electing a new President, the 13th Parliament, as well as County Government bosses and the assemblies.
It is possible this consideration has occasioned Catholic Bishops to call for a shift of focus from BBI to the General Election.
The Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 requires that political parties shall nominate their candidates by May 9, 2022.
The systems must gather organised pace before close of this year, both at the IEBC and in political parties, if the country will have an orderly election in August next year.
Section 13(1) of the amended law reads, “A political party shall nominate its candidates for an election under this Act at least ninety days before a General Election under this Act, in accordance with its nomination rules.”
Because the next election falls on August 9, 2022, parties must hold their primaries by May 9 at the latest. This means they have 11 months to get their act together.
Among other things, this entails polishing up their membership registers and sprucing up nomination rules for submission of both to IEBC within the statutory timelines.
According to Section 28(a) of the Act, membership lists must be with IEBC at least 120 days before the election.
This places the last day of submitting the lists on March 19, next year.
Nomination rules for party primaries, on the other hand, must be with IEBC six months before the election day, in line with Section 27 of the Act.
The rules will, accordingly, be with the commission by February 9.
It is a rat race for political parties to get their own houses in order, barring which they could find themselves locked out of the elections.
Nomination rules not with IEBC by February 9 will not be recognised.
That means the party will not field candidates, as there will be no basis.
Parties will especially, note keenly that the courts are becoming very strict about processes, as the condemnation of the BBI process demonstrated.
A political party that decides to amend its nomination rules will have to wait for 90 days to lapse, from the day when it submitted the amendments to IEBC, in line with Section 27(b) of the Act.
The last day for amending party primary rules is, therefore, May 9, 2022.
But the original rules will have been submitted on or before March 19.
The advent of BBI, with the controversial political debates around it over the past three years, has skewed focus from statutory and constitutional political affairs to an extent that could push the next General Election into a tempest of a time rush, even for IEBC itself.
Competitive, and often hostile, public debate within the political elite class has made it almost look like there can be no General Election before the conclusion of the BBI process.
Equally significant is what seems to be the assumption that if the BBI Bill is subjected to a national referendum, it will invariably sail through and everything else will follow.
Should the Bill be defeated at a referendum, it could throw the country into a spin, if the rest of the election timelines have not been followed.
But success could also lead to a messy set up, for there is little time left to the fulfilment of statutory electoral requirements.
That could explain why some political gadflies have made muffled pronouncements about extending the life of the present parliament, to make room for any subsequent legislation from BBI and give enough room to prepare for the General Election.
In contemplating this, however, the political class may have to reckon with an outraged citizenry that could possibly be fatigued with the present regime, as usually happens when a regime’s tenure is ending.
In times of general economic and social hardship, the public tends to get a sense of relief from the thought that the government in power is about to give way to something new and probably more promising.
Kenya is experiencing such times, compounded by the fallout of the Covid-19 havoc.
Ordinarily, any proposed change of law does not stop institutions and processes from continuing to function in line with the existing law.
This is regardless that the changes, in the case of the Constitution, are proposed through a Parliamentary initiative or a popular initiative, according to Articles 255–257 of the Constitution of Kenya.
A proposed constitutional amendment does not create a vacuum in the law.
Kenya is, therefore, not in a constitutional void, despite the fact that there is a proposal to amend the law, supported by President Uhuru Kenyatta and a powerful slew of the political class in the Opposition.
The real danger for the country resides in the possibility of rushing to a chaotic General Election, the necessary orderly processes having been slowed down by overwhelming focus on BBI.
That BBI is itself presently stalled in court corridors is a damper on the process.
Still, it stands a fifty-to-fifty chance of being resuscitated, as are all matters before the courts.
In the event that it survives the present setback, this would still not be adequate cause to slow down the electoral process.
For, the electoral process is protected by the Constitution and the various relevant Acts, with the Elections Laws (Amendment) Act 2017 ranking foremost in statutory law.
The recent jump starting of the process to populate the commission in line with the Constitution and the Act signals the hope that all is not lost.
For its part, the commission reports that it has developed the Elections Operations Plan (EOP) for the General Election, and the Boundaries Operations Plan (BOP).
Both should be launched soon, according to commission sources.
Procurement and mass voter registration activities are expected to be done “on budget availability.”
Continuous Voter Registration (CVR ) is said to be ongoing at constituency offices, all the time, except for where there are by-elections.
Procurement of technology support is also said to be on-going.
Finally, the first tranche of the 2022 General Elections budget is expected to be included in the 2021-2022 financial year budget, to be read in a few days from now.
Regardless, the commission has massive work ahead.
It has not done any mass registration of voters, as it admits.
Ahead of the 2017 elections, mass registration was done in 2014 and 2017, despite the existing provision for continuous registration.
The law requires that such registration should be done and that registers must be open for inspection, at least 90 days to the election day.
Registers were a huge bone of contention in the 2017 election controversies between NASA leaders on the one hand and Jubilee Party and IEBC on the other.
The country could be headed the same way again. Likewise, procurement issues seem to be in a dark place.
In 2017 IEBC faced a plethora of pre-election litigation regarding procurement.
It is instructive that the process then began in 2016, unlike today when it is not even clear when the process is set to begin.
As soon as IEBC invited tenders through advertisements, it found itself in court, landed with 50 cases that challenged the stages of procurement.
There was also legalistic wrestling with the of Public Procurement Advisory and Review Board over procurement.
The board cancelled the award of printing of ballot papers to Al-Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company of Dubai.
The courts also cancelled further awards, at least twice.
Repeat drama could be in the offing.
Meanwhile, NASA had a raft of 11 items dubbed “irreducible minimums.”
They wanted them addressed before they could participate in repeat presidential poll of October 2017.
Some of the more critical concerns pertained to the ICT framework and its use at various stages, the manner of printing various forms and the details, as well as how they should be used and appointment of returning officers and, most important, result transmission.
All these concerns point to the possibility of politically chaotic times ahead.
United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Secretary-General Veronica Maina has downplayed ongoing internal wrangles within the ‘hustlers movement’, saying it is nothing to worry about.
The feud pits the mainstream UDA against Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria-led Peoples Empowerment Party (PEP).
Speaking in Nakuru, Maina dismissed the infighting as ‘friendly fire’, saying the movement headed by Deputy President William Ruto allows members to differ on opinion.
“These (feuds) are bound to happen since UDA and other like-minded parties are attractive and one of the best political outfits being built today,” she said on the sidelines of a leadership and aspirants meeting.
Mr Muraya Githaiga, the new Rurii ward MCA in Nyandarua County taking an oath of office at the county assembly chambers during a special sitting
The leadership crisis at the Nyandarua County Assembly deepened on Friday after the acting clerk Elizabeth Muthui swore in newly elected Rurii Ward Representative, Muraya Githaiga.
The ceremony was conducted in a special sitting convened by Deputy Speaker Zakary Njeru.
The event came a few days after Speaker Ndegwa Wahome was barred from accessing the assembly, following his reinstatement by Justice Joel Ngugi a week ago.
In his maiden speech, Muraya said one of his priorities is the rehabilitation of roads.
Politics took centre stage during the burial of a businessman in Nandi Hills, which was attended by ODM leader Raila Odinga's son, Raila Odinga Junior, and leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto.
During the funeral of Mombasa-based businessman Gregory Kipruto Koech on Wednesday, politicians used the podium to send conciliatory messages, urging Raila Junior to prevail upon his father to form an alliance with Ruto ahead of the 2022 General Election.
Nandi Governor Stephen Sang, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi and local MCAs recalled how the two leaders worked together during the 2007 elections where Ruto played a key role in the 'Pentagon', a political grouping that helped Raila clinch the PM position in the Grand Coalition government.
Sudi said it was high time Raila backed Ruto's ambition to take over power from President Uhuru Kenyatta next year.
“In 2008 Ruto campaigned for Raila and he became Prime Minister during President Kibaki's Grand Coalition government. Next year, we expect him to support the DP to become the next president,” he stated.
“When you (Raila Odinga Junior) go back, ask your dad to consider supporting DP Ruto's presidential aspiration as a way of paying back the support the community gave him in 2008,” he said.
Governor Sang said there was a high possibility that Ruto and Raila could still work together in a new political realignment.
While condoling with the family, Raila Junior urged youths to be innovative and invest in a business to get empowered. He also urged them to shun tribal politics.
“I have travelled all the way from Bondo to bury my friend and this shows how we are socially related despite our political affiliations. I want to tell young people to shun divisive politics. You can own land and do business anywhere in the country,” he said.
Deputy President William Ruto with speakers of the two Houses Justin Muturi and Ken Lusaka during the 18th Kenya National Prayer Breakfast at Parliament Buildings, Nairobi
calls for dialogue and national unity dominated the National Prayer Breakfast meeting that brought together President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.
The leaders – with increasingly strained relationship – met in public for the first time since February.
Uhuru called on Kenyans to pull together for a prosperous country, while DP Ruto appealed for national dialogue to end political antagonism pitting proponents of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and his Tangatanga camp.
The push to amend the 2010 Constitution has split the country into two rival camps, with Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga leading the BBI proponents, while DP Ruto and his allies are on the opposing side.
Addressing the 18th Annual National Prayer Breakfast co-hosted by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Ken Lusaka, Uhuru called on Kenyans to unite in battling the Covid-19 pandemic.
He said it was only by coming together that the country will manage to achieve its agenda for growth.
“There is hope that it is possible to overcome if we pull together. One person cannot change Kenya, but together we will make a significant difference. I hope that those who are here and to all Kenyans who have had the opportunity to hear the teachings will live by them,” said Uhuru.
He also called on MPs to fast-track legislation on Universal Health Care to ensure access to healthcare to all Kenyans, admitting that a majority of the population cannot afford medical care.
“We have heard from the health experts, we have also heard from our senior (Senator Amos) Wako challenges of our people not able to access healthcare,” said Uhuru.
“To the speakers of both Houses, there are proposals before you that will ensure that all Kenyans have access to better health care; please expedite the pieces of legislation,” he said.
The controversial NHIF (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to compel Kenyans who have attained the age of 18 to enroll and contribute Sh6,000 annually to the National Health Insurance Fund are some of the Bills before the National Assembly.
Ruto said disruption of political activities by Covid-19 could be a sign of divine intervention for the country’s leadership to begin dialogue so as to end wrangles.
“So many things have happened during this difficult period; the Tangatanga tours are not there and reggae has also stopped. I think we need to listen to what the Bishop was telling us,” said Ruto.
He recalled how ODM leader Raila Odinga in an “uncharacteristic manner” read a Bible verse that called on leaders to “come and reason together” during the last prayer meeting.
Muturi rallied leaders to unite for cohesive and peaceful country.
He said that the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted livelihoods was enough reason for the country to come together in dealing with the common enemies.
The Council of Governors (CoG) has stood with impeached Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud as a tussle on the county’s leadership rages.
Mohamed yesterday attended a full CoG meeting in Nairobi. The newly sworn-in Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar was absent.
The embattled county boss also attended a press briefing led by CoG chairman Martin Wambora.
Muktar has already reshuffled the county’s cabinet, a move the CoG dismissed as ineffectual.
“Whoever did the appointments has already been annulled by the court,” said Wambora.
Mohamud downplayed the fight, saying the two are still playing the roles they did before the Senate removed him from office.
“There are no two centres of power,” he said. “Both of us are accessing the offices but there is impunity on the side of the Executive who are reluctant to enforce law and order.”
Wambora said the threshold to impeach Mohamud had not been met, blaming political forces.
“The threshold must be weighty enough. It must be a serious violation of constitutional provisions, which was not the case. The Court of Appeal and possibly the Supreme Court will provide clarity,” he added.
The Kenya African National Union (KANU) party has revamped its operations ahead of next year's elections.
The Independence party has changed its Nairobi branch leadership and launched a digital membership registration and recruitment drive largely targeting women and youth.
Frank Mbogo was appointed city branch chairman and is expected to breathe new life into the party.
Mbogo is also at the Pubs, Entertainment and Restaurants Association (PERAK) Nairobi branch.
In his maiden task, Mbogo reconstituted the Nairobi sub-branch offices and requested the officials to wait for further communication on restructuring.
"Kanu will for sure be in the next government and we have to be ready as a party. The changes were needed to comply with the party constitution and the political parties Act, 2011 on membership and party structures from the grassroots," said Mbogo.
He also called on other political players in the capital to get on the negotiating table with Kanu to ensure the Baringo Senator Gideon Moi-led party clinches majority of the elective positions next year.
"To all those looking for leadership slots in Nairobi from straight from MCA to Governor, join us and we are ready for negotiations because want to bring back the leadership of Nairobi to Kanu," said Mbogo.
He added: "I commit to forge a close relationship with the party leadership, including our national chairman, secretary general Nick Salat, national organising secretary, national treasurer as well as the national executive director George Wainaina and the entire secretariat."
We will penetrate and be felt in all corners of the city county.
Kanu youth leader Betty Adera said with less than 13 months to the General Election, the party had put in place mechanisms to extend its reach across the country and will train leaders seeking elective positions.
"The Nairobi office will also pursue business empowerment programmes for youth and women in consultation with the party secretariat and our strategic partners for opportunities not limited to grants, credit products and loan security especially to the small and medium enterprises. Together, we will define Nairobi's political landscape," she said.
Meanwhile, the party city leaders urged the court to rescind its decision declaring the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, 2020 null and void.
Adera said: "While we respect the ruling by the court, we should not let the gains proposed for youth and women go down the drain."
Mbogo said they support national chairperson Gideon Moi on his stand for the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill.
In the recent past, Gideon been rolling out a silent strategy to revamp the Independence party.
The senator has also been making forays into different parts of country including Coast, the Maa counties and Mount Kenya notably Kiambu, Embu, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi where he has attended church services, public functions, and assembled local teams to revamp the party.
The Kanu chairman is also part of the “One Kenya Alliance” that brings together Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya).
Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party chairman John Mbadi has waded into the supremacy wrangles rocking the Nairobi County Assembly.
Mbadi has ordered the removal of seven MCAs involved in the ouster of minority whip Peter Imwatok during a special sitting last week.
In a letter to the assembly, he called on besieged Imwatok to take action against the seven for going against the party position and acting contrary to party instructions.
"As the party pursues avenues in resolving issues bedevilling the minority party in the assembly, you are hereby instructed to discharge the following members from all committees until such a time to be communicated by my office," read the letter in part dated May 26, 2021.
The seven members include Lower Savannah MCA Nicholas Okumu, named interim minority whip last week, Kennedy Oyugi (Highrise), Clarence Munga (Kabiro) and Fredrick Omondi (Kayole Central).
Others are MCA Jared Okode (Mathare North), Redson Otieno (Ngei) and Maurice Gari (Nairobi West).
The rebel MCAs have been accused of going against the Raila Odinga-led party and causing division in the assembly.
During a special sitting last week, they engineered the ouster of Imwatok in changes communicated by session speaker John Kamangu.
They installed Lower Savannah MCA Nicholas Okumu as interim minority leader pending consultations with the party.
They had accused Imwatok of “tarnishing the image of the party by abusing his position for selfish gain.”
The development comes against the backdrop of another letter by ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna who castigated actions of the MCAs and change of leadership.
In a letter to Speaker Benson Mutura, Sifuna said the party had not sanctioned the changes and that he was conducting a probe into the actions of his members but requested that the status quo remains.
“Kindly note that the party has not made any changes to the leadership and the same did not originate from us,” Sifuna wrote.
This comes even as the rebel MCAs plan to amend the assembly standing orders to rob political parties of the power to appoint minority and majority leaders and bestow it unto themselves.
A letter by MCA Oyugi to the speaker revealed that there was a push to delete standing orders numbers 20 and 21.
The changes are aimed at making the process of removing a leader complex and also make it difficult for political parties to hold accountable members that go against the party position.
If effected, the changes will have MCAs chose their leaders and not seek the approval of their political parties.
The proposals have been sent to the Procedure and Rules committee.
Jubilee Party has announced that David Murathe has not resigned as party national vice-chairperson.
In a statement released on Wednesday, May 26 by party communication director Albert Memusi, the party termed false reports circulating on social media that Murathe had quit.
“It has come to our attention that there are reports circulating on social media alleging that our vice-chair, Murathe. We would like to clarify that such reports are false,” read the statement.
Memusi said Murathe was still the party’s able vice-chair and continues to carry out his duties in that capacity, working diligently to fulfil his mandate as provided for in the party constitution.
The party urged members of the public to treat any documents, reports or communication purporting to convey his resignation with the contempt they deserve.
Memusi said any changes in the Jubilee Party leadership will be communicated through the official Party organs, as is the norm, and as is articulated in the Jubilee Party Constitution.
The reports emerged after President Uhuru Kenyatta reportedly made a phone call to top jubilee officials including Murathe and read him the riot act over the party’s loss in the two recent by-elections held in the Mt Kenya region.
Leaders have also called for party’s leadership changes following the Juja constituency and Rurii Ward by-elections.
In Juja, Jubilee candidate Susan Waititu managed 5,764 votes, losing to People's Empowerment Party (PEP) candidate George Koimburi who garnered 12,159 votes.
In Rurii Ward, UDA candidate Francis Muraya beat Jubilee's Peter Thinji.
Murathe in January 2019 resigned his post as Jubilee Party vice-chairperson, saying he could not sit with Deputy President William Ruto in the party’s National Executive Council (NEC).
The surprise resignation came on a day some Jubilee MPs demanded he either withdraw his utterances against the DP or be ousted from the party’s top position.
In May 2020, Murathe made a U-turn about his resignation saying President Kenyatta did not accept his resignation letter.
“I wrote a resignation letter to President [Kenyatta] but I have not received a response from the President indicating whether my intention was accepted or declined. This means that I’m still the party’s vice-chairperson and I will continue discharging my duties and responsibilities in the ruling party,” he said.
Nairobi County Assembly has approved a second Sh12 billion supplementary budget for pending bills and statutory payments.
The funds will be utilised by both City Hall executive and the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) to settle debt obligations audited by the Auditor General's office.
In the first supplementary budget passed in April, Sh1.3 billion was set aside for the Major General Mohammed Badi-lead team to pay contractors and suppliers.
County Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee chairperson Robert Mbatia said the second supplementary budget was drafted based on the directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure suppliers pay is not delayed.
“The second supplementary estimates of Sh12 billion will settle part of recurrent pending bills and amounts owed to development contractors,” said Mbatia.
Notably, Sh4.4 billion has been allocated towards settling Kenya Commercial Bank's (KCB) loan.
Another Sh1.2 billion will pay Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) debt while Sh381 million has been allocated to NSSF.
Mbatia also said re-allocations had been made across various votes in line with the provisions of Section 135 and 154 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFM) 2012, to make resources available for the payments.
The changes saw NMS budget reduced from Sh23.2 billion to Sh11.2 billion.
The committee further noted that the second supplementary budget was necessary to allow expenditure of the funds before the lapse of the current 2020/21 financial year on June 30.
“The committee and indeed the County Assembly has been a strong crusader of the need for county government and the latter–day brother, NMS, to prioritise settlement of pending bills to also bolster the county’s credit score, while also guaranteeing that those who do business or work with City County don’t regret the decision,” Mbatia added.
During debate, Kilimani MCA Moses Ogeto, however opposed the budget, saying committee had slashed NMS funds and this would hamper development.
“This is a skewed presentation and I have never seen such a budget estimate paper before. Denying NMS funds is unreasonable," said Ogeto.
Majority leader Abdi Hassan however said the supplementary budget was in order given that it had been presented before the house from NMS via the executive.
Eastleigh North MCA Osman Adow said passage of the budget would ensure pending bills are paid and revive stalled projects.
Roysambu MCA Peter Warutere said the funds will reduce the huge pending bills.
Impeached Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud and newly sworn-in boss Ahmed Muktar.
The political tussle in Wajir County deepened after impeached Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud and newly sworn-in boss Ahmed Muktar both claimed to be in charge of the county government.
Muktar on Tuesday said he was legally in charge following the impeachment of his former boss – Mohamud – who separately claimed to be running the government, citing a High Court order stopping the swearing-in of the Deputy Governor.
But the order was reportedly issued after Muktar had already been sworn in.
Addressing a press conference in Nairobi, Muktar and a host of elected leaders from the county led by MPs Adan Keynan (Eldas), Rashid Kassim (Wajir East), Ahmed Bashane (Tarbaj), Prof Mohamud Sheikh (Wajir South) and Ahmed Kolosh (Wajir West) said the crisis was threatening tension in the region and appealed to Mohamud “to come on board as a citizen” and support the new team.
Keynan said it was clear that the court order was in vain as it was already overtaken by events.
But speaking separately at the Council of Governors’ offices in Nairobi on Tuesday, Mohamud termed his impeachment a violation of the law, citing a court ruling that barred the process and a subsequent one blocking the swearing-in of his deputy.
“The entire findings and resolutions of the Senate to remove me from office was rendered ineffective, inapplicable and non-operational. As such everything done pursuant to the resolution of the senate including the purported swearing in of the governor as the governor of Wajir has no effect,” he said.
He further said he was ready to work with the newly sworn-in governor, saying he harboured no ill-feelings towards him or the county assembly.
“To my deputy governor, I know you as a humble person who has never shown any ill-intentions all along. I reaffirm that our relationship will remain the same as we continue to serve the great people of Wajir as mandated by law,” said Mohamud.
The beleaguered county boss said he was perturbed by the behaviour of some politicians who hurriedly conducted and officiated an illegal swearing-in ceremony in an attempt to remove a popularly elected governor from office.
Mohamud blamed his ouster on 2022 politics by a section of leaders, terming them “coup De’ tat tactics and maneuvers” citing an election petition against him in 2017 as the start of his woes.
“This proves that my purported removal was well-engineered from the beginning,” added Mohamud.
The latest tussle comes in the backdrop of a decision by the High Court in Meru to refer the petition that sought to nullify the impeachment of the embattled politician to Chief Justice Martha Koome to form a three-judge bench to determine the matter.
"It is hereby directed that the matter be heard by more than one judge ….it shall henceforth be dealt with after the Chief Justice exercises mandate under articles 165(4) of the Constitution", states the order issued on Monday.
Tuesday, Keynan fell short of blaming the High Court for issuing orders that cannot be enforced for being overtaken.
“Courts have held again and again that it cannot stultify itself by making orders which cannot be enforced or grant an injunction which will be ineffective for practical purposes… the court should have declined to grant it,” said Keynan.
“It was thus clear, that the applicants in the above-mentioned case failed to inform the court, or withheld material information that as of the time the orders were being sought, Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar had been sworn in and assumed office,” he added.
Muktar said his former boss was removed from office due to his inability to offer services to the people.
He said the removal was not politically engineered as claimed by the impeached county boss.
“There have been many serious issues in Wajir. Hospitals were closed, health workers were not at work. The people of Wajir faced some very small issues that any county government can handle. Ours now is to work on them and ensure they don’t happen again," Muktar said.
The pro-Muktar team also cautioned the CoG against frustrating the will of the people of Wajir who made the decision to remove their governor from office.
There was drama at the venue of the governor’s press briefing when police wielding clubs and teargas canisters tried to eject the media from the Delta Towers premises to prevent them from covering the event.
An officer who only identified himself as a chief inspector did not offer explanations as to why the press was almost chased out.
The assumption of office of Chief Justice Martha Koome has completed the triumvirate leadership of the three arms of government; the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary raising concerns about regional balance and the face of Kenya in running the country.
Often viewed as a taboo topic, ethnic balkanisation for political gain remains Kenya’s biggest bane.
Political exclusion and subsequent marginalisation have been attributed to past election disputes and are the substratum of fragile stability.
One key requirement of the 2010 Constitution is for the President to table a report before Parliament yearly, on three issues during his State of the Nation Address is regional balance.
According to Article 132 on the functions of the President, he is obligated to address a special sitting of Parliament annually.
He is required to table: “report on all the measures taken and the progress achieved in the realisation of the national values, referred to in Article 10, publish in the Gazette the details of the measures and progress made and submit a report for debate to the National Assembly on the progress made in fulfilling the international obligations of the Republic.”
The furore of having President Kenyatta, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and the latest Justice Koome coming from one region as opposed to having the seats spread over the seven other regions captures according to some elected leaders, the source of Kenya's ethnic problem.
By law, Muturi, who was last week crowned as the Mt Kenya spokesperson, is third in the pecking order and would act as President in the absence of the President and the Deputy President.
Alongside Uhuru, Muturi, National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya, Koome, Chief of Defence Forces Robert Kibochi and Attorney General Kihara Kariuki are also from Mt Kenya.
From the interviews to the debate in the Senate and the National Assembly, the question of ethnic balance across the arms of government came out strongly.
“Does it bother your conscience that if you are recommended by this committee, approved by Parliament and appointed, then all the three organs of government in our great republic will be headed by persons from the same region, commonly known as the ‘mountain’?” posed Kisumu West lawmaker Olago Aluoch.
Supreme Court Justice William Ouko, during his interview for the position of Supreme Court Judge by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), pronounced himself on the matter frankly.
“I really have no prescription, what I can say is that we are very deeply tribal even in this commission. I want to leave it at that,” said Ouko, who has been sworn in.
The commission has four of its eleven members coming from Mt Kenya.
They are AG Kihara, Patrick Gichohi, Macharia Njeru and Olive Mugenda.
Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala caused a spectacle in the Senate when he listed top leaders holding various posts in the three arms of government, rattling Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi.
“I hope the BBI document will sort [out] the mess in the Public service. Facts are facts. Kindly Senator Wamatangi, today evening when you're free, ask yourself who is the head of the Executive, Judiciary, Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) Speaker (National Assembly), CDF boss, Governor of CBK, Attorney General, Solicitor General, Kenyan Ambassador to the United States, Chair KRA, Director-General KRA, DCI, head of civil servants, state House Comptroller. Where is equity here,” posed Malala.
He argued, “We cannot lie to ourselves. Ask yourself that question and you will come to the reality that there is marginalisation in this country. Security recruitment across the country, there has never been a Wanyonyi, Wafula or Walubengo as Inspector General of Police (IG).”
Said Malala: “Is it that there are certain people from certain regions that are more qualified than others. It is a shame. Let us not use BBI to hoodwink some of us to pass it and go back to the normal practice. I want to see a day when a maize farmer in Kakamega is treated the same way as a coffee or potato farmer in Kirinyaga.”
Senators Wamatangi and Ephraim Maina (Nyeri) could not let the matter fly, arguing that even Mt Kenya has suffered, including the colonial times. “Let’s not mislead this country by creating preferred or preferential treatment to some areas,” said Wamatangi.
When debating Clause 11 (A) in the BBI in the economy and shared prosperity, Senate Minority Leader James Orengo led colleagues Senators Malala, Moses Wetangula (Bungoma), Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (Makueni), Johnstone Sakaja (Nairobi) in calling for a more exclusivity public service.
“Of the last two months’ appointments made, I don’t know if we are going in the right direction. Every institution should reflect the face of Kenya whether Judiciary, public service or the security system. Our objective is to ensure the enabling provision call for the face of Kenya, which is fair than we have had,” said Orengo.
“The report by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) tabled in the House show a large portion of Kenya is red and a small portion is green. There is a verse in the Bible, those who have will get more, those who have little, it shall be taken. This is the true story of Kenya,” Kilonzo Jnr said.
He said there was unfair distribution, with Mt Kenya getting a lion’s share.
“It's a fact that there is 2,500km of tarmac roads in Kiambu while Kakamega only has 750km of tarmac,” he said.
Wetangula said they should not let facts be swept under the carpet and urged Maina and Wamatangi not to contradict the president and purport to support him at the same time.
“Uhuru and Raila sat and acknowledge the challenge of marginalisation, unequal development, unequal opportunity in Kenya and many other historical wrongs. When we live a lie, when we live in denial, we will not solve our problems,” he said.
Wetangula said it’s a fact there are those with comparative advantage.
“Cowards will always whistle in the dark hoping to scare away people. The inequality we keeping crying about is real,” he added.
Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has dismissed his colleagues' plan to impeach Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i later this week in the National Assembly.
Speaking after issuing bursary cheques worth Sh11.2 million to his constituents, Arama said that such a motion would be dead on arrival, citing that there are no sufficient grounds to oust the CS.
“I am surprised that my colleagues have hatched a plan to impeach Matiang’i over some flimsy grounds. They have forgotten an impeachment must meet a constitutional threshold,” said Arama.
The MP said that a majority of those crying foul after years of cordial relationship with the CS had been denied opportunity to further their personal agenda.
“One of the MPs crying foul wanted the CS to allow him use the police to undermine other leaders. Matiang’i told him off and he has now turned against him,” said Arama.
The second term lawmaker pointed out that the appointing authority was confident in the way the CS performed his roles and was going for an even greater seat in 2022.
He accused those complaining over the Bonchari mini-polls of attempting to spark a revolt against Matiang’i in his own backyard.
“The President is not complaining about him. Bonchari people are not complaining. It is only a few outsider MPs who went there with a motive to paint a bad image about the CS. Matiang’i will be on the presidential ballot in 2022 and they won’t stop him,” said Arama.
He called on the leaders to instead respect the current leadership and the law to be on the right side without brushing police the wrong way.
“These are the same people who have since 2017 been hurling insults at President Uhuru Kenyatta. They seek attention by going where they know there will be a controversy,” he said.
MPs Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri town) on May 21 intimated that there was a plan to impeach the CS whom he accused of being rogue.
“There is this one Cabinet Secretary who somehow thinks he’s untouchable. We get insulted here every day as we protect the government he works for, then he thinks he can run over us the way he runs over everyone else,” Wambugu wrote on Facebook.
Ngunjiri who is associated with Kieleweke faction of the Jubilee Party, said they would join forces with Tangatanga faction and ODM to ensure the CS is voted out.
His sentiments came barely two days after Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi announced the same plan on May 19, accusing the CS of abusing the police service and disobeying court orders in the past.
“In all the by-elections that we have held in this country, Matiang'í has been sending thousands of police officers because he wants his preferred candidate to win. We shall impeach him in the next two weeks," said Sudi.
The Tangatanga faction has since their fallout with the Kieleweke faction cried foul over what they termed as selective discrimination by the police during mini-polls in Nakuru and Bonchari.
Ex-Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi now terms his removal as malicious
Former Wajir Governor Mohamud Abdi during his impeachment debate at Senate chambers, Nairobi.
A cat and mouse game is playing out in Wajir County.
Former Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi has now claimed that his impeachment was “well-planned”, terming it a political witch-hunt.
In a televised address on Tuesday, Abdi, pointed an accusatory finger at some leaders in Wajir County who, he said, engineered his removal from office.
“I’m perturbed by the behaviour of some Wajir leaders who orchestrated an illegal swearing-in to remove a serving governor from office,” he said.
Abdi decried disobedience of court orders, given that the High Court had barred the County Assembly and the Senate from impeaching him until a petition he had filed was heard and determined.
The former governor had challenged his removal from office, a day after Senate upheld his impeachment.
“The resolution by the Senate was rendered ineffective and inapplicable. As such, anything done in pursuit to that resolution on May 17, 2021, including the swearing-in of Wajir Deputy Governor, has no effect,” he said on Tuesday.
He also quoted last week’s orders by the Meru High Court stopping the swearing-in of newly appointed Governor Muktar Ali, which stated that he (Abdi) shall continue to be in office until his petition is heard and determined.
His statement came just hours after Wajir leaders rallied behind Governor Muktar in a press conference, affirming their support.
“Governor Muktar is now firmly in office. Any order purportedly issued by the High Court blocking his assumption to office was overtaken by events,” said MP Adan Keynan.
Last week, Abdi received support from the Council of Governors, who expressed discontentment in the manner in which his impeachment was conducted.
"The Senate has failed to set standards on what amounts to gross violation of the Constitution. For example, in the Kirinyaga case, the Senate acquitted the governor charged with similar violations,” CoG Chairman Martin Wambora stated.
But even as leadership wrangles rear their ugly head in Wajir, the impeached governor says he has no resentment towards Muktar, and reaffirms that their relationship “will remain the same”.
Nyamira County assembly is staring at another row after Governor Amos Nyaribo resubmitted the name of James Gesami for approval as his deputy.
The assembly rejected Gesami in January with 21 voting against the nomination and only 15 supporting.
And as the Assembly resumes sittings on June 6, it is not clear whether the MCAs will approve this time.
Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party had on April 12written to Nyaribo to nominate lawyer Charles Rigoro as his deputy in what was termed as an understanding between the party and the governor.
“Please communicate the position to all members of the majority party and ensure the party’s interests are secured,” the letter read.
The assembly is also yet to debate and approve Clive Ogwora, nominee for County Executive for Environment.
The delay in considering Ongwora has also become another source of conflict between Nyaribo, Speaker Moffat Teya and some MCAs.
Teya wrote to Nyaribo on May 13 explaining why he should reconsider his decision to withdraw Ogwora’s name.
Nyaribo had stated a few months ago that “I have already made up my mind and I have identified another candidate for appointment.”
Nairobi lawyer and Raila Odinga’s staunch supporter Donald Kipkorir has announced that he will take an extended break from politics.
In a Twitter post on Monday, May 24, Kipkorir, while making the announcement, challenged Kenyan leaders to love the country above self, family and tribe as a precursor for developing a mature political system.
“On reflection, I have taken a sabbatical from Kenya’s politics which has no higher ideals, but driven at its default by personal interests with the support of the poor and illiterate bases,” noted Korir.
US-based law professor and columnist Makau Mutua, however, cautioned the lawyer against taking the decision, saying it might erode the gains made in trying to sanitise Kenya’s politics.
He said the lawyer’s decision was like leaving a football pitch in the dying minutes, just when his team was leading.
Prof Makau pleaded with Korir not to lose hope in Kenya’s politics saying that things will soon change for the better.
“You are a striker and can’t take a “sabbatical” from the game at the 80th minute with your team leading 2-1. If you do, the other side’s mediocre 11 will beat your 10-man team,” said Prof Mutua.
Kipkorir maintained that his decision to take a sabbatical was cast on stone, arguing that the political arena was infested with deceitful individuals, and that he was no longer on being part of the confusion.
On his part, city lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi challenged the lawyer to disclose the real reason behind his sudden change of heart.
He alleged that Kipkorir was opting out of politics after realising that the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and his preferred presidential candidate for the 2022 polls were headed nowhere.
“Have you lost faith in the project? Did you realise the project is doomed? Have you realised that your candidate has zero chance? Is your candidate even running for office? You saw the light,” said Ahmednasir.
Kipkorir’s decision to take a break comes as President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila prepare to appeal the High Court ruling that annulled the BBI.
The President and the ODM leader formed a legal team of six lawyers, led by Attorney General Paul Kihara to try to dismantle the ruling by the High Court judges and allow the BBI reggae to stay on.
In the team to resuscitate the BBI are Solicitor General Kennedy Ogeto, former BBI joint secretary Paul Mwanga, members of the BBI committee of experts Prof Ben Sihanya, Prof Kibe Mungai and city lawyer Jackson Awele.
Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has stepped up charm offensive of the vote-rich Mt Kenya region.
Mudavadi held a series of meetings with leaders, raising speculation over his political game plan in the succession race of President Uhuru Kenyatta.
The ANC leader convened a stakeholders’ meeting with a host of former lawmakers from the region led by Former Members of Parliament Association chairman Humphrey Njuguna (former Gatanga MP) and ex-Gachoka MP Mutava Musyimi, at Sagana Getaway Resort on Friday.
Mudavadi said his engagements with the leaders revolved around the economic mainstay of the region and programmes that can support the people.
He described the region as pivotal for his 2022 presidential bid and was pulling all the strings to reach out to voters.
“Mt Kenya axis is extremely pivotal and critical in Kenya’s political landscape. The population there is huge, they are powerful voters, they come in large numbers when it is time to vote if they believe in the candidacy of the person they want to push through,” said Mudavadi.
“Going into 2022, it is a region that must be taken very seriously, and that is what I am doing as the ANC candidate,” he added in an interview.
He revealed that he wants to focus on discussions with people to identify their problems before engaging various stakeholders on possible solutions.
“Critical issues of Mt Kenya will always revolve first and foremost matters of the economy; they have a lot of entrepreneurship issues, they are very sensitive about their agriculture, coffee, tea, milk," noted Mudavadi.
"So when you engage them it is done on the basis that assurance is being given that you will pursue policies and programmes that will be supportive to this economic agenda. These are issues that one has to engage them on and develop approaches together," he added.
He, however, said that he will prioritise stakeholder engagement rather than working with the perceived regional kingpins.
“We have reached a stage where you talk more of stakeholder’s engagement rather than individuals or what you call kingpin-based approach; people now want to know what you are doing for the agricultural sector, transport, policy on taxation among other areas,” he explained.
Recently, Mudavadi toured Kieni constituency where he was hosted by area MP Kanini Kega.
He has lined up a series of political engagements in the coming days to solidify support.
The ANC leader noted that there was a growing impatience amongst the youth due to unemployment and prohibitive tax regimes that have frustrated their efforts to do business or get jobs.
“We do not know what they are thinking of and what they will eventually do when they get angry at us. They have become rebellious and we need to seek solutions amongst us leaders. This younger generation is not a happy lot," said Mudavadi.
Mr Kega described Mudavadi as a friend to Nyeri people saying that the Mt Kenya region was open to negotiation with everybody.
He said the voters will back the presidential candidate with the best offer for the region.
“We are very accommodative people; we want as many bridegrooms before we can settle on one that will take good care of our people,” said Kega.
“We are open for negotiation with everybody, unlike the Tangatanga who have already committed themselves to Ruto. Mudavadi has been our friend, but the point is that we are open for anybody with the best offer for our people,” added the MP.
Njuguna said talks with the ANC leader revolved around the way forward for the region and the country.
He noted that the region was open to negotiations with politicians seeking the presidency.
“Mudavadi has asked for our support and we shall continue with this conversation because we think Mudavadi is a leader worth engaging. And as a region we think we should consider him among other leaders because we believe Mt Kenya is going to play a major role in the 2022 succession politics,” he said.
Similar views were shared by Musyimi, who said that they will continue with such candidate engagements in preparations for the next General Election.
“We have followed your story and your convictions, the things you have done in government and even as a profession in the lands sector, and we feel very proud to be associated with you," said the lawmakers.
The former MP, "We are grateful for the candid conversations we have had, sometimes candid conversations are usually rough but as long as they are honest from the heart and they reflect the concerns and constraints of our people across board then they become very helpful."
Former Ndia MP Stephen Ngare said that leaders seeking the support of the region have to spell out their agenda for the coffee industry.
He said the sector was completely down with value addition, adding that farmers feel the government has let them down.
Others in the meeting were former Murangá deputy governor Gakure Monyo, former MPs Esther Murugi, John Kihagi and Kamande Mwangi.
Mudavadi was accompanied by Senators Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi) and Cleophas Malalah (Kakamega) and ANC Party Chairman Kelvin Lunani.
ODM leader Raila Odinga is in Kisumu County today (Monday) as he seeks to put his house in order ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to the region in a week’s time.
The two leaders are expected to unveil several handshake projects when Kisumu hosts this year’s Madaraka Day celebrations on June 1.
The move is part of the efforts he has put in place to ensure that the President does not walk into a hostile crowd following claims of betrayal over the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process that has run into a brick wall.
The Standard has established that the ODM chief is hoping to calm the sense of disquiet in his ODM party and backyard over the stalled BBI process.
The ODM chief will meet ODM leaders from the region in a meeting that is meant to resolve some of the woes that have rocked the Orange party in the recent past.
A number of ODM officials told The Standard that they have been invited to the meeting in one of the hotels in Kisumu.
Although the agenda of the meeting has been kept a closely-guarded secret, sources told The Standard that unity of the party, preparations for Madaraka Day celebrations and the 2022 succession quest, tops the list of issues the ODM chief wants to discuss.
But it is the crack in the ODM party that risks publicly embarrassing the ODM chief should local politics and supremacy battles within his own party play out during the national celebrations.
In the last couple of days, Raila’s main foot soldiers including Senate Minority Leader James Orengo, Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo, party chairman John Mbadi and ODM’s Director of Elections Junet Mohamed have been engaged in a war of words.
Some of Raila’s key lieutenants such as Orengo will be expected to deliver speeches during the national celebrations.
BBI Secretariat co-chairmen Junet Mohamed and Dennis Waweru described the ruling as more focused on the taskforce and deliberately ignored the BBI Secretariat as the promoters of the Bill.
"The judges stopped the President who is not a promoter of the BBI Bill. We assure Kenyans that we shall continue to promote the constitutional amendment Bill until it is ratified by Kenyans," said Junet.
Yesterday, the secretariat released a list of stakeholders, meetings and number of written submissions that cumulatively helped build the BBI Bill that the courts declared unconstitutional.
They explained that before the Bill came into being, the 14 member BBI Taskforce led by the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji engaged deeply and widely including meeting over 400 elected leaders, present and past, prominent local voices from the community and youth and and the 755 handwritten submissions during public forums in the counties
They said the Haji-led taskforce received presentations from 123 individuals representing major institutions, including constitutional bodies and major stakeholders in the civil and private sector spaces and 261 individuals and organisations who emailed memoranda.
"Due care was taken to ensure that the face of Kenya was captured in this process: The Taskforce consulted more than 7,000 citizens from all ethnic groups, genders, cultural and religious practices and different social and economic sectors," read their statement.
The BBI secretariat said details of all individuals and groups that participated either in person or through written memoranda are at pages 134 to 154 of the taskforce report.
And to prove further wide consultation, the team said the BBI Steering committee was subsequently appointed to validate the report of the taskforce and once again met Kenyans from all walks of life and those who contributed were captured in pages 161 to 173 of the Steering Committee’s Report.
"The validation exercise was conducted through the following content and report implementation, national Stakeholder Validation Fora. The Steering Committee held a total of 93 stakeholder consultation meetings at the KICC, Laico Regency hotel and at its offices in Nairobi," the statement added.
The foras, they explained, were attended by representatives from civil society, faith-based organisations, women’s groups, youth groups, persons with disability (PWD) groups, cultural leaders and Government and regional meetings took place across the country to discuss and validate the taskforce report.
On Friday, Junet said they respect the High Court's decision, but they do not agree with it and they will explore all options to ensure people-driven review of the 2010 Constitution.
"As law abiding leaders, we respect the decision of the court. But we don’t agree with it. Consequently, we are setting up a legal team to look into and appeal the ruling. We assure all Kenyans who believe in the BBI and it’s promise, not to give up. It’s is not over yet. We will fight to the bitter end for that dream to be realised," said Junet.
Waweru said the BBI process was people driven and Kenyans are will to change the Constitution to improve governance and take more resources to the grassroots.
"The proposed additional 70 constituencies will ensure more money is taken to the grassroots and improve the economic situation across the country. The hiccup encountered at the High Court will be over soon," he assured Kenyans.
ODM party leader Raila Odinga (pictured) may have disliked the court’s outcome on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) judgement, but still intends to appeal the decision.
In a party statement on Saturday, Raila avowed: “We will calmly and respectfully move to the Court of Appeal to present our case as to why we think the High Court did not render the right verdict. We will do so with sobriety and with respect for our judges and courts.”
His sentiments breaking a two-day long silence on High Court’s ruling declaring the BBI process as unlawful, null, and void.
The former Premier however called for restraint from personalised attacks on the court and its members, especially the five judge-bench that delivered the Thursday ruling.
He stated: “We may disagree with the court but we must respect its ruling and its freedom to exercise its judgment as it understands the legal and constitutional matters before it.”
Raila's team will be heading to the Appellate Court to seek a second opinion, in hopes that it shall revive ‘Reggae’.
Other BBI proponents including BBI Secretariat co-chair Junet Mohammed also vowed to appeal the decision.
In a televised address yesterday, Junet is quoted as saying: "We respect the decision of the court but we don't agree with it. It is not over yet; We will fight to the bitter end until a new Kenya is realised.”
Top legal minds including Bobby Mkangi, Charles Kanjama, Steve Ogolla and Elias Mutuma, however, believe the petitioners would have a low chance of success, while another section led by Prof. Ben Sihanya and Tom Joseph Kajwang, believe the lower court’s ruling would be overturned at the Appellate court.
Raila, an avid promoter of the BBI has in the past expressed that it must be subjected to a referendum.
“We agreed that the BBI must be subjected to a referendum because it entails a fundamental reorganization of the architecture of the Executive and Kenyans need to have a say in the reorganization,” he said in March.
Victim or villain? Wajir governor's long journey in corridors of justice
Wajir Governor Mohamud Abdi (left) and his Lawyer Paul Nyamodi during the impeachment debate at Senate chambers, bunge buildings, Nairobi.
The Senate select committee hearing impeachment proceedings against Wajir Governor Abdi Mohamud declined to summon family members after Members of the County Assembly accused them of graft.
Nyamira Senator Okong’o Omogeni-led team had been told by the MCAs through lawyer Ahmednasir Mohamed that the wife and children had some serious explaining to do about skewed payments made by the county government, which the county assembly believes were kickbacks running into millions of shillings.
So weighty are the MCAs' accusations against the Mohamud family that they claimed the county first lady was akin to the “Supreme Leader,” upon whose discretion lay the survival of senior technocrats in the county government.
“It is an open secret in Wajir County and far beyond that Mrs Kheira Omar is the supreme leader and it's always her way or the highway," Elnur-Tulatula MCA Abdullahi Issack told the Senate.
For Mohamud though, it is not just his integrity and career on the line – his family has been dragged into the murky world of politics – with his wife Kheria Omar, son Yusuf Mohammed Abdi and Daughter Ferhiya Mohammed key persons of interest.
As a reprieve, in its ruling on Wednesday, the House team declined to summon the family members but ordered that a fourth witness – businessman Osman Jibale – appear before the committee to shed more light on suspect payments to several of his companies and remittances allegedly made to the Mohamud family.
Jibale was, however, no show on Thursday, and was also unreachable on phone, when the assembly legal team attempted to call him.
Jibale, the MCAs claim is a distant nephew of the first lady – adding to governor Mohamud’s tribulations – as the 11-member team retreated to draft a report this weekend ahead of a likely tabling before the House tomorrow (Sunday).
Mohamud was impeached in a vote backed by 37 MCAs against 10.
Among the charges facing the governor is a gross violation of the Constitution, corruption, abuse of office, poor service and gross misconduct.
The 11-member Senate team include Johnson Sakaja (Nairobi), Mwangi Githiomi (Nyandarua), Susan Kihika (Nakuru), Godana Hargura (Marsabit) and Okong’o Omogeni (Nyamira).
Others are Mithika Linturi (Meru), Fred Outa (Kisumu), Agnes Muthama (Machakos), Issa Juma (Kwale) and nominated Senators Petronilla Were and Christine Zawadi.
Mohamud has been in and out of court for the last three years having had his election challenged all the way to the Doho Maduong' Mogik.
The tumultuous start of Mohamud’s tenure as governor, would ironically, however, come to define his slightly over three years in power – fighting at the courts, and in the county assembly to remain in power – the climax of which is his current impeachment battle at the Senate.
When Justice Fred Mabeya quashed his election on January 12, 2018, there was a mix of celebration and uproar loaded in the clan and political undertones.
At the time, immediate former Governor Ahmed Abdulahi had petitioned the election on among other grounds electoral malpractice and Mohamud’s then alleged lack of a university degree, a requirement for all gubernatorial aspirants.
The Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the nullification but at the Doho Maduong' Mogik, Mohamud recouped his seat.
Curiously – like classic echoes from the past, lawyer Ahmednassir Abdulahi was the same man that tormented his legal team up to the Doho Maduong' Mogik, while representing the former governor.
This week, Governor Mohamud told the Senate team: “I believe this impeachment is politically motivated with malice and witch-hunt.”
Among critical defense witnesses, the governor called to the stand, was Wajir county acting secretary Abdulahi Hassan Maalim, who also accused the assembly of a political witch-hunts.
Maalim told the Senate team that Mohamud had worked extremely hard to improve service delivery in the county and denied claims of vacating his decision-making powers to his wife.
“I am not aware of the first lady being a member of the Executive Committee chairing any meetings. From 2018 to date, there is nowhere we have met the first faddy to discuss substantive matters of the county,” Maalim said.
Delay to enact referendum law led to killer blow for BBI
Majority Leader Amos Kimunya (centre) flanked by Minority Whip Hon Junet Mohammed (from left) Majority Whip Emmanuel Wangwe and Eldas MP Adan Keynan address the media after the bunge passed the BBI Bill at the bunge buildings, Nairobi. May 7, 2021.
The absence of a law to guide the referendum process was among the many issues that sank the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020 on Thursday.
In their ruling, the five High Court judges found that the Bill birthed by the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) was launched when there was no legislation governing the process leading to and the conduct of a referendum.
“A declaration is issued that in the absence of the legislation or legal framework to govern the collection, presentation and verification of signatures and conduct of a referendum in the circumstances of this case renders the attempt to amend the Constitution of Kenya through the amendment Bill 2020 flawed,” presiding judge Joel Ngugi read the court’s decision.
The judges noted that bunge had acknowledged the apparent vacuum and had moved to propose the required legislation to address the gaps.
This was in reference to the separate versions of a Referendum Bill sponsored by two National Assembly Committees
The Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee (CIOC), which is chaired by Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni, fronted the Referendum Bill, 2020 in June last year.
The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC), currently chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano, has its version – the Referendum (No. 2) Bill, 2020 – which was tabled in bunge by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo.
At the moment, the JLAC version, which was tabled first, is at the committee stage, with CIOC Bill still at the First Reading stage.
The National Assembly speaker Justin Muturi ruled that the JLAC proposal be given priority after the CIOC and JLAC failed to develop a consolidated Bill as advised by the speaker.
In his ruling issued in February this year, Muturi found that the JLAC proposal had resulted from a consultative process between the committee and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) dating back to 2015.
“Should the Bill sponsored by JLAC be withdrawn by the mover or get lost at any stage, the House will result to considering the Bill sponsored by the CIOC in the published form. This would be a last resort,” ruled Muturi.
As the dust settles on Thursday's ruling, Kioni faults the courts and bunge, to some extent, for the current state of affairs.
Kioni believes that bunge dragged its feet in enacting a referendum law.
“We should have processed this Bill much earlier. As a committee, we thought of a framework as the BBI Bill was processed. The House Business Committee should explain why it did not prioritise our Bill earlier," Kioni said.
He, however, said Thursday’s court ruling disregarded to the prevailing realities.
“The Constitution lists the necessary principles for conducting a referendum and it is the nitty-gritty that needs to be tidied up,” he said, terming the BBI process as one that captured the imagination of Kenyans.
"Kenyans must know that they have the sovereign right to say how they want things to be done. The judges should have cautioned the applicants for going to court too late. You cannot sit on your rights.”
Both the JLAC and CIOC Bills prescribe the process of conducting a referendum, even as the CIOC proposal restricted itself to amendments resulting from a popular initiative.
As stipulated in the Constitution, both Bills state that a popular initiative shall be backed by at least a million registered voters.
As ruled on Thursday, IEBC will be required to verify the signatures through a proper framework.
The JLAC Bill further proposes that not more than a third of those who sign up shall be from one county.
Proposed amendment
“Voters in at least 24 counties shall be represented,” reads the JLAC referendum Bill in part, which also makes it mandatory to publish the names and signatures of those who support a draft Bill.
Both Bills had seemingly foreseen the likelihood of a multi-choice referendum.
“Each question to be determined during a referendum shall require the voter to select an answer that is either “yes” or “no”,” reads the Kioni Bill
The JLAC Bill, however, falls short of the judges’ verdict that each proposed amendment would be a separate question as it only allows that a proposed initiative may be challenged by another in the form of separate draft Bills.
High Court ruling on BBI sets stage for challenging key government decisions
Justices Teresia Matheka, George Odunga, Joel Ngugi, Jairus Ngaah and Chacha Mwita at a Court in Milimani on Thursday, May 13, 2021, delivering the judgement on eight consolidated petitions challenging the BBI Referendum.
The landmark decision by the High Court to scuttle the Building Bridges Initiative has drawn sharp reactions from constitutional lawyers over its implication to the country.
Whereas some lawyers celebrated the decision as a bold statement by the Judiciary to stop an illegal process, other legal experts argued that the decision was illegal as the judges themselves violated the Constitution by failing to correctly apply the law in determining the issues raised.
According to lawyer Duncan Okatch, the judges opened a Pandora’s Box where we are likely to see several cases of people challenging some decisions that has been taken by President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
“The judges seemed to have even gone against decisions of other judges from the same court on interpretation of the Constitution on some of the issues raised. The implication is that we are likely to see several litigations against actions that have been taken by some institutions,” said Okatch.
From their final orders, which contained 23 declarations, legal experts said Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresia Matheka judgements could be summarised into four broad sections which have far reaching consequences.
Top on the list was the declaration that President Kenyatta violated the Constitution and that he has no powers to initiate changes to the Constitution.
The judges also ruled that civil court proceedings can be instituted against the president or a person performing the functions of the Office of President during their tenure of office and that the steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges to a United Kenya Taskforce Report established by the president is an unconstitutional and unlawful entity.
Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Nelson Havi says that the judgment is an indictment on President Kenyatta. He was of the view that the breach of the Constitution is a serious matter that he can be personally held accountable for.
According to him, the judge’s reference to the president as a Mr Uhuru amounts to stripping him of his status as a Head of State.
“There is no decision of the High Court that is clear on the misconduct of the president as this one. If it were in Israel or India, he would have resigned. You realised they have referred to him as a Mr Kenyatta; they have stripped him of the stature of a president,” said Havi.
Constitutional lawyer Kibe Mungai, however, said it will be a Herculean task as the president enjoys majority support in both houses of bunge owing to his Handshake partner Raila Odinga.
“It is not very new, it is a clarification that they are doing that to show the president can be sued in his personal capacity and not about his functions, for example, if a president is to rob a bank, he will be sued as an individual and not as the president,” said Mungai.
Secondly, the lawyers said the judgement revolved around the process used by President Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on promoting the BBI.
The judges had ruled that the entire constitutional change process promoted by the BBI Steering Committee is unconstitutional, null and void.
According to lawyer Duncan Savwa, the judges’ decision meant the BBI process was built on quicksand, and the promoters have to go back to the drawing board.
“The implication of the pronouncement on the changes proposed in the BBI is that there is nothing in it that can be implemented given that the whole process was a nullity from the beginning when they started collecting signatures,” said Savwa.
On the composition of the IEBC, Okatch stated that the judges got it wrong in declaring that the IEBC is not properly constituted.
He said although the judges meant to say that their decision is only limited to the BBI case, the interpretation will mean that so many decisions that have been made by the commission from the time there were only three commissioners are null and void.
“It means that even all the by-elections, which have been conducted by the commission are illegal and that they have no capacity to carry out any other election,” said Okatch.
Members of bunge allied to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) say they are not interested in initiating an impeachment process despite Thursday's scathing court verdict for President Uhuru Kenyatta.
The High Court, while upholding a consolidated case by eight petitioners, said the 14-member Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) steering committee, which was gazetted by President Uhuru, and led by the late Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji, was unconstitutional.
The bench, led by Justice Joel Ngugi, said the president erred in initiating a process to change the constitution through a popular initiative.
The court also observed that Uhuru was in breach of the constitution - an impeachable offence.
On Friday, MPs Alice Wahome (Kandara) and Sylvanus Osoro (South Mugirango) said the judgement was a big win for the constitution and sovereignty of the people of Kenya.
“We celebrate the judiciary. They have redeemed the nation from the shackles of dictatorship. You cannot make the constitution-making process your own bid. The document belongs to Kenyans. Ordinary Kenyans have been talking about all these issues,” said Wahome.
Wahome said the Head of State should make amends after threatening the constitution by first approving the appointment of 41 new judges who were forwarded to him in mid-2019.
“Our team is not interested in the impeachment process but we need President Uhuru Kenyatta to come out clear on some issues. The president was found to have breached the integrity and provisions of chapter six of the constitution. The Head of State has violated the constitution. Let him start by appointing judges. He has failed an honorary duty,” Wahome added.
According to Osoro, the Bill was gazetted against the wishes of ordinary citizens.
“We are on record in bunge that we wanted to know who gave the president powers to initiate such a process. They have wasted public resources to change the law illegally, “said Osoro.
Osoro said the president should explain how monies spent in the process will be recovered, and provide an outline on how the court’s concerns shall be resolved.
Any Kenyan can push the motion to impeach the president, but for now we have better things to do.
“The arrogance by some leaders, surrounding the president, has been put on hold. The blame is squarely on the country’s Attorney General. The brave judges have given this country time to celebrate. This is a jurisprudence across the world. Give people options on what they want to change,” added Osoro.
Bonchari, Juja by-elections in limbo as AG heads to Court of Appeal
Two by-elections that are to be conducted next week may not happen following yesterday's High Court’s verdict that Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has no quorum.
While pleading with the High Court judges to suspend their finding on the IEBC’s quorum for at least 14 days, IEBC lawyer Eric Gumbo argued that the electoral agency was handicapped and that the by-elections in Bonchari and Juja constituencies may not happen next week.
“On behalf of the IEBC, we have a unique concern that cannot wait. Because the court has touched on the quorum of the IEBC, the IEBC is put in an awkward position because of a by-election slated for Monday in Juja and another by-election in Bonchari,” the lawyer argued. He added that the Constitution required the commission to conduct a by-election within 90 days.
“The timelines within which the by-elections must be conducted have been defiled and are cast on stone. Because of that unique concern, if we will wait for the formal application, substantial prejudice will be prejudiced,” he said.
The decision by the five-judge bench not only affects the two by-elections, but they also have an implication on other by-elections conducted by the current commissioners.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Kihara Kairuki vowed to challenge the verdict on the Building Bridges Initiative before the Court of Appeal.
In his application seeking to have the five-judge bench suspend the implementation of its judgment to allow him to appeal, Justice Kihara explained that he was aggrieved with the court’s decision that the process was illegal, adding that public interest on the matter needed an interpretation by a higher court.
According to him, the Amendment Bill, which was challenged before Justices Prof Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresiah Matheka and Chacha Mwita, was validated by 3 million Kenyans, passed by more than 24 counties, and subsequently passed by National Assembly and the Senate.
“It is in the public interest that pending the filing of the Appeal and to enable him to exercise his right of appeal, an interim stay of execution of the judgment be hereby stayed. It is critical to take judicial notice of the fact that the BBI process has been undertaken extensively, over 3 million signatures have been collected, to the critical constitutional processes such as consideration of the Bill by the county assemblies have been undertaken, the Amendment Bill has been passed by the majority members of the National Assembly and the Senate,” argued Solicitor General Ken Ogeto.
“Second relates to that the judgment you have just rendered raises fundamental questions with far-reaching implications. The Hon AG is dissatisfied with the judgment in its entirety, and he has firm instructions to move to the court of Appeal to challenge this decision. The public interest is a serious consideration in considering a relief in a matter such as this. I urge your honor to grant a stay of your judgment.”
Kabogo announces bid to run for president in 2022
Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said he will vie for the presidency in next year's elections.
Kabogo said he has what it takes to lead the country.
Speaking on Thursday, the former governor announced that he is in the process of registering a new political party on whose ticket he will seek the country's top job.
"The owner of Jubilee Party is set to retire next year. This means we need a new political party that will push the interests of Mt Kenya region," said Kabogo.
He added: "I don't agree with President Uhuru Kenyatta that the Kikuyu community should not field a presidential candidate next year. I don't think someone should look at me in terms of a community. I am an individual candidate and my name will be on the ballot."
Kabogo said his will be a national party that will accommodate all Kenyans along.
"Mt Kenya region can produce a presidential candidate after which we can negotiate with other leaders as we head into 2022," he said.
Kabogo unsuccessfully vied for the Kiambu governorship in 2017 as an independent candidate after missing out on the Jubilee ticket which went to Ferdinand Waititu.
Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro kicked out of bunge for four days over claims of bribery
Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro was on Thursday suspended from the National Assembly for four days for claiming that MPs were bribed to vote for the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) Bill.
National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi had summoned Nyoro and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria to substantiate claims that some MPs were induced before they voted for the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
The Speaker asked the Kiharu MP if he indeed called members conmen, cowards, sell outs and traitors.
"Did you make those allegations or not?" Posed Muturi.
The MP said some members used their stomachs and were cowards, traitors and sell outs who bought and some voted because of the directives from their party leaders.
After protests by MPs, Muturi ruled to suspend Nyoro from the precincts of bunge for the next four days. "Ndindi Nyoro is going to be suspended from this House including his office for the period of four days," he said.
This means that the Kiharu MP will not be allowed to visit his office at the continental House.
Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang said that Nyoro was putting the integrity of members at risk.
Earlier, the Gatundu MP had sensationally admitted in an interview with the BBC that he was induced with a bribe to vote for Majority Leader Amos Kimunya.
Kuria told the BBC that inducement especially to pass government business was a normal affair in the National Assembly.
“It is not uncommon in Kenya for Members of bunge to be paid or compensated to vote in a particular way, especially when the government has an interest in a matter,” said Kuria
He claimed that he received Sh100,000 to vote for Kimunya, to take over from former Majority Leader and Garissa Township legislator Aden Duale in June last year.
“When the new Majority Leader was appointed because they were not elected, we went to the Majority Leader’s office and received a USD 1000 gift, this is common in bunge,” Kuria claimed.
The Gatundu South MP said he was willing to return the Sh100,000.
Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi, cronies accused of squandering Covid-19 funds
Wajir County Assembly has accused the embattled Governor Mohamed Abdi of running down healthcare in the devolved unit.
In his submission, Habaswein Ward MCA Abdirahman Dahir told a senatorial impeachment committee that money allocated for the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic was misappropriated, exposing the locals to a dilapidated healthcare system.
The witness swore that the county boss and his cronies conspired to squander all the money allocated to the health docket.
The submissions were made as the impeachment hearing entered its second day.
“They did not spare a dime even during the time the county is faced with Covid-19. The money allocated for health care has been mismanaged with basic services such as free county ambulances in Eldas Constituency being available for those who can pay for it, money allocated for fuel and maintenance services also found its way to personal pockets,” claimed the witness.
But Lawyer Ndegwa Njiru, representing the governor, moved to dismantle some of the claims describing the witness as “having nothing useful to add other than lies presented in the affidavit”.
He questioned the witness qualifications to determine if healthcare was not being managed as required after Dahir claimed that he has been visiting various public hospitals in the county to establish their status.
The witness could also not provide documentation to prove that money allocated for the department was squandered by the executive.
The MCA claimed that it was an open secret that Wajir County’s health care system is at its worse since independence.
“The people of Habaswein Ward have not been spared by the greed and insatiable urge for money from the team of the governor and his cronies. The Habaswein Sub County Referral Hospital has been dragged into a crisis,” he alleged.
He claimed that the Griftu Sub-County Referral Hospital was shut down after its casual laborer’s downed their tools citing poor working conditions and delayed payment of their wages.
He added that most public hospitals in the county suffer from an acute lack of medical supplies and equipment needed for the day-to-day running of the facilities.
He said that despite the county government receiving funds from various sources in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic, there was little to show for the mobilised resources.
The monies included Sh5 billion conditional grant; funds from the ministry of health allocated for Covid-19 emergency allowance for frontline health care workers; Sh9,450,000 from the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); and Sh194,000,00 appropriated from the Wajir County Supplementary Budget 2019/2020.
The witness claimed that the county government embarked on a shopping spree and began the journey for the creation of Covid-19 billionaires by squandering money it had received to combat the disease.
“This was done in blatant disregard of the guidelines and caps set by the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the County Government Act, the Public Finance Act and the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act No. 33 of 2015 and the Records Disposal Act Chapter 14 of the Laws of Kenya,” he added.
Earlier, the defense lawyers sought to discount submission by Diff Ward MCA Shueb Bare Ahmed, who linked the family to several companies that traded with the county government.
Lawyer Njiru pushed the witness to provide any documentation linking the said firms to the family members of the governor. The witness could not provide form CR12 to prove directorship.
The defense team also sought to know the source of bank statements that the witness used to demonstrate how the companies wired kickbacks to the governor’s wife, Khaire Omar, immediately after they received payments.
“It is your evidence that the first lady has been running affairs of the county. Which department of the county; the executive or the assembly? You have said that for you to be paid you have to seek the blessings of the first lady, what kind of blessings?” posed the lawyer.
“I want you to take us to that particular accounts that you said have received the monies. How did you get hold of the bank statement?’ he went on.
The MCA said he obtained the documents from a whistleblower, who he could not name.
The witness could also not provide documentary evidence that the governor’s spouse chaired several meetings of the executive.
When pressed, he said some of the meetings were informal as they took place at the governor’s private home.
The committee suggested that they may consider writing to banks named in the transactions to authenticate bank statements provided by the county assembly.
“There has been question on the source of documents. I want to be on record that if we compel the said institutions to provide the documents, is it what you have attached that we will get?’ Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja posed.
Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wangwe has said the BBI proposals will change Kenya's political structure and secure everybody's interests.
Wangwe said the overwhelming endorsement of the BBI Bill in both houses of bunge demonstrates that the president is fully in charge and his ‘foot soldiers’ are keen to deliver on his agenda.
“By garnering a rare more than two-thirds in the National Assembly and the Senate, President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga have flexed their political muscle and showed they are the real heavyweights,” he said.
The legislator who doubles up as the Majority Chief Whip said proposals in the BBI Bill will be a game-changer in Kenyan politics.
“The proposed sharing of power in the Executive and strengthened oversight roles will alter governance in a big way and the winner will be the common man. The new structure will also promote inclusivity and make more communities feel represented in the highest offices,” he said.
His sentiments come as the High Court is set to rule on the BBI process today.
Wangwe said after the verdict, BBI proponents will go to mwananchi and convince them to support the draft ahead of the referendum.
“We are ready to campaign for the BBI proposals and bring more Kenyans on our side. We must continue the pursuit of a more progressive society. More money is being taken to the ground through the BBI proposals, hence our support,” he said.
He said politics is about numbers where leaders stand to be counted on a particular issue.
“Before the vote in both houses, there was talk of resistance to the BBI Bill, but when the lawmakers were called to vote, they endorsed the proposed constitutional amendments overwhelmingly. This also shows Kenyans are ready to improve the 2010 Constitution for a more just and progressive future,” he said.
The approval of the referendum bill by lawmakers allied to Deputy President William Ruto has brought to the fore the reality of politics as a competition for allocation and retention of resources.
By voting in support of the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2020 – after opposing the document for more than a year – a section of Ruto-supporting MPs and Senators gave the strongest indication that they can easily switch camps ahead of the 2022 elections based on personal and regional interests.
Some key DP allies in Coast, North Eastern, Mt Kenya, Western and Kisii voted in support of the Bill, a rude awakening likely to send the DP back to the drawing board to identify dependable foot soldiers ahead of the succession battle.
Of the 320 MPs who voted in the second reading, 235 voted in support, 83 voted against while two abstained.
On Wednesday, a section of Ruto allies described their colleagues who voted in support of the BBI as political flip-floppers and cowards, who cannot be relied on for the 2022 battle.
But others claimed that fear of backlash forced some MPs to back the Bill since their counties were benefiting from additional resources and constituencies while others claimed state intimidation.
But allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga said the vote was a lesson to Ruto that he cannot win votes outside Rift Valley without working with regional kingpins.
They claimed that Ruto had been relying on political lightweights, who can not stand up against their regional supremos to deliver votes.
“Definitely both camps will undergo some political realignments ahead of the polls. I was not surprised by some of my colleagues. But it is good to have a stand; because if you have been singing anti-BBI songs but when it comes to voting, you go YES; people will say you do not have a stand,” said Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, a Ruto ally.
“Voting YES means you agree with the document. They have weakened themselves and are people who cannot be depended on. You cannot be saying any all this time and when it comes to voting you say YES. That was cowardice of them,” he added.
Garissa Township MP Aden Duale said some MPs, who were opposed to the Bill but voted in support of it, were scared of political backlash from their backyard as they stand to benefit from the additional constituencies.
Duale was one of the few MPs from North Eastern, who voted against the Bill last week on Thursday.
“When the rubber meets the road, I will not think twice on my political affiliation, political formation or personal interest; I will think of the interest of Muslim community and by extension Somali community,” said Duale.
“I have been consistent in defending the right of the people and I will not think about my political affiliation even if I am the only one standing. Without any contradiction, among the things in BBI that I do not agree with is on the issue of representation and resources. If my region gained in terms of resources, I would have voted yes,” he added.
Duale disclosed that MPs backing Ruto were told to make independent decisions based on how their regions were going to be affected by the document.
Aldai MP Cornelly Serem said that it was the creation of the media that Ruto was opposed to the BBI Bill.
Serem noted that Ruto and his allies only raised issues with certain clauses and did not ask MPs to vote against the document.
“We did not tell people to vote in a certain way. We told our people to look at their regional interests. It was never a contest. There was no time we said we were going to vote No,” said the MP who voted against the Bill.
Some of the notable Ruto allies that voted in support of the Bill include Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati), Feisal Bader (Msambweni), Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga), David Sankok (nominated), Kareke Mbiuki (Maara), Joash Nyamoko (North Mugirango), William Chepkut (Ainabkoi), Purity Kathambi (Njoro), David Gikaria (Nakuru East) and Malulu Injendi.
Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu said that the DP was depending on the wrong people for his 2022 presidential bid. He claimed that most of the MPs cannot sacrifice for Ruto and were only with him for personal benefit.
“What they did means that they can switch camps at any moment. Very few people are ready to sacrifice for standing with Ruto, they will all vanish if their survival is threatened,” said Mr Wambugu.
“The people the DP has are not committed to his course. The vote shows that the DP does not have a hold of people outside Rift Valley. He will have to go to the regional kingpins that he has been avoiding if he is serious with his bid. The vote has essentially made him realise that politics is local,” he added.
The Uhuru ally said that Ruto can only bank on Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichungwa and Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira) from Mt Kenya.
Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, a proponent of BBI, said the vote reduced the DP to a community leader, who has no support outside his Rift Valley turf.
Mr Atwoli said that those who do not believe in the BBI will be reduced to political spectators in Uhuru’s succession.
“Politics is like a heavy downpour, when it rains the water will always find its natural course. That is exactly what happened in the National Assembly. If you don’t believe in the handshake you will be a spectator in the succession politics,” he said.
“The landscape of 2022 is now taking shape and the vote shows that he has no committed political allies; after this vote he was reduced a community leader. Political realignments are out there for everyone to see,” added Atwoli.
He said that those who rely on huge political rallies as a sign of popularity will be shocked when the people cast the ballot for the next president.
National Assembly Minority Whip Junet Mohammed said that Ruto has been banking on the wrong people for his political bid.
Junet claimed that some of the MPs were with the DP for “tokens” but will leave him when elections are called.
“These are people who are with him because of his money, at the end of it all they will go back to supporting the Handshake. Look at the total number of MPs in Central; only 10 per cent are with him based on the vote,” he said.
Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju said he was not surprised by the turn of events.
“A politician can change anytime. Very few politicians can be relied on,” said Tuju.
The powerful Jubilee Party organ has endorsed the purge of three MPs for opposing the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) and supporting the ideals of other parties.
The National Management Committee (NMC) yesterday directed the party’s disciplinary committee to begin the process that could lead to the expulsion of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, Nominated MP Cecily Mbarire and Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga.
In yesterday’s meeting at Jubilee headquarters, the NMC noted that the Gatundu South MP has been espousing the ideals of the People’s Empowerment Party (PEP) in contravention of the Political Parties Act.
Jubilee vice chair David Murathe said they had zeroed in on Mr Kuria for supporting George Koimburi, a PEP candidate, for the Juja by-election yet Jubilee has a candidate.
The by-election in Juja was occasioned by the demise of MP Francis Waititu popularly know as Wakapee on February 22 and Jubilee fronted his widow, Susan Njeri Waititu.
The by-election is scheduled for May 18.
Mr Murathe said the MP has been actively campaigning for Mr Koimburi.
“We have asked the Jubilee disciplinary committee to take up the matter and summon him to answer to the accusations. If he is culpable, we will remove him from the party through expulsion; we must retain discipline in our party,” said Murathe.
He said Ms Omanga and Ms Mbarire will face the disciplinary committee for voting against the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
Murathe said support for BBI was a party position and therefore those who voted against it did so in disregard of the same.
During debate preceding the voting at the National Assembly, Mbarire was among the MPs who passionately spoke out against the BBI Bill, arguing it clawed back the gains of the 2010 Constitution.
“The minute we have the Executive be the head of bunge and the Judiciary, then this would be the beginning of the end of democracy. This Bill takes away the gains we fought for with our lives and sweat and blood and should it pass, one day we will regret our decision,” she said.
She added, “Where will we get justice if a judge knows that they could easily lose their job?”
Senator Omanga opposed the Bill, saying it would put more pressure on the ‘hustlers’ who were already suffering because of the poor economic situation.
“The Bill will see over-taxation of the hustlers. I oppose it,” said Omanga.
For their opposition to the Bill, Mbarire and Omanga will have a date with the Lumatete Muchai-led Jubilee disciplinary committee.
This will not be the first time Omanga is facing the committee.
Last year, she was among five other nominated senators who were accused of openly defying their party leader during the Senate leadership purge.
The others were Mary Seneta, Falhada Iman, Naomi Waqo, Alice Milgo and Isaac Mwaura.
The National Executive Council had endorsed their removal, but the Political Parties and Dispute Tribunal saved them.
The six were accused of snubbing a State House meeting last year where President Kenyatta had sought to ratify removal of Deputy President William Ruto’s allies, Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and his Nakuru counterpart Susan Kihika from Leader of Majority and Majority Whip positions, respectively.
They were replaced by West Pokot Senator Samuel Poghisio and his Murang’a counterpart Irungu Kang’ata.
Also targeted for removal is UDA Secretary-General Veronica Maina, who Jubilee has accused of serving in positions of two political outfits.
Before joining UDA, Ms Maina held a senior position in Jubilee.
Murathe said they had also agreed as NMC that they were interested in the party resolution mechanism that UDA had sought for after they wrote to the Registrar of Political Parties seeking dissolution of a 2018 partial coalition pact with PDR, now UDA.
UDA has written to the registrar declaring a dispute with Jubilee following the move to end the coalition pact.
“As provided for in the coalition agreement deposited in your office on May 30, 2018, in compliance with Section 10 (4) of the Political Parties Act No 11 of 2012 Schedule 3 thereof, and further pursuant to provisions of Article 6 of the said Coalition agreement, we have therefore declared dispute,” Maina said.
Last year, the party removed MPs allied to Ruto from plum positions in bunge, including former National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Senate Deputy Speaker Kithure Kindiki and Meru Senator Mithika Linturi.
Others who were shown the door were Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei, Bomet’s Christopher Lang’at and John Kinyua of Laikipia, all chairmen of key Senate committees.
Garissa MCAs have started the process of removing Speaker Ahmed Ibrahim Abass from office over alleged gross misconduct.
About 36 ward reps have already signed the motion accusing the speaker of gross violation of the Constitution.
Led by Maalimin MCA Mohamud Aden, the mover of the motion, the MCAs said yesterday they were waiting for the assembly clerk to officially notify the speaker of their intention to impeach him.
“We have officially filed a notice of motion by way of impeachment motion in accordance with the Constitution,” said the statement read by Aden on behalf of his colleagues.
The MCAs also accused the speaker of incompetence and gross misconduct, saying he has been running the House like a "kiosk" in total disregard of the procedures.
At the same time, Dadaab MCA Mohamed Abdi said the motion was not about clan or politics.
“We would like to assure members of the public and the executive that there will be no interruption of services as we execute the legislative process,” he said.
This is not the first time the speaker is facing an impeachment motion. Early last year, a group of MCAs started the impeachment process, but it flopped after they failed to reach the threshold required.
The speaker, who is the former Ijara MP, is a close confidant of Governor Ali Korane.
Efforts to reach him on phone were futile.
WRC releases Safari Rally Kenya list ahead of the June showpiece
The forthcoming Safari Rally Championship in Naivasha has attracted strong names from around the globe who are gearing up for the June 24-27 competition.
The official list, released by the World Rally Championship (WRC) on Friday has Elfyn Evans who is fresh from winning the WRC Portugal leg.
Evans will be up in arms against world champion Sébastien Ogier who will also be particiduond burang under the same Toyota Gazoo brand.
Estonia speed merchant Ott Tanak will lead the Hyundai attack that also has Thierry Neville, considered to be the competition dark horse according to some rally pundit.
Other global manufacturers in the mix are M-Sport Ford team that to be spearheaded by Gus Greensmith whose pace notes will be called by Renaud Jamoul.
Also, Toksport has entered Marco Bulacia to search for their glory.
Back at home, Carl Tundo, fresh from winning the Equator Rally, will be Kenya's hope in his VW Polo R5.
The Minti Motorsport team member is out to stretch his two Safari wins he recorded before the WRC series left Kenya for 19 years.
Other Kenyan's in the WRC saddle are Aakif Verani, Tejveer Rai, Karan Patel and Onkar Rai.
They will all compete in the homologated R5 machines.
World champion Ogier will lead the Toyota Gazoo Racing gladiators in the much anticipated major event in the country.
The Frenchman, whose pace-notes will be called out by compatriot Julien Ingrassia is hungry for an eighth title which he wants to accomplish in a Yaris brand.
"The Toyota Yaris is a car for the super-boys, it's a masterpiece of Japanese engineering,” WRC Safari Rally CEO Phineas Kimathi noted when the machine, to be steered by Ogier at the gruelling Safari, was unveiled in Kenya last week.
To make his intention known, Ogier has already won two legs of the 2021 WRC; the Rallye Monte Carlo and the Croatia Rally.
Ogier is also out for an eighth WRC Driver's Championship title following his victories in the category in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020.
The 38-year old also has 51 wins in the WRC and seven titles of which six are consecutive wins.
The feats place him as the second most successful WRC driver, after former Citroën WRC teammate Sébastien Loeb (nine titles).
Other drivers in the star-studded Toyota mix are Elfyin Evans of Wales to be navigated by Scott Martin of the United Kingdom, Kalle Rovanpera of Finland to be assisted by compatriot Jonne Halttunen and Katsuta Takamoto of Japan who will be guided by Dan Barritt of Great Britain behind the wheel.
Rovanpera is son of Hari Rovanpera, who finished second in the last WRC Safari in 2002.
The Toyota lineup comes just days after South Korean manufacturer Hyundai announced their list for the Safari.
The Hyundai Shell Mobis World Rally Team (i20) will be spearheaded by Estonian speed merchant Tanak.
Tanak, who won his WRC maiden title in 2019 has gone toe to toe with Ogier this season.
He has already won the second leg of the 2021 WRC in Finland.
Other drivers in the Hyundai mix are Thierry Neuville of Belgium to be navigated by Martijn Wydaeghe and Dani Sordo of Spain whose pace notes will be read by Borja Rozada.
Rally purists believe the rocky Sleeping Warrior stage in Naivasha will determine who goes home with the Safari title.
From the ARC championship held at the venue last month, it was evident that anyone who wanted to conquer the tough, muddy, rocky terrains needed considerable time to focus before launching the ferocious attack like a lion.
Arguably, many local fans will throw their weight behind Ogier since Kenya is a Toyota nation, owing to the availability of the brand spare parts.
Local drivers including Carl Tundo, Onkar Rai, Tejveer Rai and Karan Patel are expected to give the global drivers a run for their money if not the bragging rights.
Why climate action is at the heart of Eldoret City Marathon
When at least 600 athletes line up at the third edition of Eldoret City Marathon on Sunday, one race, which is tree planting will be climaxing.
Since the inaugural edition in 2018, the race has lived to its Climate Action theme.
This year alone, three million tree seedlings are expected to be planted prior to and after the race, in areas around Eldoret, the athletics town christened the ‘The City of Champions’ because a majority of world-beaters live and train there.
But why Climate Action?
The Local Organising Committee (LOC) says the millions of trees will be planted in areas where athletes train increasing oxygen supply, a key component in running.
LOC chairman Andrew Chelogoi said the tree planting events are aimed at sustaining fresh air in Eldoret town in areas near major training bases.
Chelogoi said for the last three years, the race’s management, with support from its key sponsors, has consistently sustained the Climate Action theme.
“It is not only about the race. Our athletes should train in conserved environments and Eldoret City Marathon is aiming at planting three million trees this year alone,” the LOC chairman said.
Last year, the race was cancelled but was marked by tree planting at Kapseret forest, which is one of the key training bases in Uasin Gishu.
Kaptagat, Burnt Forest, Kipchoge Keino Stadium, Moi University grounds and the University of Eldoret are among key training areas in the town where the country’s athletes train.
The neighbouring counties of Elgeyo Marakwet and Nandi are known for producing the finest talents.
Retired athlete Daniel Komen told Standard Sport in a recent interview that training in Eldoret and other towns was becoming a health risk thanks to pollution.
“I urge athletes to train in areas away from town. It is risky to train in places with polluted air,” he warned.
Uasin Gishu Kenya Forest Service ecosystem conservator Thomas Kiptoo said at least one million trees will be planted on Saturday, just hours to the race.
“The one million trees will be planted in all streets of Eldoret town on Saturday as part of the official opening ceremony of the marathon,” Kiptoo said.
On Saturday, as preparations for the race entered the home stretch and as focus shifted to management of crowds at the finish line, Joseph Chemuren, representing Athletics Kenya in the LOC said Anti-Doping of Kenya (ADAK) officials will play a central role in the race.
Chemuren said open grounds at the TAC Centre, near the finish line, will be utilised for the VIP podium, athletes resting area and as space for race officials whose services will not be necessary at the finish line.
“We now have a clear layout of the finish line and the final checks are on course. All the Covid-19 protocols for the race will be adhered to,” Chemuren said.
Race officials who will come into contact with athletes during the race must strictly wear face masks,” he said.
LOC secretary, Professor David Some says: “This is the only confirmed event to take place in the country this year and the world is watching. That is why we are careful.”
No soul under the sun can match –with precision and class –the hard work and determination Amos Kipruto summoned to excel in marathons.
Kipruto, the world marathon bronze medalist, is not your typical Kenyan athlete.
From childhood, Kipruto nursed lofty dreams: to stage excellent shows in athletics. And it has come to pass.
Kipruto, who put on hold his athletics desires to concentrate on academics, seems to follow in the counsel of American author Les Brown who once said: “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it, you will still land among the stars.”
The 2016 Rome Marathon winner still draws inspiration from former world marathon record holder Paul Tergat.
Runners up Berlin Marathon 2018 Amos Kipruto after training at Kapsabet Nandi County. 28.05.2021.
He said he picked his running skills from Tergat and former Olympic marathon champion, the late Samuel Wanjiru.
The 28-year-old athlete said he watches their clips online especially ahead of major races.
“I love their fighting spirit especially in the final stages of races. They produced unexpected victories. In most cases, I watch their clips to pick some tactical skills,” said Kipruto, a runner up at the 2018 Berlin Marathon.
His memorable clip is that of Wanjiru battling Ethiopia’s Tsegaye Kabede at the 2010 Chicago Marathon.
“In that clip, Wanjiru was behind at 35km to 40km but he produced a powerful kick in the last two kilometres. It clearly shows that while competing in a marathon, you must have courage and stamina to run faster than expected,” he said.
Positive lessons he learned from the late Sammy Wanjiru, former Olympic marathon winner.
While I was a young boy, Kipruto said he used to compete in inter-school games lining up in 5000m.
“By then, the late Sammy Wanjiru was at the top level. I loved watching him compete. His videos are being watched by many people up to now. His running style was wonderful. And luckily, the coach who trained him is now my coach,” he said.
Kipruto, who finished second when Eliud Kipchoge set the world marathon record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon, said his training runs smoothly.
“My body is responding well. I am ready for the Olympic Games. I started preparing it in April and all has been well.
“My coach and my management follow every step I make in my training. I am under no pressure at the moment. I decided to put training a priority first and then plan for the race day. Preparations will determine the results.
“I am happy to race again with Eliud Kipchoge, who is my mentor. I competed against Kipchoge when he set the marathon world record at the Berlin Marathon in 2018."he said
I am grateful to race against the record holder and Olympic champion, I really get inspired a lot.
“I follow his footsteps when it comes to competitions. Kipchoge is now unbeatable,” he said.
Mercy Cherono gears up to make a strong return
After battling injuries for two years, 2013 world 5000m silver medallist Mercy Cherono is gearing up for Tokyo Olympic Games national trials at Kasarani Stadium on June 17-19.
The 29-year-old, who finished fourth at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in the 5000m event behind her compatriots – gold medalist Vivian Cheruiyot and Hellen Obiri, and Ethiopian Almaz Ayana – will battle for the prized ticket to the Olympic Games that run in Tokyo, Japan, from July 23 to August 8.
“After the Rio Olympics, I had a frightening foot fracture that made me miss out on the 2017 and 2018 seasons. I had to lay back from competitions and I decided to start a family and in the process, I had a baby girl,” Cherono said. “Immediately after the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak last year, I retreated back and continue training.
She added: “We are now training well and our focus is on the national trials. Training at home in Kericho and Kapsabet is good for me. I opted to train in Kapsabet so that I can stay closer to my coach and have better training sessions."
You know training closer to the coach makes things easier.
He monitors all areas of weakness and sees if I can improve.
But her beautiful looks and the latest hairdo will no doubt make a statement about her off-the-track lifestyle, just as she did when she won 5000m gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland – without much fuss.
Cherono is no longer that rural girl from the far-flung Kipajit village in Bomet County but a fashion model.
She is gorgeous in her running kit and absolutely stunning in an evening gown!
When she threw down the gauntlet to the Commonwealth nations’ participants, one point came out clearly inside Hampden Park in Glasgow: the world’s male sporting enthusiasts cooed with envy as the beauty queen headed to the start line.
Cherono is the World Youth and World Junior champion as well as the world senior silver medalist in 5000m
Cherono, whose beauty and style are drooled over the global athletics scene, did not disappoint her fans when she blew away her rivals.
She is the World Youth and World Junior champion as well as the world senior silver medalist in 5000m and her hairdo with colours of the Kenyan flag always causes a stir and admiration among the menfolk across the globe.
She is no doubt a perfect definition of a billboard girl as her hair brings out her personality.
I had good performance as a junior, winning world cross country junior championships twice.
"It really helped transition to senior level. I had a nice build up given that athletics is a process. You can’t just change instantly. You have to navigate slowly."she added
I have been out of competitions for almost two years due to injury.
During this period, I have learned to become duond buraent and how to multi task motherhood and athletics.
I hope to make the Olympic team for the second time.
"But the biggest hurdle is the national trials. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, we managed top two positions. I hope we can make 1-2-3 this time."said Cherono
“I am planning to step up to road races and even marathon in future. And that will depend on what my coach will advise and the body response,” said Cherono.
The long wait is almost over.
Eldoret, the spiritual home of world athletics, will soon get back to life – though under strict Covid-19 restrictions.
No fans, top notch competition and world class pay out welcome you to Eldoret City Marathon on Sunday.
Mark your calendar.
Expectation and excitement will no doubt remain visible since it is the first 42km race to be held in Kenya since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic last year.
Athletics analysts say the third edition of Eldoret City Marathon will serve as a manual to guide the planning and execution of marathons amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Sh3.5 million winner’s prize – the highest pay out in Africa at the moment – will certainly send the athletics world into ecstasy.
It has Abott World Marathon Major (WMM) series recognition and became the only race in Kenya to attain such status even as it eyes a World Athletics label.
Yesterday, focus shifted to the finish line as preparations for the marathon entered homestretch.
Local organising committee (LOC) chairman Andrew Chelogoi issued strict guidelines aimed at minimising large crowds at the finish line while staging a good race.
Chelogoi said a maximum of 100 people will be allowed at the finish line between Ziona Mall and TAC Centre grounds.
Among the 100 people to get access to the finish line, he said, are a restricted number of VIPs, individuals representing sponsors and journalists.
“We want to set the mark on enforcement of Covid-19 protocols in competitions and that is why we are restricting the number of people at the finish line to only 100,” Chelogoi said.
“We will be having a team of doctors and nurses deployed by our sponsors and the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) to respond to emergencies,” he added.
The LOC said only ten cars ferrying VIP guests among them Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed and several governors led by Jackson Mandago will be allowed to the podium near the finish line at specified times.
Chelogoi said the VIP podium where 200 guests traditionally sit, will only take 60 people to uphold social distancing.
“We are asking fans to watch the race on KTN News because we will not allow crowds at the finish line,” he added.
Moses Tanui, the race director and two-time Boston Marathon winner, said only persons with special passes will be allowed to the finish line.
“All areas near the Zion Mall will be a no go zone. It’s only a few people with special identification badges,” Tanui said.
“We will have a team of first aiders and health workers on one section and a space has been reserved for the timer to pass.”
Kenya's Elias Ng’eno thrills crowd with good show in trials
Elias Ng’eno, an athlete based at Global Sports Communication camp in Kaptagat, thrilled the small crowd in Nyayo Stadium yesterday as he produced a good show at the Athletics Kenya pre-Olympic trials.

“I feel happy after making the qualifying time for the Olympic Games (1:44.80). It has not been easy but I want to thank my coaches at Global Sports Communication. I will get back to training and hopefully make the Olympic team,” said Ng’eno.
Vincent Keter (3:38.66) won men’s 1500m race ahead of Kamati Etieng (3:39.61) and 2011 world 1500m silver medalist Silas Kiplagat (3:40.00).
Elias Ng’eno celebrates winning the 800M final during the Athletics Kenya Pre-Trials for Olympics at Nyayo National stadium in Nairobi on May 29, 2021
“First time to win in the senior category. My hope to represent the country at the Olympics and the World Under 20. I have been training alongside Timothy Cheruiyot (world 1500m champion) and he has been an inspiration. All I need to do is improve on my endurance,” Vincent Keter, who has an Olympic qualification time of 3:34.59.
AS expected, Michael Kibet won men’s 5000m in 13:21.39 ahead of Emmanuel Kiprop (13:22.81) and Victor Kiprop (13:26.27)
“I am happy for the win. My focus is to train for the Olympic trials. It is a good improvement from what I ran on Thursday when I clocked 13:34 but today I managed 13:21.
Weightlifting: Maurice Aromo wins silver to bring Kenya's medal tally to 14
Kenya team captain Maurice Aromo lived up to expectations by winning silver in the men 89kg category at the ongoing Africa Weightlifting Championship cum Tokyo Olympic Qualifier at Ruaraka Sports Club in Nairobi.
He scored 102 points in the Snatch and 132 points in the Clean and Jerk for total 234 points.
Aromo finished second behind 22-year old Algerian gold medallist Touairis Faris who set a new African record in the Snatch.
Faris had a whooping 165kg lift to surpass the previous 164kg mark that has been a hard nut to crack.
In Clean and Jerk, the Algerian recorded 170kg to take his total tally to 335 points that earned him the gold.
"I feel happy to have won the medal, it's my second African prize in the category," Aromo told The Standard Sports.
"I was playing safe because I didn't want any injuries," he said.
Aromo, who is a mechanic by profession, stepped up training for three months ahead of the competition, he is glad that the effort has paid off.
Despite his feat, Aromo, just like any other medalists in the championship, will have to wait until next month to know their Tokyo Olympic fate as there are other similar contests ongoing in Europe and the Americas after which the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) will harmonise the results.
"I'm optimistic that after the final entry by the IWF I shall be in the Tokyo bound squad," Aromo said.
Aromo's feat now brings Kenya's medal tally to 14 in total including eight bronze and six silvers.
Caroline Wangeci (women 55kg), Winny Langat (women 59kg), Rachael Achieng (women 64kg) and Janet Oduor (women 45kg) are other Kenyan players who have not missed the medal rush.
Aromo says he will rest for two days before embarking on training at the Kitengela Gym as he waits for the Olympics.
His weekly schedule will include Snatch and strength work on Monday, Clean and Jerk and strength on Tuesday.
Wednesday is for power workout while Thursday is his rest day.
He returns to the gym on Friday for some strength and conditioning training while Saturday is for mobility and flexibility workouts.
Aromo won his first silver at the 2018 Africa Championship in Mauritius.
He failed to qualify for the Rio Olympics in Brazil in 2016.
"I was dedicated to learning the sport more.
"It was sheer hard work and consistency in training for seven years that helped me to win the medal in Mauritius," he said.
The medal inspired the father of two who now has great confidence in the discipline.
Aromo strongly believes he will be a continental champion some day.
The 32-year old focused lifter finished fifth overall at the Africa Games in Morocco in 2019.
In the next five years, Aromo dreams to be a continental champion.
Since he started to captain the national team in 2019 in Morocco, Aromo has learnt key lessons in life among them leadership skills.
"I feel great and honoured to be the skipper of Kenya team. I'm constantly reminded to be a responsible citizen."
"I did not play the game as an amateur, i joined the sport as a senior at 21years when I bumped on some weightlifters in the gym at Kitengela." Kenya Team Captain Maurice Aromo.
Weightlifting: Kenyans Langat and Oduor strike silver as Achieng bags bronze
Triple Africa silver medallist Winny Langat (women 59kg) and new entrant Janet Oduor (45kg) bagged silver medals at the Africa Weightlifting Championships cum Olympic qualifiers in Nairobi last evening.
Teenager Rachael Achieng won bronze in women’s 64kg. Lang’at scored 61 in Snatch and 81 in Clean and Jerk for 142 points.
Odour scored 42 points in Snatch and 50 in Clean and Jerk for 92 points. Achieng, who is also the Youth and Junior Africa bronze medalist, had 60 and 70 in the categories for 130.
Kenya’s Anthony Libasia scored 117 points in Snatch and 137 in Clean and Jerk to finish fourth with 254 points in men 73kg.
The category was won by Ben Hnia of Tunisia who amassed 330 points.
At the same time, Africa Zone Two champion Wilkister Nadzuwah Nyiro will be in action this afternoon in the women 76kg.
She longs to improve her Clean and Jerk personal best that currently stands at 82kg.
Her personal best in Snatch is 70kg. “I am ready for the competition, it’s now or never. I want another gold,” she said. Nyiro has been training at Alpha Fit Gym in Nairobi and in Kitengela since returning from the 2019 African Games in Morocco where she finished seventh overall.
She believes she stands a great chance in the ongoing qualifier owing to the fact that she has been conducting her exercises under supervision of five weightlifting coaches and three others for strength and body conditioning.
“I feel my technique is good. I am now waiting to replicate the same on the podium on Saturday.”
Nyiro was introduced to the sport by coach David Adeyomo who guided Kenyan Olympian James Omondi Adede to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.
“Apart from embracing the sport, I have also taken the initiative to mentor young players from Thika,” Nyiro said.
Meanwhile Olympic coronavirus guidelines are being drawn up for each separate sports competition, a Tokyo 2020 senior official said yesterday.
Organisers have released Covid-19 prevention measures.
Triple Africa silver medallist Winny Langat (women 59kg) and new entrant Janet Oduor (45kg) bagged silver medals
No pressure for AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems ahead of Mathare United fixture
AFC Leopards coach Patrick Aussems has urged his charges to remain focused as he aims to help the club end its 22-year Premier League title drought.
According to the Belgian, he will not let anything block his vision, not even a temporary place at the top of the league standings for a day or two.
Ingwe have a realistic chance of moving joint-top of the FKF Premier League table with KCB (36 points) today if they beat struggling Mathare United at Ruaraka Grounds.
But Aussems has strongly cautioned against premature celebrations that might come with their temporary ascendency to the summit.
A victory with a big margin (4 goals plus) at Ruaraka will see Ingwe lead the table for the first time in many months.
However, the former Simba SC coach wants Ingwe players and fans to stick their eyes on the big prize which is to win the elusive title at the end of the season.
“If we win on Thursday, then we will be at the top, but (being at the) top is not important right now,” Aussems said after his side was held to a barren draw by Posta Rangers last weekend.
And even as Aussems lamented poor officiating and the state of the pitch for their stalemate against the mailmen, he knows this is equally an important game for Mathare United, who are coming off a 2-2 draw with Nzoia Sugar.
But he believes their one game in hand gives them a chance to continue piling pressure on the leading pack as the race for the CAF Champions League qualification hots up.
Leopards are currently third on the log with 33 points, two behind second-placed Tusker.
On the other hand, Mathare, who recently acquired the services of former Harambee Stars assistant coach Frank Ouna, are rooted at the bottom of the table with a paltry eight points.
“Pressure is for the bears and wolves, so that’s not a problem. We still have one game remaining and if we win, we will be at the top. I know at the end of June there will be something special but after that, the league will finish in August,” said Aussems.
“You need to know that we played 10 against 15 today (Saturday). Eleven players from Posta, the pitch and the three referees. I don’t like talking about the referees, but everything was against us. We need to have a good recovery because on Thursday we will be back in action, but I hope not on this pitch again.”
Just like AFC, Gor Mahia will be seeking to narrow the gap on the league leaders KCB when they battle with Vihiga United in Mumias.
A win for the record champions will see them take their points tally to 28. and leapfrog Bandari into the fifth spot.
Coming from a community predominantly known for its athletics prowess, Fifa assistant referee Gilbert Cheruiyot wants to conquer greater heights in football.
Cheruiyot, who is a Fifa accredited referee, has worked his way up to become one of the most respected match officials in the continent.
Born and raised in Lembus Kiptoim, in Baringo County, Cheruiyot had a dream of playing professional football during his childhood but lack of support seemed to have dimmed his desire.
He chose football instead of athletics, going against the norm in his community, something that did not go down well with his parents who insisted he should focus on his education or try athletics.
“Coming from a community that likes athletics more than any other sport was one of the main challenges. My community considers playing football a waste of time. And I could receive a beating from my parents whenever they saw me play with my peers,” said Cheruiyot.
But despite being reprimanded by his parent, Cheruiyot never gave up on football.
After his secondary school education, in 2006, he decided to go for a refereeing course.
Since making up his mind of being a referee in 2008, Cheruiyot has never looked backed, rising from officiating local village football tournaments, Division Leagues, FKF Nationwide league to being a common face in the Football Kenya Federation Premier League matches.
“Since 2008, I have developed from the lowest ranks through to the Kenyan Premier league and Confederation of African Football (Caf) matches,” said Cheruiyot.
Seven years later, the 37-year-old official bust into continental limelight as he oversaw several matches in different parts of Africa and there’s no slowing down for the lanky official.
And as Kenyans eagerly await the Tokyo Olympics showdown scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8 this year in Tokyo, Japan, to witness their athlete’s battle for medals, their eyes will also be trained on the football fields as Cheruiyot makes those vital calls along the touchline.
According to Cheruiyot, one of the challenges referees face mostly is language barrier.
Cheruiyot and Mary Njoroge are part of the 99 officials selected by Fifa from 51 countries to officiate at the Olympic Games.
They will be in charge during the men and women’s football matches at the world games.
Fifa appointed 25 centre referees, 50 assistant referees, 20 VAR officials and four support referees.
Cheruiyot, who officiated at the Caf Confederation Cup between Orlando Pirates of South Africa and Raja Casablanca of Morrocco in south Africa on Sunday, said he feels honoured to be among the match officials selected for the Summer Games.
“I don’t take this for granted; it is a big honour for me and the country. Out of the many referees, I am among the selected few,” he said.
Cheruiyot, who was named the most improved assistant referee by Kenya Premier League in 2018, credits his refereeing journey to hard work and resilience.
“The climax in refereeing is being at the World Cup; it is every referee’s dream to officiate at that top level. Olympics is second after World Cup,” he said.
Cheruiyot began his continental journey in 2015 when he officiated at the Caf Under-17 tournament in Niger before heading to Rwanda the following year for the 2016 Africa Nations Championships (CHAN).
In 2017, he was among the match officials who officiated the CAF Under-20 tournament in Zambia.
Cheruiyot said one of the challenges referees face mostly is language barrier.
“When officiating especially international matches you normally meet with players and officials speaking different languages, you speaking English, players speaking Arabic others speak French, but we normally say refereeing is a universal language, when you blow the whistle or raise the flag the players should just follow instructions”, he said.
Gor Mahia players protest after losing the CAF Confederations Cup match against Napsa Stars of Zambia in Lusaka on February 21, 2021.
Gor Mahia duo Kenneth Muguna and Boniface Oluoch have been slapped with Sh3.2 million fine by the Confederation of African Football (CAF).
The two stars were on Monday found guilty of violent conduct on a match official during a CAF Confederation Cup match on February 21, 2021, against Zambian side NAPSA Stars.
Gor Mahia players roughed up South African referee Lebalang Mokete who awarded Zambian side NAPSA Stars a penalty in the dying minutes of the game
NAPSA scored and knocked out K'Ogalo on a 3-2 aggregate scoreline.
After the final whistle, a section of Gor Mahia players confronted the referee, leading to a short but ugly scene.
In a ruling by the CAF Disciplinary Committee, Oluoch and Muguna have each been handed Sh1.6 fine in addition to four-match bans.
K'Ogalo have also been ordered to foot the cost of repairs at the Heroes Stadium in Lusaka.
"Gor Mahia are instructed to immediately check the cost of the damages incurred by NAPSA Stars and reimburse the cost of damages caused by the players," reads the ruling by the CAF's Disciplinary Board.
This is not the first time K’Ogalo have found themselves on the wrong side of the CACF rules.
In 2019, the record Kenyan champions were fined Sh750,000 failing to control their players in a CAF Confederation Cup home game against Motema Pembe of DRC Congo.
In 2019, CAF once again slapped K'Ogalo with a Sh1.5million fine for crowd trouble after a section of fans were caught on camera throwing objects in the field during a CAF Confederation Cup against Algerian side, NA Hussein Dey.
KCB capitalised on Tusker and AFC Leopards slip up to go on top of the FKF Premier League table after thrashing Bandari 3-0 at Utalii Grounds yesterday.
Having watched Tusker and AFC Leopards drop two points each following their draws with Wazito (1-1) and Posta Rangers (0-0) respectively, the bankers needed a win to dislodge the brewers from the summit.
And they did that in style with David Simiyu, Harun Thomas and substitute Derrick Otanga’s goals helping the bankers avenge last season’s double loss against the dockers and consequently return to the top of the table.
The emphatic victory saw Zedekiah ‘Zico’ Otieno’s boys take their points tally to 36, one ahead of Tusker and three more than third placed AFC as the race for CAF Champions League qualification hots up.
Though Otieno was pleased with his side’s performance, he played down their chances of securing their maiden Champions League ticket this season.
“Even though we are focused on our next game against Sofapaka, it is our hope and prayer that we maintain the position until June 30. We are just taking one game at a time,” said Otieno.
“I’m satisfied with the result and proud of my players’ performance today. We stepped up against Bandari after a slow start in the Mathare United game. Winning 3-0 against a team of Bandari calibre at this point of league means we are a good team. The players know what’s at stake and I feel that’s a sweet revenge after Bandari took six points from us last season.”
It took only 15 minutes for David Simiyu to break the deadlock when he capitalised on the dockers’ defensive error to easily tap home Reagan Otieno’s delivery from the left flank before Henry Onyango missed a golden chance in the 21st minute.
But five minutes later, Thomas Harun beat goalkeeper Justin Ndikumana from close range after the visitors’ defence failed to clear David Owino’s free kick.
Simiyu nearly bagged his second goal of the day when he pounced on a loose ball in the area only for the former Vihiga United man to feebly shoot straight at Bandari goalkeeper.
Sensing danger, Bandari coach Cassa Mbungo made a tactical change bringing on striker Umar Kasumba for centre half Brian Otieno on the half hour mark.
Kasumba nearly made an instant impact after he earned a free-kick for the dockers but William Wadri’s attempt was easily gathered by KCB goalkeeper Joseph Ochuka.
One of KCB defenders almost conceded an own goal while trying to clear Willian Wadri’s cut-back in the 40th minute before Kasumba missed a sitter following a goal mouth melee from Hassan Abdallah’s corner kick.
The bankers continued from where they left off in the first half with Curtis Wekesa almost extending the lead in the 58th minute after a brilliant run on the right flank.
Bandari responded after ten minutes, but Kasumba’s shot at the edge of the box was deflected for a fruitless corner before Wekesa missed another open scoring chance on the opposite end.
Derrick Otanga then came off the bench to put the game beyond the dockers reach when he perfectly connected Michael Oduor’s cross from the right flank in the 82nd minute.
Elsewhere, Frank Ouna picked up his first point as Mathare United coach after the Slum Boys held Nzoia Sugar to a 2-2 draw in Bungoma.

Ten-man Gor Mahia put aside their financial worries to thrash Congo Boys 3-0 and advance to the next round of the FKF Betway Cup.
Tito Okello, John Macharia and Clifton Miheso scored a goal each for the winners.
Okello scored in the 37th minute after he connected with a high ball pass from former Bandari defender and Ugandan import Fred Nkata to beat advancing Congo Boys custodian Edwin George.
However, the Premier League champions were reduced to 10 men after defender Sydney Wahongo was shown a straight red card for a dangerous play on Hussein Abdul in the 43rd minute.
Macharia pounced on a rebound to add the second goal in the 50th minute for the Gor side coached by Vaz Pinto. Gor surged ahead with the third goal in the 66th minute by Miheso.
The winner of the tournament qualifies for the Caf Confederation Cup.
Gor Mahia could have missed the match due to financial constraints after they were stranded in Wundanyi, Taita Taveta County, where they had beaten Sofapaka 2-1 in an FKF Premier League match.
However, Lady Luck smiled on them after a Mombasa businessman Suleiman Shahbal came to the rescue of the record Kenyan champions.
The businessman bailed out K’Ogalo by paying for their travel to Mombasa for the rescheduled FKF Betway Cup Round 64 match.
Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier and Team Manager Jolawi Obondo thanked Shabhal for catering for the team’s transport, accommodation.
“Gor Mahia’s management called me seeking help on accommodation, and because I was aware of their match against Congo Boys, that was to give our coast boys the much-needed exposure, I thought it was only fair to help Gor Mahia honour this match as one way of supporting sports in this country,” Shahbal said.
Ulinzi Stars on Saturday ended Kariobangi Shark’s five match unbeaten run after defeating them 2-0 in a tight Football Kenya Federation Premier League match played in Narok.
Keeper James Saruni put up a man of the match performance as Ulinzi ended their four match winless run, a result that saw them move above the mid-table to eighth for the moment.
Masita Masuta and Clinton "Aguero" Omondi each netted in the opening half to inspire the soldiers to their fourth win of the campaign.
The victory gets Ulinzi to 21 points from 17 matches played, 14 points behind leaders Tusker.
The match started on a high note with both teams attempting for early goals but by the time the referee stopped the match in the 22nd minute for the first water break, no goal had been scored.
However, that would change at the half hour mark after Masuta netted past a helpless Brian Bwire in goal for Sharks.
Ten minutes later, Ulinzi would take a healthy two goal cushion to the breather after Omondi scored in the 39th minute to give Ulinzi a 2-0 lead.
In the final half, Sharks attempted to come back into the match but their numerous attempts were kept at bay by the excellent Saruni in goal for Ulinzi.
Shark’s disappointing day was summed up in the 89th minute when substitute Robert Onyango’s goal was ruled out with Ulinzi holding on to win 2-0.
Ulinzi will now prepare to face Western Stima next in Kisumu.
Lucy Mukhwana goals inspire Ulinzi Starlets in seven goal-thriller
Mukhwana’s hat trick in the opening 16 minutes of match was enough to unsettle the Slum Queens who have now conceded 15 goals in the two legs after previously losing 9-1 in the first leg.
Mukhwana opened the scores with her first strike on goal in the 6th minute giving Ulinzi Starlets an early lead.
Seven minutes later, Mukhwana grabbed her brace after she outplayed Mathare United Women’s defense to bag the second goal for Ulinzi Starlets.
Mukhwana summed up her hat-trick in the 16th minute when she converted a free kick with a header that landed the ball to the back of the net.
Mukhwana went for a haul through her goal in the 22nd minute giving Ulinzi Starlets their fourth goal.
Siliya Rasoha first shot on target for Ulinzi Starlets in the 36th minute saw Ulinzi closing the first half with a comfortable 5-0 score line.
After the breather, Emily Egesa netted the sixth goal for Ulinzi Starlets with Emma Wainaina’s goal for Mathare United Women in the 87th minute summing up as a consolation goal with the full time whistle sealing the scores at 6-1.
Kisumu All Stars are confident of closing the gap on log leaders FC Talanta when they face Kibera Black Stars on Saturday (today) at Ligi Ndogo Grounds in Nairobi.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, All Stars captain Bobby Kwaka said their journey of returning back to the topflight league starts against Kibera.
“Nothing beats playing in the premier league. As a team, our objective is to achieve that goal and we start the ascending with a win against Kibera,” he said.
Despite not playing competitively since March 26 when sports was suspended again, Kwaka said they are more than ready for the league than before after working out some of their earlier problems.
“I think it has been to our advantage to some sort because we learnt new things during the break. The coach also never had enough time for pre-season so we utilised the two months,” Kwaka added.
Kisumu All Stars are seventh with 25 points, a point behind Kibera who are joint fifth with Fortune Sacco with 26 points.
Elsewhere, Migori Youth captain Clifford Otieno said they are seeking their second consecutive away win when they play Coast Stima today in Mombasa.
Stima are coming off a disappointing 2-0 defeat to relegation threatened Muranga Seals as Migori earned an impressive 2-0 victory over hosts Mwatate United during the rescheduled matches played in midweek.
“We are very confident and beefed up after a massive win in midweek and we expect to play even more against Stima. It won’t be easy but we have the momentum already,” said Otieno.
Three more matches are on the cards on Saturday as round 18 is expected to kick off with 10 teams playing for the first time since March.
Bottom placed Mt. Kenya United FC will host third placed Vihiga Bullets FC at Camp Toyoyo.
Soy United host Gusii FC at Bukhungu Stadium as Silibwet entertain Modern Coast Rangers in Bomet Stadium.
FKF Premier League: Robert Matano left fuming after Tusker drop points against Wazito
This was the second consecutive stalemate for the brewers after they were held to a barren draw by second placed KCB on the first weekend of the resumption of the league.
The result took Tusker’s points tally to 35, two ahead of the bankers, who tackle fifth-placed Bandari in Utalii on Saturday.
Sammy Meja gave Tusker an early lead in the fourth minute through a deflected free kick before Kevin Kimani capitalised on goalkeeper Emery Mvuyekure’s howler to score a 19th minute equaliser.
While Matano was left fuming with the result, his Wazito counterpart Francis Kimanzi heaped praised on his players.
“It’s like we lost the game. Those are two dropped points because we conceded a very easy goal. There was some fighting spirit, but I feel registering two draws in a row is not good for us,” said a visibly disappointed Matano.
“I also think the referee made unnecessary calls and water break in the second half affecting the momentum and the rhythm of the game. All the same, we are looking forward to improve in our next match.”
Tusker's Sammy Miseh (left) and Musa Masika of Wazito FC during an FKF Premier League match at Utalii Sports Club on Friday, May 21, 2021.
On the other hand, Kimanzi said: “I’m really proud of my players’ effort. Coming from a goal down to get a point from the league leaders means that we are learning very quickly. We could have won the game if we had maintained the same intensity we had in the first half.”
But Wazito were forced to make an early substitution in the seventh minute when central defender Benard Ochieng replaced the injured Maurice Ojwang.
Kimani then pounced on a rebound after the Rwandan goalkeeper failed to deal with Amos Asembeka’s feeble long range shot.
Wazito almost went ahead in the 34th minute, but Rogers Aloro reacted fast to intercept a cross for a fruitless corner.
Tusker responded immediately, but Christopher Ochieng’s glancing header from Luke Namanda’s delivery went over the bar before Boniface Muchiri forced a fine save from Wazito goalkeeper Levis Opiyo.
The brewers came close to regaining the lead on the stroke of halftime only for defender Kevin Monyi to scuff his effort in the area.
Namanda then saw his powerful shot kept out by Opiyo as both sides continued searching for the winning goal in vain.
Saturday’s matches will see Kakamega Homeboyz clash with Western Stima at Bukhungu Stadium as Ulinzi Stars and Kariobangi Sharks battle in Narok.
The result took Tusker’s points tally to 35, two ahead of KCB, who tackle fifth-placed Bandari in Utalii on Saturday.
Nzoia Sugar coach Shikanda coach calls for response after Ingwe defeat
Nzoia Sugar coach Ibrahim Shikanda has called on his side to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat to AFC Leopards when they host Mathare United in Sunday’s FKF Premier League match at Sudi Stadium.
The millers were made to pay for their wastefulness after Caleb Olilo scored a screamer to inflict a sixth defeat of the season on the 14th placed Nzoia.
“Profligacy in front of goal cost us the game. I was disappointed with my players’ response in the game, they didn’t play as per instructions,” said Shikanda. “I feel the break also affected our performance.
FKF Premier League leaders Tusker feeling the pressure - Muchiri
Tusker midfielder Boniface Muchiri has admitted that they are feeling the pressure of being at the top of the FKF Premier League.
The brewers, who were held to a barren draw by title rivals KCB last weekend, take on Wazito in today’s fixture at Utalii Grounds.
“We didn’t get the desired results against KCB, but I feel we can do that in the coming few games,” said Muchiri.
“There is always the pressure of being at the top but it is making us work extra hard because if we drop more points our opponents will catch up with us.
The more we get the maximum points, the more relaxed we become.”

Gor Mahia revived their chances of playing in the CAF Champions League next season thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Sofapaka in today's FKF Premier League match in Taita Taveta.
The match seemed to be heading for a 1-1 draw only for Alpha Onyango to score a last gasp goal from Tito Okello’s cross.
The third consecutive victory temporarily took the pressure off the shoulders of Portuguese tactician Manuel Vaz Pinto as the sixth-placed K’Ogalo took their points tally 25, two behind fifth-placed Bandari.
Batoto Ba Mungu remain ninth on the log with 19 points.
But despite the positive result at Wundanyi Stadium, Carlos Manuel Vaz Pinto knows he has his work cut out as Gor Mahia must at least win all their June fixtures and pray their opponents drop the points for them to earn the Champions League ticket.
On Monday, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) issued a directive saying that the team that will be on top of the standings by June 30 shall be declared the Kenyan representative at next season’s Champions League.
But it was Sofapaka who started the game on a high note when Timothy Otieno almost punished his former club only for his tenth-minute effort to be easily gathered by goalkeeper Gad Mathews.
South Sudan striker Tito Okello then broke the deadlock with a cool header past a hapless Togolese goalkeeper Abuol Moubarak Togolese in the 28th minute..
Fullback Titus Achesa drew level in the 56th minute before Okello combined well with youthful Alpha Onyango for the winner in the 82nd minute.

Migori Youth captain Clifford Otieno is upbeat the club can finish among the top four clubs in the National Super League after resuming the second-tier league with a victory in one of the three rescheduled matches played on Wednesday.
The South Nyanza based club defeated Mwatate United 2-0 to move out of the relegation zone up to 12th in the standings with 21 points from 17 matches played.
Former Gor Mahia striker Dickson “Agwambo” Raila debuted with a goal in addition to Michael Bosco strike that sealed all three points for Migori.
“We are very happy to come back home with all maximum points especially after another stressful two months out without football,” said Otieno during an interview with The Standard Sports.
“This win will come in handy ahead of our next matches which we have to win in order to be able to achieve our goal of finishing in the top four,” Otieno added.
Meanwhile, Vihiga Bullets closed the gap on joint leaders Kenya Police and FC Talanta to two points after narrowly edging out Fortune Sacco 1-0 in Kianyaga Stadium.
The victory saw Vihiga move to third in the standings with 30 points, two behind Kenya Police and FC Talanta who are tied on 32 points.
In Mombasa, Wilson Kamau scored a brace to inspire Muranga Seals to an important 2-0 victory over Coast Stima at Mbaraki Grounds.
The win lifted Seals out of the relegation zone to 14th with 19 points.
After round 17 of super league matches played, former Premier League side Mount Kenya United remain bottom of the table with 13 points followed by Soy United and Gusii FC AS Talanta, Kenya Police and Vihiga Bullets lead race for promotion.
Five more matches are on the cards on Saturday as round 18 is expected to kick off with 10 teams playing for the first time since March.
Accountant, matatu driver win in BangBet draws
Evanson Kiprotich, winner of BangBet Casino Lucky Draws receives cheque from BangBet Marketing Manager Kelvin Maundu on Friday May 21, 2021.
Evanson Kiprotich and his family are set to be cushioned from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic after he clinched Sh500,000 courtesy of BangBet’s monthly Casino Lucky Draw.
The Muthiga resident, an accountant by profession, is one of those who suffered reduced earnings after his employer imposed a pay cut following the disruption the pandemic caused on businesses, but last Thursday, that pain was alleviated, thanks to BangBet.
The Baringo native staked just Sh500 on his favourite Lucky football game and walked away with 1,000 times the amount following the monthly draw.
Kiprotich has, however, had to endure numerous losses for the last year, having signed up to the BangBet Lucky Casino in May 2020, but he credits patience for the victory.
“I always knew that there is a season for winning and a season for defeat. That is why I did not give up,” said Kiprotich, who was accompanied by his wife, when he picked his cheque from BangBet Marketing Manager Kelvin Maundu on Friday.
His wife, who lost her job due to the pandemic, will now see her frustration turned into joy after Kiprotich revealed that he will use the money to start a business for her.
Meanwhile, William Nyaga, a matatu driver, who lives in Githurai 45 walked away with Sh100,000 from last week’s Weekly Casino Draw.
“I will use the money to buy a bull and take it to my home county of Murang’a,” said the father of three, who staked Sh100 on his favourite game, Lucky Poker.
Sofapaka are upbeat about toppling Gor Mahia when they entertain the defending champions in a Football Kenya Federation Premier League match on Wednesday at Wundanyi Stadium in Taita Taveta.
Sofapaka sit ninth on the standings on 19 points from 15 matches knowing that victory will see them move level on points with sixth-placed K’Ogalo, a fete Sofapaka head coach Ken Odhiambo is keen to achieve.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Odhiambo said he trusts his players to maintain their winning form when they face Gor Mahia.
Riding high on the back of a commanding 2-0 victory over Wazito 2-0, Odhiambo believes players will be motivated when they face the champions.
“The match against Gor will be very tricky considering the talent they have in the team. Despite that, we are ready for them. My boys are psyched up and raring to go and we can’t wait to hit the field,” Odhiambo said.
Regarding Caf Champions League, Odhiambo said their focus is on their match against Gor Mahia and their matches to follow.
“Today we focus on Gor. Tomorrow we look at who is next in line. Our main objective as a tea is to win games, each at a time and then we will see how it goes when June 30 reaches,” Odhiambo added.
Gor are sixth in the standings with 22 points, 12 points behind leaders Tusker, a gap Gor assistant coach Sammy Omollo believes they can close.
“I believe everything is achievable in football and to be top of the standings by the end of June is very much possible for us. Gor is a team with wealth in quality players and we are banking on them to lift the team up in the coming run of matches,” said the former KCB coach.
“Sofapaka is a good team and we will have to be cautious too. I believe we had a good win against City Stars that will give players a boost today and we expect nothing but all three points,” Omollo added.
Record Kenyan Premier League champions Gor Mahia are confident of closing the gap on top-four teams when they face Sofapaka today’s FKF Premier League match in Wundanyi.
Speaking to Standard Sports, Gor Mahia assistant coach Sammy Omollo said they must beat Sofapaka to keep their chances of topping the table by June 30 and play in the Caf Champions League.
Earlier this week, FKF said the team that will be on top of the Premier League standings by June 30, will represent Kenya in the 2021-22 CAF Champions League.
“I believe everything is achievable in football and to be top of the standings by the end of June is possible. Gor is a team that has a lot of talented players and we are banking on them to lift the team up in the coming matches,” said Omollo.
Sofapaka is a good team and we will have to be cautious too.
I believe we had a good win against City Stars, which is a boost ahead of our match.
Player rotation will be key during this busy schedule for most teams.
Meanwhile, former Harambee Stars assistant coach Frank Ouna started his reign at Mathare United on a losing note after the Slum Boys fell 2-1 to KCB at Ruaraka Grounds yesterday.
The victory saw the bankers take their points tally to 33 and leapfrog AFC Leopards into the second as Mathare remain rooted at the bottom with seven points.
Daniel Otieno gave Mathare an early lead in the first minute only for Vincent Wasambo to cancel it on the stroke of halftime.
Derrick Otanga then scored the winner midway through the second half to help the bankers narrow the gap on league leaders Tusker one point.
Migori Youth captain Clifford ‘Ouma’ Otieno is optimistic they can turn around their poor form and get back to winning ways when they face Mwatate United FC on Wednesday (today) as the National Super League resumes under strict COVID-19 protocols.
Three midweek super league fixtures are on the cards after an eight-week break in March when President Uhuru Kenyatta suspended sporting activities in the country to curb the rising cases of COVID-19.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Otieno believes they have what it takes to compete at the top level again, noting that the brief two months break will play a pivotal role in their rise once again.
“We are Migori Youth. The team is ready for the league battle once again we are going to do everything it takes to collect maximum points in Taita.”
“We have been training well during the brief break where we tried to work out some of the few problems we faced during the opening 16 matches we played and I believe we are in a better positon than before,” Otieno said.
After 16 matches in the second tier league, Migori are 17th with 18 points.
Migori beefed up their squad with the acquisition of former Gor Mahia striker Dickson “Agwambo” Raila who is expected to make his debut today.
Mwatate are eighth with 25 points and a win will see them move to within four points of leaders FC Talanta.
In Mombasa, 11th placed Coast Stima welcome relegation threatened Muranga Seals at Mbaraki Grounds as Vihiga Bullets seek to close the gap on leaders Talanta to two points when they travel to play Fortune Sacco who are a point behind them in the log.

Ex-Harambee Stars assistant coach Ouna left to pick up the pieces at Mathare
Former Harambee Stars assistant coach Frank Ouna was yesterday appointed Mathare United’s new head coach after Salim Ali was sacked alongside his assistant Patrick Gitagia.
The club’s management opted to make the changes in a bid to save the team from relegation.
Ali, who took over from current Wazito coach Francis Kimanzi in 2018, has endured a difficult campaign this year.
The Slum Boys are at a risk of being relegated at the end of the 2021 Football Kenya Federation Premier League season after failing to win their 14th match of the campaign as the local football league resumed over the weekend under strict Covid-19 protocols after seven weeks out.
In his last match, Mathare played out to a 0-0 draw with Vihiga United, a result that left them bottom of the premier league standings with seven points.
Mathare United CEO Jectone Obure said they had to take the drastic change for the sake of the team's future.
"We had to make some changes. The team has not been performing well this season and we made a tough decision to let Salim, our former player who has grown through the ranks, to go because of the poor results,” Obure said.
Salim will now be replaced by Ouna, whose major responsibility is to ensure the team survives the axe.
“Ouna takes over with immediate effect. He is a great coach whom we believe will help the team get out of the relegation zone and stay in the top league next season,” added the CEO.
Former Harambee Stars coach Bobby Williamson will also be part of the new-look bench as a technical advisor.
“I want to thank the leadership of Mathare United for giving me this opportunity to work at this great club," said Ouna.
“My goal is to do everything within my powers and help keep Mathare in the top league. With all the knowledge and experience I have gained in my 12-year coaching career, I believe we can get positive results."
Despite enjoying a two-game in hand advantage, the former Gor Mahia assistant coach has a huge task ahead with safety only assured if they leapfrog either Western Stima or Vihiga United, who are five points ahead of them having played two games more in the 17-team league.
To start off their push for survival, Ouna will face fourth-placed KCB who are pushing to compete for the title today before tackling in-form AFC Leopards at the weekend.
“I cannot predict what I can or cannot do ahead of KCB match. We have had only one session and therefore the challenge to my players is to show me how much they can fight. We start as underdogs, but size counts for nothing,” said Ouna.
Prior to his sacking, the former Ulinzi Stars tactician had led the team in 14 matches where he managed one win, four draws, and nine losses.
Out of the 14 matches played, the Slum Boys have only registered one win against Nzoia Sugar in a 1-0 win they bagged in February 8.
They would have had two wins but their 2-0 victory over Zoo FC in January was scrapped following Fifa’s May 4 decision to relegate Zoo FC to Division One after finding them culpable of match fixing.
This leaves Mathare with seven points from their one win and four draws after losing nine matches to Sofapaka, Gor Mahia, Ulinzi Stars, Tusker, Bidco United, Nairobi City Stars, Kakamega Homeboyz, Posta Rangers and Kariobangi Sharks.
Mathare was founded in 1994 to help youth and their families escape poverty in the Mathare slums.
They won the 1998 Presidents Cup, the same year they were promoted to the then Kenya Premier League.
They won their first and only league title during the 2008 season.
The 2008 champions’ story in the top league might just be over this year but it remains to be seen if this will be the case at the end of the campaign especially with the change of guard.
Mathare United sack head coach Salim Ali
Mathare United have parted ways with head coach Salim Ali.
Former Wazito head coach Frank Ouno is set to take over.
Mathare United is at risk of being relegated at the end of the 2021 FKF Premier League season after failing to win their 14th match of the campaign as the local football league resumed over the weekend under strict Covid-19 protocols.
The league was suspended on March 26 after President Uhuru Kenyatta banned all sporting activities in the country, owing to the increased Covid-19 infections.
Mathare played out to a 0-0 draw with Vihiga United, a result that left them bottom of the league standings with seven points.
Out of the 14 matches played, the Slum Boys have only registered one win against Nzoia Sugar back in February.
This leaves Mathare with seven points from their one win and four draws after losing matches to Sofapaka, Gor Mahia, Ulinzi Stars, Tusker, Bidco United, Nairobi City Stars, Kakamega Homeboyz, Posta Rangers and Kariobangi Sharks.
Chelsea win second Champions League title, deny Pep Guardiola's Manchester City their first
Chelsea won their second Champions League title and denied Pep Guardiola's Manchester City their first after Kai Havertz grabbed a first-half goal to secure a 1-0 win in Saturday's all-English final at the Estadio Do Dragao.
The German youngster, Chelsea's record signing, kept his composure as he raced through and evaded goalkeeper Ederson before rolling the ball into an empty net in the 42nd minute to decide a tight encounter played in front of a 16,500 crowd.
Premier League champions City were favourites ahead of the final but suffered a desperately disappointing night in their first Champions League showpiece match.
Despite winning three of the last four Premier League titles for City, Spaniard Guardiola failed to deliver the coveted European trophy he last won with Barcelona in 2011.
For Chelsea's German manager Thomas Tuchel the triumph comes after his Paris St Germain side suffered defeat in last season's final against Bayern Munich and just four months after he took over from Frank Lampard at the west London club.
"To share it with everybody is incredible. We made it. Wow. I don't know what to feel," said Tuchel. "I was so grateful to arrive a second time (in the final). I felt different.
The (players) were determined to win this. We wanted to be a stone in their (City's) shoe.
We encouraged everybody to step up and step out, to be more brave.
While Tuchel got his approach spot on, Guardiola’s team selection was surprising with Raheem Sterling brought in on the left, neither regular holding midfielder, Fernandinho or Rodri, picked and Ilkay Gundogan left to protect the back line.
It quickly became apparent the move had left City’s defence exposed with Chelsea creating early chances, three of which fell to German Timo Werner who failed to capitalise - miskicking one, shooting softly at Ederson and then finding the side-netting.
Gundogan’s already difficult task got harder when he was booked for a foul on Mason Mount in the 34th minute.
Chelsea also suffered a setback when their experienced Brazilian centre-back Thiago Silva went down awkwardly after a header and had to limp off six minutes before the break, being replaced by Andreas Christensen.
However, three minutes later Chelsea struck. Midfielder Mount split the City defence with a superb through ball and Ederson rushed out of his goal but was unable to stop Havertz from skipping past him and slotting into the unguarded net.
City’s night got worse when key midfielder Kevin De Bruyne had to go off with a concussion injury after an accidental clash with Antonio Rudiger left him on the ground, with Guardiola throwing on Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus in his place.
Christian Pulisic came on for Chelsea to become the first American to play in a Champions League final and almost the first to score when he was slipped in by Havertz but then drifted his shot just wide of the post.
City gradually began to get the upper hand but their usual composure was lacking and it was not until deep into stoppage time that they went close with a hopeful effort from Riyad Mahrez that clipped the bar.
The final whistle set off wild celebrations for the Chelsea fans who had flown in for the game, while dejected City supporters headed off for the flights back to Manchester.
"Decisions are always to try to win the game," said Guardiola, when asked to reflect on his team selection.
"I would like to say it was an exceptional season for us. Unfortunately we couldn’t win. We tried, but we couldn’t do it and will work harder from here," added the Spaniard, whose side won the League Cup to go with their Premier League crown.
The way we played the game in the second half, they had one counter attack with Pulisic.
They’re a really good team, but we competed perfectly against them.
Tuchel has faced City three times in six weeks and won every time. Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich, watching from the stands, must have had a wry smile to himself as once again his ruthless approach to managerial changes has paid off.
In the second half we deserved to score one goal but we couldn’t do it.
Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has announced the team that will be leading on the FKF Premier League standings by June 30 will represent Kenya in the 2021/22 CAF Champions League.
This is after a statement dated May 17, 2021, signed by FKF CEO, Barry Otieno required a name (representative) be submitted to CAF by Wednesday, June 30, 2021, which is the deadline for member associations to submit teams to its Interclub Competitions.
"The federation is in receipt of communication from CAF directing that FKF submits Kenya's representative for the CAF inter-club competitions, latest June 30, 2021," read part of the statement.
FKF says the decision to award the CAF Champions League spot to the team leading the league at the said date has been occasioned by the fact the league calendar (fixtures) will not have concluded.
"Consequently, and in consideration that the FKF Premier League calendar may not be concluded before the aforementioned date, due to the disruption occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, the FKF Leagues and Competitions Committee in a meeting held on May 7 2021, resolved that FKF PL representative shall be the team at the top of the table, as at June 30, 2021," read the rest of the statement.
This means perennial Kenya champions Gor Mahia risk missing out on a place in next season’s CAF Champions League.
Tusker FC lead with 37 points after 17 matches, followed closely by AFC Leopards, with 32 points having played two games less.
Kariobangi Sharks are third tied on points with fourth-placed KCB (31) having both played 16 matches, with Bandari two points behind in fifth.
K'Ogalo, the defending champions are sixth, 12 points off first place, however, having played three games less than Tusker.
The unavailability of Kasarani and Nyayo Stadiums is giving FKF Premier League bosses sleepless nights.
Initially, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) had earmarked the two largest sporting facilities in the country as venues for the league which resumed on Friday (May 14) after almost a seven-week break.
But according to Sports Kenya Director General Pius Metto, Kasarani (Main and Annex) will be inaccessible for at least four months as it is being used as a bubble camp for Team Kenya preparing for the Tokyo Olympic Games.
Apart from acting as a bubble camp for the Olympic team whose first batch departs for Japan on July 5, Kasarani is scheduled to host the IAAF World U20 Championships on August 17-22.
He further said that they are still in discussions with the Ministry of Sports on the availability of Nyayo Stadium.
“Kasarani is locked for Olympics preparations. It is a bubble camp for Team Kenya and we are not allowing any other activities in the facility. In essence, the facility is inaccessible until after the World U20 Championships in August. That means, the FKF Premier League organisers will have to look for somewhere else to host their matches,” Metto told Standard Sports.
Asked about Nyayo’s availability, the official simply said: “I don’t want to comment about Nyayo Stadium because the facility was not supposed to host local games."
But all the same we are still having a discussion with the Ministry and we will update them.
I have actually guided the federation and therefore they are seeking clearance and how to use the facility.
And that’s why I don’t want to comment further on the matter.
And with the unavailability of the two largest sporting facilities in the country, the federation has been forced to relook for other alternative venues (Narok, World Hope, Utalii and Ruaraka Grounds) for Nairobi-based teams in this congested window that is set to conclude on July 14 two weeks after the deadline of submitting the league winners’ name to CAF (Champions League).
Friday saw Kariobangi Sharks beat Kakamega Homeboyz 1-0 at Utalii in their first restart match before Ruaraka, which had been banned from hosting league matches staged a double header the following day (AFC Leopards 1-0 Nzoia Sugar and Tusker 0-0).
Gor Mahia also overcame Nairobi City Stars 1-0 at Utalii yesterday while Mathare United drew 0-0 with Vihiga United at Ruaraka.
While FKF president Nick Mwendwa says they have no option but to continue playing, he feels the poor state of the venues that has been worsened by the rains will affect the quality of the game.
“Football is under pressure after we were denied hosting the matches at Kasarani and Nyayo. We have been told none of the stadiums is available for us so we will have to make do with the venues we have,” said Mwendwa.
“The other pitches will have a great impact on our game in terms of TV production and players’ output. It will be expensive to take the matches outside Nairobi.”
Defending champions Gor Mahia resumed the Football Kenya Federation Premier League with a win after narrowly defeating 10-man Nairobi City Stars 1-0 at Utalii Grounds on Sunday.
Victory propelled K'Ogalo to sixth in the league standings with 22 points, 12 points adrift leaders Tusker while City Stars remained 11th with 17 points.
Abdul’s goal came in the 30th minute after Clifton Miheso's cross presented him with a tap in off the post with City Stars stopper Steve Njunge nowhere to be seen.
Despite City Stars striker Eric Ombija sending off in the 74th minute, Gor Mahia could not do any more damage in the remaining 16 minutes of the match with City Stars defense repelling all attacks.
In Wundanyi, 2009 champions Sofapaka defeated Wazito 2-0 to move up to the bottom half table from their previous 13th place.
Nicholas Omondi and former Gor Mahia midfielder Lawrence Juma’s goals in the final half were enough to hand Kennedy Odhiambo his fifth win of the campaign.
The win saw Batoto ba Mungu moved to ninth on the log with 19 points, while Wazito dropped to seventh with 22 points.
At Ruaraka, bottom placed Mathare United were held to a barren draw with Vihiga United.
Last year’s Kenya Cup runners up Kabras Sugar will welcome Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad at the Kakamega Showground with an eye set on extending their lead in the standings. Kabras lead the log with 15 points.
Menengai Oilers will play Strathmore Leos in Nakuru in the final match of the day with Nondies, Nakuru, Kenya Harlequin and Impala given a rest.
Meanwhile, KRU has opened a temporary loan transfer window ahead of the Kenya Cup reyurn.
The transfer window opened on May 26 and runs until June 4.
As we resume play for the suspended Kenya Cup League, the league and fixtures committee have declared a temporary transfer window period.
This period shall run from May 26, 2021, to June 4, 2021.
“The regulations affecting loan players (regulation 14.8 and others) will be in effect and clubs are asked to adhere to the same,” read a letter by Kenya Rugby Union’s acting C.E.O Thomas Odundo.
Kenyan legend Benjamin Ayimba was set to start an age grading rugby academy in Nyanza
As Kenyans are coming to terms with the sudden death of the former Kenya Sevens and rugby legend and coach Benjamin Ayimba, it has been revealed he had a great intention to build an age grading rugby academy in the Nyanza region.
While revealing his (Ayimba) plans for Nyanza region in rugby development, Kenya Lionesses head coach Felix Oloo said the fallen hero had started engaging him to commence the inauguration of the academy that could tap talents at the grassroots from the home of rugby in Western Kenya.
Oloo said Ayimba had the intention of having an academy in Western Kenya similar to the ones at Nakuru Athletic Club and Impala Club in Nairobi.
“That was his aspiration and ambition soon after he retired from the national duties and we were to partner together in the whole process of having the matter come to fruition,” Oloo told The Standard Sports while mourning the fallen legend.
“He was a real coach who faced issues head-on and had his own ways of solving matters within players that resulted in the playing unit playing for him,” Oloo who is a former Kenyan international said.
As he leads Kenya Lionesses to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Oloo said he would like to emulate the fallen legend in his footsteps that led Kenya to win the first ever global sevens title in Singapore Sevens in 2016.
“He was my mentor and with my appointment at the national level, it is my desire to follow his footsteps to ensure the women’s team bags a global title under my armpit,” he stated.
Menengai Oilers head coach Gibson Weru said Ayimba elevated the sevens rugby from obscurity to the global level.
He said he had the privilege to play alongside Ayimba at the national team at the global level before he later became his tactician years later.
Impala RFC head coach Mitch Ocholla termed the late Ayimba as a comrade whose inspirational spirits led the team to win the Singapore Sevens title.
Former rugby Sevens coach Benjamin Ayimba’s funeral will cost Sh2.7 million.
The money will help foot the Sh1.7 million pending hospital bill and Sh1 million will go towards funeral expenses.
His uncle Joseph Ayimba, and the family spokesperson, Oscar Osir, said he will be buried in two weeks.
The family has asked for well-wishers to help ease the financial burden.
Ayimba (44) was battling cerebral malaria, which kept him away from the public eye since the start of 2021.
On May 9, Ayimba’s family gave an update on his health status, urging Kenyans to keep on contributing money to offset the medical bill of the ailing rugby legend.
Ayimba was admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) Private Wing.
After leaving his brief role as Kenya 15's coach, Ayimba coached the Sevens team between 2006 and 2011, where they secured their first-ever World Series final in 2009 in Adelaide, Australia. In the same year, he led Shujaa to its maiden Rugby World Cup Sevens semi-final in Dubai.
His second stint as Kenya Sevens head coach was between 2015-16, where he coached the team to its first-ever appearance at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
In 2016, Ayimba and the team made history when they won the World Series title after Kenya beat Fiji 30-7 in the 2016 Singapore Sevens final.
Locally, he had coaching stints at Kenya Harlequins (Assistant coach), Mean Machine and Homeboyz.
Ayimba will go down in history books as the man who won the 2016 Singapore Sevens after thrashing Fiji 30-7 to bring the coveted cup home.
It is no mean feat.
But did you know that Ayimba’s rugby journey reads like that of the biblical Israelites when they left Egypt?
Maybe not, as many Kenyans — save for his recent win in Singapore — remember him as a man who was fired as the Sevens coach in 2011.
The former old boy of Olympic Primary School in Nairobi, according to one of his teachers, tried his hand (and legs) in anything sports.
After completing his studies at Olympic, Ayimba joined Maseno School in Nyanza, where he met a teacher, one Jeam Agutu, the then Deputy Principal at Maseno School.
Ayimba had a polished demeanour and was easy to read.
He had the will and mettle to succeed against odds, traits he had built since his childhood days and later teenage years.
He received the all-important shot in the arm when Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Chairman Richard Omwela reinstated him as coach to do what he loves and knows best. He did not disappoint as was evident in the Hong Kong and triumphant Singapore tours.
During his days as a player, he had a winning mentality, especially after reaching similar finals in the late 1990s.
The Kenyan rugby fraternity and the entire sporting world was in shock yesterday after Shujaa legend Benjamin Ayimba died of cerebral malaria on Friday night. He was 44.
The news of Ayimba’s death, who was a national hero after establishing himself as one of the greatest rugby coaches in the country, brought an outpouring of mourning and remembrance on social media, headlining almost all the discussions.
“Benjamin succumbed to the multiple complications he was being treated for over the past couple of months,” read a statement from family’s spokesman Oscar Osir.
The family and close friends would like to extend their deepest gratitude for the prayers and the overwhelming moral and financial support that you all have offered during Benjamin’s last days.
The former Kenya Sevens and fifteens captain’s legend grew into international reverence in 2016 when he masterminded Kenya’s Main Cup triumph at Singapore Sevens.
Shujaa pulled off a shocking 30-7 victory over Fiji to clinch their first ever World Sevens Series title on Ayimba’s second stint as the national team coach.
And from President Uhuru Kenyatta to opposition leader Raila Odinga, Kenya Rugby Union chairman Oduor Gangla, Shujaa coach Innocent ‘Namcos’ Simiyu, captain Andrew Amonde and his former teacher cum rugby coach at Maseno School Milton Nyangaga, all described Ayimba as a true servant of the game.
While paying tribute to his predecessor and former coach, who introduced him to international level, Simiyu urged the government to give Ayimba a state funeral.
“I’m saddened by the loss of Benja. He was a true rugby man who dedicated his life to the game. He was a national team player, a captain and a coach. It is a big loss not only to the rugby fraternity but the entire country,” Simiyu, who replaced Ayimba as Kenya 7s coach in 2016 told The Standard Sports.
It is at this time that the government should come in and even give him a proper sendoff.
He actually deserves a state funeral or a sendoff that best befits him like someone who dedicated his whole life for Kenya.
He has been a true servant of the game.
President Uhuru Kenyatta excited after making a line out with the Kenyan 7s team at State House, shaking hands with the head coach Benjamin Ayimba in 2016.
He continued: “I remember when I left High School and made it to the national team, Benja was the captain. He walked us through and introduced us to the international level."
He was a very inspirational captain and even when he became the coach, I was his first captain.
We had a very good year in getting to the finals for the first time ever in Adelaide.
He really mentored us to challenge the norm and renew our thinking and change our mindsets.
There was that notion that we are the underdogs and that’s what he changed; we can compete with the big boys.
KRU chairman Oduor Gangla simply said: “A true servant of the game, Benjamin was an inspiration to many, on and off the pitch.”
But Ayimba also made friends and foes in equal measure with his perceived no nonsense approach and unflattering statements during his two coaching stints at Shujaa.
Though Ayimba was portrayed as a coach who attracted both admiration and resentment in his line of duty winning himself love and loathe at the same time, Amonde considers him as a revolutionary.
He clashed with KRU bosses in some occasions that mostly led to his sacking both in 2011 and 2016.
In 2011, Ayimba was fired after opposing the fielding of the team’s main players in the Safari Sevens tournament before he faced the same wrath in 2016 following the Rio Olympic Games fiasco.
“Ayimba was a special person. He came through the Kenyan rugby system and he has been able to give us a road map that we will have to follow in the future. Ayimba did his part and showed us the way, and now it is up to us to make him proud in heaven. We are all mourning for having a legend gone too soon,” said Amonde.
"I feel Benja was more than a servant of the game. He gave it all. I think he is one mentor that has brought a different bit into the game. Rugby will forever remain indebted to Benja and his family because he brought us at a place where no one ever did and achieved a lot.” he addded.
Before the Singapore triumph, Ayimba had masterminded Kenya’s first ever World Series final in 2009 in Adelaide followed by a maiden semifinal appearance at the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Dubai.
But it is at the historic Singapore Sevens that Ayimba left an imprint in the game after literally killing three birds by one stone during his second short spell.
First, he guided the team into booking its Olympics ticket in Rio before leaving a legacy of having introduced several youngsters on the World Rugby Sevens scene.
And it was after Ayimba’s reappointment following the departure of Felix Ochieng in 2015 that immediately turned around the team’s fortunes after a difficult 2014/2015 season, where they had flirted with relegation for the better part of the campaign.
But his return in the dugout ended on a relatively low note after disappointing outing in 2016 Rio Olympics Games, where Kenya finished eleventh on overall before guiding the team to reclaim the Safari Sevens.
The multi-talented Ayimba, who tried his hands and legs in nearly all sports while at Olympic Primary School, Nairobi, began his rugby career at Maseno School.
And for Nyangaga, a man who honed Ayimba’s rugby skills at Maseno between 1991 and 1994, his student outdid him in coaching.
“I’m the one who introduced Benjamin to rugby. He was not a good player, but as a coach he did much better than me. It is unfortunate to hear of his demise. We have lost a great man,” said Nyangaga.
However, Ayimba is credited for laying the foundation of Kenyan rugby after scouting and nurturing many players before eventually introducing some of them to the global scene.
Samuel Oliech, Donald Aluoch, Robert Aringo, Nelson Oyoo, Jeffrey Oluoch, Alvin Otieno, Samuel Motari, Alex Olaba and Frank Wanyama were all handed their World Series debuts by Ayimba in the 2015/2016 season.
By doing so, Ayimba was preparing for a smooth transition in Shujaa when the time comes for the likes of Humphrey Khayange, Collins Injera, Dennis Ombachi and Andrew Amonde to exit the field.
While Ayimba was critically ill and fighting for his life in a city hospital, the family was struggling to raise funds to offset an estimated medical bill of Sh 1.7 million.
He had not been seen in public since the beginning of the year.
Ayimba played for Impala as a rookie (backrow) in 1995 after completing his school studies and went on to captain the Red Shirts to two Kenya Cups, Enterprise Cups and Floodlit tournaments in 2000 and 2001.
He also inspired the team to three National Sevens Circuit titles between 1999 and 2001.
He then moved to record Kenyan champions Nondescripts in 2002 before joining English side Cornish Pirates the following year.
Before venturing into coaching, Ayimba had featured for Shujaa at the 1998,2002 and 2006 Commonwealth Games as well as the 2001 and 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens tournaments in Argentina and Hong Kong respectively.
He then had a short coach/player role for the Simbas before serving as Shujaa coach between 2006 and 2011 after succeeding his Impala coach Bill Githinji.
His achievements didn’t go unnoticed as he was awarded the Order of the Grand Warrior (OGW) by former President Mwai Kibaki.
Ayimba is also credited for being part of the team that introduced popular tournaments like Masaku7s, Meru 7s and Kitui 7s in the country.
Inside Paul Odera’s plan to take Kenya Simbas to first Rugby World Cup
Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera remains optimistic that Kenya can qualify for their first Rugby World Cup to be held in France in 2022.
Despite Covid-19 restrictions restricting the currently 102 players that were called up to the national 15s rugby squad to virtual trainings, Odera believes nothing can stop them if they implement a core set of values he created ahead of their qualifying journey.
Odera believes protection, respect, honesty, perseverance, leadership and warrior-ship can assist the Simbas in their quest to reach France 2023.
“Making the World Cup in France is something much bigger than just rugby for us,” Odera told World Rugby.
“To us, it's to bring the country together, to bring all the different races, tribes, ethnic groups and disparate social groups together for the country to start believing in the men.”
“What's driving me is my passion and that passion is what I'm trying to get into the players, into my coaching staff, into the Kenya Rugby Union as an organisation.”
“We are transforming this country through the game of rugby and we're going to get success on the field and we're going to get success off the field,” he said.
The Simbas are scheduled to host Senegal and Zambia in Nairobi in July in Pool B of the second round of African qualification for RWC 2023.
Kenya have won both of their previous test meetings with Senegal, while their only defeat to Zambia came 41 years ago.
However, the Simbas have not played a competitive test since their Victoria Cup win over Zimbabwe in September 2019, while the country’s domestic competition was suspended in March due to the pandemic.
And, although two of the three teams will progress to the next round, Odera is still worried that a lack of match practice and conditioning could hurt his side.
Kenya came closer than they ever have done to realising their Rugby World Cup dream three years ago when the team qualified for the tournament in Marseille as Africa 2.
However, it turned into a sobering experience as the Simbas lost each of their three matches in the south of France to Canada, Hong Kong and Germany.
Odera and Kenya know how hard it is to navigate the repechage, and the coach is, therefore, keen to secure the team’s return to France as Africa 1, an ambition he thinks is achievable.
Taking heart from the win his Kenya U20 team recorded over Namibia to qualify for the World Rugby U20 Trophy 2019, Odera believes the Simbas can do similar if they improve their success rate in key areas of the game, including the lineout, kicking and tackling.
“We want to transform our country, leadership and our identity; inspiring pride and love for the people of Kenya through rugby,” he said.
Innocent Simiyu: We are ready for Olympics scrum down
Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu is confident Shujaa will be ready for the Tokyo Olympics when the global games begin on July 23.
Speaking after guiding the national rugby Sevens team to a second-place finish at the two-week Rugby Africa Solidarity Camp mini-friendly tournaments in South Africa, Simiyu is optimistic the team would have worked out all their errors and team chemistry before heading to Tokyo.
“We are happy with the performance of the team so far in the last three pre-Olympic invitational tournaments. Getting match fitness has been our key agenda especially after a long layoff due to Covid-19 pandemic,” said Simiyu.
“We need to tick all the vital boxes; breakdown, tackle completion and kick off receipt. We have been having a challenge with these areas and we aim at improving on them."
Shujaa finished second at the Rugby Africa Solidarity Sevens second leg tournament that ended on Sunday at Markötter Stadium, Stellenbosch in South Africa.
Shujaa, who were using the tournament as part of their preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games, lost 31-5 to South Africa 1 in the final of the two-day event.
This was Kenya’s fourth consecutive loss against the Blitzboks in the tournament.
The coach said their focus turns to their last pre-Olympic tournament in USA next month.
With the Tokyo Olympic Games quickly approaching, Quest for Gold Sevens has confirmed international men’s and women’s teams to compete in an exhibition tournament at Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles from June 25-26.
Kenya will start preparations earlier next month ahead of the Quest for Gold 7s. USA, Argentina, Samoa and Korea have confirmed participation in the event.
“For us, we need to go back home and continue with Olympic Games journey and hopefully by the time we get to Los Angeles, we will be able to tick more boxes and be in a position where we can perform well at the Olympic games,” he added.
“With the government support, we need to keep working hard and improving our game.”
KCB winger Jacob Ojee is the only player doubtful for the US tournament after he picked up a left leg injury in South Africa.
Meanwhile, the national women’s Sevens team, Kenya Lionesses, have also confirmed participation in the US pre-Olympic tourney.
With a majority of the participating teams being regulars on the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series, the exhibition sets a perfect stage for pre-Olympic trials ahead of the Tokyo Games.
Three Nakuru High School students hope to become top rugby professionals after passing KCSE exams
From left Michael Denga, Brian Njoroge and Moses Furore at Nakuru High school on May 13, 2021.
Having catapulted Nakuru High School to become regional champions in East Africa Schools Games, three ace rugby players scored straight As (KCSE 2020) in different subjects and want to become top professionals.
As much as they were top players in the first school team, they are out to emerge as top professionals in their respective academic professions at the universities.
Brian Njoroge (eighthman), Michael Denga (centre) and scrum-half Moses Furore are ready to begin a new chapter in their academic lives after a marvellous performance in the recently released KCSE examinations, a move that has prompted regional rugby tactician and the school's principal Mike Yator to appeal to national selectors to focus on the trio as potential future star players.
"They excelled in the pitch and as well in their academics. I appeal to national coaches to give them a chance at the national teams while pursuing their studies at the universities,” said Yator.
The trio of Njoroge, Denga and Furore, who all are aged 18 years, scored Mean Grades of A (81 points), A- (76 points) and B+ (68 points) want to study Civil Engineering, Marine Engineering and Law respectively.
Interestingly, the trio had scored over 300 marks in their KCPE Examinations with Njoroge scoring 380, Denga 368 and Furore 351 marks.
Besides their academic excellence, none of them is ready to stop playing rugby.
They hope to proceed with it at the university with an eye of hoping to be selected into the National Sevens and Fifteens teams.
"Rugby is part of my diet and it will remain so at the university," said Njoroge who scored five straight As in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography and Art and Designs.
Denga, who is the first school rugby captain in the institution's history, said the sport had inspired his academic progress.
"Had it not been rugby and the discipline it carries with it, I believe my performance in this exam would have been different today.
"This is because the inspiration instilled in us during our training sessions was carried to the classroom in equal measure and it motivated me to catch up with the rest in the class to emerge as the best ever school rugby captain," a confident Denga stated.
On his part, Furore who wants to study Law at the University of Nairobi, thanked Kenya Lionesses Head Coach Felix Oloo for his inspiration and skills learnt in the training sessions at Nakuru RFC Development Program while still at New Life School Academy in Nakuru Municipality.
"That is where I started my rugby career as a junior player while still in primary school and rose through the ranks in development sides to become a refined player for my school team," Furore told The Standard Sports.
The trio was in the Nakuru RFC development side that toured United Kingdom in 2015, Kigali, Rwanda in 2018 and Jinja, Uganda in 2019 in junior rugby championships.
In the United Kingdom where they participated in the Festivals of Rugby, Nakuru RFC III finished runners up, won the Rwanda Connect to Africa Rugby Championships in 2018 and also finished runners up in Jinja Connect to Africa Rugby Championships the following year (2019).
While thanking their principal Yator and school coach Reynold Kaunda, the trio said in unison that experiences shaped their life in general.
Yator said the record set by the trio is a precedent that will go a long way in being emulated by many players who will pass through different coaches in the school's rugby history.
"This is a rich rugby history mixed with rich academic records that will live to be remembered to inspire more players who'll aspire to emulate them," Yator, who is also a qualified athletics and rugby coach, said.
The talented youngsters look forward to being selected by the Joint Universities Academic Board(JAB) and pursue courses of their dreams.
Shujaa finish second at Rugby Africa Solidarity 7s camp
Kenya Sevens team Shujaa finished second at the Rugby Africa Solidarity Sevens second leg tournament that ended on Saturday at Markötter Stadium, Stellenbosch in South Africa.
Shujaa, who were using the tournament as part of their preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games, suffered a 31-5 defeat to South Africa 1 in the finals of the two-day event. This was Kenya's fourth consecutive loss against the Blitzboks in the tournament.
South Africa 1 took the lead through Sako Makata via a cross-kick and chase before Selvyn Davids stretched the lead to 12-0 after grounding another cross kick.
Selvyn Davids would then set up Angelo Davids on the left wing for the third try before Angelo stretched the lead to 24-0 with another good kick.
Alvin Otieno pulled one try back for Kenya but Muller du Preez would hit the final nail on the win with a late try to make the score 31-5
Earlier on, Billy Odhiambo scored a brace as Kenya edged out Uganda 31-7.
Herman Humwa, Daniel Taabu and Bush Mwale’s tries saw Kenya register their third win of the tournament.
Shujaa now shift focus to their last pre-Olympic tournament in USA next month.
The Rugby Africa Sevens camp acted as a competitive training camp including two tournament weekends for host South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Kenya ahead of the Summer Games
Kenya Sevens team Shujaa started the second day of the final leg of the Rugby Africa Solidarity Sevens friendly tournament on a high note after thrashing Uganda 31-7 in match played at Markötter Stadium in Stellenbosch on Sunday.
Billy Odhiambo scored a brace as Herman Humwa, Daniel Taabu and Bush Mwale’s tries saw Kenya register their third win out of the four matches played so far in South Africa.
Kenya took an early 5-0 lead after a missed conversion in the opening minutes of the match after Odhiambo touchdown in the left corner from a quick restart by Humwa after overturning possession on a Ugandan attack.
Odhiambo soon made it 12-0 after Tony Omondi’s conversion. Collins Injera’s clever pass of the rack found an unmarked Odhiambo who raced to the try line to dot Kenya’s second try of the match.
Shujaa will soon after run away with the game after Herman Humwa touched down between the post for a 19-0 lead after Omondi’s conversion.
Uganda would grab a late try after the hooter after Nobert Okeny raced past the Kenyan defense to land their only try of the match before Tim Kisiga added the conversion as Shujaa went to the break leading 19-7.
In the final half, Daniel Taabu and Bush Mwale sealed the win with two more tries as Kenya won comfortably with a 31-7 score.
Kenya will be back in action again against South Africa 1.
Maseno School rugby players qualify for university after passing KCSE exams
Kenya National Secondary School Rugby heavyweights Maseno School have sent all their rugby players to the university.
This is after all 21 players from the Kisumu based secondary school scored C+ and above in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) that were released on Monday.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Maseno School rugby coach Paul Nyamita said he is proud of all his 21 players who featured in both 7s and 15s school teams.
“Covid-19 spoiled the game but we won academic battle. All my smart rugby players are joining university. I am very proud and humbled to be part of this amazing school,” said Nyamita who doubles as Maseno School’s English teacher.
Two players scored A-(minus), three B+(plus), five B(plain), seven B-(minus) and the remaining four C+(plus).
Influential players Peter Ogoti and Agoro Mitch scored A- as Jack Mungala, Emmanuel Odhiambo and Samwel Oketch scored B+.
Generally, Maseno School topped Kisumu County with a mean of 9.58 points with 448 students out of 462 scoring direct to university mean grade of C+ and above. 24 students scored A (plains) and 121 students got A-(minus).
Five time national rugby 7s champions Maseno School had just qualified for the Nyanza Regional Secondary School Games when the coronavirus pandemic struck, blowing away the schools dream of lifting the 2020 Kenya National Secondary School rugby 7s and 15s title.
However, Nyamita said he called upon his players to forget about rugby and turn their attention to academics, a move that played out to be successful.
“I told my rugby players to quickly shift focus to academic after learning that Covid-19 will interfere with sports not only in Kenya but globally. They didn't disappoint. I can’t even describe how I am feeling right now,” said Nyamita, an author of English Demystified Revision Paper 1,2 and 3 series.
Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion Elly Ajowi is confident the National Boxing Team will give its best in the Konstantin Korotkov Memorial International Tournament in the city of Khabarovsk in Russia starting Monday.
The nine-day competition to run from Monday to May 16 has attracted top European boxing nations and three countries in Africa in Kenya, Morocco and Algeria.
Fresh from winning a gold medal in the Africa Zone Three Boxing Championships in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo in March, Ajowi said the team is ready to revert to its original place in the global boxing map as was in the seventies and eighties.
He said the Russian championships will give them the right atmosphere against refined boxers drawn from Europe and the rest of the world in readiness for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in Japan in two and half months.
"Such tournaments give us confidence and the right atmosphere to take part in serious competitions and therefore it has come at the right time before we head to Olympics," Ajowi told Standard Sports.
Four boxers have qualified for the Olympics and are expected to jet out of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport today.
The quartet includes Ajowi, 2015 African Boxing Championships lightweight gold medallist Nick Okoth, Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medallist Christine Ongare and national lightweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi.
The four boxers will be handled by three coaches led by Head Coach Musa Benjamin and assistant coaches David Munuhe and John Waweru while the team manager is Linus Ouma.
Boxing Federation of Kenya Communications Director Duncan Kuria and international referee cum judge Nelson Otieno are other qualified officials approved to accompany the team.
Otieno will officiate in the tournament having faced a similar assignment in the Kinshasa Championships and during the World Military Games in South Korea in 2015.
Otieno was impressed by his appointment to officiate in Russia and promised to give his best at a time Confederation of African Boxing((CAB) is equally shopping for officials from the continent to officiate in Japan.
"Accompanying teams during national assignments gives us and players confidence required that can assure them of fair officiating in international assignments," he told Standard Sports.
Head Coach Musa Benjamin said morale was high among the four players who have been training for the past five weeks at AV Fitness Centre in Lavington, Nairobi.
Admitting it is a tough tournament, Benjamin said the four players are in the right frame of mind for the tournament but are ready to give their best before they head for the Olympics.
"The tournament is the right platform that gives our players the right exposure against competitive opponents before we head to the Olympics," he said.
The team is also scheduled to feature in another international assignment in the Phillipines next month, which will be the final friendly assignment before they head to Japan.
Meanwhile, the Moroccan team of four boxers are already in Russia preparing for the Olympics.
They are featherweight Mohammed Hammoud, welterweight Abdelahaq Nadir, light heavyweight Mohammed Assaghir and heavyweight Youness Baala.
Kenya’s Otieno voted best referee in Russian boxing tournament
Kenya’s top international referee cum judge Nelson Otieno was voted one of the best referees in the Konstatin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships that ended in Russia over the weekend.
Otieno who was the only African referee in the nine-day tournament officiated several matches, with his last one being the semifinal featherweight match between Tomo Tsuboi of Japan and Azerbaijan's Umoid Rystamnov.
Previously, he had officiated in the Africa Zone Three Boxing Championships in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo in March after having taken part in the World Military Games in South Korea in 2015.
"It is a big honour given to me and Kenya and hope to continue in the same spirit in future international assignments," Otieno told Standard Sports.
The tournament attracted three African countries: Kenya, Morocco and Algeria.
Kenya is the only country in Africa that produced a referee to officiate in the tournament.
As Otieno was being given a standing ovation at Lenina International Sports Complex-Stadium in the city of Khabarovsk, two Kenyan boxers also received their bronze medals.
They include 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight (60kg) Gold medallist Nick 'Commander' Okoth and double Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight (over 91kg) Gold medalist Elly Ajowi.
Okoth was beaten in the featherweight (57kg) semifinals on a unanimous decision by Russia's Ovik Oganisyan while Ajowi lost his quarterfinal match against Uzberkistan's Madiyar Saidrahmov.
Commonwealth Games flyweight (48kg) bronze medalist Christine Ongare and National lightweight (58kg) champion Elizabeth Akinyi finished fifth in their respective weight categories.
The four boxers were handled by three coaches led by Musa Benjamin and assistant coaches David Munuhe and John Waweru while Linus Ouma was the team manager.
African Boxing Union (ABU) middleweight champion Rayton 'Boom Boom' Okwiri turned professional after his amazing show at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Brazil.
Since then, he has been on and off the paid ranks following announcement by World amateur boxing body AIBA allowing pro boxers to qualify and compete in the Olympics.
He took advantage of this reprieve last year to take part in the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal where two Kenyan pugilists punched their tickets to the Summer Games.
Unlucky Okwiri returned home to carry on with his professional boxing, successfully defending his ABU title on December 14 in Nairobi.
His professional stint, which has not yielded much in terms of revenues, seems to have taken a lucrative turn on Friday when Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC) announced his forthcoming title fight against a yet to be named Russian opponent.
The World Boxing Organisation (WBO) duel slated for August in Nairobi has attracted global quarters including former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, Floyd Mayweather's The Money Team Promotions and sport and technology firm Bet22 Kenya.
The fact that the bout has attracted big boys in the sport is a clear indication that the pugilist is set to reap big in the duel.
Also, Bet22 Kenya coming on board to sponsor his stay and training in Florida, USA ahead of the fight in addition to Sh350,000 to cater for his training expenses tells a lot about the magnitude of the fight.
Will he finally get his breakthrough in the paid ranks?
Only time will tell.
Okwiri has been upping his exercises at the historic Pal Pal gym under head coach David Kiilu to prepare for the WBO fight.
"I have been engaging in strength and conditioning schedule in addition to the skills and sparring techniques," he told The Standard Sports.
His weekly routine involves long distance jogging at the weekend, shadow boxing on Mondays, normal training on Tuesdays, sparring sessions on Wednesdays, another normal training on Thursdays and another sparring session on Fridays.
In order to take his fitness to the next level, Okwiri will now travel to the USA to engage in high profile training.
"I'll be based in Florida till August under Raynelo Promotions," he said.
Okwiri will engage in competitive sparring in the US to gain exposure ahead of the fight.
"There are no worthy sparring partners in Kenya right now, most of the opponents I have get tired easily.
"While in the US, I'll be training in a state of the art gym with all the equipment. This will put me at par with my opponent," he said.
Okwiri is grateful that his trip and stay in America has been fully sponsored by betting firm Bet22 Kenya.
"With the Sh350,000 received, I'll buy gloves, pads, boots, tracksuits, headgear, skipping ropes among other training paraphanelias," he said.
Sam Malonza, 22Bet Kenya General Manager said they chose to sponsor Okwiri because the pugilist has potential.
"We supported him last December when he successfully defended his ABU title. We are glad he didn't disappoint," Malonza said.
Malonza explained The Money Team (TMT) Promotions by American boxer Floyd Mayweather and former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson have agreed to be part of the forthcoming bout.
"We look forward to hosting Tyson in Nairobi soon before the fight," said Malonza.

Kiilu who is a former World Boxing Union and World Boxing Federation champion is happy that Okwiri has finally landed on a sponsorship deal to aid his fights.
"Now we have no financial problems, it's our turn to deliver the belt home," said Kiilu.
Kiilu will engage Okwiri online to monitor the boxers progress in the US.
Okwiri's Manager, Ahmed Juma believes the boxer will return to Kenya sharper and ready to deliver the coveted belt.
Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC) President, Reuben Ndolo said the federation and WBO will announce Okwiri's opponent in due course.
He also challenged Bet22 to sponsor other young boxers because they are the future of the sport.
"Okwiri was initially to fight Moshea Aleem of USA on May 19, but this did not take place due to the ongoing covid pandemic," said KPBC Secretary General Frankline Imbenzi.

Coaches: Kenyan boxers earned required exposure in Russia ahead of Tokyo Olympics
Kenya finished second behind Morocco in Africa with two bronze medals as the curtains came down on the Konstatin Korotkov International Boxing Championships in the city of Khabarovsk, Russia on Saturday.
The two medals were won by captain and 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight gold medalist Nick 'Commander' Okoth and two-time Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight gold medalist Elly Ajowi.
Okoth dropped in the semi finals of the featherweight (57kg) when he lost the bout on a unanimous decision against Ovik Oganisyan of Russia while Ajowi was beaten by Madiyar Saidrahmov of UzbekistanUzbekistan on a similar decision.
Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medallist Christine Ongare finished fifth alongside national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi after all of them lost in the first rounds in their respective weight categories.
Immediately after the match, Okoth admitted having lost to a better boxer after he slacked in the last two rounds after a better start in the first round but was contented with the bronze medal.
"I started the match well in the first round but relaxed in the last two rounds for my opponent to turn tables on me. However, I'm happy with the achievement. A bronze medal is better than nothing," he told The Standard Sports.
Head Coach Musa Benjamin said the tournament had assisted them to know the strengths and weaknesses of each boxer for proper review ahead of the future international championships.
"The tournament is of great importance to us as it has assisted the technical bench on areas we need to address before we head to Japan for 2020 Tokyo Olympics," Benjamin said.
His (Benjamin's) deputy, David Munuhe said boxers did their best in the tournament but was quick to point out that they were fighting better opponents exposed to quality facilities compared to them.
He added that it could have been a grave mistake had they missed the tournament.
"Such competitions are of great help to us especially at such a time when we are preparing for serious international championships," Munuhe pointed out.
National Olympic Committee - Kenya, (NOCK) treasurer Anthony Kariuki who was the leader of the delegation said it was very crucial to involve the team in another international friendly competition before they head to Japan.
"Kenyans played against young refined boxers they could face in Tokyo and since it was an important tournament that had exposed them, it'll be prudent if we could involve them in another event of such magnitude before heading to Japan," Kariuki stated.

His statement coincided with Boxing Federation of Kenya's earlier plans of sending the same team to the Philippines ahead of the Olympics.
Last week, BFK's Competitions' Secretary John Waweru confirmed they had written to the Kenyan Government on their intention to travel to the Philippines upon their return from Russia.
Team manager Linus Ouma said it was important to start the recruitment and training of young boxers in the grassroots at tender ages and expose them at the international level before climbing up the ranks to the senior teams.
"This is the way forward to measure with the standards seen in Russia. That's the way to go if we are to regain our previous status of a global boxing powerhouse," he said.
During the nine-day tournament, Kenya's top referee cum judge Nelson Otieno was the only technical official from Africa who was appointed to officiate in it despite the competition having also attracted Morocco and Algeria.
Team Captain Nick Okoth won a bronze medal in the featherweight division (57kg)
Olympian Elly Ajowi won a bronze medal in the super heavyweight (over 91kg).
Flyweight(48kg) Christine Ongare and welterweight (69kg) Elizabeth Akinyi finished fifth in their respective weight categories.
Boxing legend Mike Tyson to grace Rayton Okwiri's WBO title fight in Nairobi
Africa Boxing Union (ABU) middleweight champion Rayton 'Boom Boom' Okwiri is stepping up training for a World Boxing Organisation title fight slated for August in Nairobi.
The duel, pitting the Olympian against a Russian opponent is also supported by Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather TMT Promotions.
Okwiri has been upping his exercises at the historic Pal Pal gym under head coach David Kiilu ahead of the crunch tie.
In order to take his fitness to the next level, Okwiri will travel to the USA next week to engage in a high profile training.
"There are no worthy sparring partners in Kenya right now, most of the opponents I have got tired easily.
Okwiri's trip and stay in America was sponsored on Friday by betting firm 22Bet.

In addition, the firm gave him Sh350,000 to cater for his training gears.
"With this money, I'll buy gloves, pads, boots, tracksuits, headgear, skipping ropes among other training paraphernalia," he said.
Sam Malonza, 22Bet General Manager said they chose to sponsor Okwiri because the pugilist has potential.
"We look forward to host Tyson in Nairobi soon before the fight," said Malonza.

Kenya’s Nick Okoth and Elly Ajowi bow out of Russian boxing tournament
Kenya captain Nick Okoth and two time Olympic champion Elly Ajowi have bowed out of the Konstantin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships in Russia.
Okoth who is the 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight gold medalist lost in the semi-finals in the featherweight (57kg), while Ajowi who is the reigning Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion was beaten in the quarter-finals.
Okoth was beaten by Russian Ovik Oganisyan on a unanimous points decision.
All five judges gave Oganisyan a total victory of 30-27, 30-26, 30-27, 30-27 and 30-28 at Lenina Regional Sports Complex in the city of Khabarovsk on Friday.
Oganisyan will face the winner of the semi-final match between Tomo Tsuboi of Japan and Umoid Rystamnov of Azerbaijan, to be officiated by Kenyan referee Nelson Otieno.
Okoth was happy to have won a bronze medal in the tournament admitting he made several mistakes in the first and second round, which cost him the victory.
“This was a tournament meant to prepare us for the Tokyo Olympics and the mistakes we made here (Russia), will be corrected by our coaches,” he told The Standard Sports.
The technical bench was headed by Musa Benjamin with the assistance of David Munuhe and John Waweru.
On Monday, Benjamin said losing and winning was part of their mission in Russia but what mattered was the team to gain exposure on the kind of boxers they could meet in Japan.
“What mattered on our part was to have the boxers get the required exposure before we head to Japan,” said the head coach.
Ajowi, who was taking his first match in the quarter-finals was beaten on a unanimous points decision by Madiyar Saidrahimov of Uzbekistan.
The five judges gave Saidrahimov a victory of 30-27, 30-27, 30-27, 30-27 and 30-27 to cruise into the finals where he’ll face off with Lazizbek Mullozhonov of Uzbekistan.
On the way to the finals, Mullozhonov had beaten Andrey Stocky of Russia in the second semi-final match.
Okoth and Ajowi join compatriots Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi, who have equally bowed out of the tournament.
Ongare finished in the fifth position in the flyweight.
On her part, Akinyi was happy to have participated in the tournament saying: ”it was my first time to have travelled this far and for sure it has enhanced my confidence in the future international matches.”
The team was using the tournament to shape up for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to be held in Japan from July 23 to August 8.
Top Kenyan referee Nelson Otieno was the only referee from the continent who officiated in the seven-day tournament.
The team is expected back in the country on Monday.
Nick Okoth becomes first African boxer to win in Russia
The 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight (60kg) gold medalist Nick ‘Commander’ Okoth became the first African boxer to win his bout in the ongoing Konstantin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships at Lenina Regional Sports Complex - Stadium in the city of Khabarovsk, Russia.
Okoth, who plied in the featherweight (57kg), beat Kishko Sergei of Ukraine on unanimous points’ decision to cruise into the semi-finals on the fourth day (Thursday) of the tournament.
All the five Russian judges in Radnaev Baryato, Rymyacencev Semen, Liskyn Andrey, Moiseev Oleg, Shevchenko Aleksey and Shalimov Uriy gave Okoth a thumbs up on a 5-0 win of 29-28, 30-27, 30-27, 30-27 and 30-27 respectively.
“It was a good but difficult match, which I easily won. My opponent was good and applied too much force but I defended myself well following instructions from my coaches who kept shouting them at the touchline,” Okoth told The Standard Sports in a post-match interview.
It was a sweet victory for the experienced Okoth, who strolled to victory in all three rounds of the epic match against the Russian.
Okoth takes on Ovik Oganisyan of Russia in semi-finals this afternoon.
And the victory was a big relief to the technical bench led by Musa Benjamin with the assistance of David Munuhe and John Waweru following a double loss for female boxers in the opening matches.
“It was a tough match for Okoth but he came out victorious because he followed our touchline instructions. Fights will be tough but we are ready for any eventuality. The win was good for the team,” said Benjamin.
The female players who lost in the opening matches were Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi.
Ongare was beaten on unanimous points’ decision by Diana Gorishnaya of Estonia while Akinyi lost to Maria Moronto of Dominican Republic also on points.
Benjamin said their prime objective in Russia was to give the four players exposure against refined opponents ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
“This tournament came at the right time to prepare players for the big games after a long lay-off due to Coronavirus pandemic. It is giving us exposure on possibilities of meeting the same opponents in preliminary matches at the Olympics,” Benjamin told The Standard Sports.
Ongare blamed her defeat on temper after she was severally held and pushed by her opponent without the intervention of the referee.
“My opponent kept on holding on me as she pushed me around, which made me lose temper and control of the game against Gorishnaya without intervention of the referee who instead penalized me,” Ongare told The Standard Sports from Russia.
However, she said the standards in Europe were far ahead of Africa as it gave her the experience required to take part in the Olympics.
On her part, Akinyi was not aggressive against Moronto (Maria) in the first two rounds only to recover in the third one but by then it was too late to catch up with her opponent.
Benjamin said a cut sustained by Akinyi in her mouth also contributed to her defeat as she kept on backpedalling in the last two rounds.
“It was too late for her to beat her in the third round with the cut,” said Benjamin.
Out of the four boxers, it is only two-time Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion Elly Ajowi who is yet to take the ring.
False start for Kenyans, Ongare and Akinyi knocked out in Russia

Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national bantamweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi have been knocked out of the on-going Konstantin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships after losing their opening bouts in Khabarovsk, Russia yesterday.
Ongare lost to Diana Gorishnaya of Estonia on unanimous points’ decision at Lenina Regional Sports Complex before Akinyi was beaten by Maria Moronto of the Dominican Republic.
The two boxers were eliminated in the early stages of the seven-day tournament.
The competition has attracted players from Africa, Europe and Asia, who are using it as part of their preparations for the Tokyo Olympic Games slated for July 23 to August 8 in Japan.
Other countries representing Africa are Morocco and Algeria.
Kenya and Morocco have entered four players each, while Algeria sent three players to the tournament.
Though disappointed by the duo’s early exit, head coach Musa Benjamin says the event will give the Kenyan team a lot of exposure ahead of the Olympics.
“Our main objective is to ensure players get exposure whether they win or lose matches. Their performance here (Russia) will help us shape them for the Olympics,” said Benjamin.
Africa Zone Three super heavyweight champion Elly Ajowi (over 91kg) and the 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight (60kg) gold medalist Nick Okoth are set to take into the ring later today.
Cohesion in Boxing Federation of Kenya promotes formidable working partnership
The cohesion in the executive committee of Boxing Federation of Kenya is the drive that has seen the effective performance of the National Boxing Team in the recent international boxing championships.
The BFK led by President Anthony ‘Jamal’ Ombok was elected into the office in 2019 and has since involved the national boxing team in a number of international matches.
International referee cum judge Nelson Otieno said proper planning by the national boxing governing body is what has seen several appointed Kenyan officials and teams do well in international championships.
“This is the way to go if we are to revert to the previous standards witnessed in the seventies and eighties that saw Kenya get respected globally at a time we were in the same class with world boxing powerhouses like Cuba and United States of America,” said Otieno.
The past year has seen a number of coaches get trained by International Boxing Association (AIBA) certified experts in workshops.
Kenya recently took part in the Konstatin Korotkov Memorial Boxing Championships hosted in the city of Khabarovsk, Russia where they won two bronze medals from a representation of four boxers.
The four were captain and 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight gold medalist Nick Okoth, Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight gold medalist Elly Ajowi, Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi.
The two bronze medals were won by Okoth and Ajowi.
BFK treasurer Musa Benjamin said theirs is to give all officials an equal opportunity to excel in their respective fields.
“Our work is to give all boxers and officials an equal opportunity to progress their careers in their respective specialities,” said Benjamin
Otieno is one of the most respected referees cum judges in Africa and the world over.
He was recently appointed to officiate in the Russia Championships before he was voted as one of the best referees of the tournament.
Other respected Kenyan international referees and judges are Rebecca Wambui, Steve Ndung’u and Samuel Otie

Prior to that, he (Otieno) had officiated in the Africa Zone Three Boxing Championships in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo in March 2021 following his appointment by Confederation of African Boxing (CAB).
Otieno also officiated in the World Military Games in South Korea in 2015.
He looks forward to being appointed to officiate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
“Hopefully, I may be appointed to officiate in the Olympics but all that is still not confirmed. If given the opportunity, I’ll be ready to offer my services at the big games,” he said.
Boxing coach Musa Benjamin: We hope Government will approve our trip to Philippines ahead of Olympics
National Boxing Team head coach Musa Benjamin is still hopeful the Government will approve their trip to the Philippines for the final international friendly boxing championships before they head to Japan for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
If the trip is not feasible, Benjamin said they'll still be contented with another one in any of the top European boxing nations preferably Denmark, Ukraine or Germany.
Speaking exclusively to The Standard Sports three days after their arrival from Russia where they took part in the Konstatin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships, Benjamin said that was the way to go in preparations for international assignments.
"Another tournament of the same magnitude like the Russian Championships is what we need to strengthen and spur confidence and performance of boxers before we start official residential training at Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani," Benjamin said.
He said boxers also need time to heal and rest before residential training and appealed for approval of the trip in good time to involve the same four boxers who featured in the Russian Championships
Christine Ongare in action against Diana Gorishnaya of Estonia during the Konstantin Korotkov Memorial International Boxing Championships in Khabarovsk, Russia, on Wednesday May 12, 2021.
It is the quartet of captain and 2015 Africa Boxing Championships lightweight gold medalist Nick Okoth, Olympian and Africa Zone Three super heavyweight gold medalist Elly Ajowi, Commonwealth Games flyweight bronze medalist Christine Ongare and national welterweight champion Elizabeth Akinyi.
"This trip is also ideal for us as earlier planned among the two international friendly tournaments we were to attend ahead of the official residential training camp," the National coach told The Standard Sports.
However, it seems time is not on their side as all Kenyan teams that have qualified for the Olympics are scheduled to enter residential training in the next three weeks.
The Kenyan teams that have already qualified for the games are the National Sevens rugby teams for men and women - Shujaa and Kenya Lionesses, the National Women Volleyball team- Malkia Strikers, Athletics Squad, judo and shooting teams.
Benjamin said on Friday his main aim is to have the four boxers reach the medal bracket at the Olympics and possibly win them.
"It is the reason we urge the Government to approve our trip to the Philippines or to one of the top European boxing nations," he said.
He said the world over all teams that have already qualified for Olympics enter special training three months before the games and take part in several international friendly matches.
"Since time immemorial, teams whose boxers reach the medal bracket at the Olympics are those whose countries take their time to involve their boxers in numerous international matches. And we should not be an exception," he said.
While thanking the Government for their trip to Russia, he said players and the technical bench had learnt a lot from it and thanks the way to go in future international championships.
Kenya Open champion Kibet ready to roar to Grand Slam arena
He is a two-time Davis Cup and Kenya Open winner
He is upbeat of making it to Europe contests despite missing Euro/Africa Group II tournament earlier this year.
It took four years for Ibrahim Kibet to end his four-year wait for a major title when he won the 2018 Kenya Open after shocking top seed Ismael Changawa 7-5, 6-4.
Kibet, who boast superb groundstrokes and endurance, always unleashes sterling shows on the court.
But beyond his wide smile that radiates with milky teeth, stands a 24-year-old man with lofty dreams – he longs to compete at the European Championships within a few years.
“After many unsuccessful attempts, I chose not to give up and it paid dividends in 2018 when I won the Kenya Open title. I have a self-belief that slid me to victory.
“In the same spirit, I will strive to attain my dream of playing in the world championships,” he said.
Kibet said he is ready to start afresh after taking time off during the coronavirus pandemic which, he says, is a blessing in disguise –more importantly –coming after suffering Davis Cup heartbreak in Indonesia earlier this year.
Kenya's hope of featuring in the Euro/Africa Group 2 tournament later in September this year were shattered in March after Ismael Changawa and Ibrahim Kibet lost 6-7, 7-6, 7-6 to Christopher Rungkat and David Susanto of Indonesia in the best-of-five Euro/Africa Group 2 playoffs at the Gelora Bung Karno tennis court in Jarkarta.
The last time Kenya qualified for Euro/Africa Group 2 was in 1992 where they were eliminated in the semi finals, falling just one match shy of the World Group 1 play offs but Kibet is confident of replaying the feat next year.
“Losing the opportunity to take part in the Euro/Africa Group 2 tournament scheduled for September this year was my lowest moment but I am not giving up. I have to make it. I believe that with proper training nothing is impossible,” he said.
Kibet, the Kenya seed three, now focusses on qualifying and, perhaps, winning the postponed ITF 15K Futures Tournament and with a dream of making it to one of the Grand Slams in future.
“I have been training and working hard with individual training under guidance of my coaches with hope of winning the Futures Tournament.
“It will be great if I qualify for one of the Grand Slams, with Wimbledon as my dream competition because I play well on the grass,” he said.
Kibet is looking forward to defend his Kenya Open title and aims to win his third Davis Cup crown, having won the awards in 2018 and 2019.
“My main goal this year is to finish the year as Kenya’s tennis top seed if all goes well in post coronavirus pandemic. I know it won’t be easy with Changawa’s consistency but I believe in myself.”
He started playing tennis at the age of eight while studying at Mombasa Primary School after being influenced by his grandfather and trained by his coach and mentor Lawrence Karanja.
Naomi Osaka fined Sh1.6 million for media boycott, could face expulsion from French Open
Japan's Naomi Osaka could be thrown out of the French Open if she continues to boycott post-match news conferences at the tournament, the board of Grand Slam tennis tournaments said on Sunday.
Osaka, who was fined 15,000 dollars for skipping the news conference after her first-round victory at Roland Garros, could also face suspension from other Grand Slam tournaments, the board added.
The four-times Grand Slam champion said earlier this week she would not face the media during the French Open, citing mental health reasons.
Men’s world number one tennis player Djokovic tests positive for COVID-19
Novak Djokovic, the men’s world number one tennis player, has tested positive for COVID-19, the Serbian said in a statement on Tuesday.
Croatia’s Borna Coric, Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria and Viktor Troicki have previously tested positive after playing in Djokovic’s Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region.
“The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested,” the 33-year-old said in a statement, adding that he was not showing any symptoms. “My result is positive, just as Jelena’s (wife), while the results of our children are negative.
“I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope that it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and that everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days.”
The tournament witnessed packed stands during the opening leg in Belgrade, players hugging at the net, playing basketball, posing for pictures and attending press conferences together.
Djokovic organised nights out in Belgrade for the players and pictures and videos of him dancing with the other participants at his event were posted on social media.
With both Serbia and Croatia easing lockdown measures weeks before the event, players were not obliged to observe social distancing rules in either country.
Djokovic said the idea behind his tournament was noble and he wanted to raise funds for players in need.
“Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions,” said Djokovic, who is also the head of the players council of the men’s ATP Tour. “Our tournament meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region."
“The Tour has been designed to help both established and up and coming tennis players from South-Eastern Europe to gain access to some competitive tennis while the various tours are on hold due to the COVID-19 situation.”
A following statement confirmed that the remainder of the Adria Tour had been cancelled, the two-day event on July 3 and 4 in Banja Luka, Bosnia and the planned exhibition match with Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in Sarajevo on July 5.
“We are extremely disappointed to have to cancel the events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo,” said Novak’s brother Djordje Djokovic, the director of the Adria Tour.
“We were looking forward to treating fans in these two cities to watching Novak Djokovic and other top players. Unfortunately, the recent events make everyone’s speedy recovery a top priority.”
Young Owegi targets ITF World Tennis Tour victory
Kenya will host women’s International Tennis Federation (ITF) World Tennis Tour in October.
Alicia Owegi, the Kenya seed three, defies every description of a dedicated and determined tennis player.
Her swift swings and steadiness set her apart with other tennis players.
Owegi’s bravery has seen her triumph in tension-packed courts.
Her court exploits have – and still are – well supplemented by her slender figure. And pride swells in her heart as she recounts her journey to fame.
“I long to become a professional tennis player,” said Owegi. “And I am just going to work hard every day.”
The 16-year-old girl is one of the top players in the country, ranked third nationally.
With a superb serve and good groundstrokes, Owegi is destined for greater achievements.
She won the ITF/CAT East African Junior championship singles and doubles in 2016 and reached the semifinals at the 2018 Kenya Open – a feat she is keen to surpass this year.
She is now focused on winning the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Women’s World Tennis Tour.
"My target is to win the ITF World Tour. I believe I have what it takes. I need to improve and rectify the mistakes I made last year," she said.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Owegi says she sticks to a special training programme to keep her fitness in preparation for the October games.
"I wake up in the morning and do some workouts before proceeding to school for online classes then embark on stretches and jogging," she added.
Kenya is set to host the women’s International Tennis Federation (ITF) World Tennis Tour in October this year.
The Tour, which will be held in Kenya for the second time, will attract 20 teams.
Last year, 56 players battled it out for the Sh1.5 million top prize where Owegi was forced to start at the qualifying rounds as Angela Okutoyi, Faith Nyabera and Judith Nkatha were handed byes.
Owegi was introduced to tennis in school at the age of 10.
She made her debut in 2012 during the Gymkhana Open under 12 Championships where she lost all matches and finished last. But she never gave up.
In 2016, she won gold at the ITF East Africa junior championship in both singles and doubles.
She represented Kenya at the All African Games in Rabat, Morocco, last year where they finished fourth before finishing runners up at the East Africa Zonal Championship last year and this year.
Cheruto: From slums to the top of Africa
She is keen to stage a comeback after Covid-19 pandemic
The 15-year-old high school student beat all odds to scale the continent’s heights of fame.
Her slender looks and the swift swings on the courts offer a spectacular sight.
And Cynthia Cheruto is a gifted tennis player who dismisses opponents in local and international tournaments without breaking a sweat. The 15-year-old girl is simply a talent in several fronts.
In the last seven years, Cheruto has produced remarkable performance in Kenya, Confederation of African Tennis (CAT) and International Tennis Federation (ITF) competitions.
Apart from winning the Star Challenge under-14 championship last year, she also won the under-14 Kenya Open and ITF/CAT East African Junior championship in Tanzania in 2018.
In 2016, she made her international debut in Morocco where he finished fourth in under-14 singles before her second outing in Egypt the same year, where she won a bronze medal.
The highlight of her journey to stardom came in 2018 when she won gold at the ITF/CAT East African Junior championship in Tanzania.
She also 2018 Kenya Open under 14 category in singles and doubles.
“Winning the Kenya Open was a milestone for me even if it was in the junior category. It motivates me while in the court,” Cheruto, whose father was a footballer and mother a runner, said.
Last year, she won the Star Challenge under-14 tournament and reached semi finals of the International Tennis Federation Juniors event at Nairobi Club before taking part in ITF Algeria and South Africa Junior championships.
She also put her young muscles to test in a senior competition at the Women’s Futures championship where she reached the quarterfinals, a feat she longs to beat when she makes her senior debut this year.
“I can’t wait to play in senior events. Though I am still young, I believe I have what it takes to compete,” she said.
Cheruto, a student at Mbagathi Road Secondary School, hopes to attain a top 100 ITF ranking.
She is currently ranked 2279 in the world junior ITF rankings.
She is keen on stepping out of the shadows of her role model and Kenya seed one Angela Okutoyi.
As a Kenya tennis seed five, Cheruto has huge ambitions -- to take part in French Open, USA Open and Australia Open.
“Okutoyi is my role model. What she has achieved in her career is unbelievable. Her determination and hard work inspires me,” Cheruto said, adding that her role model is former World number one Serena Williams.
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, she has a training regimen that she adheres to everyday to keep fit.
“I was 10 years old when I heard of tennis. Some organisation came to Kibra offering opportunities to children. I gave it a try and gradually I fell in love with the sport because it kept me busy and away from the streets,” she said.
Veronica Osogo, who is her coach, said Cheruto has a bright future in tennis.
“Cheruto is a hard-working player. Even with the challenges she faces, tennis has made her focus,” she said.
Born and raised in Kibra, Cheruto started playing tennis while in Standard Four at Shadrack Kimalel Primary School.
Living in a place where lack of food and proper shelter were the order of the day, Osogo said tennis gave Cheruto solace from squalid lifestyle.
It was at Shadrack Kimalel Primary School that she stormed into the world stage.
“I have been carrying out tennis programmes at the school since 2007 and when I saw Cheruto play, I knew at that time she was talented,” she said.
Ariel Okall upbeat of success with Titans in Uganda despite debut loss
Kenya Morans star Ariel Okall is optimistic of succeeding with the Kampala International University(KIU) Titans in the 2021 National Basketball League of Uganda (NBL).
The former Kenya Ports Authority forward signed with the Ugandan university side last week from AlBashaer Basketball Club after suspension of sports in Oman due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Speaking to The Standard Sports from his base in Kampala, Uganda, Okall said he is confident of helping the Ugandan side win trophies.
This is despite a losing debut for the Morans forward whose side went down 56-68 to second placed JKL Dolphins.
“I had a quiet night but I was trying to fit it getting my chemistry with the team. I was just looking to get to my spots and find my rhythm,” said Okall.
Okall scored five points and six rebounds in 24 minutes played with Feisal Aden finishing as Titans leading scorer with 11 points and four rebounds.
“The Ugandan fans welcomed me very well. You can see even on social media the KIU fans have showed me a lot of love. There is no better way of repaying that than helping the team win games and trophies,” said the former US Setif player.
Okall noted that the NBL is tough and more physical. He said majority of the teams have very good players with lucrative contracts, a step the Kenyan league needs to make in the near future.
“There are sponsors, contracts etc. Nevertheless, I believe we are slowly growing and Kenya will get there soon,” he said.
Titans are currently eighth in the NBL standings with three points after the defeat but with two games in hand.
Heavyweights City Oilers lead the standings with eight points

Why Morans new star Bungei chose basketball over athletics
Preston Kiprono Bungei is a true Moran.
The American-Kenyan basketball star debuted for Kenya at the Afrobasket Qualifiers played in Cameroon earlier this year in February.
Bungei was among the 12 players that helped Kenya Morans, the national men’s basketball team, qualify for the 2021 Afrobasket tournament for the first time in 28 years.
Currently playing for Randers Cimbria Basketball in BasketLigaen, the top league in Denmark, Bungei’s is eyeing to win the Danish Cup after helping his team reach the semifinals playoffs of the cup championship where they will face Horsens on Thursday.
The Standard Sports caught up with the Bungei from his base in Denmark through a phone interview where the basketballer whose roots run deep into the Kalenjin athletic regime narrated his story as follows in a question and answer session.
When and where were you born?
I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
I’ve lived there my whole life until I left for university.
I’m the only child from my mother and father’s marriage.
I have two sisters from my mom’s second marriage.
Their names are Grace and Carly.
Grace is 16 and Carly is 14.
Did your parents play any sport?
If yes, which ones and to what level did they reach
Both my parents ran cross-country and track.
They both attended Lubbock Christian University in Texas on running scholarships, which is where they met.
My father was a 4-time individual national champion, and in turn, lead his team to 4 national championships as well.
My father turned professional after graduating from LCU and had a career spanning 10 years from 1995-2005.
He most notably finished in 2nd place in his first-ever marathon at the LA Marathon in 1999 finishing in a time of 2:10:43.
Kenya Morans Forward Preston Bungei (left) in action against Senegal during the Afrobasket Qualifiers.
Which sport did you play growing up?
I ran cross-country (but not track, I quit running track after 8th grade) up until 11th grade.
I also played basketball all 4 years and stopped running cross-country after 11th grade to focus on basketball for my last year of high school
When did you start playing Basketball?
I began playing basketball when I was 5 years old.
Why did you choose Basketball despite other sports? What made you decide to play Basketball?
My mother started me in basketball when I was 5 because most of my family on my mom’s side were basketball players.
My grandfather, Phillip Harmon, played for Kansas University in the 1960’s.
My aunt and uncle also played basketball growing up and in high school.
When I was about 2 or 3 my mom got me a plastic hoop for Christmas and she said I would just stand there and shoot on it all day long.
So she signed me up as soon as I was old enough to start playing in the local youth team.
After high school, how did you progress with Basketball?
After high school, I attended Trinidad State Junior College, in Trinidad Colorado from 2013-2015.
Junior Colleges, are two-year schools so while there I was on a basketball scholarship and earned my associates degree.
After that, I earned a scholarship to Norfolk State University (NCAA Division 1) in Norfolk Virginia.
I played my first season there 2015-2016, but in the fall of my senior season (2016-2017) I injured my elbow which required surgery and I had to miss the whole season.
I came back and played my redshirt senior season in 2017-2018.
During your early stages of playing Basketball, who mentored and trained you?
Kenya Morans Forward Preston Bungei (left) in action for Randers Cimbria against Bakken Bears in the Denmark League.
Growing up, I learned the fundamentals from the various teams that I played on.
The coaches would teach you the basics of passing, dribbling, shooting, etc.
I would also go outside and shoot on my hoop in the drive way and practice different moves that I would see NBA players doing when I would watch the games.
I learned more technical skills in high school.
My coaches did a good job of teaching the principles of having proper foot work, using both hands, dribbling with your eyes up, reading screens, etc.
My mentor and the person I looked up to is Jorel Johnson.
He and his family are close friends as we attend the same church.
Our families have known each other since before I was born.
Jorel is 4 years older than me and I’ve always looked up to him as an older brother.
He was a very good basketball player himself, so he would always help me practice and teach me things about how to be a successful player.
I without a doubt wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for him.
Kindly list some of your personal achievements
What is the most memorable moment in your playing career?
Honestly, representing Kenya and upsetting Angola has been the most memorable moment in my career to date.
To be able to be a part of history and help guide the country back to Afrobasket for the first time in nearly 30 years, there’s nothing else in a career that can top that feeling currently.
What are some of your experiences playing basketball? Lessons learnt?
There are many parallels in basketball, or any sport, and life.
Sports are a powerful tool which can help to teach valuable life lessons in a way that most other things can’t.
For me personally, I’ve learned from basketball about determination, sacrifice, and battling through adversity.
I was ranked as the 17th best player in my senior class in the state of New Mexico, which isn’t known for producing high level basketball talent.
Hardly anyone thought that I was good enough to play in college, and I used that to motivate me to work that much harder and prove them wrong.
I only had one scholarship offer after I finished high school which is how I ended up at Trinidad State Junior College (TSJC).
After my two years at TSJC, I only had one scholarship offer which was to Norfolk State University (NSU).
I was always determined to do what it took to play NCAA Division 1 basketball and God blessed me with that opportunity.
I also learned that you have to be willing to sacrifice certain things to achieve your dreams.
For me, I had to sacrifice time spent hanging out with my friends.
While they were out partying and having fun, I was at the gym working on my craft and getting better.
I had to really narrow down my circle of friends and prioritize my time with the ones who had the same mindset as me.
As far as adversity goes, I had to have a major operation that required 7 months of physical therapy.
Initially, I was having to go 2 times a day 5 days a week so that I could regain the range of motion in my elbow, otherwise, it would’ve been permanently locked up and not straight.
Mentally, going through the recovery process is very hard.
I couldn’t use my dominant arm for everyday tasks and I didn’t know how my shot would be once I finished the rehab process.
It’s also difficult sitting on the sidelines the whole season and watching your team take the floor every night without you.
I had to fight through the physical and mental pain of that injury and rehab process to get back to being the player that I knew I could be.
These are all lessons and experiences that you aren’t able to get from a lot of other sources.
My main goals for the next five years are to begin playing the Australian NBL (top league in Australia), purchase a house, and start a family with my wife.
This year my main focus is on Afrobasket and doing everything I can to help us have a good showing and surprise a lot of people with our performance there.
I also am focused on our World Cup Qualifiers and helping Kenya qualify for its first ever World Cup.
As I stated early my main plan is to play in the Australian NBL and have success there.
Playing in the NBL will allow me to be with my wife for the majority of the year, rather than being separated for 8-9 months while I’m in Europe playing.
Off the court, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places.
I’m pretty simple though and just like to relax and hang out with friends and family when I do have time off.
I currently play in Basket Ligaen, which is the top league in Denmark.
The league is split into two categories, Pro A (which mine and Tylor’s team compete in) and Pro B. The league consists of 10 teams of which the top 8 qualify for playoffs.
My team doesn't compete in any international competitions and only plays games against the teams in Basket Ligaen.
Since I grew up in the States, I didn’t know of any Kenyan basketball players.
My favourite player growing up and of all time was Kobe Bryant, so he is the one that I looked up to.
Jordan to be Bryant's presenter at Hall of Fame enshrinement
Former NBA star Kobe Bryant, CEO of Kobe Inc, speaks at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 3, 2016
Michael Jordan will be Kobe Bryant's presenter when the Los Angeles Lakers great is inducted posthumously into the Basketball Hall of Fame next month.
Bryant, a five-time NBA champion with the Lakers, died last year aged 41 in a helicopter crash alongside his daughter and seven others, shocking the world of sport and sending fans into mourning.
He will be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2020 alongside the likes of Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett on May 15.
Members of the Class of 2020 were asked to select previous inductees to present them to their peers during the ceremony.
Lakers guard Bryant, who idolised Jordan growing up, will be presented by the six-time champion, who made an emotional speech at his memorial.
Jordan, who led the Chicago Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s and currently owns the Charlotte Hornets, will also present Baylor women's basketball coach Kim Mulkey for her enshrinement.
Former Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich and 10-time WNBA All-Star Tamika Catchings are among the other members of the highly anticipated Class of 2020.
Bryant, an 18-time NBA All-Star, retired from the league in 2016 after one of the most decorated careers in basketball history, and is the NBA's fourth all-time leading scorer.
Bungei not ready to drop the ball playing for Kenya Morans
Currently staring for Randers Cimbria in Denmark, Bungei wants to help Kenya qualify for World Cup after the Afrobasket.
There may never be another basketball player as supreme as Michael Jordan.
The argument of who truly deserves the title of ‘Greatest Basketball Player’ is a complicated one, not immune from the interesting nuances of subjectivity.
There will always be those who favour the explosive brilliance of Jordan or the electrifying, self-destructive ingenuity of Kobe Bryant; not to mention the more recent claims staked by the entrancing contemporary works of modern great LeBron James.
Preston Kiprop Bungei may not fall amongst the category of the three great basketball players, but he is a rare kind of an athlete.
Few get the chance to reach a continental final stage in their respective sports in a lifetime, let alone do what he has achieved in his six years as college and professional basketball player.
“I’ve learned so much to do with determination, sacrifice, and battling through adversity,” Bungei told the Standard Sports during an interview from his base in Denmark.
“Very few people thought that I was good enough to play in college, and I used that to motivate me to work harder and prove them wrong.”
Making his debut this year in the national basketball men’s team, Kenya Morans, Bungei said playing for the national team has been his biggest achievement in basketball.
“Kenya is a part of my heritage. It’s my father’s country, where he was born and raised. All of my father’s family members still live in Kapsabet.”
“Kenyans work harder and more determined than any other group of people that I’ve met in basketball especially with the limited facilities. The country is beautiful. Even though I grew up in the US, Kenya feels like my second home,” said Bungei.
Earlier in February, Bungei was among the 12 players who helped Kenya qualify for the 2021 Afrobasket tournament for the first time in 28 years.
His journey to playing for the national team began on a rather bumpy ride after FIBA prevented him from playing because he did not have a permanent Kenyan passport.
Watching the competition from the sidelines, Bungei’s absence from the court was felt as Morans got narrow success in the first round after beating Mozambique 79-62 in their final match after previously losing to Senegal and Angola in Group B.
“I was disappointed after all the preparations and time and then learning you’re not able to play, it hurt,” said Bungei.
But in February, he was handed the opportunity to don the Kenyan colours and despite losing 69-51 to Senegal, Bungei finished the match as Kenya’s best player with 11 points.
He followed his impressive debut performance with another 10 points in Kenya’s historic 74-73 win over Angola, a victory that saw them qualify for the Afrobasket set to be held in Rwanda this year.
“I just can’t describe the feeling. Tylor hitting the game winning shot and us qualifying, is a memory that I’ll carry with me forever,” said Bungei.
“I give credit to this group of players who started this journey to or three years ago, when nobody knew or cared about who the Morans were. And yes, I plan to continue playing for the Morans moving forward for as long as they’ll have me and want me on board.”
The forward player, who currently plays for Randers Cimbria in Denmark, dreams of honouring his father who died in 2011 by helping Kenya win a continental championship.
Bungei, who carries athletic genes from his late father James Bungei, was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1995.
Just like his father, Preston grew up running cross country and track and field. However, all that stopped as he chose to focus more on basketball.
“My mother introduced me to basketball when I was five years old because most of my her relatives were basketball players. When I was about three years, she got me a plastic hoop for Christmas and said I would just stand there and shoot on it all day long,” said Bungei.
Despite falling short of a state championship while he was in high school and college, Bungei started making strides after going professional in 2018.
After a successful stint with Trinidad State Junior College and Norfolk State University which featured in the NCAA Division 1, Bungei joined Jazine Arbanasi in Croatian Prva Liga.
In Croatia, Bungei recorded impressive stats as he averaged 17 points per game.
He was named in the All-Croatian Prva Liga Honorable Mention and won the League Player of the Week four times for the 2018-2019 season.
Why sports ban won’t slow down Kisumu Lakeside’s hunger for success
Kisumu Lakeside Basketball Club is optimistic of performing well in the 2021 Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Men’s Premier League despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which is continuing to disrupt sporting activities across the country.
Last month, the KBF topflight league was suspended temporarily by the Government due to rising cases of COVID-19 in the country, hitting a huge blow to the Kisumu side which had just started building their momentum.
Prior to the halting of the league, Lakeside had played five games losing four against EMYBA, Thunder, Eldonets and KPA.
Their only win came against Ulinzi Warriors, with the Kisumu team shocking the defending champions 61-59, a win Lakeside Secretary General Bria Lusaga believes would have set the momentum heading towards facing other opponents.
Speaking to The Standard Sports, Lusaga, who also doubles as the assistant coach, said they were disappointed by the ‘no sports’ Government order but remain buoyant of achieving success this calendar year.
“The team had picked momentum and was ready to take on the next opponents. Some players had already made job schedules that would allow them honour matches and with the ban, it means their plans have been interfered with and that may affect us when sports resume.”
“The management had also paid for training facility for the year, that would go to waste too. However, we are choosing to remain positive and hopeful for a better year and not a sports-less season that was 2020,” said Lusaga.
Lakeside head coach Dismas Oketch echoed his assistants’ sentiments by saying other teams are lucky because of the temporary suspension of the league otherwise they would have faced a totally different Lakeside team compared to the side that lost four straight games.
“Winning against the defending champs to break our losing streak was big, it's an eye opener that any team is beatable in the league. This would of cause psyched the team heading to our next matches but unfortunately, the league was suspended.”
Being at 1-4, we are maintaining our focus by doing what's been working and improving on our weaknesses. We had used the previous four losses in understanding where our systems were faulty, analysing and rectifying on our mistakes during current practice,” said Oketch, commonly referred to as ‘DC’.
“For the previous seasons it's been a mental kind of thing that winning on the road is something else, but I believe the current team is set to make that perception a thing of the past.”
Lusaga said Oketch, who joined the club during their maiden season win against Ulinzi will be a key figure in turning out Lakeside into a serious basketball force.
“Oketch was an instant hit. He is a long-serving lakeside player who understands the structures of the team. After retiring the management helped facilitate for his coaching course. DC is firm and reads the game well. He is the next big thing in the coaching world,” said Lusaga.
Lakeside signed Ocholla Bryan from KPA, Marko Odhiambo from KU Pirates, Joshua Carter from Barcelona, George Collins, Jayden Simiyu and Allan Kibira seeking to better their last season’s quarterfinals playoffs achievements.
“Joshua Carter is a talented guard standing at 6.2', he is still adjusting to the physicality of the league, he is picking up well and his commitment to training is impressive. He will surely bring us the wins we want,” said Lusaga on their international player who used to play in Spain.
Lusaga added that they have come up with a training program, where the team does morning run to keep fit, individual workouts and online discussions during this temporary suspension of sports.
Kenya Morans star Ongwae voted Danish Cup Defensive Player of the Year
Kenya Morans star Taylor Ongwae is the Danish Defensive Player of the Year.
Ongwae was awarded after an impressive show where he helped his club Bakken Bears win the Danish Cup.
Ongwae scored seven points and had 10 rebounds with an assist to inspire Bakken Bears to the Danish Men’s Cup by beating Horsens 80-82 in the final.
In his third season with the Danish giants, Ongwae has been instrumental for the champions on the defensive end.
Cameroon has made its debut on the global streaming platform Netflix.
The debut saw two movies filmed and produced in the central African country.
The two Cameroonian movies, Therapy and Fisherman's Diary, are now streaming on the American over-the-top content platform and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California.
According to local reports, Ermelinde Simo Sakah Jing produced the movie Therapy, going down in history books as the first Cameroonian film to be aired on Netflix.
The film stars Nigeria's Richard Mofe-Damijo, Ireti Doyle alongside Jing, Alenne Menget, Lucie Memba, Neba Godwill, child actor Kayla Merits.
The Forkwa Babila scripted film follows the story of a dysfunctional couple who enlists an unconventional therapist's services in a bid to resolve their marital woes.
The Cameroonian debut is co-directed by Anurin Nwunembom and Musing Derick, while Anthill studio's Victoria Akujobi is credited as the film's editor.
The Fisherman's Diary by Kang Quintus and Enah Johnscott, which has been one of Cameroon's best movies of 2020, was early this year pre-selected for the 93rd Oscars.
Unfortunately, the film did not make the final cut.
Speaking about the Oscars pre-selection, the Executive Producer of the Film, Kang Quintus, excitedly explained that the opportunity to make it to the Oscars was enough recognition to put the Cameroonian film industry on the global map.
"We are happy to have made history with this film. For us, aside from being a good reward for hard work, this deal grants the opportunity for our content to reach a global audience. Hopefully, this would be the first amongst many, not just for me and the team, but for other Cameroonian filmmakers," Kang Quintus said in a press release.
The movie, The Fisherman's Diary, follows the story of a 12-year-old Ekah (Faith Fidel) who got inspired by Malala Yousalzai, the youngest noble prize winner.
In the film, Ekah is determined to go to school in a fishermen's village where it is considered taboo.
The film features other actors such as Ramsey Nouah, Onyama Laura.
Commenting about this latest achievement for the Cameroonian movie, the film's Executive Producer, Kang Quintus, could not hold back the excitement.
"After making it to the Oscars list, The Fisherman's Diary has now become the 1st Cameroonian Film to be acquired by Netflix. This is big news for the Cameroon Film Industry and a proud moment for all Cameroonians… Many more Cameroon Films to follow," Kang Quintus wrote.
Cameroonians have taken to social media platforms to congratulate the movie producers and for the outstanding achievement.
How the wine tasting event went down at The Local Grill

Did you ever imagine that the world’s most expensive beef, Wagyu, is available locally?
Well, The Local Grill in Village Market and KWAL and Durbanville Hill Collectors Reserves recently treated wine enthusiasts to an evening filled with food and wine, introducing us to some of the most premium wines and of course, good food.
For only Sh6,000 per person, one had the rare chance of enjoying a variety of wines from the South African wine company that crafts wine using the best grapes from Cape Town’s best vineyards, with the evening’s host being wine expert and sommelier Victoria-Mulu Munyoki.
In an evening filled with laughter, we got to talk about life, love and eat the best food available, including chicken mshikaki.
Learning how to tell the flavours of wine just from tasting it and being able to tell which grape was used in making the wine is also key.
Identifying how sweet, dry or acidic wine is also helps in choosing the best bottle of wine.
For the starter, we had grilled Octopus in tropical slaw and Mediterranean relish with a Durbanville Hill Collectors Reserve – ‘The Cableway’ chardonnay 2018, and chicken mishkaki in sugarcane speared chicken thighs with spicy peanut sauce with a glass of Durbanville Hill Collectors Reserve.
For the main course we had Wagyu x Boran short ribs that was slow braised with a red wine infused with a glass of Nederburg ‘The Manor House’ Shiraz 2017.
And I have to say my highlight for the night was a passion and lime sorbet, which was a palate cleanser as we geared up for the second course.
The second main course meal was grass fed fillet 200 grammes with local salad and mixed salts, accompanied with a glass of Durbanville Hills Collectors Reserve ‘The Promade Pinotage’ 2017.
To close the pairing, we dug into a raspberry panna cotta dessert with a glass of Durbanville Hills Collectors Reserve ‘The Lighthouse’ Merlot 2017.
Kisumu's 63-year-old Ofafa estate set for Sh3 billion facelift
The 63-year-old Anderson Ofafa Estate in Kisumu will undergo a Sh3 billion facelift thanks to the County Pension Fund and Laptrust Fund.
The county authorities have embarked on a two-year low-cost housing project to give the estate a new look befitting Kisumu city status.
On Wednesday, Governor Anyang' Nyong'o laid the foundation stone for the houses of retirees from the defunct Kisumu Municipality.
Some tenants have lived in the houses for more than 20 years and were paying as low as Sh4,000 for a one-bedroom or two-bedroom house.
But now, the houses, which they have lived in for years, are set for an upgrade with a vision to make them homeowners in the noble low-cost affordable housing project mooted by President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Kenya’s Affordable Housing Programme (AHP) was launched in December 2017 by President Kenyatta as one of the national government’s four pillars of growth.
The Kisumu Housing Project comes at a time when the city's bulging population is continuing to pile pressure on housing demand amid an acute shortage of low-cost houses.
Currently, demand for housing, according to the County Lands and Housing Executive Dickson Obungu is 250,000 annually against a supply of 50,000 as the city grows.
Currently, the proportion of the urban population in Kisumu has risen from 482,327 in 1979 to 664,086 in 1989 to 804,289 in 2009 968,909 persons with 474,687 males and 494,222 females.
The county's population stands at 1,155,574 as per last year's census.
Acting city manager Abala Wanga envisages Kisumu population will double in next 20 years.
Nyong'o said the growing population has necessitated fresh spatial planning. "So we have to look at the distribution of people and activities in urban areas and towns to improve their housing, economic and social environments," Prof Nyong'o said.
Laptrust CEO Hosea Kili released a cheque of Sh76,000 each and an additional Sh100,000 to facilitate the relocation of the affected 1,200 families.
The Andersen Ofafa Estate was home to 246 families staying in 39 blocks.
Each family was paid a year's rent based on a mutual agreement with CPF and LapTrust.
The former tenants will be given priority on buying the new modern housing units.
According to the project's architect Peter Wasilwa, each of the one-bedroom houses will be offered to the former tenants at an affordable cost of Sh1.5 million.
The tenants will have 10 years to offset Sh1.5 million for the one-bedroom houses, paying Sh12,500 monthly.
The two-bedroom houses will go for Sh2.5 million, while a three-bedroom house cost Sh3.5 million.
Non-tenants will part with Sh1 million more for the units.
Kisumu is the third-largest city in Kenya after Nairobi and Mombasa and is in Lake Victoria Basin Commission headquarters for East African countries.
Why today’s Kalasha gala is an awards show like no other
It is all systems go for this year’s Kalasha International Film and TV awards that will be held in Nairobi today.
Timothy Owase, the Kenya Film Commission CEO promises a major show in the annual event that seeks to celebrate the crème de la crème of the local movie industry.
Some of the films that are favourites include Sincerely Daisy, Family Meeting, Midlife Crisis, 40 Sticks and Uradi.
While Sincerely Daisy has 13 nominations, Family Meeting, 40 Sticks and Midlife Crisis have 12 each while Uradi has nine.
Now, in its 10th year, the event will also serve as a platform for showcasing some of the best TV shows and children’s productions.
The event will be attended by Joe Mucheru, the Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology Cabinet Secretary.
“From our research, there has been a growing need for content for children on our screens and as a result, the commission introduced the Best Children Production category to acknowledge those who have developed concepts to accommodate our young ones as screen audiences,” Owase said.
Maisha Magic’s Pete, Majuto, Kovi and Selina series have been nominated in Best TV Drama category while their lead actors/actresses have also been nominated for their roles.
The awards ceremony at Sarit Centre will feature a few guests in line with Ministry of Health guidelines on social distancing.
KFC has partnered with StarTimes, which is the official platform where nominated films had been uploaded for voting and viewing.
The films and actors in Sincerely Daisy, Family Meeting, Midlife Crisis, 40 Sticks have all landed in notable slots namely Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Design, Best Director, Best Lead Actress and Best Lead Actor.
The awards are being held at a time when the local film industry is showing signs of growth and recovery.
This year, a number of local films and TV drama shows have found their way to Netflix with KFC making deliberate efforts to promote film production.
The awards gala is being held at a time when focus is on the Kenya Film Bill 2020 that seeks to consolidate the legislative framework of laws relating to the film industry and to provide for the development, funding and regulation of the industry.
“For long, artistes have been complaining about being underpaid, poor working conditions and policies. In response, we are coming up with new guidelines to achieve the full potential, development and growth of the local talent,” Owase said. He added that, through its parent Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs, KFC is championing a National Screen policy that will streamline funding, incentives, investment and capacity development.
He noted that a film-friendly production environment will involve a shared, positive view of the industry across a range of different government departments, agencies and other entities.
The Labour Statistics for Film and Related activities data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics 2020 economic surveys indicated that about 123,290 jobs existed directly in the film industry in 2018 with a 5.3 per cent increase recorded last year.
According to the PWC analysis of trends shaping the entertainment and media industry in Africa – released last year – the total cinema revenue in Kenya is set to reach US$8.6 million (about Sh860 million) by 2023, up from US$6.2 million (about Sh620 million) in 2018, as production activity peaks for both feature films and TV drama.
While Nigeria remains Africa’s film giant, Kenya has been tipped to join the continent’s major film countries in which is South Africa and Ghana.
Jamhuri Day fever- Must attend weekend events
It is the festive season and a number of feelgood events are on cue this weekend to help you make the most of the coming holiday celebrations.

Alternate Sound, a fused four-man band boasting unique musical expressions, will be bringing African magic at the Just a Vibe event in Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi.
Beloved Kenyan boy band Sauti Sol will be host to Sol Saturday - a limited tickets event - at the Karen Waterfront which will feature must listen to special guests. Former Camp Mulla artist Miss Karun will at the Rebel Room for throbbing Afro Soul vibes alongside fast-rising songstress Xenia Manasseh and Nigerian singer Tems.
Golden Ice Bistro will be having a special Jamhuri Eve hosted by Jay Ranking with DJ Kronixx behind the decks. Rapper Kahush, the son of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe, will be performing live at Clique Lounge in a must-attend event dubbed ‘Wanted in Nairobi’ which will also double as his album launch and listening party.
254 Brewery will host some of the finest people in the contemporary music space such as Big Bear, Mix Master Lenny and Marcelo Cura for Kenyan Nights’ 11th edition in another limited capacity event.
The events industry has borne the brunt of the implications of Covid-19 to a very large extent this year.
Typically one of the most lucrative industries when all factors are constant, this year has seen the demise of many money-making channels for many a stakeholder for months on end now.
As we edge closer to the end of this rather turbulent year, it also looks like organizers are buoyed to slowly bring back the events lifeline slowly by slowly.
Except it is also not as easy as it sounds.
A few weeks ago, the annually controversial NaiFest went down and so much flack has been meted out against them after.
Questions have been asked as regards whether it is the right time to bring back showbiz or humanity should be prioritized over profits.
Are there many event organizers willing to care less for the money and more for the lives of the human race?
That is the million-dollar question amid the current events temperature.
Last weekend saw the last-minute cancellation of the much-awaited Mugithi in the Wild, a move that many arguably did not see coming.
“It is with sincere regret that I formally inform you that, after due consideration of our current circumstances, KWS management has come to the decision to stop the planned Mugithi in the Wild event. We apologize for the inconvenience caused,’’ read a part of the statement put out by Lekishon Kenana, an official at Kenya Wildlife Service South Conservation Area division.
The much-hyped event was slated for November 21 and had big headliners like Samidoh, Jose Gatutura and Kareh B, with ticket prices going for as high as Ksh10,000.
“It was devastating, to say the very least. A culmination of so many days of intense work with preparation went to the drains. It was not easy. Somewhat miraculously, people were very understanding and did not give us hell. So many people agreed that it was not our fault and had our backs. That was a really good feeling,’’ adds Shem, one of the key organizers of Mugithi in the Wild.
‘’The email from Kenya Wildlife Service was sent at 12am. Typically, no one really logs in to email at that hour. So, we only got to see the email at 8am in the morning. The shock that hit us is inexplicable. We had spent the previous night on final touches of the set, so the last-minute directive hit us rather hard. Nonetheless, we choose to focus on the bright side of things. We are already planning on a possible rescheduling and gearing up for another event, Reggae in the Wild, already. We are not slowing down anytime soon, ‘’ affirms Shem, who also doubles as a renowned corporate DJ.
What about the safety and wellness of Kenyans?
‘’We had planned on handing out face masks and hand sanitizer to every single reveller who was coming to the event. We also had a great sitting arrangement that entailed haystacks, strategically placed within intervals of 1.5 metres, as per the health ministry’s social distancing directive. When it comes to security, the location is synonymous with that. It was beefed up to the core. We were not about to make the same mistakes as others, ‘’ he boldly confirms.
Going by Shem’s statement, Mugithi in the Wild was bound to be a huge success.
He insists that the rescheduled event will be even bigger and better, and with all Covid19 rules adhered to.
Enter Thrift Social, which earlier in the month was postponed - the much-awaited gig headlined by award-winning South African singer and songwriter, Samthing Soweto will be going down this Sunday.
This will be the first-ever post-Covid-19 edition, and suffice to say that many eyes are on them.
Critics are all up in arms in case the event fails to live up to the required health restrictions.
Being their first-ever post-virus to gig, what are they going to do differently?
‘’I do not want to dwell on that, seeing as my words could easily be twisted. I want to be very careful. As a matter of fact, I’d rather remain tight-lipped on any banter pertaining to Covid-19 restrictions and the event,’’ said a somewhat discreet Oliver, one of the key organizers of Thrift Social.
As to how the event will pan out on Sunday, we will have to wait and see.
Meanwhile, questions abound on what the legal atmosphere hitherto looks like.
What will befall those find themselves on the short end of the stick?
The Public Health Rules 2020 impose a penalty of either a fine of up to KSh20,000, imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both, for contravening the measures set out in public places: places to wash hands, social distancing and enforcement of wearing of masks and regular sanitization of the premises.
This is stipulated under Rule 6.
As for revellers who contract the disease because they visited a public place or attended an event, this would be a caveat emptor situation.
The consumer is responsible for their actions and they cannot transfer this liability to the owner of the establishment.
‘’ Looking at the mysterious nature of the disease, that may be hard to prove as its still a medical discover the Public Health Rules 2020 impose a penalty of either a fine of up to KSh20,000, imprisonment for a period of up to six months, or both, for contravening the measures set out in public places: places to wash hands, social distancing and enforcement of wearing of masks and regular sanitization of the premises. This is stipulated under Rule 6, ‘’ informs Liz Lenjo, founder and Managing Consultant of MYIP Legal Studio. She specialises in Intellectual Property, Entertainment, Media and Fashion Law.
‘’Since March, the situation has changed. With the Government imposed restrictions the playing field can be anticipated. Now, events are being held under these guidelines. Some event managers and establishments are following these rules while some are flaunting them. The enforcement of these rules is rather wanting as there are instances it may be construed to be selective. That said, there is a rise in exclusive events and people seem ready and willing to pay premium. Perhaps owing to the eagerness to escape the boredom of staying at home, ‘’ she concludes.
Recently, rapper and events guru Muthoni the Drummer Queen caused a storm on social media after she blasted errant event organizers whose sole intention has been making many with negligent regard to people’s wellbeing.
Her words were echoed by fellow showbiz bigwig Reign Mwendwa who said that putting events on hold right now is the most prudent thing to do.
With the festivities edging closer by the day, one cannot help but wonder what we’ll wake to come the New Year.
However, it is more than evident for all and sundry that the dilemma to bring back events or have humanity on the top of organizers’ priority lists is a struggle that cannot be understated.
Does the end justify the means?
How club owners are maximizing on profits despite pandemic
There were mixed reactions after a video released by musician Muthoni the Drummer blasting her fellow event organisers in the entertainment industry who ignored the soaring numbers of the Covid-19 cases and went ahead to host gigs.
“It is extremely reckless. I’m ashamed of you. You know yourselves,” she ranted.
Muthoni’s concerns seemed to have fallen on deaf ears with showbiz activities, which had been crippled for the better part of this year, going on uninterrupted in various entertainment spots throughout the country with little concern if any.
The sad part is Kenyans will have to shoulder their own expenses.
Vineyard - The recently refurbished entertainment spot on Kiambu recently launched its Reggae Meets Live Music Night, which will feature a deejay with lapses involving various bands performing in between the intervals.
The host, Deejay Double Trouble was hosting Graviti Band, Band Linda and was assisted on the decks by Steve Junior, Deejay Prince while MC Philipo put his hype skills to work.
With revellers catching up after the disappointing Harambee Stars versus Comoros game, word soon went round that a police lorry had been spotted sending everyone into a panic.
Kitengela - It’s the new entertainment hub in Athi River with numerous clubs, piled on the same stretch try their best to outshine each other.
Such was the case last Sunday afternoon, with the two households clubs Pavillion and Halcyon playing a you can’t beat me game.
Revellers came from as far as Nairobi just to have some fun.
Pavilion - It was a mega party showdown featuring some of the biggest names in the game.
Hosted by SpinCycle entertainment deejay Mr T alongside MC Jose ushered Mejja whose hits are currently topping the charts with spinmaster Joe Mfalme on the ones and twos.
Just from the parking lot, it was evident that the event was sold out.
According to MC Jose, body temperature test were conducted and “despite the huge turnout, we occasionally reminded revellers about the need to observing the health regulations like social distancing,” he said.
Just a few metres, Kriss Darlin’s unit Dohty Family, was entertaining yet another full house during their weekly Reggae Sundays.
This is the third consecutive month and we are still strictly adhering to health precautions.
We encourage our clients to start with the afternoon brunch and are shut by 8pm,” said the club’s entertainment manager.
The Outdoor - In an outdoor event at the Carnivore themed park and chill where revellers got entertained in the comfort of their cars.
The Outdoor, which has constantly gained popularity was a success with various revellers seemingly because of the minimal contact as most prefer to sit in their cars.
The massive club along Mombasa road, The Tunnel, wasn’t left behind either and after hosting DJ Malaika, Saturday night was the ultimate battle of the siblings as DJ Nick Dee took on his younger brother DJ Moh in the Takeover themed night.
Sincerely Daisy, 40 Sticks lead in 2020 Kalasha Awards nominations
Only a month after it premiered on Netflix, Sincerely Daisy has emerged as the movie to beat during this year’s Kalasha International Film and TV Awards whose nominees have been unveiled.
With 13 nominations in the 16 main Film categories, the film, an urban story about family, young love, timeless friendships and the reality of tough economic times leads in a list dominated by the biggest Kenyan films released in the recent past.
The top four will battle it out in the ceremony’s traditional prestigious slots; Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Design, Best Director, Best Editor, Best Lead Actress in a Film, Best Lead Actor in a Film and Best Production Design.
Other nominees have everything to celebrate for having made it to the lean list from a whopping 1,036 entries submitted this year.
Coming on the heels of Sincerely Daisy is Family Meeting, Midlife Crisis and 40 Sticks all with 12 nominations each, while Uradi has nine.
It is a re-match of some of the biggest names that have dominated the winners' scorecard in the past such as Sarah Hassan and Nick Mutuma, newcomers have made a statement with a significant number of nominations.
While Sincerely Daisy’s new acts got them recognised, 40 Sticks has an assortment of fresh talents in film production such as Enos Olik and Lucas Bikedo, both famous for music production.
The Kalasha Commission also introduced the Best Children category to fill in the gap of the growing need for children content.
“From our Audience Development Strategy research, there has been a growing need for children content on our screens and as a result, the Commission introduced the Best Children Production category to acknowledge the producers who have developed concepts to accommodate our children as screen audiences,” said the Kenya Film Commission CEO, Timothy Owase.
“At the beginning of this year, it seemed as though Covid-19 would halt production and affect content creation altogether. However, our TV shows are on the rise and Kenyan films are being premiered on global platforms,” Owase remarked as he stressed the resilience of Kenyan filmmakers who have continued to make huge strides in these trying times.
“This year, the stories are more authentic and relatable and filmmakers are pushing the boundaries of creativity”, stated James Kanja, the Kalasha nine-member jury chairperson.
Maisha Magic’s Pete, Majuto, Kovu and Selina dominated the Best TV Drama, Best Lead Actress in a TV Drama and Best Lead Actor in a TV Drama.
Popular TV drama show Maria got three nominations.

How things fell apart for three Kenyan concerts this past weekend
Ahealthy amount of financial mismanagement, poor security, artists mishandled, underage attendance - this concoction is what besieged Nai Fest this past weekend.
A number of artists who were scheduled to perform did not take to stage, including Reekado Banks, who was set to headline the event.
And while socialite and event organiser, Bridget Achieng came out to blame the Government and curfew regulations, narrating in a post “The Government stopped the music, the main artiste (Reekado) could not perform, but revellers were happy."
"It was past curfew the rules have to be followed,” Reekado’s team told another tale.
“The contract agreement was that Reekado was to be paid the remaining balance of his performance fee once he arrived in the country. The organiser was supposed to pay the remaining amount Sh540,000 on Saturday morning before Reekado would take to the stage later in the day,” a member of Reekado Banks’ management team, who sought anonymity, revealed.
Reports that an attendee died following injuries from Nai Fest during the weekend after a confrontation in unclear circumstances, is the boiling point of poor security measures to control an event.
A patient is said to have been brought in at Melchizedek Hospital along Ngong Road by a group of boys who later fled.
With 3,800 tickets sold according to a Nai Fest management crew, the later reported number of 7,000 plus turn-out was remarkable, but over half the ticket sale ratio made into the venue.
Multiple cases of day-light theft, rape, and underage being allowed into the party have overshadowed the event’s turn-out success.
“Even though I’m proud that the gig could do such numbers, it’s fair to say that it was poorly handled, and there was a lack of professionalism.” Caesar Obare, a member of the organising committee said to Pulse.
Forget professionalism, basic decorum, respect and diligence was so costly.
Too many cases of battery, assault and attempted robbery took the shine of stellar performances.
More incidents took the air out of the room but party-goers continued to enjoy themselves amidst the chaos.
“I got robbed at NaiFest” quickly became a trend after influencer Shaq The Yungin opened the can of worms that then spewed on to many others sharing their experiences at the day time brunch gig.
“You should be walking with a gang”, “You should buy a Glock”, “Sorry Shaq, Nairobi is crazy”, were the sentiments as friends and fans consoled with the embarrassed personality.
We were literally entering a den of thieves.
After the first Nai Fest, we thought they would have addressed the issues of the first edition, but we were wrong.
At a point, it felt like we were fighting for our lives.
We went to a certain terrace that could oversee the event and you could just see the number of people who weren’t there to enjoy themselves, an anonymous attendee told Pulse.
In a graphic video uploaded to Instagram, radio presenter Shaquille Oduk was bruised and battered explaining his ordeal of being ambushed as he was leaving the event.
He lost his iPhone during the incident.
The lack of readily-available transport was a major issue leaving the crowd stranded and vulnerable.
It was a thief’s heaven and that’s exactly what it turned out to be.
“There was security hired, police did a sweep before the event, a partnership with Matter Hospital, but I think the organisation could do a better job at managing the events more thoroughly and ensure people’s safety,” Obare told Pulse.
Gengetone Festival in Machakos caused an outburst from the performers due to non-payments and multiple no-shows.
Complaints from artists made more headlines than the attempt at bringing together folks for a common good.
First, it was Ex-ray of Boondocks Gang who led the rant-fest that acts could barely even make it to the event with basic riders not offered for performers.
“Respect artists.” He said in a long video.
The Gengetone act went on to apologize to fans that purchased tickets to watch them live, stating that he needed the cash to provide a livelihood for him and his family.
Willis Raburu who was touted to be among organisers and made an appearance, and would later distance himself from the horror show.
According to him, artists were cheated and outstanding balances are the reason as to why the event that stacked a line-up of Jua Cali, Mbogi Genje, VDJ Jones and many others to perform failed.
Furthermore, Kikwetu and Nai Fest have been poorly exposed for their ‘influencer-marketing strategy’ to sell tickets.
The idea that influencers are crowd pullers is a myth.
Kikwetu was fashioned to pull huge crowds, but it was false hype in reality despite artists’ dedication to put on a show.
Out of the many cars in the Drive-Inn concert, a quarter were complimentary tickets and this was again the case intimated that over 500 influencers were hired to promote Nai Fest and a high number of attendants had tickets handed out to them by organisers and influencers.
Pseudo posters promoting artists that would not come such as Migos were also employed.
Tanasha Donna’s management tells Pulse she pulled out a day before the gig because, despite her performance fee of Sh350,000 being discounted by Sh100,000, the organisers could not afford to pay her to use her image to promote the event.
“Tanasha had fans from Kisumu, Nakuru, Coast and all over pull through just to see her and then the Nai Fest guys pull a shady move last minute saying they do not have even a deposit. She had agreed to perform with half the figure, and get paid later with a contractual agreement to seal the same, but it wasn’t to be after Bridget shortchanged this.” The La Vie singer’s management told Pulse.
Other artists that are said not to have performed including Sailors who quote a Sh350,000 tag to perform also backed out after being snubbed at the last minute.
While artists such as Boutross, Khaligraph Jones, and Otile Brown said to have gigged were paid the full amount.
The same bouncers hired to maintain order and a free-flowing event then became violent as things flared up backstage.
It’s no secret that an event doesn’t always go flawlessly perfect, Nai Fest 2 was however further desolated when it was reported that a female in rapper Gwaash’s entourage was harassed and beaten by security despite having a pass.
Influencers associated with the event such as Fred Omondi responded harshly to backlash at the event’s incompetence with a now-deleted Instagram post.
He reiterated that it was the best event and the fans got premium value paying Sh2,000 for local acts rather than headliner Reekado.
After the atrocious mishap that was Gengetone Festival the weekend prior, this was a moment of redemption for the events sector in particular but it now hangs in the balance after things transpired the way they did.
The event is planning a follow-up edition on a reported date of December 12th.
Tanasha’s management, however, says they would not be interested in getting into business again.
On top of that health security is a major concern according to fans that have been privy to these events.
There is food, music, lights, everything, but masks and sanitization points.
"Corona lives in these events, and it’s hard to imagine how they market it as no mask, no entry yet no one gives a hoot on the grounds,” said a reveller Simon at Kikwetu.
Additionally, propaganda that Mo Sound went ahead and cut off the sound at Kikwetu, and that guys never even wanted to travel out of town for an event at Gengetone Fest because of Curfew regulations are some of the drama in these shows.
Artists are short of stage-time in line with Covid-19 government protocol so the idea that you will get a fully-fledged show is something to consider when attending these concerts.
The manner in which Nai Fest brand will reconcile the damage and losses to the affected will be a light step towards how serious showbiz events in Kenya can be judged.
This weekend, Thrift Social featuring Amapiano and Kwaito artist Samthing Soweto, will have to carry the events sector and prove Covid physical outdoor concerts can be pulled off Safe
Spectacular night show returns to illuminate sky above Fort Jesus
The Mombasa night sky above Fort Jesus Museum exploded in a blaze of colour on Wednesday following the reintroduction of a spectacular pyrotechnics event.
A huge 270-kg firework display by Jay Pyrotechnics Ltd illuminated the dark skies and signaled the launch of the Fort Jesus Enchanting Sound and Light Multimedia Show.
Pyrotechnics MD Jayshree Suchack said the 40-minute shows, which includes 3D projection mapping and holograms that depict Mombasa's rich history, will be held on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
Sports and Culture Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed led Mombasa residents and guests from the hospitality industry in unveiling the show.
"We are delighted to be gathered at this historic fort to witness the launch of yet another milestone that serves not only to create awareness on culture and heritage, but also reposition Mombasa as a popular tourist destination," said Dr Amina.
Kenya Tourism Federation chairman Mohamed Hersi said: "We are happy that we have something positive in this crisis over and above beach and bush."
Coast Guard destroys Sh. 4 million illegal fishing gears in Kisumu
The Kenya Coast Guard Service (KCGS) on Friday destroyed illegal fishing gears worth Sh. 4 million in Kisumu.
The illegal fishing gears were detained through enforcement patrols within Lake Victoria to curb indiscriminate fishing which has seen fish production in the lake drop.
The 45 illegal nets ranging from monofilament, undersize gillnets, mosquito seine nets and beach were torched at Kisumu pier to deter fishermen from the vice.
KCGS Director General (DG) Brigadier Loonena Naisho who spearheaded the exercise said over 100 offenders have been arrested in Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay counties and will be arraigned in court and charged.
He said KCGS has enhanced patrols within the lake to enforce the law and ensure that prohibited fishing gears and methods are not exacerbated.
“Reports indicate that overfishing by organized crime syndicates in Lake Victoria could drive 76 percent of fish species to extinction,” he said.
The use of illegal fishing gears, he added was also to blame for cases of fishermen being harassed by neighboring security agencies.
The DG called for collaboration with Beach Management Units (BMU) and court officials to eradicate illegal fishing in the lake.
Loonena cautioned the BMU’s against destruction of boats and fishing gears of others without following due process of the law.
“We have noticed criminal activities where some beach management units take the law unto themselves by destroying boats and nets of others,” he said.
He challenged the BMU’s to sensitize fishermen on changing and adapting sustainable modes of fishing to rebuild fish stocks in the lake.
Raila in Kisumu ahead of Madaraka Day
ODM party leader Raila Odinga is in charm offensive in the lakeside city of Kisumu ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to celebrate Madaraka Day.

MOTHERS, NEWS BORNS DETAINED OVER HOSPITAL BILLS
Over ten mothers and their newly born babies have been detained by St. Akidiva Hospital, in Suna West sub-county of Migori over failure to pay medical bills.
The mothers include two whose newly born babies died in the facility said clarity on reference was not availed as they were referred from other facilities whose workers are on strike or overpopulated yet their Linda Mama and NHIF were rejected.

They claimed that their bills had accumulated yet they still have a balance.
According to the hospital’s director Dr. Idagiza Akidiva, they received a circular from NHIF offices not to discharge any patient urging the government to sort out technicalities so that they have smooth operation and patients are released.
Prepare for another political betrayal, Kuria West Mp Robi
As the window for political realignments narrows ahead of the 2022 general elections, bigger political parties are positioning themselves for the big seat, yet to be declared vacant after president Uhuru Kenyatta retires from politics.
The Jubilee Alliance affiliate party United Democratic Alliance (UDA) staunch supporters are however at cross roads, not knowing which side to throw their wait after their exit from the umbrella party.
UDA’s Mathias Robby of Kuria West has however cautioned ODM party of a looming political betrayal, which he claimed is in the offing.
Mathias said the opposition chief Raila Odinga should stay woke following his previous experience and make valid choices if he expects to win the presidential seat.
The legislator while speaking at a burial within his constituency said the recent court ruling that declared the Constitution Amendment Bill (2020) null and void should be awake up call to Raila.
As Minority groups, he added, their interests were not captured in the document despite Uhuru and Raila vouching for it.
Mathias added that Raila should forget about any political endorsement or support from Mount Kenya region but should instead work towards gaining support from minority communities.
Migori senator ,Ochilo Ayako while speaking at the same function, said that of importance to electorates at the moment is service delivery.
Ayacko took issue with the I’ll fated Migori Governor Okoth Obado , whom he accused of advancing his political agenda and abdicating his other responsibilities.
Sexual Gender Based Violence on the rise in Nyakach
Residents of Nyakach in Kisumu County are questioning the existence of a gang that has continued to rape and defile locals at will.
Horrific stories of the gang atrocities have been told over time and security authorities, according to victims have failed to act on information shared.
A non-state actor, Inuka Success Organization has been in the forefront to document cases of sexual gender based violence in the sub county.
The organization coordinator, Victon Onyango, says they are a member organization of the Sexual Gender Based Alliance Kisumu County tasked with the responsibility to coordinate assistance to the survivors.
Onyango explains that during the documentation of the SGB violence in the area, it has come to their attention that the stories of the perpetrators are almost similar, an indication that it is a roaming gang.
“It looks like a coordinated rape scenario, because we find similar cases happening same night, where people, two or three breaking into houses, they have same apparatus, torch knife,” he said.
A resident, Jared Ochieng, not his real name, due to the sensitivity of the case, narrates how the gang breaks into the house where his daughters were sleeping and in turn defiled them.
“My daughters woke me at 2 am to report that some people gained entry into their sleeping room and defiled them,” he said.
Ochieng says he sought medical attention for his three daughters before pursuing justice.
His case is among many in the area where rapes, defilements are order of the day and night with no action being taken.
Ochieng noted that her daughters had recognized the voice of one of the perpetrators and police were given the information but little has been done.
“We did report to the police about one of the suspects who is a local, however, we were told to inform the police whenever we spotted the suspect, that sounds crazy,” says Ochieng.
For the cases that find their way into the courts, they get frustrated as suspects walk scot free after placing bonds and fines.
Onyango says they have followed a number of cases, some stuck in courts, but their ultimate goal is to ensure justice is served.
“We just make sure that justice to the survivors is achieved, we also trace cases that have stalled and see why and the reasons behind the delay,” he said.
The organization has conducted a number of awareness creations among the public on the need to report cases of sexual gender based violence.
“Most of the cases that we have been able to get currently are as a result of the conversations we have had in the community,” he said.
The conversations have also targeted police officers and administrators in the community.
“Cases have been reported but surprisingly nobody follows these cases after they happened, they are reported and end that way,” said Onyango.
Kisumu Medical and Education Trust, (KMET) an indigenous Kisumu based non-governmental organization established to promote quality health and education services across the country has so far since March this year documented six cases of gender based violence within a village in Nyakach.
Patricia Orao, KMET advocate in policy lead gender justice project says that in collaboration with Equality Now, they are determined to see the six cases go through the judicial process.
“We are taking police officers through capacity building in investigations because what happens if the investigation is shoddy, such cases always collapse,” she says
Orao says the officers are being strengthened on documentations of evidence to be able to take to court water tight cases as a way of discouraging sexual gender based violence cases.
A local chief, Elizabeth Achieng representing Agoro location, the epicenter of sexual gender based violence, says from October last year, the area has recorded a number of cases on gang rapes and defilements.
Achieng says she had made emphasis during her routine public meetings that cases of defilement and rape should be reported immediately after seeking medical attention.
“I normally tell my people to report such cases to the authorities after the victims are taken to the hospitals for medication,” she says.
Locals in Nyabondo protest over poor health services.
Locals in Nyakach, Kisumu County, have staged a demonstration over poor health services at Nyabondo Mission Hospital.
Carrying placards and twigs, the locals stormed the mission hospital alleging that the management had run down the medical facility.
Levy Hawi, a local, says the management of the hospital has deteriorated over time and it is time to fix the mess.
He says some officers have been looting the hospital without any shame at the expense of the sufferings of patients.
Hawi says patients are going without proper food despite being billed and the conditions of the wards are wanting.
Speaking after failing to get an audience with the management at Nyabondo, Hawi says staff at the hospital are ready to work but the management is not ready to avail the required tools.
He noted that most of the medical facilities are being bought from outside the hospital at the cost of the patients.
Hawi says more often patients have failed to get treated due to lack of essential medical facilities.
The locals are calling for an overhaul of the management and a proper vetting of new management with capabilities to run the facility.
None of the management team was at the hospital when the locals stormed in to register their displeasure.
Nyabondo Medical Training College Principal Juma who was also mentioned as those behind the failing of health standards in the facility dismissed the allegations.
Juma says clan politics is at play and they will continue to discharge their duties as required despite the noise.
Kolwa Central ward in partnership with a Non Governmental Organization has launched a program targeting youth for enrolment at a vocational training.
The area MCA George Olwal says the program will benefit young people who are out of school.
Olwal says the program will be run by Akado Youth Polytechnic and will target youths between the ages of 18 to 35.
He says more emphasis will be given to girls noting that those who will be selected will be given a monthly stipend.
Speaking to the press in his ward, Olwal called upon the youth who have completed class eight or form four to step out and apply for the short courses.
James Misanze, the facilitator of the organization, community progress youth empowerment institute says they are given hope to young people.
Misenze says some youth dropped out of school may be due to school fees and the program is coming to support them.
He says the three courses they are offering will give the young people an opportunity to look for jobs elsewhere or start off their businesses.
Kenya reports progress in saving the northern white rhino with four new embryos produced
Kenya announced Thursday that four new northern white rhino embryos had been produced as efforts to rescue the iconic giant land mammal from extinction gathered momentum.
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and a consortium of international scientists said the embryos were produced in March from 19 immature eggs (oocytes) that were harvested from one of the only two surviving female northern white rhino called Fatu.
“We are excited with the laboratory outcome of the last ovum pick-up in March,” said Najib Balala, Kenya’s cabinet secretary for Tourism and Wildlife, in a joint statement issued in Nairobi. “With nine pure northern white rhino embryos now developed, the partners in the project should embark on the next phase of the project-embryo transfer to the surrogate southern white females at Ol-Pejeta conservancy.”
Kenya has partnered with an international consortium of scientists, conservationists to help produce the next generation of northern white rhino through assisted reproduction technologies.
The harvesting of immature eggs from the two surviving female northern white rhinos and artificially inseminating them using sperm frozen from deceased male counterparts has been ongoing since 2019 at Ol Pejeta Conservancy based in northwestern Kenyan county of Laikipia.
KWS said that 14 out of the 19 immature eggs that were harvested from Fatu on March 28 produced four viable embryos after they were fertilized with thawed sperm from a deceased northern white rhino bull called Suni.
The four embryos are now stored in liquid nitrogen alongside the five ones that were created during earlier procedures as they await transfer to surrogate mothers to help produce new northern white rhino offspring.
Another milestone achieved in the rescue of northern white rhino was sterilization of a southern white rhino bull called Owuan in December 2020 to pave way for its role in helping determine the reproductive cycle of potential surrogate mothers without impregnating them.
KWS said that Owuan will be introduced to the southern white rhino females in the coming weeks to facilitate seamless transfer of embryos and produce new northern white rhino offspring.
“We are eager to get the progeny from the project that will guarantee survival of the species,” said Balala.
Nyanza police office to Strictly enforce Covid-19 protocols
Security agencies in the Nyanza region have been directed to enforce Covid-19 protocols and bring to book those found flouting the regulations.
Nyanza Regional Commissioner Magu Mutindika has singled out bars, Public Service Vehicles (PSV) and churches as hot spots for the spread of the virus as the country faces a third wave of Covid-19.
He has directed County commissioners, Deputy County commissioners, chiefs, the police and County enforcement officers to carry out a joint crackdown and arrest those flouting the rules.
Speaking to the media in Kisumu at a joint press briefing with Kisumu Governor Prof. Peter Anyang Nyong’o, Mr. Mutindika said the County government will revoke licences of bars breaking the regulations.
“We have realized that some bars close doors at 9.00 pm as required but still continue selling beer to revelers locked inside,” he revealed.
“This is a warning that this will not be tolerated and we have agreed that the County government who are the liquor licensing authority to cancel their licenses for ever,” he added.
The Regional commissioner, who was flanked by the Nyanza region and Kisumu County security teams criticized some people who are peddling lies about the covid-19 vaccine, saying the vaccine has been scientifically proven to be effective to boost body immunity and has no side effects,
Governor Nyong’o said the county government has rolled out several vaccination drives across the county for high risk populations and frontline workers.
“The health department has expanded vaccination centres at Kombewa, Ahero, Nyakach county referrals hospitals among others to ensure success of the drive,” he added.
The governor has however said the uptake of the vaccine amongst healthcare workers was lackluster, which was delaying commencement of other identified high risk populations.
“The positivity rate in Kisumu has risen from 2.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent in the past week, which translates to a 100 per cent rise in the said period.
‘During the briefing, Governor Nyong’o outlined stringent containment measures that require that all morgues not to preserve bodies for a period exceeding 72 hours and not to release any body after 10.00am
There shall be no night vigil in the homes of the deceased, maximum attendees to remain at 100 persons only and that all restaurants and bars adhere to covid-19 protocols and close 9.00pm among other protocols and other regulations.
County KNUT wants Sossion out as Sec Gen ahead of national polls, back rival
The Migori county Kenya National Union of Teachers council have joined a lineup crafted to kick out nominated MP Wilson Sossion as the giant union Secretary General.
The council which has four branches of Migori, Rongo, Kuria East and Kuria West said they will support Collins Henry Oyu who seeks to unseat Sossion.
Oyu is from Nyanza region and the same to Kennedy Nyamwanda who was also endorsed for the Assistant National Treasurer for the national polls slotted for June.
Paul Girwa, the council treasurer said because of Sossion leadership the union have been bleeding numbers and have a bad relation with the Teachers Service Commission (TSC).
Girwa said Sossion used the position of the secretary general to auction teachers from the country for his personal gains.Caleb Opondi, the Knut Secretary General said the move to back the two comes with a team crafted in all regions nationally.
In the team, the national chairman slot will go to Patrick Karinga from Central, National Treasurer will be James Ndiko from Eastern Region and the Deputy Secretary General will be Otieno Agola from Nairobi region.
The first Vice National Chairman will be Stanley Mutai from Rift Valley.
Migori’s public service board has raised concern over the county’s bulging wage bill.
According to the board chairman Jared Kopiyo, the county is spending a lot of money on wages and they are soon going to take action to downsize the bill.
Kopiyo said they are planning to conduct a headcount and payroll audit so that they can ascertain the genuine county government workers.
The county public service board vice chairman Jemima Were said the board is committed to ensuring that the devolved unit has a payroll system that is above board.Migori County has over 3000 workers in the payroll.
In 2018, Migori County conducted a workers’ headcount and the report indicated that the county was losing Ksh. 7,545, 643 per month in paying salaries to undeserved individuals.
The report also indicated that a total of 48 county employees who had deserted duties were irregularly taking home salaries amounting to Ksh. 869, 960 per month.
The 2018 report also reveals that eight people who had forged documents were taking home salaries totaling Ksh.318, 500 per month and 856 employees were earning undeserved allowances amounting to Ksh. 2,031,753 monthly.
During the headcount done in 2018, a total of 2615 employees out of the total 3345 were cleared during the exercise that was also aimed at weeding out ghost workers from the county payroll system.

Speaking about this new development, Naivas Chief Commercial Officer, Willy Kimani said: “We are delighted at the prospect of opening a food market in Greenspan Mall, as it offers us an exciting opportunity to provide Eastlands shoppers the Naivas Foodmarket experience. "
We have not had this storemat in the greater area, which has been a long-standing request by our shoppers; we are finally able to fulfill this with the new development.”
He added: “This is not just a story about the expansion of the retailer but a mark of resilience of the retailer in the prevailing business environment and reminder of the commitment of the organization to fill the gaps in underserved communities when it comes to Supermarkets.
As a business whose DNA is Kenyan, we bear a responsibility to society and with each store opening, we do our small bit in fulfilling this through purchases from suppliers, offering direct and indirect employment, which ultimately uplifts the communities we set up shop in.”
Commenting on the development, The REIT Chief Executive Officer, Einstein Kihanda, said the move fits within the mall’s strategic objective to enhance variety for the shoppers.
He stated, “We are excited to welcome Naivas Supermarket on board as a partner whom we believe fits perfectly within our growth and expansion strategy."
The partnership has been motivated by the need to continually offer shoppers at the mall a wide variety of brands, which confirms our sustained commitment to continue offering Greenspan Mall’s patrons a lasting experience all under one stable.”
We look forward to collaborating with our newest partner, existing tenants and the recently appointed Property Manager, Knight Frank Kenya Limited, on significant marketing and promotions investment to drive footfall to the mall and attract new tenants.
The store is scheduled to open later in the year.
Gor Mahia’s Major Comeback
It was a glorious Monday afternoon for the legendary Gor Mahia after thrashing Bidco United 3 goals to 1 at the Kasarani Annex.
The goals started off at the 11th minute when Bidco’s Peter Nzuki gave the first score of the match after receiving a well chipped corner from David Kaluma.
Despite various signs of defeat, K’Ogalo’s Clifton Miheso took the golden chance of a freekick along the box edge to equalize the match.
Miheso didn’t plan on stopping there as he tried to take the leading button to Gor but was saved by Bidco’s Zamu Adisa.
It was at the top of the hour when Wilson Silva took the mighty Gor to the lead after a neat assist from the “equalizer” Miheso.
Not planning to stop, Clifton Miheso then gave a major assist that was warmly received by a tap to the net by Kenneth Muguna at the 84th minute giving K,Ogalo a 3-1 lead.
This gave Gor 22 points making them 7th on the table
Gor Mahia fell 1-0 to Posta Rangers yesterday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani yesterday.
Francis Nambute scored the sole goal at the 44th minute for Posta Rangers.
Gor Mahia’s coach Carlos Manuel Vaz Pinto still persists that they were luckless.
In his interview he said, “We attacked and didn’t convert the chances we got.
It was not hard to play against 10 men and we dominated the game only that we were unlucky.”
K’ogalo sure did dominate the game at Kasarani to the extent that Vaz Pinto made changes during the game.
He substituted Wilson Silva, Samuel Onyango, and Clifton Miheso for Jules Ulimwengu, John Macharia, and Farouk Abdul respectively.
The loss has left K’ogalo seated at the 8th position with 19 points as the Posta Rangers players increased their tally points to 14 points.
Gor Mahia has so far lost six games since the start of the Football Kenya Federation Premier League.
They lost 2-0 to KCB last weekend, managed a 2-1 win against Homeboyz on 3rd March, and fell 2-1 to Nzoia sugar on 27th February.

KCB gained their victory from Dennis Simiyu, a former Vihiga United, at the 75th minute and Victor Omondi.
Gor Mahia had faced Simiyu back in January 23rd while in Vihiga United where he scored 1-0 against K’ogalo.
There was a great struggle between the opponents to such a degree Gor almost equalized at the 82nd minute through Clifton Miheso but the KCB goalkeeper, Andika saved the ball.
Gor Mahia is facing their fifth lose this season after yesterday’s match and has dropped to 13th on 16th points.
Gor Mahia’s coach Carlos Manuel Vaz Pinto had the following to remark; “In this game we were better that KCB especially in the second half."

TANZANIA’S EXHILARATING ACTION FILM “NYARA” TO PREMIERE IN KENYAN CINEMAS FEB 26TH 2021
The album that Prince Kaybee has been teasing at since the beginning of 2021, has finally gone live as a pre-order across all digital platforms.
To accompany the launch of the pre-order of this highly anticipated album, Prince Kaybee has released a hot first single from the upcoming album.
“Ebabayo”, featuring Nokwazi marks the first collaboration between the two artists.
Tanzanian action-packed movie “Nyara” (Swahili for The Kidnapping) is set to premiere nationwide in Kenyan cinemas, starting 26th February 2021.
The film distributed by Crimson Multimedia Ltd will be available to watch in the following cities and cinemas; in Nairobi at Prestige Cinema; Westgate Cinema, Anga Cinema (Diamond Plaza); Mega Cinema (Kisumu), Motion Cinema (Greenspan Mall) and Mombasa (Nyali Cinemax).
“Nyara” is also set to screen in Uganda’s NuMax Cinema.
“Nyara” is the first feature film from the Tanzanian renowned production conglomerate Wanene Entertainment; East Africa’s first 360 degree content creation company.
It’s a must-see on the big screen, being Tanzania’s first locally produced action film to be mixed in 5.1 (surround sound specifically mixed for cinema release). Nyara’s original soundtrack and cameo appearances include bongo stars: DJ Sinyorita, Chid Benz, Weusi and Chin Bees.
The film’s storyline follows the kidnapping of a 7 year old girl called Rehema; the daughter of a rich and successful businessman, Adam.
An ex-military serial killer escapes prison without a trace and becomes the leader of a gang of notorious kidnappers in Dar es Salaam; they are responsible for kidnapping Rehema under gunpoint.
Short on time, Adam approaches his sister-in-law Faith for help; she is the Head of Police Special Forces undercover unit.
She recruits her well trusted, strong team of martial arts fighters,The Dragon Boys.
The character of chief investigator Faith is played by Rose Donatus Ndauka – one of Tanzania’s most popular leading actresses in the Bongo Movie scene; celebrated for her role in “Swahiba” (2007).
She portrays overwhelming talent and versatility, alongside the Kung-Fu Dragon Boys consisting of friends: Paul Peter, Baraka Singano, Jimmy Singano.
The trio decided to enter the field of Action Movies in 2012, after getting training from Denis Singano who features in “Nyara” film as Freddie Ludewe, the escaped convict and gang leader.
In real life Denis is Baraka and Jimmy’s older brother.
Ahead of the film release in Kenya, director of “Nyara”, Ram Kasongo, says, “Nyara marks the beginning of a new era of possibilities for Bongo movies here in Tanzania.
We are excited for Kenyans to experience our first commercial action film that is 100% a Tanzanian production, shot on location in Dar es Salaam.
All the stunts were done by the actors themselves and no stunt doubles were involved in the making of the film, and all the costume design, sets and VFX were done by a local team here in Tanzania.
It took three years to complete the filming of “Nyara”.
The director hopes that the cinema screenings in Kenya will encourage cross-collaborations between Kenya and Tanzania, as well as open doors for East African filmmakers to cross-over into international platforms and cinemas to further build both film and music industries.
Ram says, “The fact that “Nyara” is premiering nationwide in Kenya, opens doors to the wider global audience and this will additionally help promote Tanzanian talent in the arts,” concluding, “Hopefully this will have a knock-on effect that can see us further develop local talent and produce better and more authentic content that represents the diaspora at large.”
CA, telcos launch interactive portal for safer online environment
The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) has, in partnership with local telecommunications service providers, launched an interactive portal aimed at creating a safer online environment for children.
The micro-site, developed in collaboration with Safaricom, Airtel, Telkom Kenya, Jamii Telecommunication Ltd and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), will provide online safety tips for children and guardians.
“It also has a gaming component that enables both the young and the young at heart to measure their level of awareness on online risks such as cyber bullying, identity theft and online sexual harassment,” said Mercy Wanjau, Ag. Director General of the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA).
The launch comes against a backdrop of increased cyber-threats recorded in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a new frontier for cyber criminals.
According to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) statistics for the quarter ending December 2020, the National Computer Incident Response Team Coordination Centre (KE-CIRT/CC) detected more than 56 million cyber threats in the country
A majority of the threats were malware attacks at 46 million, followed by web application attacks at 7.8 million while 2.2 million Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) threats were detected during the same period.
The ICT Cabinet Secretary, Joe Mucheru expressed fears on possible increase in the volume of cyber crime in the country in the lead up to the upcoming BBI referendum and the 2022 general elections, and urged the CA to boost its detection and monitoring capacity to mitigate the risk.
Speaking at the official opening of national Safe Internet Day celebrations, Mr. Mucheru lauded CA for working with other stakeholders to create a safer online environment.
Abuse and exploitation of children is unacceptable and should generally not be protected even by free speech principles.
In the Internet world, further protections are also needed to shield children from predators, who may contact them through deceptive enticements in online forums,” the ICT Cabinet Secretary said.
He further called on CA to liaise with relevant state agencies and private sector players to manage escalating cases of cybercrime.
Mrs Wanjau said the public would use the platform to report any cases of child online abuse, which will be directly channelled to CA for necessary action.
At the same time, the public can also access information about other organizations that offer support for children, including Childline Kenya, Kenya Association of Professional Counsellors, The Cradle and the Children’s department.
Making the Internet safe for our children and other users is a collaborative effort.
By coming together to deliver this microsite, the Kenyan mobile industry has demonstrated the great things that we can achieve when we join hands and work together.
We look forward to further deepening our collaboration further to consistently enhance safety and availability of the internet, as well as other pertinent challenges facing the industry,” said Stephen Chege, Safaricom’s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, on behalf of the ‘We Care Initiative’.
Safer Internet Day began as an initiative of the European Union Safe Borders project in 2004, and is today celebrated in close to 130 countries around the world
Silverstone Air Rebrands As Renegade Air
Embattled Airline Silverstone seem to have found a way to comeback to the Kenyan skies after an imposed engine halts following numerous sell accidents that put the firm in negative limelight.
In February, Silverstone had announced the intention of coming back to business and they had applied with Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) for the approval of rebranding.
It however now appears that the Airline is already back in operation.
Renegade Air which initially operated 3 planes under Governor’s Air has recently acquired a new fleet in their expansion plan.
Silverstone aircraft have been included in what could be a new partnership.
The airline that has been in operation since 2012 and only operated chartered flights and flights to Wajir County, has announced its expansion to new destinations Masai Mara, Malindi, and Lamu.
Dash 8-Q300 one of the most popular fleets of the Silverstone airline.
The Dash 8s was also the reason Silverstone ground to an halt since it was responsible for the most accidents and mishaps.
The gradual process of starting with few routes could be a good strategy to develop customer confidence before they expand to other routes.

Government to issue out free sanitary towels
The Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Education will distribute free sanitary towels to all primary school girls in adolescent age.
Education CS Prof.George Magoha announced this on Wednesday at Our Lady of Fatima Secondary School in Kariobangi, Nairobi County during an inspection tour.
“Every girl who is in primary school and is in puberty will receive sanitary towels to last nine months… we are also in talks with KCB Foundation for the same provision to secondary schools,” he said.
He also added that they are in talks with Kenya Commercial Bank to supply sanitary towels to all High school girls in the country.
This move follows pleas by many stakeholders for the need to provide sanitary towels for free or at a subsidized fee to enable every girl in need to access them.
He also urged parents to rise up to the occasion and offer good parenting to their children so as to provide them with proper discipline and not neglect them.
“The problem is that parents are not giving their children tough love… because for nine months a child has been at home and you’ve been treating him like an egg and you expect the Principal to instill in him discipline, what do you think will happen?” Magoha said.

Pageant wife of Derek Chauvin doesn’t want a penny in their divorce
The wife of ‘killer cop’ Derek Chauvin followed through with her vow to divorce him today, insisting in a bombshell court filing that she doesn’t want a penny from the shamed ex-cop, DailyMail.com can disclose.
Kellie Chauvin, 45, said she was divorcing her husband of ten years due to the ‘irretrievable breakdown’ of their relationship.
She also revealed the couple officially split on May 28 – three days after he’s accused of killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck during a brutal nine-minute arrest.
Despite Kellie, a realtor, stating she is currently unemployed, the mom of two adult sons from another relationship said she did not want any money or financial assistance from Chauvin.
‘Respondent is full capable of supporting herself,’ the filing reads.
She also revealed that the couple officially split on May 28 – three days after he’s accused of killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck during a brutal nine-minute arrest.
Kellie, who came to the US as a child refugee from Laos, also applied to the court to have her name changed.
A former Mrs Minnesota America pageant winner, she once worked as a radiologist at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, the same hospital where Floyd was pronounced dead.
The couple met when Chauvin brought a suspect in for a health check before an arrest, returning to the hospital shortly after their initial meeting to ask her out.
They married June 12, 2010 in Washington County, Minnesota, the same court where she filed her divorce petition today.
Disgusted Kellie kept her silence for several days as video of Chauvin’s brutal antics went viral, before releasing a statement Friday indicating that her sympathies lay with the victim and his family – not with her husband.
‘This evening, I spoke with Kellie Chauvin and her family.
She is devastated by Mr. Floyd’s death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy,’ attorney Amanda Mason-Sekula said on her behalf.
‘While Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time.’
Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of Floyd.
Kellie writes in the filing, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, that they called quits on their marriage one day earlier.
‘The parties have been separated since May 28, 2020,’ it reads.
‘There has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship of the parties within the definition of Minn. Stat. 518.06, and the marriage cannot be saved.’
The filing explains that while Kellie was recently a realtor with Remax Results she is currently unemployed.
But it adds: ‘Petitioner is self-supporting, is not in need of spousal maintenance, and waives her right to receive temporary or permanent spousal maintenance from respondent’.
She does, however, ask the court to award her ownership of the former couple’s two homes, one in the leafy Oakdale suburb of Saint Paul, and a second in Windermere, Florida.
Both properties have been abandoned for days after they were surrounded by protesters and covered in graffiti.
As part of a press push for her bid for the beauty contest Mrs. Minnesota America 2018, Kellie had raved about her husband, telling the St Paul Pioneer Press: ‘Under all that uniform, he’s just a softie.’
She also told the outlet how the shaven-haired ex-lawman was a major upgrade over her previous husband.
‘He’s such a gentleman. He still opens the door for me, still puts my coat on for me.
After my divorce, I had a list of must-haves if I were ever to be in a relationship, and he fit all of them,’ she said.
Kellie won the contest in October that year and went to Las Vegas in 2019 to compete for the national rounds of the pageant.
Today, however, her glamorous life is in ruins, with her husband regarded by many as the poster boy for white police brutality towards African Americans.
A shell-shocked relative told DailyMail.com that Kellie did not want to talk with the media and they did not want to stoke tensions further by speaking out on her behalf.
Her attorney Ms Mason-Sekula added: ‘Ms. Chauvin is not providing any additional statements at this time.’
Chauvin was moved to one of the most secure prisons in the US Sunday night to ensure he won’t be murdered behind bars, DailyMail.com previously revealed.
In a highly unusual move, Chauvin, who is facing a murder charge in the death of George Floyd, was transferred late Sunday to Oak Park Heights Prison – Minnesota’s only Level Five maximum security facility.
He was previously at Ramsey County Adult Detention Center where he was on suicide watch, before being moved to the Hennepin County Jail because of COVID-19 concerns but then moved to the high-security prison.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) told DailyMail.com that Chauvin was transferred to prison and placed in ‘administrative segregation’ – solitary confinement – after a plea from the Hennepin County Sheriff.
The 407-inmate prison boasts of never having had an escape and is also regarded as one of the country’s safest, having only had one homicide in its history.
Located on the border with Wisconsin, between the cities of Bayport and Stillwater, it accepts some of America’s most hated and high-risk inmates.
Chauvin was due to appear in court on Monday but with Minneapolis still gripped by unrest the appearance was pushed back until June 8.
Commissioner of Corrections Paul Schnell said Chauvin was moved to prison because of concerns about coronavirus and the huge influx of people being booked into Twin Cities jails on public order offenses.
‘First and foremost, we have a COVID situation. Second of all, a large number of people could be booked into Hennepin County Jail,’ Schnell said.
Privately though, law enforcement sources told DailyMail.com the move was to ensure Chauvin – now America’s most hated inmate – was not murdered behind bars.
‘If he was in the general jail population he would probably be dead in two minutes,’ a source told DailyMail.com.
‘This is entirely for security purposes.’
Chauvin will be held at the prison until next Monday when authorities face the daunting challenge of keeping his first court appearance in downtown Minneapolis shielded from further unrest.
It’s highly unusual to lock defendants up in prison before they have been convicted, however officials did something similar in the case of disgraced Minneapolis officer Mohamed Noor who shot dead a woman in 2017 while responding to her 911 call.
Across the country, protests and riots have broken out as demonstrators protest against police brutality and racism, amid a backdrop of a country that had already been shaken by economic uncertainty and public health fears caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Cities across the nation appear war-torn after rioters set establishments and cars in the middle of streets on fire, smashed windows of local stores and looted their shelves and clashed with law enforcement.
Many governors activated the National Guard in their states and sent them to cities being affected by protests turned to violence.
The president did not appear publicly on Sunday to address the rioters, who have engulfed the perimeter of the White House as well taken to the streets in several other U.S. cities, he did weigh in on Twitter, claiming that governors need to activate the National Guard in their states.
He lauded the improvements over the weekend in Minneapolis, Minnesota by the National Guard’s presence – and while the demonstrations have appeared less violent since they started at the end of last week, police in the city said they discovered Sunday caches of homemade firebombs around the city.
Trump had to flee to the White House bunker to shelter in place for a short period of time on Friday, it was revealed on Sunday.
The president has also told aides that he’s concerned about his safety as the White House turned off its lights Sunday night while protests and riots continued a few hundred yards away from the residence.

Colgate announced today, in support of World Water Day, an extension of its partnership to drill water wells to provide clean and safe drinking water to Kenyan communities and extended an invitation to consumers to support the effort by purchasing Colgate products.
For the past 2 years, Colgate has supported 60 water wells at schools in 5 counties (Kisumu, Siaya, Kakamega, Migori and Kwale) working with WellBoring, a UK NGO.
The partnership has benefited approximately 60 000 lives.
Due to the severity of the water challenge across rural communities, in 2021 Colgate aims to donate a further 30 Water Wells where thousands of pupils, their teachers, and their families may all gain access to clean drinking water.
Colgate has long supported schools in Kenya through its Bright Smiles, Bright Futures (BSBF) program.
Colgate’s BSBF program delivers oral health education as well as toothbrushes and toothpaste to millions of kids across the African continent.
The BSBF program in Kenya started in 1968 and has reached well over 7 million kids in Kenya.
The Colgate brand is in more homes than any other, so we can and we will create a healthier, more sustainable future for all.
Creating access to clean water is critical to this mission.
We are delighted with our collaboration with Wellboring NGO and the opportunity to build these 30 boreholes, as a step towards providing pupils with clean and safe water, not only for their drinking but also for their learning environments and overall quality of life “, said Vijay Ameta, General Manager of Colgate-Palmolive East Africa Ltd.
“People in Kenya can make a donation through a purchase of any Colgate product at their nearest Naivas store; and via Mpesa on the WellBoring website (www.Wellboring.org/Colgate).
All the donations will help towards drilling the 30 water wells”.
Clean water for hundreds of school children and teachers, reduces water-borne diseases including cholera, dysentery and typhoid among children and increases the school enrollment as most children won’t spend their time scouting for water.
"We urge Kenyans to support the initiative as it not only, in the long run, reduces water-borne diseases but also helps in keeping the children in school.” explains Lucy Njoroge, WellBoring Project Engineer.
This water Initiative delivers on Colgate’s brand promise that everyone deserves a future they can smile about.
The Campaign will run from 1 April 2021 to 31 May 2021.

Two grade three pupils drown in River Rionsata
Two Grade Three pupils have drowned in River Rionsata in South Mugirango, Kisii.
According to Etago Sub-County Commissioner Jackson Olechuta, the two drowned as they were walking along the river bank, after attending a CBC lesson.
They were accompanied by their teacher.
Several other pupils were rescued by police and locals.
“All pupils are safe and have gone back to school.
We call for calm as we investigate the circumstances under which the two drowned,” Olechuta said.
Kisii County Commander Jebel Munene said a team of officers have been sent to the area to conduct further investigations.
Their bodies have been taken to Tabaka Mission Hospital mortuary.
Pastoralist leaders now declare support for BBI after Raila meet
Pastoralist communities have made an about-turn and declared their unwavering support for the BBI report after they were assured their concerns would be addressed.
The pastoralist leaders were led by Jubilee Coalition Secretary Adan Keynan and National Treasury CS Ukur Yatani.
The Pastoralist Leaders Forum, which comprises of governors, MPs, CSs and PSs and speakers of county assemblies, on Monday said members had unanimously resolved to throw their weight behind the BBI process.
The leaders had last week identified 10 areas that they wanted to be amended but have since narrowed them down to three.
CS Yatani, the group leader, said former Prime Minister Raila Odinga assured them that their concerns would be addressed.

I can confirm to you that we have been deliberating on the matter and we have now resolved to support the BBI in totality.
We want to thank President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga for having a special place for us in this matter,” said Yatani after a meeting with Raila at a Nairobi hotel.
The leaders agreed to form a technical committee that will liaise with the BBI team to address their concerns.
The three issues they said would be extending the Equalisation Fund for 20 years, establishing the Livestock Marketing Authority and deleting proposed amendment on Article 203 (1) of the Constitution on revenue allocation.

Concerns identified earlier but were dropped include securing and protecting the 290 existing constituencies, making Senate the Upper House and doing away with the proposal to create the Health Service Commission.
Raila said the three concerns raised by the pastoralist communities would be adequately addressed.
The issues will be taken on board.
"The technical team will sit down and look at them,” he assured.
Raila added that it is important to address the issues of concern raised by pastoralist communities if their potential is to be unlocked.
“Pastoralist areas are rich in resources and have the potential for tourism and other businesses. Infrastructure is also critical in these areas because these regions have been subjected to marginalisation for a long time,” he explained.
He added: “We are reading from the same page and talking the same language. Each and every Kenyan is equal.”
“It is important for us to ensure that we prepare for the event. Even if we have our own differences, we should not wash our dirty linen before our visitors,” said a senior ODM official.
And it is those differences that the ODM chief wants to address before the national event even as they begin preparations for next year’s General Election.
At the weekend, signs that the disagreements in Raila’s camp are far from over played out after Orengo launched fresh attacks on his critics within the ODM camp.
Orengo, who is said to be among lawyers approached by Raila to challenge the stoppage of the BBI initiative by the High Court, said leaders only turned to him "when things are thick".
The Siaya Senator has been at loggerheads with some ODM top brass over the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020.
He voted in favour of the Bill.
Orengo claimed some ODM leaders were riding on the party successes without knowing how they came about.
"When the party is in turmoil, everyone looks for me asking for my whereabouts, but during the other days, they undermine my capability," said Orengo.
He told his critics to focus on helping Raila clinch the presidency.
"It does not matter what we all want now, our focus should be on the presidency... Ambitions can appear easy but getting what one wants is never easy."
A cold relationship between other Raila’s foot soldiers who are having ambitions for similar political seats in the region also risks splitting the party.
There are fears that some of the politicians may ferry goons to boo their opponents during the national celebrations, like was the case when Raila convened a meeting early this year in an attempt to rally his troops for the BBI process.
During the meeting at Ciala Resort, a section of the attendees booed Mbadi. And this is what some ODM insiders fear could play out, should the leaders fail to come together before the national event.
Yesterday, Raila snaked his way to his Riat home with a lean motorcade, evading journalists, with sources saying that he has planned a series of activities in Kisumu this week.
Despite the woes in the ODM party, Raila is optimistic that the several projects that have been undertaken that the president will unveil will breathe life to the region’s economy.
Yesterday, contractors tasked with delivering some of the projects were still racing against time to complete the word ahead of the national celebrations.
The facilities include a road project leading to the Sh350 million Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground, which will host the event.
Others are the rehabilitated Sh3 billion port.
The revival of the Kisumu-Nakuru meter gauge railway line is among those that the President is expected to unveil after Kenya Railways workers completed its rehabilitation.
The entity says only a few components of the project are still remaining.
Last week, the institution moved a passenger train to Kisumu in anticipation of the developments set to take place on Madaraka Day.
Aboard the train was the corporation’s Managing Director Philip Mainga and a team of engineers who undertook an inspection tour of the line.
The authority is also racing against time to complete the construction of a new passenger terminal in Kisumu.
According to Kenya Railways, the construction currently stands at 35 per cent.
Moses Kuria’s People's Empowerment Party pulls out of Kiambaa by-election after talks with William Ruto
Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria’s People's Empowerment Party (PEP) has pulled out of the Kiambaa parliamentary by-election.
The move is expected to avert a bitter fallout within Deputy President William Ruto’s camp.
In a Facebook post, Kuria disclosed that he made the decision following a meeting with the DP Ruto on Sunday.
The PEP party had settled on Raymond Kuria to face off with United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate John Njuguna Wanjiku in what threatened to split the Hustler nation.
“PEP's message of hope and renewal was endorsed by the voters of Gaturi ward in Murang'a on December 15, 2020, and Juja constituency on May 18, 2021. We wanted to present this message for approval by the people of Kiambaa constituency on the July 15 [by-election],” said Kuria.
However, this did not go down well with my colleagues, particularly [Mathira MP] Rigathi Gachagua and [Kikuyu MP] Kimani Ichungwa.
Yesterday I held extensive discussions with my boss and friend Dr William Ruto on this matter.
Kuria went on, “I take this opportunity to offer my profuse apologies to the people of Kiambaa and all PEP members who undoubtedly will be disappointed with this decision."
To make my two colleagues happy and above all for the unity of the Hustler nation, PEP will not be fielding a candidate for the Kiambaa by-election.
There is a perceived simmering supremacy battle in the Tanga Tanga camp as MPs from Mt Kenya allied to the DP jostle to be in Ruto’s inner circle based on their perceived influence of the region.
Kuria said PEP is a member and stakeholder in the Hustler nation alongside Johnson Muthama-led UDA, Mwangi Kiunjuri-led The Service Party (TSP) as well as the Omingo Magara-led People's Democratic Party (PDP).
The lawmaker said the party decided to shift its focus to a nationwide tour to meet possible candidates for the 2022 General Election.
The seat fell vacant following the death of MP Paul Koinange on March 31.
He is said to have died of Covid-19 complications at the Nairobi Hospital.
Until his death, Koinange served as the Chairperson of the National Assembly Administration and Security Committee.
Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki during the launch of State of the Judiciary Annual Report (SOJAR) , January 23, 2020
When the Court of Appeal sits to hear the cases filed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, ODM leader Raila Odinga, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and the electoral commission, seven issues stand out.
If the court is to allow the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) juggernaut back on the rails, the judges will first be determining whether the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had quorum to verify the signatures submitted by the BBI proponents.
This question transverses the appeals filed by both the IEBC and AG.
The commission argues that the question on whether two or five commissioners can legally run the institution was determined by another court and could not be reopened.
On one hand, IEBC argues that in the first case, determined by Justice Wilfrida Okwany, the minimum commissioners vary.
Meanwhile, High Court Judges Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Chacha Mwita, Teresiah Matheka and Jairus Ngaah held that the commission should have five commissioners.
It faults the five judges, arguing that the section they relied on to find that IEBC had no quorum was earlier on declared unconstitutional by a separate court.
“The learned judges of the Superior Court erred in law in finding that IEBC lacks the requisite quorum for purposes of carrying out its constitutional and statutory mandate yet paragraphs five and seven of the Second Schedule to the IEBC Act, upon which the finding was premised on had been declared unconstitutional by a judge of equal jurisdiction,” IEBC appeal papers read.
“A contrary finding on the issue of quorum had been arrived at by another judge of concurrent jurisdiction.”
On quorum, the AG argues that the High Court went beyond what had been asked and in turn, the IEBC has been rendered useless as it can no longer operate.
His contention is that the commission cannot even conduct voter registration and which it was faulted of not doing in preparation of a referendum.
“The orders issued by the High Court were so extensive and revolutionary that they go to the very foundation of the Constitution. They were beyond the matters that were before the court,” Solicitor General Ken Ogeto argues.
Another issue which the court is being asked to determine is whether the court erred by reversing an exercise which involved a consultative process including the Judiciary.
According to the AG, the court illegally placed itself at the centre of the Constitution-making process.
He argues that means each time Kenyans want to amend the Constitution, they will have to get back to the court to ask it which parts to amend and which ones to leave.
In effect, the learned judges decreed that whenever the people desired amendments to the Constitution, it would be imperative to seek the guidance of the court in advance to determine the changes that are, or are not amendable.
"This risks transforming courts into policymakers, thereby usurping the people’s freedom to determine the terms of the social contract and how they wish to change those terms,” he continues.
The AG is also contesting the court’s decision on the involvement of President Kenyatta in the BBI process.
He argues that owing to perennial polls battles, three million Kenyans who signed on the document, majority county assemblies and the two Houses of Parliament ratified the president and ODM’s plan to end the violence and marginalisation.
“The above process is geared towards national reconciliation which constitutes a legitimate national political process. The process is supposed to pre-empt perennial election-related violence and marginalisation and it’s imperative that it be concluded before the next general election,” the court papers also read.
He argues that President Kenyatta cannot be faulted for promoting peace. According to him, the finding by the High Court that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution is not supported by evidence.
According to him, the finding by the High Court that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution is not supported by evidence.
The other issue is whether the Constitution has clauses that cannot be amended.
On this, he accuses them of skewed, slanted, incomplete and erroneous reading of available academic work on the subject and of Kenya’s constitutional history and the making of the Constitution of 2010.
Senate Minority Leader James Orengo has hit out at his critics in the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), saying they only seek his help during crisis.
Orengo, who is said to be among lawyers approached by ODM leader Raila Odinga to challenge the stoppage of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) initiative by the High Court, said leaders only turned to him "when things are thick".
The Siaya Senator has been at loggerheads with some ODM top brass over the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. He voted in favour of the Bill.
He has been a key strategist of Raila and was his lawyer during presidential election petitions.
However, succession politics in ODM and the fight for political positions in Nyanza in 2022, are said to have caused a wedge.
On Saturday, Orengo who spoke during a burial of former South East Alego MCA Joshua Osuri in Alego Usonga sub-county in Siaya, accused unnamed politicians in ODM of abandoning the party leader Raila, during his times of need or crisis moments.
Orengo claimed some ODM leaders were riding on the party successes without knowing how they came about.
When the party is in turmoil everyone looks for me asking for my whereabouts, but during other days they undermine my capability, said Orengo.
"I remember after 2017 General Election during the swearing in of Raila at Uhuru Park only a handful of us were at the forefront. I can only recall our 'chief justice' that day Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang. When we want people who are strong and can fight for the party they are nowhere to be seen," he said.
He told his critics to focus on delivering the presidency to Raila.
He added: "Even just fighting for devolution was not a walk in the park."
He asked all Kenyans to prepare for a referendum before the year ends.
ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna asked cabinet secretaries with 2022 political ambitions to resign.
Referring to the recent Bonchari by-election, he accused unnamed CSs of using their powers to frustrate the 'handshake' and the ODM party.
Deputy President William Ruto (left) confers with Kilifi North MP Owen Baya (center) and former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar Sarai during a retreat with Coast leaders and professionals at the Sun N Sand Hotel in Kilifi County.
Deputy President William Ruto on Saturday launched a broadside against the government's borrowing plan, saying the ballooning foreign debt was a threat to the nation.
Speaking after a two-day retreat with Coast leaders and professionals, Dr Ruto said if elected president, he would reduce the country’s debt burden.
“Instead of borrowing, we will enhance and expand our savings. Borrowing is threatening our nation,” said Ruto after receiving an 18-point economic blueprint from coastal leaders.
The DP did not say how his administration would finance the multi-billion shilling projects in the blueprint.
He, however, promised to sign a charter with the Coast on the agreed plan.
In his new political plan targeting regional blocs, Ruto said he would negotiate with people in former eight provinces and develop plans to unshackle the nation from chains of poverty.
He said Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok would coordinate all the “hustle nation activities.”
After the Coast, the DP is scheduled to meet leaders from Nairobi before heading to Western.
“We must establish a charter. I’m ready to sign a charter with the people of Coast on what needs to be delivered during my administration,” declared Ruto in Kilifi.
Yesterday, a section of Coast leaders tabled 18-wish list of demands they said would form the basis of the charter or covenant between the region and the DP.
The economic plan dubbed, The Coast Regeneration Plan, touch on revival of collapsed factories, blue economy, value-additions, special economic zones, tourism and agriculture.
"These big issues were broken into 18," said former Kisauni MP Ananiah Mwaboza who once served as constitutional advisor to the office of the deputy president.
The plan appeared to borrow heavily from the 2030 economic blueprint developed by Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani in 2015.
Ruto said it would be subjected to public participation.
Former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar said the Coast would support Ruto's presidential ambitions on certain terms which he has committed to meet.
"We will cascade it down to villages. It will be a people's plan. We are happy tha the DP wants to become president on certain terms. In the last three days, we have come up with the plan for the Coast," said Omar.
Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa said Coast people would organise how to be part of the team that provide solutions for problems facing the region.
"We want partnership. We will partner with you and see whether you will met all our demands and if you do so, we will be with you all the way," said Jumwa.
Lunga Lunga MP Khatib Mwashetani said the economic plan presented to the DP was work in progress, addding that it had left out key areas like ports and harbours.
"I did not hear anything about the Shimoni Port, which is what the people of Kwale want. I hope the DP will implement it once he is elected," said Mwashetani.
The DP said the economic plan was not final as it would be subjected to public participation.
“A lot of input must come from the people. The plan will be taken to the wards and villagers because it is about them and not us politicians,” said Ruto, who met 12 elected MPs from Coast.
Others present during the meeting in Kilifi were a section former MPs and professionals. Conspicuously absent from the process was Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya.
None of the other five governors from the Coast attended the retreat.
Governors have cried foul over increased impeachment motions against them by Members of the County Assemblies and upheld by the Senate, even as they called for fair trial.
The Council of Governors (CoG) also lamented over the threshold of impeaching governors, saying that oversight bodies had watered it down.
In a statement read by CoG vice-chairperson James Ongwae, the governors said they would seek to establish the right threshold for impeaching county bosses.
They said the threshold of removing other holders of public office such as MPs and those of the County Assembly was seemingly higher than that of governors.
“The threshold for the impeachment of governors is becoming lower. We are getting into situations where procedural and administrative duties that don’t fall under the governor are actually impeachable,” he said.
The current process, they claimed, is political and had turned governors into victims of their respective county assemblies and the Senate.
Oversight bodies must remain cognizant of the legal principles surrounding impeachment so that the exercise is not abused, said the Kisii governor.
They said they would seek to be enjoined in the case by former Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud challenging his removal.
Yesterday, it also emerged that Mohamud and the sworn-in Governor Ahmed Ali Muktar addressed the extraordinary CoG meeting separately and gave their account of happenings in the county.
While Muktar joined the meeting virtually, Mohamud was physically present at CoG headquarters at Delta House, Nairobi.
Both were then excused to allow the council members to deliberate on the matter as each argued that they were legally in office, one through a court order and the other through a gazette notice by Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, after a successful impeachment process.
The Sunday Standard has learnt that the county bosses will move to court this week to seek an interpretation on what happens as well as the threshold for impeaching governors.
While protesting what they termed a worrisome trend, the CoG cited the impeachment of former governors Mike Sonko (Nairobi) and Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu) as other instances where governors have seemingly been persecuted.
"While we appreciate the fact that impeachment is both legal and a political process, the rule of law should prevail while undertaking the same," said Ongwae.
He disclosed, “The council shall engage relevant institutions with a view to streamlining court pronouncements with the law so that the impeachment process can be anchored in legitimacy and impartiality."
The county chiefs underscored the need for all bodies involved to be guided by the Constitution and principles laid down by the courts on the threshold of impeachment.
The governors claimed MCAs have turned into 'lynch mobs' and sent three governors home, while one survived as other mooted the same, just this year.
"The council assures the public that it values integrity and accountability in the running of public affairs in the counties. Nevertheless, oversight bodies must remain cognizant of the legal principles surrounding impeachment so that the excise is not abused," urged CoG.
"The council shall engage relevant institutions with a view to streamlining court pronouncement with the law so that impeachment process can be anchored in legitimacy and impartially."
He was in the company of Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia) and Alex Tolgos (Elgeyo Marakwet).
They spoke after a virtual conference called to deliberate county issues. The CoG is expected to meet next week to deliberate on the matter further.
Their address comes days after CoG chairman Martin Wambora termed Mohamud’s impeachment and his deputy’s takeover rushed.
The former Wajir boss moved to court a day after Senate okayed his removal from office, as initiated by the Wajir County Assembly.
The new Wajir governor was sworn in despite a court order that barred the same.
Senate found him to have grossly violated the constitution, which was one of the charges he faced before the august House.
It acquitted him on a charge of abuse of office.
Rurii ward by-election UDA candidate Muraya Githaiga celebrates with his supporters after he was announced the winner at IEBC tallying center at Rurii PCEA church in Nyandarua County on May 18, 2021
The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has unveiled candidates for Kiambaa constituency and Muguga ward by-elections, both in Kiambu County slated for July 15.
John Njuguna Wanjiku will fly the party's flag in Kiambaa, while Kamau Thumbi will face off with others in Muguga.
The two were unveiled yesterday at UDA's headquarters, a party associated with Deputy President William Ruto.
While handing the pair their respective certificates, party secretary general Veronica Maina told them to go and root for the party
"This is a good ticket. It is one of the best options in the market today for any politician," said Maina.
She made reference to UDA's victory in Rurii ward and linked it to Peoples' Empowerment Party (PEP) which clinched Juja parliamentary seat through George Koimburi.
Both Njuguna and Thumbi exuded confidence in taking up the seats.
"This is our chance to make our statement that Kiambaa is a hustler-nation stronghold," said Njuguna.
"I would like to thank UDA for playing it fair and my competitors for their support," said Thumbi.
Among politicians who attended the launch included Meru Senator Mithika Linturi, Kikuyu lawmaker Kimani Ichung'wa and his Mathira colleague Rigathi Gachagua.
MP-elect Koimburi was also present.
The Tangatanga-allied MPs chastised the government over the handling of Juja and Bonchari by-elections, and called for a fair process.
"We do not expect our competitors to misuse state agencies as they did in Juja, Rurii and Bonchari," said Ichung'wa.
"We look forward to a contest full of decorum and done on issues," said Gachagua.
"UDA believes that power belongs to the people. The opportunity that has arisen in Kiambaa and Muguga is an opportunity for people to make a decision on whom they want to delegate their power," said Linturi.
The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) associated with Deputy President William Ruto has rolled out a popularisation drive across the country.
The strategy involves dividing the country into six clusters which will be visited in phases.
The party's Secretary-General Veronica Maina announced that they have embarked on a campaign to engage regional membership across the country in phases.
She said UDA's victory in Rurii Ward, Nyandarua County and the Peoples Empowerment Party's win in the Juja parliamentary by-election has given them impetus to roll out massive registration of aspirants for various seats ahead of the 2022 elections. S
he said this will give UDA a headstart in next year’s General Election.
Ms Maina was speaking yesterday at the UDA headquarters in Nairobi when party officials met aspirants from all the 47 counties to map out their campaign strategy.
The aspirants include those eyeing seats in the National Assembly, Senate, Woman Rep and governor positions.
She said the party decided to settle on forums to enlighten the aspirants about the party constitution
. Maina said they outlined party ideologies and manifesto to the aspirants in the build-up to the grassroots election set for June and July.
“We had a very fruitful engagement. We managed to take the registered aspirants through the party constitution, the nomination process, how to market the party, and branding, among other key issues,” she said.
She also said they will use the forums to collect views on how the party should conduct its affairs ahead of the elections.
In the draft constitution, UDA proposes to have three deputy party leaders, three deputy chairpersons, three deputy secretaries-general, three deputy national treasurers, and three deputy national organising secretaries.
In attendance were Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and Kandara MP Alice Wahome.
I did not consult people of Kipipiri, flip-flopping Kimunya says will not resign over Jubilee loss
National Assembly Majority Leader Amos Kimunya has dismissed claims that he said he would resign if Jubilee fails to deliver in the Rurii by-election.
Kimunya said those are just political sentiments he expressed and did not consult the people of Kipipiri on whether he should resign as Majority leader.
The Kipipiri legislator had vowed to resign if Jubilee Party lost the Rurii Ward by-election in his Nyandarua backyard.
Jubilee candidate Peter Thinji lost to United Democratic Alliance's (UDA) Francis Muraya Githaiga, a party associated with Deputy President William Ruto.
In a video clip, Kimunya is captured saying: “I am the Jubilee Majority leader, this is our home and outsiders should not decide for us.”
He added, “Let us win this Rurii Ward by-election by 99 per cent so that those outsiders (UDA) trying to come here can be taught a lesson. Nyandarua is our home. If we lose in Rurii, I should just resign. How can Jubilee lose this seat in Nyandarua, and I am the Majority Leader?”
But on Wednesday, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declared Githaiga duly elected Member of County Assembly for Rurii.
“We thank God for Hustler nation victory in Juja and Rurii and the awesome show in Bonchari. A big congratulation to all our hustler teams for a sterling performance against all odds,” Ruto said.
Ruto added: “Hongera our competitors, let's keep it issue-based and pull together. Sasa tupange uchumi na Big 4.”
During an event at the home of Kieni MP Kanini Kega, where a number of Cabinet Secretaries from Central and MPs attended, Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemiawas asked to ensure Jubilee retained the seat.
In a dramatic about-turn, Kimunya says he will not bear the consequences of a matter that rests in another constituency.
“Many things have happened within the political circles. Rurii Ward, Bonchari and Juja constituencies have new representatives. I want to congratulate those who have been elected and ask those that did not get enough votes to accept the results. Accept the verdict of the people and live to fight another day,” Kimunya says.
He said his appeal to those who won the by-elections is to get on the job with speed and start delivering on promises they made.
“We only have about 12 months before the next election. They do not have much time and the only way they can win the hearts of people to get to work immediately,” he said.
He said on whether he has to resign from his position as majority leader after Jubilee failed to deliver in the three by-elections, he will have to do more consultations.
“I did not consult the people of Kipipiri and this is a fundamental decision that needs public participation. I doubt they would let me bear the consequences of matters that rest in another constituency. I believe the matter rests there and we move on with congratulating the winners and living situation that people have made their choice and we must respect that choice,” he said.
This comes even as sources within the presidency indicate that President Uhuru Kenyatta is furious over a string of losses that his administration has been handed in recent days.
The sources said the Head of State was particularly angered by the outcome of Rurii Ward and Juja parliamentary by-elections, where his Jubilee Party was beaten.
The President is said to have read the riot act to some top Jubilee officials for reportedly bungling the Juja and Rurii campaigns.
Involvement of civil servants, especially from Harambee House, was reportedly also discussed, with politicians in the president’s inner circle blaming the power wielders for using brute police force, occasioning a protest vote.
Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has denied being at the centre of chaos that saw the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) abruptly halt tallying of votes for Juja parliamentary by-election.
Dr Nyoro was captured in a video clip making rounds on social media is seen exchanging words with security agents at the tallying centre.
But he denied being involved in an altercation saying people misinterpreted the cause of his reaction in the clip.
While addressing the Press on Wednesday, he said there was more to his reaction that was captured in the video clip.
The county chief noted that the video did not show the beginning of the incident where he was trying to ask "the commissioners eligible questions."
He said he tried getting answers to the questions but his opponents did not want to hear any of it, hence causing the commotion.
“The clip does not tell it all. I had asked a simple question to the IEBC officials before our opponents started a shouting match. I was seated and calmly seeking answers on some observations that I had noted,” he said.
Nyoro claimed that not all votes from two polling stations where the Jubilee candidate had a strong showing were counted raising concerns of attempt to rig the by-election.
He claimed that votes from Gachororo and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology were thrown in the field, raising alarm.
“We were not involved in any chaos. We all know who are violent in nature. People are busy tarnishing my name for no reason. I condemn in the strongest terms possible the insinuation that I'm a violent person. I have never been violent even during my campaigns," he said.
IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said he will write to DPP Nordin Haji to prosecute the governor and his team over the chaos.
Chebukati blamed Nyoro for disrupting the tally of votes at Mang'u High School that saw the process resume yesterday morning.
The county chief however said he will wait for conclusion of investigation into the matter and promised to accept the outcome of the by-election.
“We will accept the results and continue working on bettering Kiambu county,” he said.
Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo, who was campaigning for Jubilee's Susan Njeri Waititu also congratulated George Koimburi of little know People's Empowerment Party (PEP) allied to the Deputy President and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.
"As one who has been honored to serve the people of Kiambu county as former governor and previously as a long serving MP for Juja constituency, i believe that we must now put the divisions of the campaigns behind us and pursue a common goal of uplifting and serving the people," urged Kabogo.
"Hon Njeri, we mounted a spirited fight but the people of Juja decided otherwise. I urge you to unite with Koimburi to pursue the interests of the people of Juja in honor of your late husband and former MP Francis Waititu," he added.
Court dismisses Oscar Sudi's plea seeking to stop forgery case
Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi has lost a bid to stop his prosecution over allegations of forging academic certificates.
Court of Appeal yesterday dismissed his application, noting that it had no powers to order a magistrate's court to stop hearing the criminal case.
According to Court of Appeal judges William Ouko, Wanjiru Karanja and Asike Makhandia, Mr Sudi does not appear to challenge the criminal case but was aggrieved about the constitutionality of the charges.
“The said criminal proceedings are not the subject of the appeal before this court. It is discernible from the notice of appeal dated August 10, 2017, as well as the draft memorandum of appeal annexed to the motion, that the subject of the appeal is the High Court’s judgment dated July 24, 2017, which dismissed the applicant’s constitutional petition. As such, we have no jurisdiction to stay the criminal proceedings in the chief magistrate’s court,” they ruled.
In the trial, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said the criminal case is halfway heard, with seven out of 14 prosecution witnesses having already testified.
This is the second time Sudi has failed to stop the criminal case.
In the High Court, Justice Hedwig Ong’udi ruled that the prosecution did not violate the rights of Sudi when he was charged with forging academic certificates while seeking clearance from the electoral commission to contest in the March 4, 2013 elections.
Kuria-fronted candidate, George Koimburi, beats Jubilee’s Susan Waititu in Juja by-election
The People’s Empowerment Party candidate George Koimburi has won the Juja by-election after getting 12,159 votes against Jubilee’s Susan Waititu, who garnered 5,746 votes.
The results were announced on Wednesday evening after all the 184 polling centres reported their respective outcomes.
Kariuki Joseph Gichui, an independent candidate, came third with 1,356 votes.
The voter turnout was a low 18.91 per cent, with only 21,862 out of the 115,632 registered voters casting their ballot.
The winner, George Koimburi, was fronted by among other leaders, Gatundu South Member of Parliament Moses Kuria.
Deputy President William Ruto continued his charm offensive to woo regional caucuses with his economic recovery agenda ahead of the 2022 election.
Yesterday, Dr Ruto hosted former councilors from Kajiado County at his official residence in Karen where they discussed the bottom-up economic model and how best to change the lives of constituents.
The DP stated that being grassroots leaders, the former councilors had a great role to play in entrenching economic reforms in their communities.
“We are rooting for an expansive, inclusive and broad-based economic intervention that will give ordinary Kenyans a chance to make a living and create wealth. In the long-run, these signature reforms will boost people’s standards of living and foster the country’s growth sustainably,” said Ruto.
In attendance were MPs Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), George Sunkuyia (Kajiado West), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi) and Kimani Ngunjiri (Bahati).
This is DP Ruto’s umpteenth meeting with regional leaders.
On Thursday last week, Ruto held talks with members of Purko Barley Growers Association from Narok County at his Karen home.
The farmers who were accompanied by MPs Lemanken Aramat, Gabriel Tongoyo, David ole Sankok and Soipan Kudate, presented a list of challenges they face and proposed solutions as a condition for supporting the DP.
“We are encouraging agricultural diversification in order to increase farmers' earnings and improve livelihoods. The national and county governments will collaborate in supporting farmers in this endeavor through research, training and resource mobilisation,” Ruto said on his social media pages.
Last week, MPs from Coast allied to Ruto, held a private meeting on Sunday, to deliberate on the economic agenda of the region ahead of 2022.
They deliberated on the special economic zones, blue economy, county housing projects, mining and job opportunities at the port.
They are expected to host the DP in coming weeks. MPs who attended the meeting were Owen Baya, Aisha Jumwa and Mohammed Ali among others.
On May 8, the DP also met leaders from Mt Kenya to discuss how to re-engineer the economy.
Ruto said they are taking collaborative efforts to promote enterprise and foster empowerment of ordinary Kenyans.
Ruto met with three representatives from each of the 11 counties from Mt Kenya as a follow-up to the Masai Mara meeting.
"Through the ongoing consultations covering all regions and all sectors of the economy, we anticipate the generation of more jobs and expanded opportunities for those in the lower cadre will rid our country of poverty," he said.
The DP has also been making inroads in Western where he seeks to eat into the support base of ODM leader Raila Odinga.
Last week, leaders who included one of Ruto’s point men in Nyanza, Eliud Owalo, met in Nairobi to plan what they described as their economic strategy for the region.
They said their strategy will form the basis of their negotiations with other presidential hopefuls ahead of 2022.
They said anyone seeking the support of the region will have to enter into a pre-election economic pact with them.
Many former foot soldiers of Raila attended Friday’s meeting convened by Owalo a former aide to the ODM leader.
The politicians claimed that they had the blessings of Ruto to organise the meeting with one of the agendas being to look for ways to attract more Nyanza leaders to the camp.
The strategy also involves attracting professionals who will help compile the economic needs of the region in a document that will form the basis for Ruto’s campaigns in Nyanza.
Raila calls for an end to police brutality as ODM wins Bonchari seat
The Orange Democratic Movement Party leader Raila Odinga has called for an end of police brutality after the party emerged victorious in the Bonchari by-election in Kisii.
According to Raila, what was witnessed in the Bonchari and Juja by-elections is an ‘abuse of police powers and an arrogant display of impunity by a few overzealous and bellicose government functionaries.’
"An election process is an opportunity for the voters to express their will at the ballot and not an avenue to pursue imaginary and short-legged political interests. Security forces exist to serve the people and not the interests of those out to conduct political experiments."
Raila said that the peaceful co-existence post-2018 must not be taken for granted by some rogue elements wanting to confuse the handshake for an excuse to erode the country's hard-earned liberties.
The ODM candidate Eng Pavel Oimeke won the Bonchari by-election.
Oimeke garnered 8,049 votes against Jubilee's Zepedeo Opore who had 7,279 votes. UDA candidate Teresa Oroo managed 6,954 votes.
The voter turnout was 50 percent with 26,526 total votes cast.
The Constituency had 52, 955 registered voters and 103 polling stations.
The One Kenya Alliance Principals, From Left; ANC Party Leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper Democratic Movement Party Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, KANU Party Leader Gideon Moi and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula during their consultation meeting on the current state of affairs of the Country at Kalonzo's Karen offices in Nairobi on May 18, 2021.
One Kenya Alliance principals are in the process of formalising a political pact that will spell out power-sharing agreement in readiness for the 2022 General Election.
Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka, Kanu chairman and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi and Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula yesterday received a report from a technical committee that they tasked with formalising the new alliance.
In a statement, the four leaders disclosed that progress had been made in crafting the political formation that seeks to have one of its principals succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta when he exits office next year.
“The One Kenya Alliance Principals met today (yesterday) to receive an update report form a technical committee on the progress made in formalising the Alliance,” read the joint statement sent to newsrooms.
The leaders are said to have expressed “satisfaction with the progress so far,” noting that Kenyans were anxiously waiting for the same “as a vehicle that carries their aspirations”.
The disclosure, by the team, of the existence of a technical committee suggests that there are already discussions on who will go for what position in the next poll.
All four leaders have indicated interest to run for the top seat, making the process of picking the alliance’s flag bearer a delicate affair.
The leaders have in the past hinted at bringing onboard more key figures to craft a formidable outfit for the succession battle.
Some of the principals have separately held consultative meetings with other political players, including ODM leader Raila Odinga.
At the same time, the leaders commended Senate for ratifying the impeachment of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud on Monday.
They said that was a bold step in the fight against corruption and impunity.
Gideon and Wetang’ula were among the 25 senators that voted in support of the impeachment Motion and sealed the fate of the governor.
The leaders expressed dissatisfaction with the High Court judgement that declared the Building Bridges Initiative null and void, putting an injunction to the referendum through the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020. On Covid-19, the leaders expressed concern over reports of a potential fourth wave in July.
They called on the Ministry of Health to intensify mass testing and vaccination to mitigate any possible devastating effects of the pandemic.
The leaders urged relevant authorities to urgently put in place measures to curb destruction caused by flooding.
They also called on the government to fast track the distribution of subsidised seeds and fertiliser to farmers to take advantages of the ongoing rains.
Chaos erupted at Mang’u High School tallying centre, Juja constituency after allegations of vote-rigging in the by-elections emerged.
This prompted police to contain the situation by sending away politicians present.
Kiambu Governor James Nyoro, Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were among the politicians who were kicked out by the police.
It was a disorderly scene with chairs disarranged and papers scattered on the floor as rowdy politicians and their party agents made their way out of the centre.
Kiambu Governor James Nyoro was on record in one of the videos making rounds on Social media demanding a fair vote tallying process.
“We are not fools, and we have made our point,” he said in the video as an unknown voice in the background supported his sentiments.
It is the chaotic behaviour that prompted the police to take charge and restore calm in the constituency’s tallying station.
The tallying process was suspended for some time as politicians, their supporters and party agents were kicked out of the tallying centre under the command of Kiambu County Commander Ali Nuno.
This comes hours after political parties alleged intimidation in the three by-elections that took place in the country on Tuesday.
The country had by-elections in Bonchari and Juja constituencies as well as Rurii ward.
The three by-elections have been marred by chaos and allegations of intimidations by the police.
Earlier, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party and ODM had said their candidates and agents were facing intimidation by the police.
Deputy President William Ruto has called on leaders to be discrete when initiating constitutional changes.
His sentiments come days after a five-judge bench of the High court nullified the BBI process.
Speaking from his Karen residence, Dr Ruto hinted at a possibility of leaders coming up with an agreement that he says will bring the country together.
“We should have an agreement that creates a path for Kenyans to work together even as we compete,” he said.
The country’s second in command also urged leaders to put the interests of Kenyans first adding that the country was facing serious challenges that needed to be addressed.
Deputy President William Ruto, who has openly challenged the Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020 since its inception expressed gratitude to a higher power, moments after the shocking ruling.
“There is GOD in heaven who loves Kenya immeasurably. May GOD'S name is praised forever,” he tweeted in response to the High Court judgement.
The One Kenya Alliance has registered its dissatisfaction with the High Court judgment on the BBI Constitutional Amendment Bill.
Its principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetangula and Gideon Moi said Kenyans should, however, be patient and wait for the appeal process to proceed to its logical conclusion.
The High Court last week annulled the BBI referendum process throwing the future of the initiative into uncertainty.
A bench comprising Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka and Chacha Mwita upheld a consolidated case by eight petitioners that the constitution bears essential features on its basic structure that cannot be amended.
The court held that the BBI secretariat and steering committee had failed to provide critical information to the public as outlined in the procedures to amend the constitution through a popular initiative.
The court also observed that the president cannot initiate a process to change the constitution in the pretext of promoting national unity.
But the four principals expressed hope that the appellate court will uphold the sovereign will of the people of Kenya.
They spoke after a meeting on Tuesday.
The meeting, they said, was aimed at receiving an update report from a technical committee on the progress made in formalising the Alliance.
They expressed satisfaction with the progress so far, noting that Kenyans were waiting anxiously for the same as a vehicle that carries their aspirations.
The Principals also expressed concerns over reports of a potential 4th wave of the COVID-19 in the month of July, calling upon the Ministry of Health to intensify mass testing and vaccination to mitigate against this danger.
The principals also regretted the devastating effects of floods across the country that has led to the loss of lives and destruction of property, calling upon the relevant authorities to put in place urgent measures to curb this situation.
They also called upon the government to intensify the distribution of subsidised seeds and fertiliser to farmers to take advantages of the ongoing rains.
Lastly, the Principals applauded the Senate for its decision to impeach the Governor of Wajir, terming it a bold step in the fight against corruption and impunity in the Counties.
Voting is underway in the Juja and Bonchari parliamentary by-elections.
This comes as the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission prepares to deliver results for three by-elections perceived to be an acid test for President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga.
A by-election is also happening in Rurii Ward in Nyandarua County where Jubilee is battling United Democratic Alliance (UDA).
A spot check in the two constituencies reveals that voters had lined up from as early as 5 am.
The electoral agency opened the polling stations some minutes after 7 am.
The two by-elections took a popularity contest with either party accusing the others of harassment and intimidation.
In Bonchari, the battle is pitting President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party, Raila Odinga's ODM and DP William Ruto-linked UDA.
In Juja, Jubilee is facing off with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria's Ndung'u Koimburi candidate running on the People's Empowerment Party.
The Juja parliamentary seat became vacant after MP Francis Waititu succumbed to brain cancer on February 22, 2021, at MP Shah Hospital.
Waititu was elected on a Jubilee ticket during the 2017 General Election. He garnered 66,190 votes.
According to IEBC, Juja constituency has 114,761 registered voters.
The 2017 General Election had an 80 per cent voter turn-out which saw 91,801 Kenyans casting their votes in the region.
11 candidates were cleared to contest.
In Bonchari, the seat was left vacant following the death of MP Oroo Oyioka.
The ruling Jubilee Party, ODM, UDA and Maendeleo Chap Chap are among those that have fielded candidates in the by-election occasioned by the death of area MP John Oroo Oyioka.
UDA has party fronted Teresa Bitutu, the widow of the former MP, while Raila’s party has presented Pavel Oimeke and Jubilee one-time area MP Zebedeo John Opore.
The Gusii region has been known to see fringe parties triumph in elections as so-called big parties are left high and dry.
Despite winning the Kisii gubernatorial, senatorial and woman rep seats, ODM emerged empty-handed in constituency seats with no parliamentary candidate in the area winning on the Orange ticket in 2017.
While ODM is seeking to consolidate its support in Kisii which is regarded as its base, Matiang’i is said to be keen on ensuring Jubilee Party wins to weigh his support in the area.
As President Uhuru Kenyatta continues to maintain studious silence on the High Court ruling on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), his allies have decided to play safe as they plot their political moves.
Birthed by the handshake between President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, the initiative to unite Kenyans that metamorphosised into the plan to amend the 2010 Constitution had co-opted top party leaders including Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya), Charity Ngilu (Narc) and Gideon Moi (Kanu).
After High Court Judges Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Teresia Matheka and Chacha Mwita declared the BBI unconstitutional, the politicians who seems to have been caught flatfooted have now adopted a cautions response to the matter.
Aware of the BBI timelines and the clock ticking fast towards the next General Election which is 14 months away and fear that the referendum to change the law could slip through their fingers, Raila, Kalonzo, Mudavadi and Wetang'ula seem to be coming to reality that time is not on their side.
The ANC leader has already called for a national conference to relook the BBI. But is quick to note that the process should not be limited to happening before the next General Election.
"Regardless of the results from any appeals preferred, the bulk of the provisions of the BBI Bill will not, for sure, become operational in next year’s General Election... for instance the proposed 70 constituencies would not be applicable if a referendum is not concluded before August 2022," said Mudavadi.
Instead, the ANC leader has proposed that the entire process to change the law starts a fresh and be guided by the High Court verdict.
He argues that there must be a silver lining out of the court’s judgement and Kenyans should re-start a proper conversation in the format of the 1997 IPPG arrangement.
"We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater," said Mudavadi.
Raila who was the first to respond to the ruling expressed his disappointment in the turn of events and vowed to move to Court of Appeal.
“We will move to the Court of Appeal to present our case as to why we think the High Court did not render the right verdict. We will do so with sobriety and with respect for our judges and courts,” said Raila.
He however, said the judgement was a direct disrespect for the Presidency and the Office of the President.
The ODM leader urged those opposed to the ruling to restrain from personalised attacks on the court and the judges.
"We must respect its ruling and its freedom to exercise its judgment as it understands the legal and constitutional matters before it," said Raila.
President Kenyatta is working on the appeal through the Attorney General Paul Kihara and Solicitor General Ken Ogeto.
The AG has already filed notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal and moved to the High Court’s Constitutional Court and Human Rights division to seek stay order.
Meanwhile, lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi believes that Raila should not appeal the BBI judgment.
Perhaps keen to take in such advice, Raila has been on vacation in Watamu, Kilifi County and is yet to assemble a team of lawyers to prepare an appeal.
Yesterday, Kalonzo broke his silence on the High Court judgement and called on Kenyans to respect the rule of law despite disagreeing with the decision.
The Wiper leader insisted that although a number of Kenyans were not happy about the ruling, they need to respect the Judiciary.
High voltage
"I also ask all Kenyans to respect due process, and respect our Judiciary. It is neither wise nor helpful to disparage the Judiciary on account of the High Court Judgment. Even though some of us may disagree with various declarations made in that high voltage judgment, we can disagree without being disagreeable," said Kalonzo.
Kenya’s constitution-making process, the Wiper leader noted, was never been easy from the first efforts recorded by the Lancaster House Conference.
Wetang'ula warned Kenyans against name calling of the five judges.
"My advice to those in leadership is to remember in our court hierarchy we have layers of courts, those who are not happy, the Court of Appeal doors are open," he said.
The Ford-Kenya leader urged the political divide not to engage in name calling against the judges.
Mohamud impeachment: Be lenient with me, Wajir Governor pleads with senators
Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud pleaded with the Senate to spare him after the special committee upheld his impeachment by the County Assembly of Wajir over gross violation of the constitution.
While addressing the Senate on May 17 before the senators took a vote on his ouster, Governor Mohamud urged the Senators to be humane and give him a chance to serve the people of Wajir.
Mohamud said he might have violated the constitution, but the violation cannot be gross based on what his administration has achieved within the four years.
“I wish to plead with the Senate to be sympathetic and not use one aspect to oust me, let the Senate be humane and give us a chance so that we can serve our people,” he said.
In the health sector, where he is accused of failing to provide services leading to loss of lives, Governor Mohamud said his administration has built 50 health facilities and bought more ambulances for the county in the last four years.
“We have built over 50 health facilities in Wajir within the four years at least every ward has one dispensary or more. We also managed to buy more ambulances with 16 currently operational,” he said.
He said his officers in the health department gave adequate information on health status in Wajir and wondered why they were only picking on issues such as generator breakdowns to impeach him.
He said Wajir has had challenges of power in most of his facilities because of the use of generators instead of electricity.
“We are not on the national grid, we depend on generator driven by fuel, hence rampant breakdowns challenges,” he pleaded.
Governor Mohamud pleaded for leniency saying out of the 17 charges, only one was substantiated against him, adding that it meant they were frivolous.
The Senate committee had recommended Governor Mohamud over gross violation of the constitution.
The Nyamira Senator Okon’go Omogeni-chaired committee found that the Wajir county boss was guilty of gross violation of the Constitution by flouting the County Government Act, Public Procurement Act and Asset Disposal Act and the Public Finance Management Act.
The committee, however, absolved the governor of abuse of office and gross misconduct charges, saying the Members of County Assembly did not provide sufficient evidence.
The final vote on his proposed impeachment by the Senate will take place this evening.
Mohamud was impeached on Tuesday, April 27, after 37 MCAs voted in favour of his ouster, while 10 opposed his removal.
Senate suspends ouster debate for 15 minutes after Governor Mohamud falls ill
The Senate was forced to adjourn for 15 minutes during the impeachment hearing of Wajir Governor Mohamed Abdi Mohamud after he fell ill a few minutes before the debate started.
Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka suspended the session for 15 minutes following a request from Governor Mohamud’s legal team.
While making the request before the Senate on May 17, lead lawyer Ndegwa Njiru told the Senate that Governor Mohamud fell ill a few minutes before the debate started but was able to recover
“I spoke to him when the session began and he was slightly taken ill but was able to recover and is on his way here, we request 10 to 15 minutes,” he said.
Njiru while pleading with the Senate said it was the governor who was on trial and deserves to be heard
He said Governor Mohamud will be given at least five minutes to defend himself before his legal team can wrap up the defence.
“Once he arrives, he will be allocated five minutes to defend himself before the lawyers can summarise on the same,” he said.
While contributing to the request, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said it was normal for someone to fall ill more so when faced with things like an impeachment.
“It is not surprising to find anyone to fall ill in these difficult moments, we should find the right Standing Order to find how we can adjourn,” said Murkomen.
A senate committee had earlier recommended the removal of Wajir Governor Mohamud over gross violation of the constitution.
The Nyamira Senator Okon’go Omogeni-chaired committee found that the Wajir county boss was guilty of a gross violation of the Constitution by flouting the County Government Act, Public Procurement Act and Asset Disposal Act and the Public Finance Management Act.
The committee, however, absolved the governor from abuse of office and gross misconduct charges, saying the Members of County Assembly did not provide sufficient evidence.
The MCAs cited financial impropriety, abuse of office, gross misconduct and violation of the Constitution as grounds for his removal.
They accused the county boss of breaching Articles 235 of the Constitution, the County Government Act, and the Public Service Act by allegedly constantly reshuffling county officers
MCAs from eight county assemblies in Central have raised concern over the gains the region stands to lose should the appeal on the BBI ruling fail at the Court of Appeal.
Speaking in Nyeri on Monday, chairpersons of the assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committees (JLAC) said the region was expected to have the proposed 17 new constituencies.
The MCAs drawn from Nyeri, Nakuru, Tharaka Nithi, Muranga, Meru, Laikipia, Kiambu and Embu county assemblies expressed support for constitutional amendments saying this will increase the region's political representation at the county and national level
Nyeri JLAC chairperson Julia Wanjiku said: "These proposals would have seen the region closer to the one man, one vote, one shilling principle that is the foundation of democracy."
Further, Ms Wanjiku noted that the assemblies conducted more than 150 public participation forums where the BBI report received support of the people.
Mt Kenya JLAC caucus chair Stanley Karanja (MCA Naivasha East) said the proposed Ward Development Fund would have ensured development of the region.
"Currently governors decide which wards to develop and some wards are marginalised due to this situation. But BBI was proposing to ring-fence the ward funds and distribute about Sh20 million to each ward towards development," he said.
Karanja stated that central Kenya stands to lose close to Sh55 billion through increased allocation to counties from 15 per cent to 35 per cent.
"These are monies which would have enabled us to invest in healthcare, agriculture and roads," he said.
He noted that Nakuru County would have benefited from increased constituencies.
"Nakuru County would have gained at least five constituencies and this would have ensured money for development and fair representation in the county assembly," he stated.
Mwiyogo MCA Micheal Karuma asked for the courts to consider the fact that citizens overwhelmingly supported BBI proposals and gave MCAs the mandate to support the same in the county assemblies.
"The Court of Appeal should overturn the High Court ruling to protect the will of the people which was expressed through public participation process that the MCAs carried out," he said.
Senate committee recommends removal of Wajir Governor Abdi
The committee, however, absolved the governor from abuse of office and Gross Misconduct charges, saying the Members of County Assembly did not provide sufficient evidence.
The final vote on his proposed impeachment by the Senate takes place on Monday evening.
They accused the county boss of breaching Articles 235 of the Constitution, the County Government Act, and the Public Service Act by allegedly constantly reshuffling county officers.
They also faulted the governor for flouting the Public Procurement Act and Asset Disposal Act.
The Senate voted to have him tried in a committee with 28 senators voting in favour of the committee, 14 for plenary while two abstained.
Okong’o Omogeni was deputized by Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika in the 11-member committee.
The committee held sittings between Wednesday, May 12 and Thursday, May 13 before retreating to write the report over the weekend.
The report was tabled in a special sitting on Monday, May 17.
MCAs have faulted the High Court ruling that declared the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) null and void.
Speaking at a Nairobi hotel yesterday, caucus of MCAs leadership forum chair Meru MCA Victor Kareithi expressed disappointment in the Judges' decision.
Mr Kareithi argued that the court's decision amounts to taking away the sovereign power of Kenyans in amending the Constitution.
The MCAs insisted the BBI report was not a product of the Handshake but rather about the people.
“The judgment does not acknowledge that a Constitution is a living document that must be responsive to the needs and desires of a society at any given time,” they said.
The MCAs faulted the declaration that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) was not properly constituted and cannot conduct a referendum because it has no quorum after some commissioners resigned.
The judges ruled that all the actions taken by IEBC concerning the BBI Bill are null and void.
“We find it strange that the bench found that on one hand IEBC can transact business but on the other hand it cannot because of a statute that provides a quorum of five members. Clearly, the bench elevated a statute over the Constitution,” he said.
The MCAs faulted the declaration that the BBI process was not all-inclusive.
On Thursday, the judges ruled that a constitutional amendment through a popular initiative is only a preserve of the ordinary Kenyans and not the executive.
They declared that the BBI Taskforce was an unlawful entity.
“A Declaration is hereby made that being an unconstitutional and unlawful entity, the Steering Committee on the Implementation of the Building Bridges to a United Kenya Taskforce Report, has no legal capacity to initiate any action towards promoting constitutional changes,” the judges ruled.
Kareithi said all concerned parties had popularised the Bill and it received approval of county assemblies and Parliament.
“The secretariat popularised the Bill which was endorsed by over three million voters against the constitutional requirement. It was then approved by parliament. It’s imperative to note that before these approvals, these legislative bodies held over 100 national and county-based intensive public participation forums,” he said.
As BBI proponents head to Court of Appeal today the MCA’s said in the event the High Court decision is upheld, Kenyans stand to lose if allocation to counties remains at 15 per cent of the national revenue instead of the 35 per cent proposed in the Bill.
“The legislative gridlock inflow of Division of Revenue Bill and enactment of county Allocation of Revenue Acts will remain and therefore paralysis in running the county governments will remain a recurrent matter,” he said.
They further stated that 1,450 wards in Kenya will miss out on the proposed Ward Development Fund.
Drive to enlist UDA members heats up with focus on posts
Rift Valley politics is bracing for a shakeup as legislators allied to Deputy President William Ruto’s Jubilee Party prepare to jump ship to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party ahead of next year’s General Election.
The Standard on Sunday has established that governors, senators, MPs and MCAs are angling for positions in the new party, which they intend to use to either seek re-election or frustrate their rivals.
The political realignment has been triggered by a falling out between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto, who rode the crest of a wave of popularity in the Rift Valley to emerge victorious in the 2013 and 2017 elections.
With Ruto on record saying he may consider exiting Jubilee for UDA, whose national chairman is Johnstone Muthama, there has been manoeuvering behind the scenes to secure control of the party that has not gone down well with some of the DP’s supporters.
“We are aware of agents of disunity moving around hoodwinking people that they have the blessings of the deputy president to control affairs of UDA in counties. They have positioned people to take up positions as interim officials,” Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri told The Sunday Standard recently.
The MP, who is one of Ruto’s firm supporters, has been hosting delegations of elders, youth leaders and women at his Bahati home to popularise UDA and the ‘wheelbarrow’ agenda, which is aligned to Ruto’s ‘Hustler Nation’ movement.
As UDA embarks on a drive to register new members in the next two months to pave the way for elections, Mr Ngunjiri warned that political brokers are planning to hijack the party’s leadership at the grassroots.
He urged Mr Muthama to ensure all party activities are done transparently as the recruitment process continues.
Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said elected leaders from the region “are in agreement” that UDA is their party of choice in the next General Election. The UDA secretariat, he added, has already trained coordinators through a website that will be used to register members.
“We are excited over the ongoing exercise. Coordinators will do the outreach and members recruited virtually because of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. We target to register over 300,000 members in Nandi County alone,” said Mr Cherargei.
Aldai MP Cornelly Serem said the region is undergoing political change ahead of the elections.
“We are planning for our next home after the Jubilee debacle. Currently, we are registering members and then hold grassroots elections. All leaders are involved.”
Uasin Gishu UDA coordinator Paul Kiprop allayed fears that some officials are receiving preferential treatment in the new outfit.
He said those managing the party were doing so on a voluntary basis to mobilise support and strengthen it ahead of the elections.
“In Uasin Gisu County, Soy MP Caleb Kositany and his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi are championing party issues. There are still challenges of resources and we call on UDA supporters to assist in fostering it,” Mr Kiprop said.
The Rift Valley–once a Kanu bedrock–has witnessed shifting political party allegiances in the past two decades.
The region stood by ODM in 2007, URP in 2013, and Jubilee in 2017.
“The problem that leads to a transition in parties is mistrust and inconsistency in party leadership. We would not be having UDA membership registration at the moment if Jubilee was consistent and stuck to its manifesto,” said Kiprop.
Mr Sudi, one of the DP’s fiercest defenders, predicted that the Rift Valley will be ‘placed under lock and key’ by Ruto’s camp ahead of the 2022 polls.
“Everyone wants to identify with UDA since it is a party with a good future. Its popularity is growing by the day. In the next five months, we will have hit even greater heights.”
In Narok County, Emurua Dikir MP Johana Ngeno said that although he was elected on a Kanu ticket, he would be the first to jump ship and join UDA.
It is an open secret that we will be moving to UDA when the time is right.
I am currently busy ensuring that my constituents register as members of UDA for the June party grassroots elections.
Besides the ongoing mass registration of members, Ruto allies have been wooing some of the deputy president’s critics in the Rift Valley to return to the fold.
Former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto has been reeled in and has been instrumental in spearheading the ‘wheelbarrow’ agenda in the South Rift region.
Close allies of the deputy president told The Sunday Standard that plans are underway to welcome back former powerful Internal Security Permanent Secretary Zakayo Cheruiyot and West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo.
Analysts have, however, warned that Independence-party Kanu could give UDA a run for its money.
Gitile Naituli, a professor of management and leadership at Multimedia University, said there are signs party chairman Gideon Moi will enter into an alliance with like-minded leaders thus thrusting him at the centre of the Uhuru succession matrix.
BBI judgment: Uhuru's worst nightmare since Maraga's 2017 shocker
President Uhuru Kenyatta has been exposed politically by Thursday’s High Court ruling, which could trigger a litany of suits and a possible bid for impeachment.
The five-judge Bench accused the president of violating chapter six of the Constitution, after consolidating cases from several litigants challenging the constitutional review process through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI).
Yesterday, ICPK director Ndungu Wainaina said the BBI process could not be salvaged after the ruling, adding that the judges had made it clear that the basic structure doctrine limits the amendment power.
“The basic structure can only be amended by the primary constituent process,” said Wainaina.
During the ruling, the judges also said civil court proceedings can be instituted against the president.
Legal experts yesterday said President Kenyatta’s remaining tenure could be in limbo, legally.
They said unless the judgment is overturned on appeal, the finding by the five judges was a clarification of the law that the president should observe the limits set by the Constitution and the law.
However, lawyer Kibe Mungai said although the verdict can be the reason for impeachment, it will be a herculean task because the president enjoys majority support in both houses of Parliament.
“It is not very new, it is a clarification that the president can be sued in his personal capacity and not about his functions, for example, if a president is to rob a bank, he will be sued as an individual and not as a president. That is the correct interpretation in most countries. That is proper finding,” said Mungai.
The five judges were of the view that the President is only protected from such actions in respect of anything done or not done in the exercise of their powers under this Constitution.
“Assuming, in his tenure, the President embarks on a mission that is not only clearly in violation of the Constitution but is also destructive to the nation, would it not be prudent that he should be stopped in his tracks rather than wait until the lapse of his tenure by which time the country may have tipped over the cliff?” they posed.
The judges were determining President Kenyatta’s role in the BBI process.
However, the court is split on if he was justified or had powers to appoint the BBI task force.
On one hand, Justice John Mativo said the president was right, while the other judges found that he had breached Chapter Six of the Constitution.
“The President cannot be said to have acted ultra vires the Constitution. He acted intra vires in taking steps to achieve this noble constitutional requirement. The President’s decision meets both the proportionality and rationality tests which are core requirements for the decision to pass the principle of legality test,” Justice Mativo ruled on the formation of the BBI task force.
Yesterday, a senior counsel who sought anonymity, said President Kenyatta did not act out of the blues in forming the BBI task force.
He also argues that by the Judiciary participating in the process, it had given its thumb of approval.
“The Judiciary participated in the BBI process. They for example, sought for extension of the time of hearing of the presidential petition. How can the Judiciary participate in the process and then turn around and say the president should be impeached for it?” he posed.
Lawyer Jackson Awele said if there are different interpretations on the President’s role from the High Court, then it is for the Court of Appeal to iron them out.
“If there are issues which are not in sync, it will be for the Court of Appeal to harmonise them,” Awele said.
Notably, it is the second time that the High Court has found that President Kenyatta can be sued in person.
In the first case, involving the swearing of 41 judges, High Court judges George Dulu, William Musyoka and James Wakiaga found that the Constitution does not shield the president from being dragged into a constitutional or judicial review court even when in office.
The three judges, however, pointed out that he should not be sued in person but through the Attorney General.
Yesterday, Law Society of Kenya (LSK) president Nelson Havi said the 321-page judgment is an indictment to President Kenyatta.
He said the breach of the Constitution was a serious issue that he can be personally held accountable for.
According to him the judge’s reference to the President as Mr Uhuru also amounted to stripping him of his status as Head of State.
There is no decision of the High Court that is as clear on the misconduct of the President as this one.
"On the judges’ appointment, they just said if he had just breached the Constitution, if it were in Israel or India, he would have resigned. You realised they have referred to him as Mr Kenyatta; they have stripped him the stature of a President. Unfortunately, Parliament is emasculated and will not impeach him but it will go a long way to dent his image as a leader,” Havi said.
But early in the week, President Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga had rallied the National Assembly and the Senate to overwhelmingly endorse the BBI Bill, setting the stage for a constitutional review.
Only a public endorsement through a referendum was awaiting until the High Court’s shock ruling on Thursday.
The push for law review began with their March 9, 2018 Handshake, following the controversial 2017 presidential elections.
But the journey to change the 2010 Constitution has not been rosy, after the BBI received a lukewarm reception from Deputy President William Ruto, a voracious civil society that sought to derail the process and then the Covid-19 pandemic, coped with a struggling economy.
After the BBI sailed through in Parliament, both Speakers said they were preparing to hand over the Bill to President Kenyatta.
“We have finished our role and are waiting for the President to give us an appointment so that we can jointly present the Bill,” said Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka. His National Assembly counterpart Justin Muturi said they had cleared their part.
“The staff are going through typos and referencing errors before booking an appointment with the president,” said Muturi.
But there had been another hurdle to the process.
In February, a five-judge Bench had barred President Kenyatta from assenting to the Bill should it be passed by the bicameral Parliament.
Thirdway Alliance lawyers had applied to have the National Assembly and the Senate barred from acting on the resolutions by county assemblies.
They ruled that the amendments would not come into force until determination of the petitions challenging the process.
Justices Joel Ngugi, George Odunga, Jairus Ngaah, Chacha Mwita and Teresiah Matheka issued the orders following an application by Thirdway Alliance, a week ago in Nakuru.
Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, who has been spearheading the unity talks and the clamour for a Coast political party accused MPs of frustrating his efforts.
With unity talks on the brink of collapse, the Coast Region is perhaps coming full circle, with its leadership repeating the errors that have for decades hindered the desired political unity.
It has emerged that traditional turf wars, mistrust or selfishness among Coast leaders and the influence of upcountry votes have impeded the region’s quest to unite ahead of next year’s elections.
Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi, who has been spearheading the unity talks and the clamour for a Coast political party or coalition, appears to have thrown in the towel, accusing MPs of frustrating his efforts.
“I have tried to bring Coast MPs for talks but some have been uneasy with the idea,” said Kingi, adding that the unity talks have been misconstrued to be his personal political agenda.
The signs of the collapse of the talks emerged in early April after Kingi and his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Joho held parallel meetings with Coast leaders.
On April 9, talks between Kingi and officials of fringe parties in the region also hit a snag over the differences on whether they should dissolve and merge into a single party or form a coalition.
After a two-day meeting at Mnarani Hotel in Kilifi, the officials of Kadu Asili, Shirikisho Party of Kenya and Umoja Summit Party of Kenya (USPK) rejected Kingi’s push for them to dissolve.
Former Cabinet Minister Morris Dzoro, who is the Shirikisho Party leader, Kadu Asili Chairman Joshua Kombora and his USPK counterpart Matano Chengo have vowed never to dissolve the parties.
But Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya appears to have revived the talks.
However, in a recent interview, he delinked his meetings with the leadership of the fringe parties to Kingi’s plans.
Although Joho, Kingi and Mvurya have held several meetings, they all appear to be reading from different scripts.
Joho has vowed to unite Coast under ODM, Kingi through a new party while Mvurya hopes to rally the region behind Deputy President William Ruto.
Coast MPs, on the other hand, accuse Kingi of failing to articulate the agenda of his proposed political pact.
“In as much as we embrace the idea of Coast unity, we cannot be subjected to uncalled for intimidation by agents of mistrust and individualism,” said Ganze MP Teddy Mwambire.
Mwambire, who is also the Secretary of the Coast Parliamentary Group, said Kingi should go back to the drawing board and “clear the grey areas”.
Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir said Kingi failed to tell the Coast what the new political party stands for, claiming that “he wanted to use it for his personal gains”.
The idea of the Coast party has over the years sparked apprehension among upcountry voters in the region, largely due to the region’s history on majimbo or federalism ideologies.
These ideologies were blamed for 1997, 2005 and 2012 xenophobic killings of non-locals by criminal gangs like the Kaya Bombo, Mlungu Nipe and the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC).
In 2017 polls, eight of the 30 MCAs elected in Mombasa trace their ancestry to counties outside Coast. This was an increase from five in 2013.
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) records also show that five of the 12 nominated MCAs in Mombasa have an upcountry lineage. In 2013 they were two.
Statistics show that the number of aspirants from the upcountry vote bloc, who contested for various seats in Mombasa, grew in the 2017 elections compared to 2013.
“It could be a good or bad thing. It is also breeding clannism that has exposed us to manipulation like in the last elections,” said Evans Mayaka.
Mayaka, who unsuccessfully vied for the Shanzu Ward seat in 2017, said there has been a sharp rise of upcountry voters in most parts of Mombasa, leading to an increase in the number of aspirants.
Prof Hassan Mwakimako of Pwani University says because of the increasing number of active upcountry voters, Coast leaders are forced to remain loyal to parties from outside the region.
For instance, he said, in Lamu West Constituency, aspirants from political parties with roots in central Kenya have a headstart because of the Mpeketoni vote bloc.
Dominated by the Kikuyu community, Mpeketoni boasts of over 17,000 voters that influence the elections in Lamu West and Lamu County in general.
Mwakimako said in Mombasa, leaders align themselves with either ODM or Wiper because of the high number of Luo, Luhya, Kamba and Kisii voters.
“The upcountry vote is not unified but in urban areas like Mombasa and where there is a significant population, it is a sway vote because they add the tally for politicians allied to them,” he said.
The sentiments were echoed by Prof Halim Shauri who said upcountry voters usually vote with their compatriots in their areas of origin, hence Coast has a hard time dropping upcountry parties.
Shauri said the upcountry voters are “faithful” to their ethnic leaders, but politicians from the region should go an extra mile, including alignment to political parties, to win them.
Promoters of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) have instructed their lawyers to file an appeal at the Court of Appeal next week and exuded confidence of success, adding that they believe the process is people driven.
Ongwae has won this cup coming off a great performance for the Kenya Morans at the Afrobasket qualifiers played in Cameroon earlier this year in February.
This is after his buzzer-beating jump shot over Angola earned Kenya a historic slot in the 2021 Afrobasket Championship to be held in Rwanda where Kenya has not been participating for the past 27-years.
Last month, Ongwae was voted the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya (SJAK) for the month of January and February.
He beat reigning Safari Rally and Kenya champion Baldev Chager to the February award.
He was also named in the FIBA Africa Top 10 list of players after leading Morans with team-highs of 14.8 points and 4.2 assists and was the team's second leading-rebounder with 7.2 boards in five games.
Ongwae joined the Bakken Bears in 2018 from Swiss outfit SAM Basket having also played for Taranaki Mountainairs in New Zealand and Italy for Felice Scandone and in Sweden where he turned out for Södertälje Kings.
Ongwae will today(Tuesday) be heading into the Danish League playoffs where Bakken Bears will face Elite Basketball Akademi Aarhus (EBAA) in the quarterfinals.
Basketball: Lakeside shock defending champions Ulinzi in Kisumu
Kisumu Lakeside registered their first win of the season after a shocking 61-59 win over defending champions Ulinzi Warriors in an entertaining Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League match played at Manyatta Arabs Primary School in Kisumu on Saturday.
Lakeside captain Silas Guya scored a season-high 16 points as the hosts broke a four-game losing streak with their star player Trevor Gari watching from the bench with a groin injury.
Point guard Sila Awuor followed with another season-high 16 points and nine assists as forward Marco Odhiambo registered a double-double of 10 points and 10 rebounds.
Ulinzi with Kenya national team players Victor Bosire, Eric Mutoro and James Mwangi could not match the lakeside team as they registered their first defeat of the season.
Point guard Victor Bosire led for the Warriors with 19 points followed by William Ochieng with 18 points as Erick Mutoro and James Mwangi registered eight points each.
The host dominated the first two quarters, leading 20-17 and 15-12 respectively before Ulinzi came back into the game with an impressive 20-13 score in the third quarter.
The Kisumu based team however left it late by edging out the champions 13-10 to narrowly win the match by a bucket in the final quarter.
Lakeside started the game on a high note with Awuor hitting two consecutive dagger threes to finish the first quarter with 11 points followed by Justus Okitoyi and Kennedy Okumu with seven and two points respectively to lead the quarter 20-17.
Forward Odhiambo came in hard in the second quarter dropping eight points as Ulinzi struggled to convert from the three-point line which allowed Lakeside to take a six-point lead at the break with the scores at 35-29.
The defending champions however responded with four consecutive threes shared equally by Mutoro and Bosire in the third quarter and Ochieng adding five more as Ulinzi took the lead for the first time in the match leading 49-48 by the end of the quarter.
In the final quarter, captain Guya took matters into his own hands to seal the win with nine points as Odhiambo added four points to narrowly win 61-59 after Mutoro missed a late layup to send the game to overtime.
Speaking after the win, Lakeside coach Brian Lusaga congratulated his players for not giving up in the last quarter, saying they are just getting started.
“We believed in ourselves from the start and that was clear after coming out on top in the first, second and final quarters. This is a good win against a talented Ulinzi side and this result will really boost us going forward,” Lusaga told the Standard Sports.
Coming into the game, Ulinzi had beaten Blades, Eldonets, KCA-University and Umoja while Lakeside had lost their first four matches against EMYBA, Thunder, Eldonets and KPA.
Lakeside seek redemption as they tackle Ulinzi Warriors
Kisumu Lakeside will be seeking redemption when they host defending champions, Ulinzi Warriors in a Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League match to be played at Manyatta Arabs Primary School in Kisumu.
Lakeside have lost all four matches against EMYBA, Thunder, Eldonets and KPA but head coach Brian Lusaga is optimistic they can grind their first win against Ulinzi Warriors.
Speaking to The Standard Sport, Lusaga said the new signings in the team are yet to stabilise, but was impressed by their performances in their last two games.
“The team is hungry for wins, we have worked on our offence which had so many turnovers. It’s a long season though and we expect to turn things around.
“We do respect every opponent, and in as much as they are the defending champions we all on the same league and we believe in ourselves,” said Lusaga.

However, Lakeside have been dealt a huge blow after losing top scorer Trevor Gari to injury.
NBA-Players protest racial injustice as league returns to action
NBA teams bowed their heads and knelt during the playing of the U.S. national anthem while wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts on Thursday as the league returned for the first time since the coronavirus halted play in March with two thrilling games.
Coaches and game officials joined players from the Utah Jazz, New Orleans Pelicans and Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers in taking a knee to protest against racial injustice and police brutality in the first games in 140 days.
Black Lives Matter was also written on the courts at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, where the NBA plans to finish its season with 22 teams inside a bio-secure bubble.
"The game of basketball has always been bigger than just the ball, the rim, 10 guys on the floor and referees," the Lakers LeBron James said after hitting the game-winning shot in his team's 103-101 win over the Clippers.
"It's an opportunity to use this platform to spread a lot of positivity and love throughout the whole world."
He said that while there has been progress in the fight against systemic racism, the key was to maintain the momentum.
"We want to keep our foot on the gas," he said. "We're dealing with a lot of racism, a lot of social injustice and a lot of police brutality, not only in my neighborhood and not only with Black people, but with all people of color."
Some players had messages like "Equality," "Education Reform" and "Say Their Names" on the backs of their jerseys in place of their names.
Athletes from around the world have united behind anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody in Minneapolis in May.
In the first game, the Jazz came from behind to defeat the Pelicans 106-104 after the Pelicans' Brandon Ingram's three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.
The games are being played without fans, but "virtual fans" appeared on LED screens wrapped around the court and a simulation of a crowd's cheers and jeers could be heard.
How NBA restart today will work
The NBA relaunches its 2019-2020 season today with 22 teams based inside a secure “bubble” at Disney World in Florida due to complete the remainder of the campaign.
Here AFP looks at some of the key questions and issues surrounding the unprecedented restart:
From the moment the NBA season was halted in March after the pandemic brought the United States to a standstill, the NBA began looking at the question of how or if the season could be restarted safely.
The logistical challenges of restarting the season in its existing format, with large travelling groups of players and support staff jetting in and out of multiple cities at a time was deemed a non-starter in the era of Covid-19.
Instead the NBA began exploring the feasibility of basing all teams at a single location, creating a giant quarantined safe zone or “bubble” and completing the season there.
Las Vegas and Orlando quickly emerged as the front-runners, with the NBA eventually opting for the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as the best venue.
Twenty-two teams are now based in the campus, with players requiring to test negative for Covid-19 twice after arrival before being allowed to enter.
Team and NBA personnel are staying in three hotels dotted throughout the complex, with a small number of media, sponsors and inactive players.
Games will take place without fans at three different venues on the complex.
In the early weeks of the restart, no guests will be allowed although those rules will be relaxed once the playoffs start.
After the first round of the playoffs, players will be allowed to reserve one hotel room each for guests, who will be required to self-quarantine for seven days.
Any guests entering the bubble must also test negative twice for Covid-19 in the 72 hours before entering.
Any guests testing positive will not be allowed to enter.
Those guests who are admitted will be required to undergo daily testing.
Players are allowed to leave the bubble in exceptional circumstances but face a mandatory four days in quarantine before being readmitted.
Players must also undergo daily testing when they leave the site.
The regulations have already tripped up two NBA players -- the Los Angeles Clippers’ Lou Williams was ordered to serve a 10-day quarantine after visiting an Atlanta strip club during a family emergency leave.
Williams was photographed at an Atlanta strip club which he said he visited to get some take out food.
Richuan Holmes of the Sacramento Kings was also hit with a 10-day quarantine order after leaving the campus to pick up a delivery of chicken wings.
LeBron James joked that leaving his home to enter the bubble was like “heading to do a bid” -- a slang term for starting a prison sentence.
But since arriving in Orlando, most players have adjusted to life in their tightly controlled environment.
Many have installed creature comforts from home including giant televisions and video game consoles.
A Twitter account -- @nbabubblelife -- which documents the daily activities of NBA players based in Orlando has quickly amassed a large following, depicting players doing everything from getting haircuts to playing golf or fishing.
Despite being inside the bubble, players are still required to follow conventions such as social distancing and wearing face coverings.
Players are also barred from entering each other’s rooms.
Twenty-two teams will complete the season -- 13 from the Western Conference and nine from the Eastern Conference.
Invited teams include the 16 franchises who were in the playoff positions when the league halted play in March, plus six teams that were six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in each conference.
Teams will start off with seeding games to determine the final playoff line-up, with the playoffs starting on August 17, when each round will be best of seven.
Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans reportedly are working together on a plan to kneel during the national anthem and show support for the Black Lives Matter movement before they square off.
ESPN’s Malika Andrews cited sources Tuesday night saying that the Jazz and Pelicans players are adamant about presenting a united front tonight.
Kenyan film 'Softie' picked for Peabody awards
Kenyan film ‘Softie’ has been nominated for the 2021 Peabody Awards in another cheer for the 2020 hit documentary.
The Peabody Awards Board of Jurors based at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia announced its 60 nominees representing “the most compelling and empowering stories released in broadcasting and streaming media” in 2020.
From more than 1,300 submissions for the prestigious award, only 60 stories were selected and ‘Softie’ made the cut.
When the news of the nomination broke, ‘Softie’ director Sam Soko was ecstatic, writing on Facebook: “I am so proud of our fantastic Softie the film team... Mad love to the crew, incredible supporters, and Boniface and Njeri Mwangi (the subjects of the film). Thank you! Congratulations to the other amazing nominees.”
The Peabody Awards honour excellence in storytelling that reflects the social issues and the emerging voices.
“It is really exciting to be nominated because it means this is an African story that has reached a global audience. A good story has no colour or race. We are honoured to be among other honourable nominees and we hope to win,” said Boniface Mwangi.
Speaking to The Standard last year as the film won accolade after accolade, Soko said the hit documentary started as a simple idea.
“When we stared it was not meant to be a documentary. We were just filming the process of the protests he was leading in 2013. It was sort of supposed to be a how-to-guide. Like an activism manual. Something short that could go on Youtube and that would be it,” he said.
But as time went on we realised it was very interesting to see what happens behind the scenes when Boni does something.
Yes, he is an activist, but he is also a father and a husband and there are demands made of him for those roles.
We never actually get to see the consequences.
The Peabody Board of Jurors announced this year’s crop of nominees on May 4, listing ‘Softie’ alongside ‘Athlete A’ and ‘Disclosure’ among 16 others in the documentaries segment.
When he and his family get death threats, that this is what it actually means.
HBO’s 'I May Destroy You', Amazon Studios’ 'Small Axe', and Showtime’s 'The Good Lord Bird' also received recognition from Peabody, as did CBS’ 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert'.
Peabody Awards winners will be announced in June and the organisation plans to honor this year’s nominees, as it did last year, via a virtual event.
Chakacha got resurgent interest from dancer Princess Farida via her pelvic pirouette in transparent waist wrap around, paving way for solo artiste, Nyota Ndogo (Mwanaisha Abdallah), who infused pop to create an urban Taarab and Chakacha beat in the 2000s.
That notwithstanding, Chakacha has rarely been copied by musicians beyond the coast, like say benga which was adapted by musicians from Western, Eastern and Central Kenya.
Even Them Mushrooms and Nyota Ndogo moving and pitching tent in Nairobi did not give Chakacha an urban appeal.
But why did this genre, which borrows from Swahili, Arab and Persian belly-dancing influences, remain rooted at the coast?
Never mind that the most popular Kenyan songs are from the coast: Malaika, the global evergreen was by Grant Charo and Fadhili Williams.
Jambo Bwana, Kenya’s signature tourist song has been recorded by Them Mushrooms and Safari Sounds-whose Best of African Songs album was the first to go Platinum and remains one of the greatest-selling.
Among the first Kenyan musicians to climb the Billboard charts in Europe was Mombasa’s Kelly Brown (Mohammed Abdulkadir Ali Bux) with his 1980 hit, Higher
With such rich legacy, why did Chakacha not spread to other parts of Kenya? There are many reasons, including culture, religion, perceptions, colonialism and changing musical tastes.
Culturally, Chakacha was specific to women and dancing was a central element. “Men (were) not allowed to dance Chakacha and a man was considered gay when found dancing Chakacha,” says Dr Donald Otoyo, director, Permanent Presidential Music Commission.
Again, Chakacha required a live band whose members had dexterity with coastal instruments most of them percussive like the chapuo, the msondo drums, the marimba and wind ones like the siwa trumpet.
Matters were made worse by their near zero mastery of coastal music song craft of messages couched in proverbs and belted out in lilting Kiswahili accent.
In Sura Yako, all-boy band Sauti Sol borrowed Chakacha beats but that’s as far as its influence went.
Chakacha is also hardly played even when national days are held in Mombasa.
Dr Otoyo explains that “as a commission, we promote Chakacha in the right settings. We use music for the right space, on a national day there are some music we can’t play, not because we do not support them but because it doesn’t suit the occasion. Music has to go with the occasion.”
Philip Tuju, the founder of Red Fourth Chorus says Chakacha failed to take root beyond Mombasa because musicians who made it popular deviated to other genres: Safari Sounds still does the beach hotel music circuit but mostly plays popular cover versions and not Chakacha inspired songs like Pole Pole and Lala Salama that made them popular in the 1970s.
Mombasa Roots, which gave us Mama Sofia, all but fizzled out leaving Them Mushrooms whose last shot at recording was its Zilizopendwa compilation - more suited to easy listening than dancing.
Then there are historical reasons. Prof Larry Gumbe, an engineer and lay music historian argues in Shades of Benga Online that British constructing the Uganda Railway from 1895 entrenched colonialism which opened up Kenya’s hinterland to urbanity and with it, the spread of music.
Secular artist Nyota Ndogo perform on stage during Kenyan Love story festival at KICC court yard on 10th February 2018
Missionaries not only taught music but also consumed it but it was mostly European music, and even when they invited bands, they played the British Foxtrot.
Society was also segregated and Africans were left out.
That the British hired Indians and not the coastal people as railway builders did not help in spreading Chakacha.
In Shades of Benga Online, Bettina Ng’weno, an Associate Professor of African-American studies at the University of California, Davis, says Kenya’s State of Emergency in 1950s Nairobi also influenced the spread of music.
Movement of people was restricted. These restrictions enabled the dominant sound to emerge, not from Mombasa, but towns surrounding Nairobi like Murang’a and Ukambani.
The British controlled recording studios and were more charitable to politically friendly communities like the Luo who worked at railways, explains Prof Gumbe adding that this allowed musicians from Luo Nyanza to thrive with their versions of rhumba.
This eclipsed other regions and genres which was not helped by the fact that “Kenyans were also picking World Music from Afro Cuban, Caribbean, South Africa’s Kwela and Congolese influences,” says Prof Ng’weno.
Ngala Chome, a writer and historian, says colonialism was largely spread through Christianity which overshadowed Islam and the dominant music was thus European.
Chome argues that Christianity became the cultural frame for those who could not enter the “Arab-Swahili-Indian Ocean imagination” and this also influenced their musical choices, besides perceptions of the Swahili as more Arab than African.
Music also spread to the masses via radio but VoK (now KBC) English Service playing mostly European music and the programming did not help matters: Breakfast Club, Lunchtime Music, Beat Time, Sundowner and Late Date according to Elizabeth Omollo, the first homespun woman broadcaster in December 1970.
In Shades of Benga Online, Omollo says “we were not allowed to play African music,” as listeners were largely mzungus. “We played jazz, classical, country, ballet, opera and instrumental music.”
Something else: Chakacha, for its sensual dance moves, was banned from the Kenya Music Festivals in the 1990s.
Yet, Chakacha is not Chakacha without the suggestive belly dancing and gyration of hips.
Tuju reckons that besides the absence of heavy hitter coastal bands, banning Chakacha from the Kenya Music Festivals did not help matters.
Dr Isaiah Oyugi, chair, department of music and dance at Kenyatta University terms Chakacha as a style of music and dance performed as a ritual exclusive to coastal girls who were ripe for marriage.
Being banned from the Kenya Music Festival, he argues, was to restrict it to a community which understood it as others would have misinterpreted its essence.
Students are also not the ideal audience as Chakacha was for girls ripe for spousal picking and in music festivals.
“The guidelines of music calls for them to perform a cultural song in its authentic way, which in the case of Chakacha is not something we want to communicate to the public,” says Dr Oyugi adding that “Chakacha was like a rite of passage, practised by the Amu of Lamu in seclusion.
Dr Otoyo also explains that Chakacha had religious connotations as Muslims separated genders such that men and women hardly gathered in the same place.
It was thus wrong to play it in clubs as “a song and a dance meant for one person was now being practised in front of over 100 men, and for the purpose of looking more sexual, women adopted a very transparent outfit for this dance, which initially was something more like a leso.
The exaggeration made it unfit for the public and even the music festivals,” where a Class Two pupil would also be watching a performer with a kibwebwe tied to the waist, gyrating suggestively.
Barissa Dhidha, senior music instructor department of music at Kenyatta University adds: “Chakacha is banned in music festivals because it is inappropriate for an elderly examiner to watch a sensual dance by students, it does not bring out the moral value.”
Street art: Loud message by unseen faces
Graffiti with encouraging words against Coronavirus pandemic at a wall along Coast General Hospital in Mombasa County.
Street art and graffiti have been used as channels of communicating important socio-political messages.
One good example is when Boniface Mwangi, the photographer and activist, and his peers from Pawa254 took to the streets using graffiti as a tool of public protests.
They drew controversial murals that portrayed the nation’s political elite as vultures preying on its citizens in a movement called ‘maVultures.’
This art has given birth to Nairobi’s new kings of graffiti and street art such as Bankslave, Daddo, Swift9, Smoki, Uhuru, Mr Detail, Chela, and Serm1 among others who have become a household name in the industry. Bankslave, was once referred to as “the founding father of Kenyan graffiti” by CNN.
Nowadays, it is not uncommon to find murals addressing all manner of topics on Nairobi streets. One of the popular groups that have cemented its authority in this sector is Spray Uzi crew.

“We met at WAPI (an underground hip-hop platform and movement) in 2006 as individual artists. We later collaborated on a couple of projects painting in different neighbourhoods and eventually formed a crew to work on bigger projects,” says Swift9, a member.
However, by the very nature of what they do, a lot of these artists have to remain anonymous.
Graffiti is after all rooted in breaking rules.
Its close sibling street art is, however, at most times commissioned or painted with permission.
Street art is also sometimes used to include graffiti.
“Using official government names kills the mystery behind the art and so does it do in exposing us to unlikely enemies, something we are weary of,” says Swift9, who declines to give his official name.
“Using pseudo names sometimes give artists the freedom of being cheeky and mischievous without their identity being in the public,” adds Daddo, a 23-year-old Nairobi-based graffiti artist and muralist.
“I use art to convey messages about our society. This is what I do to educate and reflect on both the good and bad. To me, graffiti is a way of life,” Daddo says.
He says graffiti allows him to express his creative side. “To me graffiti is a medium which I use to advocate social change, protest and expression of a certain community desire. So you can imagine how impactful it is out here.”

Some organisations working in informal settlements have been using street artists as advocates for change.
Joel Bergner, popularly known as Joel Artista is a muralist and an educator who creates large-scale works of art with the participation of young people and communities around the world.
He is the co-founder and co-director of Artolution which organises community-based public art initiatives.
In 2013, they organised and led the ‘Kibera Walls for Peace Initiative’ in collaboration with the Kibera Hamlets youth organisation.
“The Kibera Walls for Peace youth public art project aimed to encourage unity and cooperation between ethnic and political groups ahead of 2013 elections.
Kibera was strongly affected by the violence and political turmoil that engulfed Kenya after the previous election, so preventing a repeat of the crisis was their main objective,” writes Joel Artista on his website, www.joelartista.com.
The project involved peace-building workshops with local children and teenagers and the creation of a series of street paintings that promoted peace.
The initiative included a collaboration with local graffiti artists for the “Peace Train,” in which the artists and the youth painted a 10-car passenger train with art aimed at easing ethnic tensions.
However, this venture is not a walk in the park.
Graffiti is somewhat viewed as vandalism therefore most artistes do this in secret.
Working in small but well-knit groups, they meet with their sponsors and come up with topics.
Despite all the challenges, street art is becoming popular, creating a reprieve for young artists who feel at ease working in bigger groups where more funding and protection is assured.
Expensive art
“Graffiti is very expensive. Unless we are working with a big organisation, most of the murals we create are funded through sale of merchandise such as T-shirts and canvas art. They advance the art and are also a source of revenue for the artists.
“Sometimes, we secure funding in form of grants from donors and other non-governmental organisations,” says Swift9.
Spray cans cost between Sh300 and Sh800per piece.
“These murals bring people together; raise awareness and give people time to reflect on what the art is communicating.
This isn’t always achieved verbally, especially by people from different demographics but the murals communicate to everyone regardless of their backgrounds,” he says.
When subscription video on demand (SVOD) started there was resistance towards it, not any more.
Now, with working from home becoming the norm, more business and other key operations going remote, video on demand has taken off, especially for local TV shows and films.
Could the future of films and movies move online entirely?
Big production houses still have some reservations, preferring the old tried and tested ways.
One of the most anticipated movies of 2020, then 2021: No Time to Die, a James Bond’s film series, has delayed their release due to the potential losses they could make if they decide to exclusively premier it on streaming video on demand as opposed to cinema releases.
However, locally, film makers and show runners are increasingly preferring to have their films on streaming platforms.
Employing a localisation strategy, Showmax now shows a host of different genres of Kenyan TV shows for all ages.
A few of the most loved shows by its users are; Sol Family, Selina and Njoro wa Uba among others.
The past year, despite challenges caused by Covid-19 across the world, has not been all gloom for Kenyan filmmakers.
Over the past year, there has been a clear appetite for fresh African content to star on global streaming platforms like Netflix.
The Kenyan originals; Poacher, Sincerely Daisy, Disconnect and 40 Sticks all premiered on the platform.
And this seems like something that will be happening more and more.
Realness Institute and Netflix now have a new partnership on episodic content development set to spur more African originals like Queen Sono and Blood & water.
The lab is open to writers in Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria with Film and TV experience in any genre (fictional or factual) or language.
“At Netflix, we believe that great stories come from anywhere and can be loved everywhere. We strongly believe that Africa has a wealth of untold stories,” says Kenya’s Dorothy Ghettuba, Netflix’s lead for African Original Series.
Kenyan writer, director and show-runner Jennifer Gatero streamed her series This is Life exclusively on its website, a distribution method she was experimenting with.
“I chose independent streaming because I had the chance to distribute the work myself and independently reach the audience without the help of a network. I learnt a lot including that it is possible but it is much harder,” she says.
Award-winning actress Brenda Wairimu, who has been in a number of top Kenyan productions, urges viewers to offer support for the creatives and Kenyan films.
“Embrace our own. Watch Kenyan content. I’m not saying blindly accept mediocre, but give our art the benefit of the doubt,” she says.
Cameroon makes its debut on global streaming platform Netflix
Most of the murals in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu use a mixture of imagery and text.
They address societal ills such as tribalism, greed, corruption and bad governance.
I have always loved painting and through art, I have always expressed my feelings and the truth about my environment.
Dhidha reckons banning Chakacha from the Music Festivals was not what prevented it from spreading beyond the Coast, rather, musicians “looked at other genres and moved from Chakacha, others might have just gone separate ways because the band leader formed his own group.”
Being in the limelight can be tough, especially when family, friends, fans and the world expect you to be perfect and not have days under the weather.
Everyone is fighting battles that those placing high expectations on them may never know anything about.
Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka trended after she withdrew from the 2021 French Open held at Stade Roland Garros in Paris from May 30 to June 13.
In a post on her social media, Osaka said she had been struggling with anxiety and depression, thus she was not able to attend press briefings on the tournament as per the contract.
“I’ve often felt that people have no regard for athletes’ mental health, and this rings very true whenever I see a press conference or partake in one, “she said.
After facing backlash, she later explained her struggle with depression and anxiety. “The truth is I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.”
On May 30, Kenyan rugby player Dennis Ombachi opened up about being bi-polar and struggling with depression.
“I am Dennis Ombachi, kind of an international rugby player and a guy who’s passionate about cooking. What many people don’t know is that I am medically diagnosed with bi-polar disorder,” he said on his twitter account.
Ombachi said he could miss flights and was always blamed, yet he was struggling.
“For many years, I have struggled with this and depression. I would usually disappear from social media and occasionally miss flights when I had made the national team. This behaviour was always blamed on me “just being Dennis”. What my coaches and teammates didn’t know was the kind of pain I was in,” Ombachi said.
He said he chose to share his story because many people are not willing to discuss mental health. “I advise those with a similar problem as mine to seek professional help.”
This was after signing a lucrative deal for Indianapolis Colts.
He added: “I’ve had spells with therapists, psychiatrists and spent time at mental health wellness centres. Thank God for my friends. They, too, can sigh with relief and now answer truthfully when people ask them; “where’s Dennis?”
In 2013, sportsman Daniel Adongo, 23, became the first Kenyan to ever play in the National Football League (NFL) in US.
But last year, Kenyans were shocked when Adongo shared videos of himself smoking what appeared to be marijuana and holding a bottle.
Adongo’s health was not looking good in the videos.
Things started going south for Adongo in 2015 when he was suspended from the NFL following accusations of domestic violence.
Reports had it that Adongo assaulted a woman whose identity was not immediately revealed.
The family of the former Sharks, Vodacom Bulls and Kings player, who looked set to take the world by storm, called for calm saying they were taking care of him after viral videos showed him in a disturbing state.
Former 800 metres Olympics gold medalist Winfred Bungei also had his experience with depression and addiction. In 2019, Bungei told the Olympic Channel podcast that alcoholism almost ended his life.
Bungei, who has since recovered, said the addiction escalated after retiring.
“There are only three destinations for an alcoholic: You may end up in an institution which offers treatment. You may also go to jail for doing something stupid, or you will die. As Wilfred Bungei, I’ve gone through the institution. I am not interested in the other two - jail and death. And no one wants to go that direction anyway,” he said during an interview with a local media.
Bungei said the luxurious lifestyles many sportspeople live contribute to their downfall, especially for those who are not careful and who are unguided.
“There is a lot of loneliness up there when an athlete is winning and success has filled their lives. They are easily lured into alcoholism, promiscuity and other destructive habits just to hide from reality,” Bungei said.
Celebrated swimmer Michael Phelps shocked many when he shared his struggle with depression saying; “Really, after every Olympics, I think I fell into a major state of depression; I didn’t want to be in the sport anymore.”
Speaking at Kennedy Forum’s annual mental health conference in Chicago in April, Phelps said he contemplated suicide.
I didn’t want to be alive anymore.
I’ll never forget being in my bedroom at home, literally sitting in there for three to five days just not wanting to be alive.
Things may get worse when fame and the big money wanes.
Marathoner Jemimah Sumgong, in 2019, called on Athletics Kenya (AK) to offer counselling to athletes, some of whom, she said, were facing tough times.
Sumgong, who was banned for doping, said she was almost falling into depression as she had no one to turn to.
Later, AK organised counselling workshops for athletes, especially the young ones, who were taught how to manage fame and expectations that came with their success.
Some of them, especially from poor families, were struggling to manage the big money that comes with their wins.
AK’s seminars were meant to train the runners on investment so as not to struggle after retirement.
There was no comprehensive framework or model of care to support and respond to the mental health needs of athletes.
Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe was yesterday put to task to explain why it took him long to react to a report by the National Treasury faulting Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) spending.
Appearing before the National Assembly Public Investments Committee (PIC), chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir, the CS was grilled to explain why he did not react immediately when he was seized of the report, which indicated that the ministry had surpassed the requisition budget.
The committee also wanted to know why it to took the intervention of Treasury to reveal how much the agency had spent despite the Health ministry having an alternate board member at Kemsa who should share reports with his CS.
The legislators wanted to know how the communication in the ministry works if indeed the health boss was in the dark concerning the issue despite his board representative constantly attending board meetings.
“Were you not briefed on what was happening in Kemsa despite having a representative, that is why Kenyans had to wait until the Treasury flagged off the expenditure issues?” posed Wajir East MP Amin Rashid Kassim.
Ali failed to understand why the ministry did not see all the rot at Kemsa and inform the members of the public on time.
He questioned whether the CS was interested and had proper consultations with his officers in matters coronavirus and guidelines of how to handle the situation.
The lawmakers said they failed to understand why despite various board meetings, it never got to the CS’s attention that there was an issue and it had to take an insider to disclose exactly what was happening.
According to Kagwe’s submissions, the ministry knew about the matter by a letter faulting Kemsa for overspending.
The letter from the Treasury got to the ministry on June 22, 2020, and action was only taken after August 27.
“Is it fair to Kenyans that six months down the line, the ministry was not aware of exactly what was happening at Kemsa?,” asked Mandera East MP Hassan Omar.
“I consider this as sleeping on your job. Since you waited for Treasury to flag off that there was an issue yet you are the right person to raise such issues,” charged Rashid.
He added, “I consider that lack of leadership and governance from the CS.”
But in his response, the CS argued that it is not his role to oversight the parastatals that are run under him.
He maintained that his ministry cannot and did not micromanage Kemsa.
“We only offer guidelines and policy structures from the ministry. Treasury monitors and that is why they pointed that out,” he affirmed.
He, however, acknowledges that there was a problem in Kemsa and the ministry is determined to make sure it becomes a better agency.
“We are aware that we have problems and we will deal with it,” he promised.
Kagwe was also under fire for insinuating that the losses Kemsa is experiencing are as a result of a decrease in product prices.
Kagwe disclosed that the agency owes Sh2.9 billion debt in supplies but said this will be settled once all the remaining products are sold and the remaining balance cleared.
“The prices of most products have now dropped due to an increase in supplies in the country. It is however not only Kemsa that increased their prices last year, other private institutions also hiked their prices. It was bound to happen and a lot of institutions will feel the same pain and incur the same losses,” he explained.
His response puzzled the chair, who said “By the time of audit, most of the products were still at the warehouses.
Other state agencies in their submissions have indicated that there were able to buy the same items at lower prices and most opted not to buy from the Kemsa because their prices were way too high,” he noted.
”It’s a bit premature for us to say that the reason why we are making these losses is that the prices at the time were high. The loss is created by greed. Some suppliers were given regrets by Kemsa and they went and supplied the same items to third parties and Kemsa secured the same items from those parties,” added.
More than half of youth in Kenya are waiting to see how the Covid-19 vaccine affects those who have already received it before they can take the jab, according to a new report.
The study, by Amref Health Africa, has attributed the wait-and-see attitude among 52 per cent of the young people to fears of the likely effects the jab may have on their health.
More than half of female youth respondents, or 60.85 per cent, said they are waiting to see how those who have been injected react before making the decision of whether or not they will take the vaccine.
On the other hand, 47.38 of males told researchers in the study whose findings were released last week that they would be willing to take the vaccine.
The study, titled The Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Behaviour Intentions Among The Youth In Kenya: A Vaccine Pre-Introduction Study, noted many young people are hesitant to take the vaccine despite the fact that they are major influencers.
But the study also points out that a good number of youths understand the importance of the vaccine.
“Of those who are not ready to be vaccinated, 52 per cent say they are waiting to see the effects of the vaccine on those who have received it while six per cent are completely unwilling to receive the vaccine,” states the study.
More than half of those sampled, (65 per cent), said they rejected the Covid-19 vaccine due to inadequate information that has been provided so far.
They also said they do not have access to enough information on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine.
There was another segment of the young people (seven per cent) that said it rejected the vaccine because it either conflicts with their cultures or religion.
The scientists established that the youth are afraid of long-term effects of the vaccine on their health, for example, losing some of the functions of their bodies.
They also fear adverse reactions such as fever, headaches, migraines, joint pains and absence of menses.
Other issues of concern were the possibility of blood clots and infertility, especially in men.
The possible change of menstrual cycle among women, which would include missing monthly periods, also came out as a major issue of concern during the study.
“... you're thinking at my age, if this thing can affect me, then how will my tomorrow be? Will I get to a place where I can only have one child? Will I get to a place where I cannot be able to function like I would have if I had not taken the vaccine?” one of the youth told Amref scientists.
No adverse effects have been reported among recipients of the jab since the vaccination programme was launched in Kenya in March to warrant investigations, according to the Ministry of Health.
Common side effects, however, include pain at the injection area, headache, tiredness and muscle aches.
Those who were prioritised in the vaccination drive were healthcare workers, security officers, teachers and those aged 58 years and above.
The research was conducted, through an online platform, in all the 47 counties among youth aged between 18 and 35.
The study was commissioned to assess what determined the behaviour of youth towards the vaccine.
A total of 665 youth participated in the study with more than half of respondents, (60.30 per cent), being males.
Of those who took part, 45.35 per cent were from urban counties while 26.36 per cent and 28.29 per cent were from peri-urban and rural counties respectively.
The youth were found to have relied mainly on information from social media to make the decision on whether or not they would take the jab.
Others rejected the vaccine because they do not have confidence in the government's response efforts to the pandemic.
In the study, scientists noted that the common source of information about Covid-19 and vaccines among youth was social media, which accounted for 40.30 per cent of the information consumed about the pandemic.
TV and radio also provided young people with information on Covid-19, at 31.43 per cent and 23.91 per cent respectively. Information received by word of mouth stood at a paltry 2.56 per cent.
Rural youth, with primary level of education, were found to rely on radio for information on Covid-19.
Most of those in colleges and universities relied majorly on social media.
Whereas the Ministry of Health is regarded as the main source of information on the pandemic, only 1.35 per cent of respondents relied on it.
“Most young people have access to social media and fast-flowing information compared to older people, thus they may access misinformation and spread it to older people which may lead to vaccine hesitancy,” the study shows.
Meanwhile, a separate study carried out in Mombasa, Trans-Nzoia, Kajiado, and Nairobi counties established that most Community Health Volunteers (81 per cent) would accept the vaccine.
The study that was meant to explore their knowledge on Covid-19 vaccine, under the title COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Vaccination Intentions and Attitudes of Community Health Volunteers in Kenya, the rest of the members of the group said they were hesitant to take the jab over safety concerns.
Less than half of the health volunteers, or 36 per cent, and another 10 per cent cited social media and community meetings respectively, as their main sources of information.
West Pokot County has the second-highest fertility rate in Kenya, with an average of seven children per family, way above the two to three for the rest of the country.
West Pokot’s 7.2 per cent fertility rate has been linked with issues related to family planning as the national average stands at 3.4 per cent as per the 2019 Census.
It is also in West Pokot that children suffer the highest stunting rate at 46 per cent, according to the 2014 Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS), which also cites that more than one-quarter of children under five years are malnourished.
Be the county has made significant progress in tackling this issues, as family planning uptake has increased from 13 per cent in 2013 to the current 28 per cent, according to Performance Monitoring for Action Data released by the International Centre for Reproductive Health Kenya (ICRHK).
Struggling to make ends meet
But many women on family planning are doing so in secrecy for fear of repercussions from their husbands, who culturally believe that children are a blessing.
Philomena Cherotich, 33, and mother of three from Ngoleyo in West Pokot, has been using modern contraceptives to prevent pregnancy for the last four years, a fact her husband is not aware of.
If he does, she says, he will ban her from using it.
The family of five is struggling to make ends meet, and is a representative sample of thousands of families across the vast county with more children than they can provide for.
As a result of non-spaced births, the risk of children dying before their first birthday is significantly higher in West Pokot compared to Kiambu or Nyeri according to the KDHS 2014.
While there are other factors that contribute to child mortality, no spacing between births is a major contributor.
Shorter birth intervals have been demonstrated to be associated with higher mortality, both during and after infancy.
Peter Gichangi, the key investigator for the Performance Monitoring for Action at ICRHK, notes that despite all these hurdles, West Pokot continues to perform impressively well in the uptake of family planning, adding that only 31 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2020 compared to 39 per cent a year ago.
Babies born after the shortest birth intervals, less than two years, are nearly twice as likely to die (83 deaths per 1,000 live births) as babies born after three (42 deaths per 1,000 live births) or four or more years (44 deaths per 1,000 live births)
But by 2018, men in West Pokot were vehemently opposed to their wives practicing family planning.
Wilson Ngaren, the county’s reproductive health coordinator, recalls cases where men went home to check the upper arms of their wives for any signs of an implant, and then proceeded to raise hell if any was found.
So how did that change?
Valentine Cherop, a community health volunteer under ICRHK in West Pokot, says the county organizes weekly barazas to educate men who then pass the information to their fellow men about the benefits of family planning.
This has slowly changed the narrative and will hopefully address child mortality and other family planning-related issues in the county.
Focus now shifts to preparations for national examinations, days after learners opened schools.
All children from Pre-Primary to Form Four reported to schools on Monday when the new term, which will last for 10 weeks, started.
And as the 2021 academic year begins, all learners were transitioned to their new classes.
The officials will go through all activities from setting questions, proofreading, printing and packaging.
This was after a successful administration of school-based assessments for Grade 4 and the national examinations for Standard Eight and Form Four learners.
The activities took place following the roll-out of a crash learning programme to recover time lost during the prolonged closure of schools in 2020.
Last year’s examinations were administered under former Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) Chief Executive Mercy Karogo.
It is now emerging that with the change of guard at the council, where David Njeng’ere was appointed new boss, preparations for Kenya Certificate Primary Examination and Kenya Certificate Secondary Education will start early.
The Standard has established that Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha is leading a high-level team from his ministry and Knec to assess the process at the printer in the United Kingdom.
Basic Education PS Jwan Julius is also among the delegation heading to the UK.
Previously, staff who accompanied the CS and the chief executive included officers from test development, printing department, finance and examination administrations.
The officials, who have accompanied President Uhuru Kenyatta to the global education conference, are expected to monitor the examination preparations.
Dr Njeng’ere, who will be visiting the printer for the first time after his appointment, will be taken through the entire preparation process.
Back home, pressure is mounting on Knec as it races against time to be ready for the examinations ahead of March 2022.
The council will have to work within the squeezed timelines to produce examinations.
Under the revised school calendar, the second term will start on October 11 and will run for 11 weeks, ending on December 23. And third term will start January 3, 2022, and will end on March 4 after nine weeks. KCPE examination has been scheduled to start on March 7 for three days while KCSE exams will begin on March 11.
Knec candidates’ registration deadline lapses Saturday, kick-starting the long process of preparations for the examinations.
A Knec circular dated May 18 to school heads says candidates’ registration was to be done between June 2 and July 31.
The council said candidates must be registered in schools where they completed Standard Seven for the KCPE exam and Form Three for the KCSE test.
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics is yet to release the economic growth figures for 2020, citing failure to get some information from some industries due to the effects of Covid-19.
The economy contracted in the second and third quarters of last year, with the National Treasury estimating that it grew by 0.6 per cent in 2020.
The recovery comes at a time when the country is still grappling with the pandemic.
The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has captured a stray lion that caused panic in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado County.
In a statement on Wednesday, July 28, KWS said the lion, a male sub-adult (an animal yet to reach adult stage) was spotted stuck between a concrete wall and iron sheets in the residential town.
Members of the public then alerted KWS that dispatched its officers to the scene, managing to dart and subdue the animal.
“The lion was successfully darted, immobilized and safely transferred to the veterinary facility for observation and collaring before being released back to the park,” KWS said.
It is not an isolated case as incidents of human-wildlife conflict continue to grow in various parts of the country.
In March this year, The Standard reported that some stray lions had killed four people and cattle in the Maasai Mara and injured two others.
The lions encroached into communal land in Talek, terrorising villagers.
KWS has however urged the public to report such occurrences to 0800597 000, to avert further damage.
A44-year-old man from Rang’i Village in Rangwe Sub-County, Homa Bay County has committed suicide after he was discouraged by his family from marrying a second wife.
Duncan Ong’ong’a, a village elder in the area, died by hanging on Sunday, July 25.
His body was found dangling from a rope tied to an avocado tree near his parents’ homestead.
The 44-year-old reportedly got angry after his immediate family discouraged him against inheriting a widow in the neighbourhood.
Ong’ong’a got married for a second time last week following his first wife’s death in March. The new marriage received his parents’ blessings.
However, barely seven days later, he expressed interest in marrying yet another woman, a widower, as his second wife.
Genga Sub-Location Assistant Chief, Crispin Onyango, told The Standard that Ong’ong’a’s parents wanted their son to concentrate on his new marriage.
“They (parents) said they were suspecting Ong’ong’a would neglect the woman he recently married and focus all his attention on the widow,” said Onyango.
“Even the new wife rejected her husband’s plans to marry a second wife,” added the administrator.
According to Onyango, Ong’ong’a and the widow had been seeing each other for nearly two years.
“His relationship with the widow made his immediate family accuse him of neglecting his late wife, who died in March this year,” said the assistant chief, adding: “The man’s family now feared his continued relationship with the widow might lead to an outcome similar to what befell his first spouse.”
It is alleged in the week Ong’ong’a and his new wife were together, their short-lived union was marred by domestic violence.
“Last week, he hit the woman in the head with a plank of wood. The man fled upon suspecting he had killed his wife after she collapsed,” said the administrator.
Ong’ong’a’s spouse received treatment at a Rangwe hospital and was discharged.
A day later, Ong’ong’a was found dead near his parents’ homestead, with suicide attributed to his death.
Rangwe Sub-County Deputy Police Commander Joseph Okuna confirmed the incident, saying Ong’ong’a’s body was taken to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital morgue.
A man allegedly killed his estranged wife before committing suicide in Kibwezi East, Makueni County.
Area assistant county commissioner Vitalis Ogur said Nzyuko Makau and his wife, Ann Makau, were casual labourers at Dwa Sisal Estate.
Ogur said the two were headed to work when Nzyuko allegedly slashed Ann with a machete before hanging himself.
The motive of the attack is yet to be established.
"The incident happened in the wee hours of the morning as the two were headed to work," said Ogur.
One of the deceased's neighbours said the couple had family issues and were living in separate houses.
"The couple had four kids. At the time of the incidence, they had parted ways," said Urbanus Kioko, a resident.
The bodies were taken to Makindu Sub-County Hospital Morgue.
ODM’s National Elections Board (NEB) has urged its supporters to register as members ahead of the party’s grassroots elections.
“All supporters are encouraged to register as members if they want to participate in the party grassroots elections as aspirants or voters. The membership registration is free at the moment,” read a statement by NEB.
In the event a vacancy arises in any of the current grassroots structures, NEB has advised its members to consult with them for guidance and a way forward in regard to filling them.
“No person or organ may proceed to fill any vacancy before consultations with, and agreement by NEB,” stated NEB.
The board has also called on all county offices to prepare for the polls by verifying their membership status, familiarising themselves with elections rules which can be accessed from the party’s website.
The move is a twist from an initial decision by the party to push the grassroots elections to 2022.
In May, ODM deputy party leader and Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said conducting party elections a year before the general election would be ill-advised.
The elections were also initially scheduled for April 2021 but that too was aborted.
The NEB has also said although the term of party holders has expired, the officials will be expected, “to hold over until new officials are elected in line with the Political Parties Act, ODM constitution and party rules.”
“As they hold over they have the full mandates and authority of their offices and will continue carrying out their tasks as officeholders,” read a statement by NEB.
Members from counties have been asked to commence their own consultations, “to reach consensus on whom they should front as officials at all levels when NEB calls for the elections.”
The Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) is set to review the rate at which mobile phone companies charge to connect calls (interconnection or termination rates) in a move that could spark another price war in the country’s telecommunications sector.
The regulator said in a notice the review, coming after 10 years, will be conducted by comparing and contrasting the cost of voice calls in Kenya and similar economies.
“On July 8, 2011, the authority issued Addendum No 2 to the Determination No 2 of 2010, revising the mobile and fixed termination rates, implying that implementation would run till June 30, 2015,” noted CA.
“Upon expiry of the glide path in 2015, the authority took a decision to observe the market and see how it reacts before proceeding to undertake another costing study.”
Mobile termination rates are a key cost component for pricing calls among service providers.
It determines the margins that operators can put on voice calls within and outside their networks.
In 2010, the CA cut mobile termination rates by more than 50 per cent, from Sh2.21 in July 2010 to Sh0.99 by July 2013.
The move kicked off a price war between Safaricom and Airtel that saw voice call costs fall from a high of Sh12 per minute to an average of Sh3 per minute.
“Owing to the passage of time, changes in the markets as well as the macroeconomic environment, the authority now wishes to carry out a review of the telecommunications interconnection rates bench-marking methodology,” stated CA.
The latest review comes even as service providers continue to record a slowed growth on voice compared to other revenue streams like data and mobile money.
According to Safaricom’s latest annual report, the telco registered Sh94.4 billion in voice revenue last year, a marginal drop from Sh95.7 billion in 2019 and Sh95.6 billion in 2018.
Police Cpl Caroline Jemutai Kangogo's parents during her burial at Nyawa village in Elgeyo Marakwet County on July 29, 2021
The convoy of cars snaked its way from Iten County Referral Hospital mortuary in the early morning chill, down Iten-Kabarnet road, weaving its way around the Kerio escarpment.
A hearse with a banner emblazoned with the photo of policewoman Caroline Kangogo led the fleet of about 40 cars, decked in white and purple ribbons. Accompanying the cars were dozens of boda boda riders.
Along the road, curious residents craned their necks to catch a glimpse of what seemed like a bridal procession.
It was, perhaps a way of honouring some of Kangogo’s wishes that included having her body dressed in a bridal gown.
Kangogo, 34, whom many in Nyawa village, Elgeyo Marakwet County, knew as a humble and disciplined officer, was finally coming back home.
The weather, chilly, cloudy, with little bursts of sunshine, was exactly as it was on the day Kangogo’s body was discovered in a bathroom at her parents’ home.
That was 11 days after John Ogweno, a police constable, was found dead in his car at Kasarani police line in Nakuru.
Kangogo was linked to his shooting.
A few days later, Peter Ndwiga, a businessman, was also found dead in a lodging in Juja.
His shooting, too, was linked to the policewoman.
Kangogo would later be found dead, taking with her anything she may have known about the killings to the grave.
Police thereafter announced they had launched a manhunt for Kangogo, who they said was a key suspect in the murders.
An iron gate painted blue was the final stop for the convoy after a 30-minute drive to Kangogo’s parents’ home where she would be laid to rest.
Then the programme began, with speaker after speaker eulogising the woman they commonly knew as ‘Caroline Jemutai’.
Yesterday, hundreds of residents and a section of leaders attended her burial ceremony conducted within the same compound where her lifeless body was discovered in the morning of July 16.
Kangogo was buried in a white gown as she had requested in a draft message found in her phone that she is believed to have authored before her death.
According to the message, she had also asked to be cremated – a wish that her family did not honour, and instead buried her at her father Barnaba Kangogo’s farm.
There was no usual gun salute as is the tradition in the send-off of police officers who die while on duty.
Police officers from Nakuru where Kangogo worked and others who came to bid her farewell were dressed in civilian attire and sat inside a tent reserved for leaders.
They would later lay a wreath on her grave.
No uniformed officer from the nearby Iten or Tambach police stations showed up to maintain order at the ceremony where a large crowd of villagers gathered.
Kangogo’s husband Richard Ngeno sat pensively with their two children next to his parents-in-law.
Ngeno, a Mombasa-based police commissioner, as well as Kangogo’s parents, did not speak at the funeral.
At 2.27pm, Kangogo’s body was lowered to the grave.
“Many things have been written and said about my sister. The Caroline you read and heard about is not the one we know. She was a humble girl and we were happy whenever she was around,” her brother Mark told mourners.
If my sister did anything wrong, then it was by mistake.
It has not been confirmed by the DCI whether she killed anyone or not.
He said his sister was religious and often went to the nearby St Joseph’s Catholic Church, Anin, for prayers.
Kangogo’s uncle Robert Kipkorir, who was the family’s spokesman, said until yesterday, the family was yet to know whether Kangogo committed suicide or she was murdered.
“It is only God and Caroline who know what caused her death,” Kipkorir said.
On various occasions, the latest being July 21, 2021, President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed that Kenya will not cede even an inch of its territory to anyone.
The president, who was addressing security personnel training in Boni Forest, Lamu County, was most likely referring to the Kenya-Somalia maritime dispute.
Sadly, the determination to protect our territory seems to be taken with the seriousness its deserves only in the case of Somalia.
Kenya and Uganda have been wrangling for years over their common boundary in Lake Victoria, including the location of islands such as Migingo and Mageta.
And although these islands have for decades been inhabited by Kenyans, Uganda seems to have the upper hand on them.
It is common for Ugandan security officers to raid the islands and the waters around them and arrest Kenyan fishermen on flimsy grounds, only to set them free after they part with hefty bribes.
Some of the Kenyans are held for days in dingy cells on the Ugandan side.
In Mageta, Ugandan authorities reportedly force Kenyans to pay Sh8,000 per month for every fishing boat.
Yet, such gross mistreatment and exploitation of Kenyans doesn't seem to bother our government.
Granted, Kenya and Uganda are friendly nations. We cherish the friendship.
But friendship is only genuine where there is mutual respect.
That clearly is not the case here.
It's a shame for the government to do nothing while its citizens are abused and extorted.
Kenya must draw the line.
While we do not advocate for Kenya to take up arms against our neighbours, the government must demand that Ugandan officers keep off Kenyan fishermen.
It should also call for the resumption of the stalled Lake Victoria demarcation exercise.
Ugandans must not be allowed to turn Kenyans into punching bags.
The Director of Criminal Investigations (DCI) George Kinoti has alleged that detectives recovered Sh5.7 million from a woman who they claim was to deliver the cash to judges.
In a replying affidavit sworn by Chief Inspector Felix Karisa to a suit filed by the judges’ association, the DCI claimed detectives raided Justices Aggrey Muchelule and Said Chitembwe’s chambers after a tip-off that they were about to receive Sh7 million bribe.
“From the onset, we want to put the record straight that the judges were not arrested or harassed as they claim, but they willingly agreed to accompany us to the DCI headquarters to record their statements over the bribery claims,” swore Karisa.
Karisa said he had been tasked to investigate complaints on some judges and judicial officers accused of graft and had received credible information that some people acting as brokers had approached the judges to procure favourable decisions in some matters.
He swore that on July 21 he received information from a complainant that a series of meetings between a certain judge and broker had taken place and they agreed on a Sh7 million bribe to be delivered to the judge’s residence.
However, Karisa swore that the meeting venue was abruptly changed to Milimani High Court, where the broker was to deliver the money.
He stated that on July 22, they laid a trap at Milimani High Court and waited until around 2pm when they received information that the meeting with the broker was to take place at Justice Muchelule’s chamber while being facilitated by Justice Chitembwe. “
We proceeded to the two judges chambers and introduced ourselves after which we conducted a search on the occupants, which resulted to the seizure of USD50,000 (Sh5 million) from a woman who was present at Justice Muchelule’s chamber,” swore Karisa.
According to the investigator, they recovered another USD7,000 (Sh700,000) from Justice Chitembwe.
He accused the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association (KMJA) of misleading the court to stop DCI from arresting or charging the two judges.
“The DCI was only undertaking lawful investigations into grave allegations related to corruption and cannot be interpreted to mean an encroachment on the independence of the Judiciary. The petition to shield the judges is an attempt to stifle and frustrate our work,” swore Karisa.
On claims that the DCI did not obtain a search warrant to raid the judges’ chambers, the investigator stated that it was impractical to obtain the search warrants from a court since they had a short notice from the time they got information that the bribery was going to take place.
The two judges were summoned last week but Justice Muchelule and KMJA filed a petition and obtained orders stopping the DCI from summoning, arresting or prosecuting them over the bribery allegations.
KMJA, through lawyer Danstan Omari, argued that the DCI officers illegally stormed Muchelule and Chitembwe’s chambers without any search warrants and did not recover any bribe money as alleged.
Muchelule swore that the search by DCI officers did not yield anything after which the officers arrested and him took him to DCI headquarters and interrogated him.
When the matter came up before Justice James Makau, he extended the orders stopping the judges’ arrests and directed the other parties to file responses before October 18.
A 23-year-old Egerton University student was among three people found dead yesterday in unclear circumstances.
The student was found a day after he went missing.
Njoro Sub-county Police Commander Jonathan Kisaka said the student's body was retrieved from a garden at the university following a search on Sunday night.
"The student, identified as Edward Jage, was last seen on July 24," said Kisaka.
According to the police, Jage is said to have been battling depression.
Elsewhere, police in Narok South are investigating the death of a 17-year-old girl in Tendwet.
According to County Police Commander Kizito Mutoro, the girl was found hanging from the wall of her bedroom at around 6.30am yesterday.
“She died on the way to the hospital,” said Mutoro.
Area Chief Patrick Kosgei said the girl had reportedly demanded for a new pair of school shoes as her old ones were torn.
In Homa Bay County, residents of Rang'i village were shocked to find the body of village elder Dancun Ong’ong’a hanging from a tree.
His body was found dangling on a rope tied to an avocado tree near his parents’ home on Sunday.
Ong’ong’a is said to have had a row with some members of his family barely a week after marrying a second wife.
Environmental activists yesterday called on Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti to speed up investigations into the murder of conservationist Joanna Stuchburry.
Under the umbrella of the Kenya Network of Land and Environment Defenders (LED), the activists joined President Uhuru Kenyatta in condemning the brutal murder of Stuchburry.
Stuchburry was famous for her relentless efforts to conserve Kiambu Forest.
She was shot dead on July 15, with detectives ruling out robbery since nothing was stolen from her.
Centre for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action Executive Director Phyllis Omido, who led the group, said Stuchburry’s killers must be brought to book.
Other organisations that signed the statement were Human Rights Agenda, Kwale Community Development Programme, Big Ship, Prohome, Green World Kenya, Chema Initiative, Malindi Rights Forum, Preserve Africa Initiative, Eco Ethics Kenya, Tree Growers Association of Kenya, Power Youth Network, Mica Miners and Friends of Lake Turkana.
Omido said Stuchburry worked relentlessly to protect Kiambu Forest and Kenya’s natural resources.
They also sent their messages of condolence to the deceased’s family.
“The disregard for the life of environmental activists in Kenya seems to be the current norm and we wonder for how long the community will continue to be subjected to acts of violence, intimidation, police brutality, enforced disappearance and judicial harassment with no counter action from the State,” she said.
Two police officers accused of killing fourteen year old Kwekwe Mwandaza at her home in Kinango on August 2014 have now been convicted of manslaughter.
The two former kinango DCIO Veronicah Gitahi and police constable Issa Mzee have been remanded a port police station awaiting the determination of their sentence this Friday.
High Court Judge Martin Muya cancelled bond for the duo after the prosecution raised security concern of Kwekwe’s kin.
Ahead of Fridays decision, today’s judgement yet again opens the gruesome pages of the heinous murder of the primary school girl who died by the bullet in the dead of the night allegedly triggered by the officers as they searched for a murder suspect said to be a kin of the family.
Kwekwe’s case has been on the radar of human rights crusaders.
A case that would attract lots of attention prompting a court order that would see even the exhumation of her remains for an independent autopsy to be conducted.
The home of businessman S.K Macharia played host to several musicians, politicians and other businessmen Tuesday, for the Kenyan musicians’ musical show.
The event taking place at Macharia’s Ndakaini home in Gatanga, Murang’a County is dubbed Skiza Thanksgiving Luncheon program- aimed at highlighting the plight of musicians and gather support for Kenya’s identity.
Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga arrived just minutes to 12 pm in the company of his wife Ida and Governors Mwangi Wa Iria (Murang’a) Alfred Mutua (Machakos), and Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), breaking into song and dance.
The artists said they want to express their gratitude to President Uhuru Kenyatta for exempting ringtones from excise duty.
The move, which took effect on July 1, 2021 will see an increase in artists’ earnings from their songs on mobile devices.
Speaking to Citizen TV, musician Ben Githae stressed how artists had suffered since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, but was glad that there was now a ray of hope.
“Musicians tumekuwa tukiumia sana. Wakenya wamekuwa wakidownload nyimbo zetu kwenye skiza lakini ile percentage tunapata ni kidogo sana. (Kenyan musicians have suffered for long considering the small amounts we got from skiza tunes), the Tano-Tena hitmaker lamented.
Raila, who is the Chief Guest humored Kenyans on social media, noting how musicians are getting creative with song lyrics.
“Mejja’s Tabia za Wakenya hit was playing somewhere this morning and it got me thinking it is true! Masaa na mkenya lazima atachelewa lakini sherehe?!..” he tweeted.
ODM leader Raila Odinga and other political leaders arrive in Gatanga, Murang’a for the Kenyan musicians’ musical show.
Several political leaders are in attendance among them Governors James Nyoro (Kiambu), James Ongwae (Kisii), host MP Nduati Ngugi (Gatanga), Devolution Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, Siaya Senator James Orengo and former presidential aspirant Peter Kenneth.
Others are MPs Kimari (Mathioya), Maina Kamanda) Maoka Maole (Igembe North).
Popular Kenyan-based Congolese Gospel artist Solomon Mkubwa and several local musicians drawn from different parts of the country are also in attendance.
Kenyan creatives, among them artistes suffered a huge blow brought forth by the pandemic.
In his new year’s address, President Uhuru termed the entertainment industry a “critical plank of our economy” and promised to focus on it this year to revitalise the economy.
He promised to have some legacy issues that have long plagued copyright holders resolved, and proposed to have all rights holders register on a National Rights Registry.
“To receive royalties, content service providers will be required to channel all payments of royalties through a single, centrally managed account at the Kenya Copyright Board,” Uhuru said, noting that this would ensure oversight by the regulator.
Part of the strategy entails improving the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis by developing new mapping, tracing and diagnostic tools.
In 2018 we recorded about 900 cases but that does not mean those were the only cases.
We realized that there are more and more counties with the cases but they were being misdiagnosed as skin diseases.
This strategy will help us to correctly determine all the areas which are prone to the disease.
Leishmaniasis classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) is a parasitic disease that is found in parts of the tropics, caused by infection with Leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of a phlebotomine sandfly.
The disease comes in two forms, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) and cutaneous leishmaniasis.
In 2014, it was decided by the world health assembly that countries establish programs to eliminate neglected tropical diseases.
According to Dr Joyce Onsongo, a representative from the World Health Organization, leishmaniasis is given priority in WHO policies, strategies and roadmaps.
“Our target is that by 2025 we should be able to control morbidity by 75 per cent and 85 per cent in 2030 in the 13 endemic countries in Africa." She said. "We have partnerships in Kenya to enable us to achieve this and we will continue working with national and county governments."
Onsongo further appealed to all stakeholders to use the strategy as a tool to negotiate, advocate and monitor the elimination of leishmaniasis in order to achieve Universal Health Care.
“Over the last decade, efforts have been undertaken to prevent, control and eliminate the disease. National and county governments take lead in implementing strategy,” said Dr Rashid Aman
Aman added that the implementation of the strategic plan will require a huge financial commitment of Sh2 billion for the next five years.
If you think being a workaholic is a badge of honour, think again.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that long working hours threatens life expectancy, risks strokes and heart-related diseases.
Let your bossy boss know that data from WHO and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) revealed that long working hours (more than 55 a week) led to 745,000 deaths from stroke and ischemic disease in 2016, a 29 per cent increase from 2000.
In its study, WHO concluded that working for 55 hours and more per week is associated with an estimated 35 per cent higher risk of stroke, and 17 per cent of dying from ischemic heart diseases, as compared to working between 35 and 40 hours a week.
Ischemic heart diseases are a result of an inadequate supply of oxygen and blood to heart muscles.
Despite the increased number of health complications and deaths, more people are working longer hours globally and “this trend puts even more people at risk of work-related disability and early death,” cautions WHO, adding that the burden of work-related diseases is higher in men who account for 72 per cent of the deaths.
WHO established that the Covid-19 pandemic saw many employees working longer than usual and that “teleworking has become the norm in many industries, often blurring the boundaries between home and work” besides massive layoffs seeing the few remaining working longer.
Aman reports to work carrying a laptop bag, but no lunchbox inside.
Lunchtime will see him trooping to a restaurant or the office cafeteria.
A woman, on the other hand, will carry hygiene products and spare shoes, but also snacks, fruit salad, a water bottle and home-cooked lunch.
Why is it not logical for men to carry lunchboxes considering the prevailing harsh economic times yet it is healthier and cheaper?
Joseph Waithuki, a credit risk manager, says a lunchbox is impractical and cumbersome for a bachelor who doesn’t cook often and uses public transport due to that small matter of spilling the food and the attendant stress that causes.
But the pandemic forced many to work from home, changing perceptions. “I would spend around Sh300 each day, a cost which can be avoided,” says Waithuki, adding lunchboxes are easier for those who drive as the cars accord them privacy and comfort.
Henry Mwenda, a client delivery manager at a bank, says carrying packed lunch for him was during the early days of the pandemic when eateries were limited and fear of infection was high, but “I would otherwise never carry packed lunch,” he says, arguing it would interfere with his lifestyle. “Imagine going to the club with a lunchbox - it is such a no-no!” says Mwenda.
But carrying lunchboxes was normal for Kenyans who lived abroad.
“In the States, offices have what they refer to as brown bag meeting rooms, also called lunch and learning lessons rooms, where colleagues enjoy their packed lunch as they engage in informal discussions at lunchtime,” says Andrew.*
Victoria Muthoka, a wife and Law School student packs lunch for her husband who’s in manufacturing.
She includes vegetables, starch, fruit and a healthy beverage.
Eating homemade lunches has great benefits as such meals are healthier, safer, cheaper and balanced giving one “control of the food chain” including storage, says Faith Kariuki, a nutritionist at Afya Bora Nutrition and Wellness Centre.
Though he was reluctant at first, he now rarely complains of stomach upset.
She adds that city restaurants have limited choices. “If you want traditional vegetables with brown ugali, you either wouldn’t find it offered, or it would only be available for a limited amount of time.”
Besides, restaurants tend to overcook vegetables, whose vitamins and minerals are destroyed by light and heat, but with “a packed lunch you also have control over your choices of fats and oils.
Vegetable oils are much healthier than most fats used in hotel cooking.
Raphael Tuju was appointed Minister for Information and Tourism in the first Cabinet of former President Mwai Kibaki in 2003.
His assistant at the ministry was Beth Mugo.
Tuju, a renowned journalist, was no doubt a good fit for the role.
An alumnus of the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, Tuju had in the late 1980s and early 1990s worked as a part-time television news anchor.
Besides, he had produced and directed several documentaries, television and radio commercials for international agencies, private sector bodies and public institutions.
And he had been a columnist for local newspapers, particularly the East African Standard.
Tuju’s professional background gave him first-hand experience of how critical media freedom was in a democratic and progressive society.
It, therefore, did not come as a surprise that while he was at the helm of the Ministry of Information and Tourism, the Kibaki administration nurtured greater freedom of expression.
State House kept its hands off media content and tolerated criticism. Further, the voice of the civil society got louder than it had been before.
In a bid to have Kenya retain her position as the regional centre for international news, Tuju made liberalisation of the airwaves a priority of his ministry.
Under the Kanu regime, privately-owned radio stations were only allowed to broadcast in limited spaces, but the State-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) enjoyed unlimited airwaves access.
It was during Tuju’s time at the Ministry of Information and Tourism that vernacular radio stations began popping up in large numbers.
Privately-owned vernacular radio stations such as Kameme FM, which broadcasts in Gikuyu, Kass FM, which broadcasts in Kalenjin, and Ramogi FM, which broadcasts in Dholuo, among others came into existence.
Under Tuju’s leadership, the television sector also grew.
New players such Sayare TV (2004) and K24 (2007) arrived on the scene.
In addition to other privately-owned television stations such as the Kenya Television Network (KTN), started in 1990, and Nation TV (NTV), started in 1999, the new players in the television sector offered Kenyans a range of sources of information in Kiswahili, Kenya’s lingua franca, English and other indigenous languages to choose from.
Print media, too, did well thanks to the media freedom occasioned by the change of guard.
The two leading dailies, the Daily Nation and the East African Standard maintained their dominance of the Kenyan market.
But by the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency, the number of newspapers in the country had shot up to eight.
Nation Media Group launched the Business Daily whose beat was finance and economic affairs.
Patrick Quarcoo’s The Star newspaper also came into existence around the same time.
Aware of what potent tools media outlets are in the construction of a people’s popular culture, Tuju insisted that the local media creates room for local content.
On August 8, 2003, Tuju announced that from January 1, 2004, local television stations would be required to broadcast a minimum of 20 per cent local content.
For radio stations, he set the ratio at 30 per cent. Tuju’s directive was not successfully executed then.
It, however, brought the subject of suitability of media content to the national discourse table.
As the Minister for Information and Tourism, Tuju took Kenya’s image redemption campaign to the global arena.
Fed up of what in media parlance is called bad press, Tuju attempted to take Kenya’s broadcasting voice to the United Kingdom.
His intention was to reverse the 50-year one-way broadcasting regime that Kenya and Britain had maintained.
In November 2003, Tuju and Wachira Waruru, then the head of the KBC, visited London to apply for an FM radio station licence to enable KBC to be heard in the UK.
The FM station, in Tuju’s view, would offer an alternative voice to that of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
Tuju argued that unlike the BBC, the Kenya-owned FM radio station would give Kenya unbiased media coverage.
It turned out that British broadcasting laws only allowed European companies to run radio stations in Britain.
Besides, at the time all the licences for the London FM spectrum were booked up to 2010.
Even though the law has since changed and non-nationals can now apply for licences and run FM stations in the UK, the challenge of limited FM spectrum persists.
Tuju’s fight against the bad press Kenya was getting in the wake of Al Qaeda terrorist attacks was boosted by the fact that it enjoyed the support of Kenyans.
As a result, Kenya’s tourism industry, the third largest foreign exchange earner in the country, had lost $125 million (Sh13.5 billion) since the 1998 US Embassy bomb attack in Nairobi.
Immediately after the attack, European and American authorities released travel advisories to their citizenry citing Kenya as an unsafe destination.
The situation had been aggravated by the ban of UK flights to Nairobi and Mombasa by the British government in May 2003.
The ban was anchored on the fear of terrorist attacks on western targets.
After his bid to establish an FM station in the UK flopped, Tuju changed tack.
He made a series of appearances on international radio and television stations.
Tuju gave one message at each of the talk shows.
He informed the world that even though Nairobi was concerned about the terrorism threat, it had taken all the necessary precautions.
He emphasised that Kenya was not any more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than other tourist destinations.
Tuju’s crusade paid off.
The UK lifted the Nairobi and Mombasa flight ban.
He served Kibaki’s administration as the Information and Tourism Minister until 2005.
His later stint in the Cabinet had much to do with the convulsions that engulfed Narc in the lead up to the 2005 referendum.
Within months of clinching power, cracks emerged in the coalition.
These cracks assumed the form of a Kibaki-Raila Odinga power-sharing tussle.
Odinga claimed that his party and Kibaki’s had signed a pre-election Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that spelt out how they would share power after winning elections.
The MoU supposedly stipulated a 50-50 power sharing formula between Kibaki’s and Odinga’s parties.
Jubilee Party head of secretariat Raphael Tuju reminds himself how to use a camera before addressing the press at Elementaita country lodge in Nakuru on November 13, 2016
Kibaki never disowned the existence of the MoU.
His position, however, was that the MoU was limited to Cabinet slots.
He disagreed with Odinga’s demand that the MoU extended to the civil service.
Odinga and his supporters wanted the MoU to overlap to government jobs, diplomatic appointments, State corporations and security services.
The Kibaki-Odinga feud caused divisions in Kibaki’s first Cabinet.
It was in this scenario that Tuju, and former vice presidents Moody Awori and George Saitoti switched allegiance to Kibaki.
The gap between Odinga’s camp and Kibaki’s was further widened by their divergent stances on constitutional reforms.
Odinga’s faction used the 2005 proposed Constitution referendum to get even with Kibaki.
They rallied their supporters to reject the proposed Constitution.
Odinga and his supporters wanted an autonomous premier with a ceremonial president while Kibaki and his supporters wanted the opposite of this arrangement.
The government lost the referendum.
A day after the government lost the plebiscite something historical happened.
Kibaki fired his Cabinet save for Vice President Awori and Attorney General Amos Wako.
In his terse message to Kenyans, Kibaki clarified that the referendum results had prompted him to reshuffle his ministers and assistant ministers for harmony and efficient service delivery to the people.
In the new Cabinet that he announced a fortnight later, he excluded Odinga (Roads, Public Works and Housing), Kalonzo Musyoka (Environment), Ochilo Ayacko (Gender and Sports), Linah Jebii Kilimo (Home Affairs and Registration of Persons), Anyang’ Nyong’o (Planning and National Development), Najib Balala (National Heritage and Culture) and William ole Ntimama (Office of the President — Public Service).
In the new Cabinet Kibaki appointed Tuju Minister for Foreign Affairs.
From a purely bureaucratic point of view, Tuju’s brief was to advance the government’s foreign policy.
But from a political angle, Kibaki’s elevation of Tuju to the Foreign Affairs docket was a strategic move.
Empowering Tuju was one of Kibaki’s ways preparing for the 2007 political duel with Odinga.
In the run up to the 2005 referendum Tuju formed the People’s Progressive Party.
Political analysts considered Tuju’s party an outfit whose aim was to eat into Odinga’s support base and consequently reduce Odinga’s camp’s chances of winning the referendum.
Tuju served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the end of the first term of the Kibaki Presidency.
Interestingly, Tuju, who served as the Member of Parliament for Rarieda between 2003 and 2007, got into Narc thanks to his affiliation with Odinga’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
This explains why his fallout with Odinga resulted in him losing the Rarieda seat.
The political animosity between him and Odinga worked to his disadvantage since the electorate considered it a betrayal to their community kingpin.
In spite of his loss at the 2007 polls, Tuju did not slide into a political oblivion.
In a demonstration of the high regard which President Kibaki had for him, Tuju was appointed as Special Envoy and Presidential adviser in the government.
Tuju worked alongside Kivutha Kibwana.
Whereas Kibwana advised Kibaki on Constitutional affairs, Tuju advised him on Media and Management of diversity or Ethnic Relations.
Tuju served Kibaki as one of his advisers until 2011 when he resigned to focus on his 2013 Presidential bid.
Afterwards, he formed Party of Action (POA), the political vehicle through which he purposed to run for the Presidency.
Tuju was born on March 30, 1959.
He went to Majiwa Primary School from where he joined Starehe Boys’ Centre.
Tuju holds a Master of Arts degree in Communication from the University of Leicester, United Kingdom.
Before joining politics, Tuju worked as a consultant in design and implementation of public communication programmes.
Among other organisations and agencies he consulted for were the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States Agency for International Development (USAid), the World Bank, the Department of International Development (DfID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
Between 1992 and 2001, Tuju was the Founder and Director, Ace Communications.
At 3am tomorrow, the men’s 3000m steeplechase - a race that has been dominated by Kenyans for 37 years, will take place at the Tokyo Olympics.
Kenyan men have won the Olympic steeplechase gold medals since 1984.
With the absence of defending champion Conseslus Kipruto who did not complete the race during the national trials in June, extension of Kenya’s winning streaks will be on Leonard Bett, Abraham Kibiwot, and Benjamin Kigen who took the top three slots respectively.
But a tough challenge awaits the Kenyan squad in Tokyo as African countries field steeplechasers with decorated resumes in the distance.
From Lamecha Girma and Getnet Wale of Ethiopia to Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali, Kenya’s stranglehold in 3000m steeplechase will be put to test.
Winner of the national trials, former Africa champion Abraham Kibiwott, is seen as the Conseslus Kipruto’s successor.
He trains with Conseslus in Mosoriot, Nandi County.
Kibiwot, 25, has proved that he is ready to defend Kenyan dominance at the Olympics given his performance at the senior ranks.
He won bronze at the African championships in 2016, silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2018 before coming in seventh at World championships in 2019.
On the other hand, Kigen, 28, takes to the start line his monstrous kicks. He is seen as the biggest threat for gold.
Kigen, who won the Rome Diamond League in 2019, in a time of 8:06.13 can’t be wished away.
He has previously beaten El Bakkali and Conseslus at the Diamond Leagues. Back in 2018, he outclassed Kipruto to take Prefontaine Classic before beating El Bakkali on home soil to win in Rabat.
He has also shown incredible speed with a 3:31 1500 pb in Doha in May, won the only major steeple of 2020 in Monaco, and won his only steeple of 2021 in comfortable fashion, clocking 8:08 in Florence on June 10.
Although Leonard Bett, 20, is yet to show the world what he is made of, three-year-old career is rich in spectacular wins.
Bett won the national trials but was beaten in Gateshead, his only Diamond League of the year, finishing second to American Hillary Bor.
When Bett was just a 16-year-old in 2017, he won the World U18 title in Nairobi.
A year later, when he was 17-year-old, he ran away with a silver medal at the World Under20 championships before winning the 2019 Africa junior title as an 18-year-old.
Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali is of the Olympic steeple favorites. He has recorded impressive performances in recent years.
A Wang'uru court in Kirinyaga County has sentenced to death four men found guilty of robbery with violence.
Principal Magistrate Gideon Mutiso convicted Isaak Kariuki Ndambiri, Kennedy Gachoki Kanguru, James Gitonga Wawira and Christopher Bundi Mbogo of killing two people and maiming two others in a robbery incident.
The four, jointly with others not before the court, are said to have committed the offence on July 1, 2018, at a nightclub in Ndindiruku, Mwea East sub-county.
Ms Margaret Wanjiku Mwangi was robbed of Sh200,000 and killed alongside Stephen Muriithi Mwangi.
The court heard the four, armed with an AK 47 rifle, also shot and maimed James Kimani and Kelly Nyawira, who can no longer fend for themselves.
It also emerged that Robert Mwangi, the husband of Ms Mwangi and brother of the late Kimani, was impacted by the robbery since his liquor business went under.
Mwangi asked the court to give a maximum sentence to the four persons.
“When they gunned down my wife, I was left with an infant whom I continue to nurture. And under such circumstances, I can hardly go for any meaningful employment,” he said amid tears.
Ms Nyawira, who was maimed in the robbery incident, pleaded with the court to sentence to death the four men.
“I was forced to quit employment due to the serious injury I sustained. I urge this court to send them to the gallows," said Nyawira.
Defense lawyer Nduku Njuki, in his mitigation, told the court that his clients were still innocent and the police were yet to arrest the perpetrators of the heinous crime.
Justice Mutiso ruled that the convicts had not shown any remorse despite committing the serious crime.
“I find the convicts have no respect for others and even upon being given an opportunity for mitigation, they continue to deny having committed the crime which the prosecution and the witnesses proved beyond reasonable doubt,” Mutiso ruled.
The magistrate also said, although the death sentence was discretionary, the four deserved it.
Four ex-police officers charged with the murder of British aristocrat Alexander Monson will know their fate on October 28, after both parties closed their submissions yesterday.
The defense lawyers said the prosecution failed to call the bouncer of a club to testify on what transpired inside the entertainment joint before Monson was ejected and later arrested.
Jared Magolo said prosecution and Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) had failed to establish the cause of the fatal injury on Monson's death. He said the state failed Monson's family.
He said that the prosecution failed to call the bouncer of the famous Tanduri night club in Diani that had called police on the deceased after he was allegedly caught smoking cannabis outside the club.
“Looking at the circumstantial evidence, investigations let the court and the family of the deceased down by not getting the correct information. There was evidence that a bouncer from the club called the police but he was never called to testify what prompted him to call police,” said Magolo.
Police Constable John Pambe, Naftali Chege, Charles Munyiri Muganda and Ismael Baraka were charged and with the murder of Monson in May 2012.
Justice Eric Ogoia had found the four had a case to answer and placed them on their defense.
Magolo said calling for police reinforcement meant that there was confrontation at the club.
“The investigation has never bothered with what happened during the arrest and by leaving out those two areas, they denied you to find out if the injury was caused at the club or at the time of the arrest,” said Magolo.
Magolo said the court and the public will never know who caused the injury and at what stage the injury was caused.
“There is no evidence direct or circumstantial showing that his client contributed to causing the injury or assaulting the deceased,” said Magolo.
He said Monson may have been injured at the cells, police office, during the arrest or at the club.
“I therefore urge that you find the unfortunate as it is, we have been let down by police and Independent Police Oversight Authority IPOA and left you with no evidence and urge you to acquit the third accused,” said Magolo.
The DPP senior Counsel Alexander Muteti urged the court to find guilty and convict the four police officers charged with the murder of Monson in 2015 at Diani Police Station.
“I urge the court to find the four accused guilty as charged, the deceased having died in their hands,” said Muteti.
Muteti urged the court to determine the circumstantial and forensic evidence in determining the cause of death.
He said the court should also consider the credibility and believability of the accused in all human reasonable considerations of their defense.
“I focus on the defense because your lordship you have to deal with the issue of contradictory evidence from the accused persons much so touching on basis of where the assortment of drugs was discovered which is at the center of the arrest,” said Muteti.
Defense lawyer Daniel Wamotsa said the prosecution was advancing theories that Monson’s injuries were inflicted between 3 AM and 6 AM while he was in police custody but failed to call any witness to prove the same.
Wamotsa said there was no way the age of the injury could be determined as alleged by the prosecution.
He said the prosecution also failed to call in any of the cellmates to testify that the police chose to remain silent under the blue code of silence after injuring Monson.
“We submit Monson case is anchored on suspicion. It is reasonable to suspect but in view of this case, suspicion alone can’t be grounds to convict the accused,” said Wamotsa.
He said there was no motive to the fourth accused to inflict injuries on the deceased and as a junior police officer, he was doing his job.
“It is very unfortunate that after all this, we cannot point who inflicted the injuries but it cannot be put on the fourth accused who was at the right place and time,” said Wamotsa.
He said the evidence by Chief Inspector of police indicated that there was no commotion at the club and at the time of arrest.
The four officers will anxiously be waiting for three months to know if they will walk free or head to prison.
Members of the Shona community sing while displaying their Kenyan citizenship certificates during the presentation of Kenyan Identity cards and certificate of citizenship at the Windsor Hotel in Kiambu on 28th July 2021
For more than 60 years, the Shonas bestrode the country as stateless people, devoid of official recognition as citizens and denied essential services on account of their status.
Their ancestors had moved to Kenya in the late 1950s from Matebele, Zimbabwe and settled in the country.
Another batch of missionaries, sent by Johane Masowe of Gospel Church of God, checked in between 1959 and 1961, settling in Kinoo and Kiambaa areas.
And therein began their lifelong petition for citizenship, including marriages with Kenyans to secure backroom recognition as citizens.
Yesterday, after all their toils and struggles, the government made a significant step towards formalising their stay in the country.
At a ceremony where over 200 of them were issued with identity cards and citizenship certificates, Interior CS Fred Matiang’i announced that they will now be officially recognised as an additional ethnic group.
“I would like to thank those who have been with us during this journey, including UNHCR and KHRC because we have been talking about ending statelessness in the country,” said the CS.
A few years ago, the Makonde received State recognition after staging protests, walks, petitions and talks that ended up in State House courtesy of President Uhuru Kenyatta.
“We are now left with one community in Tana River and effective next month my team will embark on the assignment of getting them the documents,” added Matiang’i.
The community was told they should drop the Shona tag and become hardworking and law-abiding citizens since they would now access government services.
At the same time, local leaders were urged to ensure that children from the community enroll in schools as required.
Matiang’i added that accepting the community was another way of respecting human rights.
Among those who received citizenship certificates were Ghanaians and Asians in an event attended by Kiambu County Governor James Nyoro and various government officials.
Oliver Muregerera, the community secretary-general, said he was elated as they will now participate in the country’s general elections for the first time.
“Because we were not recognised as Kenyans we do not have critical identification documents. As a result, we cannot even open our own businesses. We have to use the details of our Kenyan friends to register the businesses,” said Muregerera.
The Shona, who make up almost 4,000 members, had lived in the country for decades without papers.
“Presently, scores are settled in Lenana, Githurai, Kasarani, Nyahururu, Meru, Nakuru, Kericho, Kitengela and Malindi,” says a KHRC report.

Kenya and the United Kingdom (UK) have signed a five-year Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) to tackle shared threats across East Africa. The agreement was signed at a side event during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s three-day Guest of Government visit to the UK.
Once ratified by respective parliaments, support to Kenya will include Sh1.165 billion annual UK investment in defence, 1,100 Kenyan soldiers trained yearly in readiness for deployment to Somalia, Kenyan Navy trained on maritime security, safety and firefighting, assured visits, professional training and exchange of experience and expertise, Sh28 million worth community projects on sanitation, health, education and tackling gender-based violence.
British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) will also hire 550 local civilians, a move that has contributed Sh5.8 billion to the local economy since 2016.
Kenya’s Defence Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma and UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace signed the new deal on Tuesday evening in London.
The agreement will anchor defence priorities between the two nations over the next five years.
The DCA comes six months after the two defence secretaries met in Nairobi to deepen wider stability and security cooperation as part of the Kenya-UK strategic partnership.
The new DCA will allow the two militaries to share expertise, experience and techniques.
The two nations have a long history of military cooperation, working together on land, sea and air to find shared solutions to our shared challenges, including countering the threat from terrorists’ groups like Al Shabaab.
Dr Juma said the two countries have reaffirmed their commitment to defence cooperation.
“We held fruitful discussions and agreed a range of measures to keep both of our countries safer. Kenya has long been our defence partner of choice in East Africa and, in a more uncertain world, we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder as we tackle the threats of tomorrow,” said Wallace.
Over the past five years, the UK, under DCA has provided an annual training of over 1,100 Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) soldiers, with courses in the UK, or with UK military training teams in Kenya.
“The framework underpinning this strategic relationship is the Defence Cooperation Agreement, which has become an invaluable tool for enhancing competencies of our defence forces. Our cooperation continues to significantly improve ability of our forces to operate effectively in high-threat environments,” said Juma.
Further training has also been provided through the UK-funded Counter-IED Wing at the Humanitarian Peace Support School in Embakasi.
Since 2016, over 2,000 military and police from 22 countries have been trained in CIED skills and 40 CIED instructors developed, significantly improving the ability of African Union forces to operate effectively in high-threat environments, including against Al Shabaab.
Infrastructure projects at the KDF’s School of Infantry, which include an urban village, a Forward Operating Base, and an assault course, all prepare more than 600 KDF personnel for deployment in the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom).
The UK has been supporting Amisom troops contributing countries since 2010 through the Short Term Training Teams from the British Army at a cost of Sh43 million annually.
Batuk has had significant benefits for the local economy and community, contributing over Sh5.8 billion to the economies of Laikipia, Samburu and Isiolo counties.
As a result, more than 550 local staff have remained in employment even during the harshest economic times brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
A crisis is looming at City Hall after Members of County Assembly (MCAs) resolved to terminate the services of County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka.
The ward representatives on Tuesday adopted a report by the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee that recommended for termination of the contract of Kwamboka for abuse of office and operating without a valid advocate practicing certificate.
The report stemmed from an investigation by the committee which had been probing a petition by John Mark Ojiambo who sought for the removal of Kwamboka "on behalf of Kenyan citizens and Nairobi taxpayers.”
In his petition, Ojiambo claimed that Kwamboka was illegally in office since her one-year contract lapsed in 2018 while she was serving suspension under the then Governor Mike Sonko-led regime.
On her return, stated Ojiambo, her contract was renewed without vetting as required by law.
The county attorney was also accused of single-sourcing Njenga Maina and Company Advocates to take up over 60 cases related to City Hall yet the law firm had not been prequalified to offer legal services to the county.
According to the report, the law firm is now demanding Sh300 million in legal fees from the county. It had already been paid Sh60 million in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.
“The county attorney allegedly runs Njenga Maina and Company Advocates by proxy and has beneficial interests,” stated the petition.
Kwamboka is also accused of nepotism as all the four directorates under her office are headed by people from her tribe.
Moreover, the county attorney is accused of engaging in professional misconduct by practicing without a valid practicing certificate.
The petition noted that the Advocates Act requires every advocate to take a practicing certificate at the beginning of each year but Kwamboka did not do so in 2020.
The MCAs said this exposes the county to invalidation of legal instruments and to unwarranted legal action.
The report by the Justice committee noted that Kwamboka did not honour summons by the committee on July 6, 2021.
In her submissions vide a letter dated July 12, 2021, she claimed she was not aware of the petition by Ojiambo thus it would be procedurally unfair to expect her to respond to the same.
Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and County Attorney Lydia Kwamboka before the Senate's PAIC, July 18, 2018.
On the validity of her contract, she maintained that she was duly appointed by Sonko in 2018 but she, alongside three other county officials, were suspended for alleged insubordination over Pumwani Maternity Hospital saga.
“After my suspension, I was recalled on October 1, 2019, where the former governor extended my contact until December 2022,” she said.
She also defended Njenga Maina and Company Advocates, saying it had been prequalified and awarded tender NCC/NCM.PREQ/001/B9/2017-18-2018-2019.
This, however, contradicted submissions by County Secretary Jairus Musumba which indicated that the law firm was not on the list of prequalified legal firms that offered services to the county from 2013 up to date.
Kwamboka further termed the nepotism and incompetency claims as baseless.
The Joseph Komu-led committee, however, found that Kwamboka had flouted the provisions of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2021, through the issuance of instructions to an un-prequalified law firm and that she contravened the Constitution on National Values and Principles of Governance.
Based on the observations, it recommended that the county government terminate the services of Kwamboka as the county attorney.
Consequently, Speaker Benson Mutura communicated the decision of the assembly to Deputy Governor Anne Kananu.
Kananu was also urged to withdraw the services of Njenga Maina and Company Advocates.
Kenya’s economy shook off the adverse effects of Covid-19 to post recovery in the first half of the year, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said yesterday.
CBK said the rebound was supported mainly by the strong performance of construction, information and communication, education and real estate sectors, with the taxman meeting its tax collection target for the financial year that ended in June.
“The economy is expected to rebound in 2021, supported by the continued reopening of the services sectors including education, recovery in manufacturing, and stronger global demand,” said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), CBK’s highest decision-making organ.
MPC has for the ninth consecutive time retained the Central Bank Rate - the benchmarking rate at which the apex bank lends to financial institutions at seven per cent.
Besides improved tax collections, banks also reduced their percentage of bad loans or non-performing loans to 14 per cent - reflecting a pickup in economic activities that have seen borrowers resume servicing their loans.
Bank profitability also rose sharply in the first four months compared to the same period last year.
There were also efforts to vaccinate the population to enable the society and economy to return to normalcy.
Nonetheless, respondents in the MPC’s Private Sector Market Perceptions Survey, CEOs Survey, and the Survey of Hotels, were optimistic about economic growth prospects for 2021, citing vaccinations and easing of Covid-19 containment measures.
MPC in a statement signed by its chairperson CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge (pictured) raised concerns about continued uncertainties over the pandemic, increased taxes and heightened political activity.
The submitted budget estimates is proposing to allocate the cooperative department Sh1.6 billion of which Sh1.2 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh374.6 million is for development expenditure.
The key targeted outputs include the completion of negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement between Kenya and the US as well as Kenya and the UK.
The department will also focus on the seizure and destruction of counterfeit goods, promotion of domestic trade and entrepreneurship through construction and completion of CIDC and operationalization of Kenya National Multi-Commodities Exchange Limited (KOMEX) trading platform.
“The submitted estimates for the financial year 2021/22 is proposing to allocate state department for trade and enterprise Sh3.3 billion of which Sh2.1 billion is for recurrent expenditure and Sh1.2 billion is for development expenditure,” read an analysis from the committee on trade, industry and cooperatives.
The 202/2022 Financial Year budget estimates have been prepared against a background of a recovering global economy from the effects of the outbreak and the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is still uncertainty on when Kenya and the entire world will be able to contain the pandemic, however, there are expectations of a vaccine powered economic recovery with the continued reopening of economies that are improving economic activities.
In the FY 2021/22 revenue collection including Appropriation-in-Aid (AIA) is projected to increase to Sh2 trillion (16.4 per cent of GDP) up from the estimated Sh1.8 trillion (16.6 per cent of GDP) in the FY 2020/21.
From insurance fraud, tax fraud and pyramid schemes to the social engineering attacks and cybercrime we experience today, fraud is an issue that has plagued Kenya, and the African continent at large.
African nations have been able to develop solutions and implement different measures to combat the effects and occurrences of fraud.
One sector where fraud is experienced, especially in Africa, is the mobile ecosystem.
Mobile phone and internet penetration are constantly rising, and this has served to increase the size of the sector by giving individuals across different economic segments access to a wider variety of services.
Despite the advantages this possesses, there are also pitfalls that come with it.
The fight against fraud has been backed by the developments made in technology.
Seeing as technology has made a contribution towards the growth of fraud, it makes sense that it should be employed to help protect individuals from the negative effects.
So as to ease the burden on regulators and assist them in strengthening their capabilities for fighting fraud, it is important for them to adopt technological solutions.
A report released by Interpol in 2020 noted that the billion-dollar mobile money industry in Africa is being exploited by organized crime groups – a trend only set to increase as the service is rolled out in more countries across the continent.
It further highlights that a lack of robust identity checks to verify users combined with a need for greater law enforcement resources and training on mobile money-enabled crimes have created a financial system distinctly vulnerable to criminal infiltration.
The fight against fraud must encompass all the players in the sector to guarantee a wholesome approach towards limiting the instances of fraud.
This includes the regulators and the mobile network operators (MNOs).
The MNOs are responsible for the development of services for the consumers to use, such as mobile money, as well as their maintenance and growth.
In November 2020, Evina - a Paris-based anti-fraud and cybersecurity specialist, released research citing the five countries in the Middle East and Africa where fraud in the mobile ecosystem is most prevalent as Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Jordan and Oman.
The regulators are responsible for protecting the consumers and implementing the various checks and balances to assure that consumers are free from exploitation and fraud.
The percentage of mobile-based billing transactions in each country that have been identified as suspect by Evina’s network of fraud sensors are 51 per cent, 30 per cent, 20 per cent, 18 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively and they go further to indicate that about one in four mobile subscriptions in Africa are fraudulent.
They estimate that Africa’s mobile fraud losses will continue to rise above the 2020 figure of $4 billion if nothing is done to prevent global cybercriminals from looting the digital space.
There are, however, digital solutions that have been developed to assist the sector in fighting fraud.
For example, a report by the GSMA indicates that MNOs have adopted GSMA recommended techniques for detecting and dealing with the international transmission of fraudulent mobile spam.
Thus far, they are yet to be fully adopted in regions such as Africa where they have great potential for success.
In particular, in markets where there is a low-level of technological understanding, consumers today are often not using available protective technology features to their full potential.
Customers within the mobile ecosystem are the most vulnerable of the lot as they often lack knowledge and the technological means to properly defend themselves.
Security must be viewed as a chain: one weak-link and the fraudsters rejoice for they interpret this as an open-door for malwares.
James Claude, the CEO of Global Voice Group, believes that it is important we move with the times and look towards digital solutions in the fight against mobile ecosystem fraud.
He says, “We live in a world that is constantly evolving, especially from a technological perspective. We therefore have to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the curve and ensure that we maximise on the benefits technology provides us”.
Global Voice Group (GVG) is a big data analytics company and regulatory technology developer working with several governments and regulators in Africa.
They have assisted in the monitoring of mobile money ecosystems where they have collaborated with regulators to implement their solutions.
The company’s Visio Device solution provides regulators the ability to control the country's handset population in real time, based on reliable and accurate data.
This data can then be used to fight counterfeiting and other device-related issues and tackle other types of telecom fraud to ensure an all-round healthy mobile ecosystem.
“Our work at GVG helps us to assist governments and regulators in this effort and some of the solutions we provide are able to strengthen their capabilities when it comes to fighting fraud in the mobile ecosystem. As such crimes move toward a bigger digital arena, it is important to detect them in a much easier and more efficient manner so as to keep all users within the ecosystem safe,” Claude goes on to add.
GSMA’s report on Safety, privacy and security across the mobile ecosystem, highlights the importance of mandatory prepaid Mobile SIM registration to protect the mobile ecosystem from fraud.
Many countries have strengthened their SIM registration protocols over the years.
For instance, in Kenya, an individual must provide a formal identification document - such as an identity card or passport – for them to register a new SIM card.
This has helped the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to link each SIM card to a Kenyan citizen or a registered resident of the country.
Nonetheless, that cannot be deemed enough and there must be further steps taken.
The Visio Sim solution by GVG provides regulators with the capabilities to identify and authenticate users using SIM cards.
This can help regulators to efficiently certify that any new SIM cards registered comply with the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements provided by the regulator.
Mobile phone penetration is constantly growing at a fast rate and there is need for a system that can assist in the authentication of the individual identities to weed out any potential fraudsters.
In the recent past, there have been efforts made towards adopting technology across various areas of life.
There have been greater pushes for customers to make use of digital banking solutions, as well as incentives for them to further grow their use of mobile money.
African governments are also putting a greater emphasis on cyber security and cyber resilience to counter the rise in cyber-attacks experienced since the Coronavirus pandemic began.
As African economies and the mobile money ecosystem continue to grow, so does the amount of data collected and without efficient systems in place it will be harder for fraudulent transactions and fraudsters to be identified.
But when all is said and done, the entire ecosystem, must work together to weed out the perpetrators of fraud.
There are more men owning smartphones in Kenya compared to women giving them an advantage of opportunities in the internet space, a new GSMA consumer survey reveals
The number of smartphone ownership among men in 2020 went up by four per cent to 47 per cent compared to 2019 ownership at 42 per cent.
Ownership among women stagnated at 32 per cent where it was in 2019.
The study found a majority of women controlling the share of basic phones compared to men with this category of gadgets has grown by three per cent to 34 per cent in 2020 from 31 per cent in 2019.
Men’s control of basic phone share though behind female counterpart grew by three per cent to 25 per cent in 2020 from 23 per cent in 2019.
There is a decline in ownership of feature phones across the gender with the adoption of gadget in this category falling 9 per cent among men in 2020 to 14 per cent from 23 per cent in 2019.
The number women opting for feature phones in the country declined by 8 per cent to 11 per cent in 2020 compared to 19 per cent in 2019.
The respondents in the research highlighted that the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic has been felt acutely in Kenya, especially by women.
“While overall mobile ownership remains largely unchanged among men in Kenya and smartphone ownership has grown, overall mobile ownership declined slightly for women, and the proportion of women who own a smartphone has not increased,” the study says.
“In addition, Kenya was the only survey country where the gender gap in mobile internet use has widened, from 34 per cent in 2019 to 42 per cent in 2020. Women’s mobile internet use remained flat over this period while use increased for men.”
The findings in the report draw on the annual GSMA Consumer Survey, which this year had over 9,000 respondents from eight LMICs.
The face-to-face survey was conducted between October 4 last year and January 8, 2021.
Additional qualitative research was conducted in Kenya11 and India12 to develop a more nuanced understanding of women’s access to and use of mobile internet, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The GSMA report showed an estimated 112 million more women started using mobile internet last year across low- and middle-income countries.
Nevertheless, 234 million fewer women than men access mobile internet.
Moreover, the underlying gender gap in mobile ownership persists and is proving difficult to close.
Affordability, lack of literacy and digital skills, and lower awareness of mobile internet are critical and common barriers for women.
Structural inequalities in society and discriminative social norms also remain a challenge.
Even when women have the same levels of education, income, literacy, and employment as men, they are still less likely to own a mobile phone or use mobile internet.
Women were more likely than men to access the internet exclusively via mobile in almost all markets surveyed.
In Kenya, for example, 63 per cent of male internet users said they only used the internet via a mobile device compared to 79 per cent of females.
This reliance by women on mobile demonstrates the disproportionate benefit of increasing their access.
“If women are to become equal citizens in a more digital, post-COVID world, closing the mobile gender gap has never been more critical,” said Mats Granryd, Director General, of the GSMA.
I urge policymakers, the private sector and the international community to take note of the important findings laid out in the Mobile Gender Gap Report because only concerted action and collaboration will enable women and their families to reap the full benefits of connectivity.
The tourism industry is on the mend after the devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic that saw it hit historical lows.
The industry lost Sh110 billion last year owing to global travel restrictions, according to the Tourism Ministry, raking in a paltry Sh37 billion against a projected Sh147.5 billion.
While there has been a degree of recovery over the first half of this year, the numbers are still a fraction of what they were before the pandemic.
The country received 305,635 international arrivals in the six months to June this year, according to data by the Tourism Research Institute.
About a third of the arrivals (94,241) were mostly Kenyans visiting their friends and family.
Business and conference tourists stood at 92,828, while holidaymakers were 92,629.
“We are encouraged by the numbers, although we are not there yet because this is only a fifth of the two million visitors we received in 2019. But we understand this is because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns that ensued, which affected the travel trends this year,” said Tourism and Wildlife Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala on the new numbers.
The top five tourist source markets over the six months were the US (49,178), Uganda (31,418), Tanzania (31,291), China (18,069), and the United Kingdom (16,264).
The latter has traditionally been the top source market for the local industry but slid following a spat with Kenya that saw it place the country on its Covid-19 red list, restricting passenger travel between the two countries.
“At the same time, we can see the UK dropped to number five due to the effects of the unfair travel restrictions and putting Kenya in the red list despite our Covid-19 numbers giving a different scenario. But we are still engaging and we hope these travel restrictions will be lifted not only by the UK but across the world.”
Last year, the industry received a paltry 471,000 visitors, more than 68 per cent of them (321,000) arriving in January and February.
This was before the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the country and containment measures to stem the spread of the deadly virus were put in place globally.
“From January to October 2020, the sector realised only Sh37 billion in direct international tourists’ receipts. This is against a projected Sh147.5 billion for the review period,” said the ministry.
“The sector hence lost over Sh110 billion of direct international tourists revenue due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”
The industry has traditionally been the largest foreign exchange earner for the country, earning Sh163 billion in 2019, ahead of tea and horticulture.
The latter two appear to have defied Covid-19, mostly on account of their operations, including cargo flights, having only been affected minimally.
Tea earnings grew 15 per cent to Sh120 billion, while horticulture earnings grew to Sh148 billion last year from Sh143 billion in 2019.
A report by Deloitte noted that the industry still faces major challenges, with Covid-19 continuing to spring up more challenges that will slow down its recovery.
Secondary schools have received Sh6.6 billion being payment of capitation money for this term which ends in about a week.
Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said the money was the last tranche for secondary schools for the third term which ends on July 16.
Another Sh170 million has been sent to teachers’ colleges, according to details from the Ministry of Education.
Dr Jwan said another Sh172 million has been wired to special needs schools.
The government disbursed Sh7.5 billion when schools opened in May.
At that time, Education CS George Magoha said more money would be released to schools by the National Treasury.
“We have made a request for an additional Sh13 billion for secondary schools and another Sh2.8 billion for primary schools’ capitation,” Magoha said.
He said if the money is released, it would help schools to plan for reopening in July.
“We hope that schools will be adequately prepared to put in place measures to adhere to the Ministry of Health Covid-19 protocols,” said Magoha.
According to the revised school term dates, the present third term for Pre-Primary I and Pre-Primary II, Grade One to Grade Three, Standard Five to Standard Seven and Form One to Form Three learners ends on July 16.
The learners are expected to take one week break between July 17 and 25.
Presently, Grade Four pupils and those who sat the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination in 2020 are still at home waiting for the present learners to complete their third term.
All the learners will open schools for Term One under the 2021 academic year starting July 26.
The 10 weeks term will end on October 10.
Secondary school heads who spoke to The Standard said the money released will go towards clearing debts accrued in the third term.
They argue more money should be sent to schools to facilitate reopening plans for July, when all learners report back.
Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (Kessha) chairman Kahi Indimuli said with schools opening on July 26, proper planning is necessary.
“Schools will need the money to plan again to receive the children. We need to ensure health protocols are implemented and this will require adequate resources,” said Indimuli.
This came even as concern grew over increasing Covid-19 infections as the fourth wave is predicted to peak this month.
Parents and school heads who spoke to The Standard said July, when the virus is projected to peak, will be marked with heightened movement of students.
“We should not wait for the peak. Put all plans in place before that time so we do not have maximum impact,” said Nicholas Maiyo, the National Parents Association chairman.
Maiyo said some of the lock-down measures should be implemented gradually.
“We particularly take issue with bars because they are the super-spreaders, and the sooner stricter rules are implemented, the better,” said Maiyo.
The release of money is also a major relief to Teachers Training Colleges (TTCs) coming barely a month after the government rolled out fresh training for diploma teachers.
About 1,000 students were admitted to six TTCs across the country as teacher education reforms kick-off to anchor the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC).
Only TTCs of Machakos, Thogoto, Baringo, Egoji, Migori and Shanzu will receive students from June 2 to start their first term under the Diploma in Primary Teacher Education (DPTE).
Each college has been allocated 150-200 students for a start with more colleges expected to get students during the second intake in September.
The students already started their first term of 14 weeks, which will be followed by the regular calendar of training.
Under the new tuition regime, a diploma will be the minimum training level for all primary school teachers as the government rolls out plans for quality teaching and learning.
More than 25,000 youth have gained trade skills by enrolling for short courses, years after dropping out of school in Murang’a County.
Henry Manyeki, 29, graduated from Gaitega Polytechnic in 2017 after pursuing a carpentry course for six months and moved into construction sites.
He then raised enough capital to establish a business.
Today, Manyeki is among qualified artisan graduates earning a living in construction sites and making household furniture.
He dropped out of school at Standard Eight at St Mary’s Primary School after his parents were unable to pay for his secondary education.
“I did odd jobs in the village, where I earned Sh200 a day for years. But I found an opportunity for free training after the county government structured a ‘Ufundi kwa Vijana’ programme, targeting youth from humble backgrounds,” said Manyeki.
After completing the course, he teamed up with Jesse Mwangi and opened a carpentry workshop in Kiharu estate, Murang’a town.
Last year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the partners went separate and Manyeki opened another workshop.
“I am pleased with the training I got from my instructors. Today, My Classic Digital Furniture is a household name in the estate,” said Mwangi.
Kiharu Estate is home to a section of National Police Service officers and hundreds of students at Murang’a University of Technology.
James Mwangi, a plumbing student at Kirwara market, said he is determined to learn as much and turn around his fortunes.
“I am happy that I am pursuing a course that I have an interest in. I also hope to secure employment or set up my workshop to serve people,” said Mwangi.
Governor Mwangi wa Iria said more than 60 polytechnics in the county offer 28 short courses, including hairdressing, motor vehicle repairs, masonry, plumbing and electrical installation.
He said the training programme was introduced to impact skills on hundreds of youth who had dropped out of school and lack certification in the different trades they are engaged in.
“The short courses have improved the living standards of hundreds of the youth, especially those interested in construction and beauty,” Iria said.
The governor said the county government had spent millions of shillings to pay instructors and equip the learning centres.
The programme has also rescued hundreds of youth from alcoholism, substance abuse and petty crime.
The programme is handled by Education and Technical Training Chief Officer Isaac Njai.
Gaitega Polytechnic Manager Martha Njeri said some learners have furthered their education to the level of being registered as instructors.
Polytechnics, she said, provide learners with training and practice opportunities, which many institutions miss, adding that they direct the employers on whereabouts of their former students.
Njai said there are 7,151 continuing students in the 65 institutions. Another 3,500 are under the ‘Ufundi Kwa Vijana’ programme.
At the height of his popularity and success, the late Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur, author and motivational speaker aptly said that “reading is essential for those who seek to rise above the ordinary”.
This is so true now, as it was back then, especially with children.
There is always a world of a difference between readers and non-readers.
And in a school setting, it is remarkably easy to tell apart children who have been introduced to reading at an early age, and those who have not.
Indicators include vocabulary and comprehension, speech performance, levels of imagination, creativity, social skills, ability to empathise or lack of it, concentration levels et cetera.
Reading is such an understated tool in improving a child’s social and cognitive abilities.
It is almost magical! And it is a pity and a shame that we have not really embraced it and/or effectively applied it with our young ones.
In most schools that attempt it, library lessons are merely sessions of children reading anything they can lay their hands on, as the teacher marks, plans for the next lesson or finishes up on some work.
No guidance, no structure, no follow-ups.
In our case, any serious interaction with books only happens in high school when learners are introduced to set-texts.
And even here, over reliance on the so-called guides by some teachers and students kills the buzz, ruins the party.
It defeats the whole idea of introducing children to active reading of truly and deeply and meaningfully savouring literature.
Recent trends in education depict difficulties in teachers helping inspire the appreciation of literature in students.
Unbridled appetite for and unmeasured usage of social media hugely contribute to this.
And so to counter this, the introduction to literature ought to begin at the earliest levels of education.
The contemporary view of the role of literature reinforces the notion that literary texts can be used to teach language beginning at the earliest levels for better nurturing.
The study of literature encourages empathy, tolerance for diversity, imagination and emotional intelligence, which is the understanding of feelings, both of one’s own and the others.
Early interaction with literature equips children with such requisite cognitive skills not only vital in a school or work setting, but valuable in other life aspects.
In the International Baccalaureate (IB), from where the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) happens to borrow heavily, students from as early as Primary Years Programme Grade 5 are introduced to literary appreciation, which helps them acquire key learning milestones that are fundamental for future success – academically and socially.
This includes their cognitive abilities to reflect on their knowledge, conceptual understandings and skills.
A wide range of assessment strategies informs learning and teaching of young learners.
One of the marquee models in IB is the introduction of literature to students at an early age, provoking both artistic and scientific thinking and inquiry.
What is more, it provides language models for children.
Literary selections also provide authentic cultural information, help critical thinking skills and emphasise historical and literary traditions.
The teaching of literature in elementary school using the appropriate pedagogical approaches and models not only develops linguistic abilities, but also offers behavioural models, which will contribute to children’s personal fulfilment.
Unlike our national curriculum, which introduces set texts in high school, the IB programme introduces set texts in junior school (primary years programme) from age 11.
This enables learners develop analytical and critical thinking skills, enrich their imagination, relate the artistic works with real-life situations, interrogate topical/societal issues, and develop reading/comprehensive skills.
According to a June 2018 research done by Cynthia Zettler-Greeley, Assistant Director, Research and Evaluation, at Nemours Centre for Health Delivery Innovation in the United States, children in the fourth through to the eighth grade (ages 9–13) are best modelled to be introduced to set texts.
These children usually have the ability to explore and understand different kinds of texts such as biographies, poetry and fiction; understand and explore expository, narrative and persuasive text; read to extract specific information, such as from a science book; understand relations between objects; identify parts of speech and devices like similes and metaphors; correctly identify major elements of stories like time, place, plot, problem and resolution; and most importantly analyse texts for meaning.
In the case of introducing children to reading in general, she states that most children learn to read by six or seven years of age.
Occasionally, some children may learn at four or five years of age. In the first and second grade (ages 6–7), children usually begin to read familiar stories, “sound out” or decode unfamiliar words, use pictures and context to figure out unfamiliar words, and self-correct when they make a mistake while reading aloud.
Children’s literature is important because it provides students with opportunities to respond to and interrogate literary elements; gives students appreciation about their own cultural heritage as well as those of others; helps students develop emotional intelligence and creativity; nurtures growth and development of the student’s personality and social skills; and transmits important literature and themes from one generation to the next.
The first value to note is that children’s literature provides students with the opportunity to develop their own (informed) opinions about the thematic concerns, logically defend their positions, and develop communication and persuasive skills to articulate their thoughts.
This strengthens the cognitive developmental domain as it encourages deeper thought about literature.
Quality literature does not tell the reader everything he/she needs to know; it allows for some difference in opinion, interpretation and decoding of information.
Early introduction to literary appreciation provides an avenue for students to learn about their own cultural heritage and the cultures of other people.
Children’s literature encourages students to think deeper about their own feelings.
It is crucial for children to learn these values because developing positive attitudes toward our own culture and the cultures of others is necessary for both social and personal development, mutual understanding and even tolerance to diversity.
Stories have the power to promote emotional and moral development.
Many books are available that depict culture as an important piece of society that is to be treasured and valued, and those books can have great value for students.
Moreover, early literary appreciation aids students in developing emotional intelligence
Children’s literature contains numerous moments of crisis, when characters make moral decisions and contemplate the reasons for their decisions, an important skill for children to be modelled in.
Literature for children encourages creativity.
It nurtures and promotes/expands the development of children’s internal imagination.
Children’s literary appreciation is of value because it fosters personality and social development.
Children are very impressionable during their formative years, and children’s literature can help them develop into caring, intelligent and friendly people.
Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget observed that when students move from the pre-operational to the operational stage of cognitive development, they become less egocentric.
Whereas students in preschool and kindergarten may be entirely focused on themselves, as students grow older they begin to take into account the feelings and viewpoints of others.
Being able to understand other people’s viewpoints and to not be selfish are important skills that must be nurtured in children, since harmonious interactions and fulfilling relationships require an understanding of the feelings and viewpoints of others.
Children’s literature can foster social development by encouraging students to accept other people and their differences, develop relationships with people and encourage social contact.
Based on psychologists Jean Piaget and Vygotsky’s development theories, a child needs to be exposed to developmentally appropriate (age appropriate) reading in order for learning to occur; and in order for literacy development to occur, a child must read.
Therefore, a child must be exposed to literature that is suitable for them based on their abilities.
Children’s literature is valuable in providing an opportunity to respond to literature, as well as cultural knowledge, emotional intelligence and creativity, social and personality development and literature history to students across generations.
Exposing children to quality literature can contribute to the creation of responsible, successful and caring individuals.
As students get older, the set-texts become more complex and demanding.
The information in the text also places a greater emphasis on higher level thinking and prior knowledge.
Specifically matching texts to the learners’ interests, prior knowledge and reading abilities was found to be essential in heightening motivation, enhancing confidence, and developing and applying specific reading comprehension strategies.
Introducing children to early literature braces students for such demands.
Conversely, delays or failure in introducing children to literary appreciation have far-reaching ramifications. First is the misplaced notion, self-defeating mentality that reading should only be done for purposes of exams, as opposed to a self-development tool
This is sickening, to say the least.
Besides slow or delayed cognitive development, individuals who are not introduced to early literary appreciation tend to be socially awkward and maladjusted, lacking in empathy, shallow in their reasoning and dogmatic in their thinking.
They are wont to struggle in terms of their communication skills, have a narrow world view and lack attention to detail.
Competencies such as speed reading, comprehension skills, critical thinking skills et cetera, developed as a result of early introduction to literary appreciation would almost guarantee easy, faster and better understanding and even mastery of other subjects and skills.
The benefits of introducing the young ones to early reading and literary appreciation are innumerable and far outweigh the pitfalls, if any.
Aday to the talks between the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) and teachers’ unions on the new proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), signs of striking a compromise are beginning to emerge.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut), which had previously objected to a CBA without monetary gains as proposed by TSC, is now climbing down and suggesting a possibility of having an agreement with a condition that the suspension only lasts two years.
TSC has scheduled a meeting with teachers’ unions to negotiate the proposed CBA, as pressure mounts on the latter to accept a deal without monetary gains.
The commission invited the unions to the July 13 meeting to discuss the 2021-2025 CBA. At a meeting held on June 29, TSC had said it would not engage in money-based CBA.
Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary-general Collins Oyuu yesterday said they were willing to get into an agreement with the employer on a two-year CBA that captures all other aspects of terms and later sign a different CBA on financial gains.
“Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) has suspended the review of salaries and teachers are not exceptional, but must agree with the TSC that teachers’ salaries will be reviewed immediately after the lapse of the suspension period depending on the country’s economic performance,” said Mr Oyuu.
At the same time, the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Nairobi branch executive secretary Moses Mbora has urged the national office to follow suit.
Previously, the Kuppet secretary-general Akello Misori had announced that they were reluctant to accept a CBA that does not include salary increments for teachers.
TSC’s stand on non-monetary CBA rose from advice from the SRC that put a freeze on the review of salary structure.
SRC pronounced that it would not review basic salary structures, allowances, and benefits for public servants, including teachers, in the financial year 2021/2022 and 2022/2023, following recommendations from the National Treasury.
The unions previously maintained that teachers expected nothing short of salary increment to cushion them against inflation and the burdens of increased workload under the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) coupled with a biting teacher shortage.
In the June meeting with teachers’ unions, TSC offered promotion of teachers in arid and semi-arid land (ASALs) and hardship areas, enhanced package on maternity leave to 120 days and paternity leave of 21 days with full salaries, as well as transfers of couples to teach in schools near each other.
“We are looking at a CBA that does not break families. Let us not only concentrate on the financial gains because the CBA has so many aspects,” said Oyuu.
The new CBA seeks to recognise teachers’ leadership and technical roles in realisation of the CBC within and outside the classroom, which had been ignored in the evaluation tool previously used by SRC in crafting teachers’ job descriptions.
Implementation of the CBA would be a boost for classroom teachers as it recognises the role they play in implementation of the CBC.
The unions are pushing for the implementation of the four-year agreement as it focuses more on the true worth of teachers as the country transitions to an education system that subjects them to more work.
No review of basic salary structure, allowances and other benefits for the period 2021/2022to 2022/2023 means job grades, salary bands from Minimum to maximum within grades, allowances and other benefits remain the same. [Jacinta Mutura]
This also implies that employees can enjoy annual increments and promotions from one grade to another through common cadre transitions and competitive interviews at constant salary bands, allowances and other benefits.
Teachers had been expecting to get new terms for the 2021-2016 CBA hoping that the next CBA shall resolve challenges that were not conclusively addressed by the last one.
Both Kuppet and Knut had separately presented their salary proposals to inform negotiations with TSC.
Kuppet had pitched a salary increment of between 30 and 70 per cent for the new 2021-2026 while TSC is reported to have proposed between 16 to 32 per cent.
The Kuppet proposal would see the lowest paid teacher’s salary rise from Sh21,756 to Sh36,985 while those in higher cadres under Job Group D4 who currently earn Sh118,242 would take home Sh153,714.
Knut had also proposed a salary increment of between 120 and 200.
The Knut proposal means the monthly basic salary for the lowest paid teacher (Grade B5) would be raised from Sh21,756 to a maximum of Sh87,024 while salary of the highest paid teacher (Grade D5) would be increased from Sh131,380 to Sh394,140.
Teachers are also hopeful that the CBA will streamline guidelines for competitive promotion interviews to enable Special Needs Education teachers to compete fairly with teachers handling normal learners.
At Ndagani in Tharaka Nithi County, college students and young pupils have for a month learnt to co-exist in a tuition block they share.
The college students, most in their teens and early 20s, have been sharing a compound with a baby class and two other classes in the Early Childhood Development Education centre.
In a rare scenario, the primary school pupils and the students intermingle as they move around their classrooms, stairs and along the corridors at the tuition block near Chuka University.
The college's lecturers also have offices and lecture halls in the single tuition building, albeit on the upper level.
Older pupils such as Class Seven and Eight take the advantage of the proximity to engage the older students for advice.
Chuka University VC Prof Erastus Njoka addressing Kenya Medical Training College students outside the building they occupy inside the university.
The university council allowed, in 2015, KMTC to occupy the building which belongs to Ndagani Primary School, as the construction of KMTC campus at Chuka Level Five Hospital continues
When the bell rings, the pupils make their usual dash to the classrooms, and the college students have learned to give way when that happens.
Friendships have also been struck, and it is not uncommon to see a group of pupils in animated chatter with their older counterparts.
But to maintain respect and seniority, the pupils have been allocated separate toilets and they dare not venture into ones meant for the college.
But many things could go wrong in this arrangement, though luckily, it is yet to happen.
It is a situation brought about by the delayed construction of the Kenya Medical Training College complex at Chuka Level Five Hospital, which has forced its students to share a building with pupils at Ndagani Primary School.
While the college students occupy the upper floors of the building, the pupils have been moved into a section of the first and ground floors.
The building belongs to the primary school but KMTC has occupied it as it awaits completion of its campus.
The primary school was moved on May 10 from its former location, in a land swap with Chuka University which is using the land to construct a library.
A teacher from the primary section told The Standard: “The pupils and teachers cannot wait to have the entire building to themselves. The university built this complex as a model primary school.”
The KMTC campus in Tharaka Nithi County was approved six years ago but Chuka University accommodated the first batch of its students in a compound that belonged to Ndagani Primary School, within the university compound.
Vice Chancellor Prof Erastus Njoka said the council decided to accommodate the KMTC in September 2015 because no other venue could be found.
“We talked with the university council and agreed to give the building to KMTC since 2015 because they had nowhere to go. Because there is a construction of a library where the primary school was, we have decided they share (the KMTC complex),” said Prof Njoka.
However, Njoka called for a speedy construction of the KMTC college at Chuka Hospital, saying it had taken long.
He asked the county government to ensure that the KMTC college campus at the Chuka hospital on the fringes of Chuka town was completed quickly.
“It has been six years and the project is not complete. We are asking the government to work faster and finish the project, after which we will assess it before releasing the students,” said Njoka.
He assured parents and other stakeholders that the university, which offers nursing and other medical courses, will continue to support the KMTC.
“We have first class laboratories and other facilities which KMTC students can make use of, as they further their education,” he said.
Ndagani Primary School Headteacher Joseph Keah said sharing the building with KMTC had given the pupils an ideal place to learn.
“We thank the university for giving the pupils a conducive environment to learn, and the local community is very happy,” said Keah.
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed Kenya’s unpreparedness for virtual and remote learning due to the unavailability of electronic learning infrastructure.
A report, Impacts of Covid-19 on Adolescents in Kenya, indicates that despite the government’s push to integrate technology in education, Kenya still lags behind in the digital divide.
The report focused on the impacts of the pandemic on adolescents in Nairobi, Kisumu, Kilifi and Wajir counties, where students between ages 15 and 19 explained their emote learning experiences.
Although the education system was unprepared for the massive changes in learning models, a few months into the pandemic, many learning institutions adapted and leveraged remote and online learning options through the internet, television and radio.
Majority of the learners interviewed reported not to have participated in the virtual classes and instead resorted to reading any materials available at home.
“Only one per cent of learners had access to computers during the pandemic, highlighting the significant digital divide in education in the country,” read the report.
Although some teachers relied on mobile phones to send assignments to students and receive answers as text, the medium was very limited.
Less than a third of students were able to use mobile phones for learning.
Some schools and teachers in marginalised areas were completely unable to offer any virtual or digital lessons.
This was evident in Wajir County, where the learners were left to study on their own without any interaction with teachers.
In Nairobi, only 32 per cent of adolescents had access to mobile phones.
In Kisumu, there was only 25 per cent, while Kilifi and Wajir recorded the lowest number of learners who had access to materials from schools through phones at 12 and 2 per cent respectively.
Lack of internet penetration and electricity worsened the plight of learners in rural areas, who attempted to access lessons through radio and television, while others completely ran out of digital options.
“When schools were closed, we were supposed to study through the radio, but we don’t have one,” said a 17-year-old boy from Makueni.
About 53 per cent of the learners in the four counties reported not participating in virtual lessons due to lack of electricity, while 40 per cent stated that lack of data bundles hindered them from accessing lessons through smartphones and other devices.
“Lower-income households were more affected since they rely more on accessing the internet through the more expensive data bundles, while higher-income households use Wi-Fi services, which are cheaper than mobile data bundles,” reads the report.
The report, however, indicates that initiatives by the government to address the digital divide through DigiTruck Initiative will enable rural youth to obtain digital skills.
The DigiTruck is a solar-powered mobile classroom equipped with internet and smart devices and offers training through a 20 to 40-hour course on the use of computers and smartphones to enable young people to study and find jobs online.
To date, the initiative has trained more than 1,500 youth in 13 locations in eight counties.
Overall, the findings demonstrated that most learners were not able to fully engage in remote learning due to a range of reasons, including lack of access to digital devices and internet connectivity, competing for demands on their time, and the lack of a conducive environment to study.
At the same time, the report displayed gender disparity in remote learning where girls majorly bore the impact of the challenges faced in remote learning raging from the availability of learning devices to disruptions subjected to learners.
While boys reported having owned mobile phones, girls relied on devices lent to them by friends or parents to attend online classes.
In some cases, mobile phones were used together with other siblings, parents, or guardians.
Some reported having had limited access to phones as parents were concerned they would use them to communicate with the opposite gender.
In Kisumu, 72 per cent of the girls who participated in the study said they resorted to reading books irrelevant to schoolwork while their male colleagues were using mobile phones and computers to study and do assignments.
The statistics were however different in Nairobi where more girls reported using mobile phones to access online learning materials.
More adolescent boys than girls returned to school when they reopened in January this year.
According to a government report, young learners could not wait to go back to school as it brought a sense of hope and normalcy.
On the reporting rate, 84 per cent of girls and 92 per cent of boys re-enrolled.
Even though the number looks high, the report said there is still a significant number of learners who did not re-enroll.
Some of the reasons for not re-enrolling were lack of school fees, pregnancies, and availability of work opportunities.
“Based on the projections from the 2019 census, the study estimated that 270,350 girls and 137,113 boys who were in school in March 2020 had not returned by February 2021,” said the report.
Lack of school fees was cited as the major reason among 47 per cent of girls and 21 per cent of boys who did not return to school.
Other key reasons why girls did not return to school were pregnancy (10 per cent) and 5 per cent of the adolescents failed to report to school because they had been married off.
There were others, especially those in Wajir, who felt there was no point to go back to school after a long stay home.
Amongst adolescent boys, the exposure to job opportunities during the pandemic made most of them wish to pursue their jobs and dump school.
Majority of the students (94 per cent) went back to the same school they were in.
Those who switched schools highlighted affordability and lack of school fees as the reason why their parents opted to move them.
The pandemic is believed to have been a major contributor to low grades recorded in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Examination results released in May this year.
Only 20 per cent of the students attained grades high enough to gain entrance to universities.
It also drew concern over the high number of learners who returned to school pregnant band those that did their exams in maternity wards.
“The low performance can be attributed to limited learning during the school closures, lower self-esteem, among other reasons,” said the report.
The Ministry of Education reported that 652 girls sat for the examination in hospital, which is 131 per cent higher than the 282 girls in 2019.
University Academic Staff Union (UASU) Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga (center) flanked by other newly elected UASU National officials singing solidarity songs at a National delegates conference held at Nakuru Athletics Club in Nakuru on July 5 ,2021.
Lecturers from all public universities have come up with new demands that will be part of their next Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Under their umbrella body, University Academic Staff Union (Uasu), the dons have decried unfair treatment by the government as compared to other employees in public sectors.
UASU secretary-general Constantine Wasonga said that in his second term, he shall focus on bridging the inequalities that public university dons face.
“I have been re-elected alongside a very able team and our message to Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) is simple-We shall negotiate. Article 230 of the Constitution is not superior to Article 41,” said Wasonga.
The SG noted that the promotion of lecturers had been left to individual universities which are never in a hurry to do so, thereby limiting their career growth and demotivating them.
“Parliament appropriates money for the promotion of public sector employees. There has never been an appropriation to cater for promotions of dons.
"We shall demand that our promotions are done at equal footing with other government employees across all public universities," said Wasonga.
He explained that despite training professionals now in leadership positions, they have been denied proper health insurance covers which other government officials enjoy.
“We shall be demanding a non-contributory medical scheme for all lecturers. We want to be treated as other civil servants. We are serving the same government in a critical sector,” said Wasonga.
He added that lecturers have been working in an undefined environment for which they are not satisfactorily compensated for their services.
“Every teacher in primary school knows their workload. This is not the case for us. In public universities, some lecturers teach units, evening classes, online, in-person. If they want us to teach, they will have to pay us overtime,” he said.
He added that dons are also discriminated against on car loans which other civil servants enjoy under established schemes.
Form One Students at Jamhuri High School, Nairobi during the School reopening on Tuesday, January 5, 2021
Recommendations of the Building Bridges Initiative Steering Committee that examinable set books in high schools should be locally written and capture local issues has triggered debate in the education sector.
In their proposals, the team suggested that all set books should be by local authors and with content relating to Kenyan life.
It specifically cites the works of leading Kenyan author Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, saying his works should heavily feature in the set books.
The committee also proposed that all books are written in English be translated into vernacular, to encourage children to take an interest in local languages and develop multi-lingual children.
The recommendations are noble.
And they will obligate the Ministry of Education to expose students to more works of literature by Kenyan writers than before.
Literary works are embedded in English, which comprises the study of English as a language and the study of Literature in English.
However, the study of the Literature component is confined to only a few books in high school.
In secondary schools, the syllabus requires that learners engage in critical analysis of the prescribed textbooks which include a novel, a play and an anthology of short stories.
KICD has released new set books that will replace those whose timelines have lapsed.
For literature in English, set books by Oxford, KLB, Longhorn, Spotlight and East African publishers have been picked to replace the existing ones.
Kenyan novel, ‘Blossoms of the Savannah’ which lapses in 2022 will be replaced by ‘Fathers of the Nation’ in January 2023.
The play, ‘A doll’s House’ which lapses in 2022 will be replaced by ‘The rest of the World’ in January 2023.
‘The Pearl’ which lapses in 2021 will be replaced by ‘From the rest of The World’ in May 2022.
‘Inheritance’ which lapses in 2022 will be replaced by ‘Parliament of the Owls’ in January 2023.
Anthology ‘Memories we Lost’ which lapses in 2021 will be replaced by ‘A Silent song and other Stories’ in May, 2022.
And for Kiswahili Fasihi, Tamthilia ‘Kigogo’ which lapses in 2021 will be replaced by ‘Si Shwari’ in 2022.
Hadithi Fupi, ‘Tumbo Lisoloshiba’ which also lapses in 2021 will be replaced by ‘Pambazuko ya Machweo na Hadithi Nyingine’ in 2022.
Riwaya, ‘Chozi la Heri’ which lapses in 2020 will be replaced by ‘Cheche za Moto” in 2023.
KICS also released list of set books for Diploma in Primary Teacher Education.
Tamthilia ‘Kifunganjia by Story Moja publishers will start in September 2021.
The novel ‘The Spider’s Web’ by OnePlanet will also start in September 2021.
And for set books for Diploma in Secondary Teacher Education, the Kenyan novel ‘Grain of Wheat’ which lapses in 2020 will be replaced by ‘Vanishing Herds’ in September 2021.
The play ‘The Successor’, which lapses in 2020 will be replaced by ‘A hole in the Key’ in September 2021.
An anthology ‘Give me a Chance’ by Bookmark Africa will also start in September 2021.
And the novel, ‘Maru’, which lapses in 2020 will be replaced by ‘Eyo’ in September 2021.
Outside these set books, the Ministry of Education has—regrettably—not spelled out books students should be exposed to as part of their exposure to the literary heritage of mankind and Kenya in particular.
English as a subject in Primary and secondary school is inordinately focused on Grammar, Comprehension and Composition.
There is no formal study of or exposure of learners to standard genres of Literature in English –prose and poetry, plays and the novel—in primary schools under the 8–4–4 system of education.
The same applies to High School English. Study of examinable set books starts in Form Three.
KICD has not outlined what books students in Forms One and Form Two should read—leaving many schools and teachers without guidance and compulsion to teach literary texts to students.
The study of English in all its facets—as a language and as a vehicle of culture–is supposed to among others, build to help students comprehend the meaning that the author tries to convey in order to enhance their reading ability.
Also supposed to enhance students' critical thinking and judgmental abilities develop students' writing ability by writing an essay or comments related to the topic of the literature.
It should ideally help students to develop speaking fluency in English by asking questions and sharing their feedback during discussion of a piece of work they are reading or have read as part of their extensive reading.
This should ideally happen right from class four when the learners have learned how to read all the way to Form Four.
This is how an education system can use English to cultivate the nurture the competences human beings need to survive in a complex world we now face.
The government, through the Ministry of Education, will have to radically review the English curriculum/syllabus to ensure that student’s basic education institutions are exposed to more materials of outstanding literary merit than the three or four books they study.
Some observations: Confining students to examinable set books has little or no educational basis whatsoever.
It inspires students to empathise with others, to find their own voice as they reflect on the human condition with discernment, and to consider the impact of their beliefs and actions on society.
The Basic Curriculum Framework—which is the blue print of Competence-Based Curriculum (CBC) notes that the study of Literature in English, should help students, develop “the capacity for critical thinking, personal growth and empathy, enhanced appreciation of diversity in human nature and culture.”
Restricting learners to local authors negates this.
The framework for teaching humanities and social science disciplines requires that students start from the known to the unknown.
They should start with an understanding of Kenya from local to global, to be expanded to East Africa, Africa and the world.
The Education the Basic Education Curriculum Framework we have referred to envision an education not just of imparting or cultivating skills. Rather, an education that is imbued with values.
“The teaching and learning of values will also enable them to value diversity in all people, and to demonstrate respect, empathy and compassion for all people,” it notes.
The “demonstration of respect, empathy and compassion for all people” refers all people, regardless of ethnicity, and nationality and race.
Students can only develop global awareness through exposure to literary texts that include not just local authors but also authors outside Kenya.
The Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) recommendations of examinable textbooks for its secondary school students are noble in vision.
It has enabled students not only to study literary texts by Ugandan authors, but also authors from Kenya, West Africa, South Africa, American, English authors and those from Continental Europe.
You can easily see insularity in our choice of examinable literary texts.
The Recommendation to restrict examinable books to Kenyan will exacerbate the narrow-mindedness even further. It should not happen.
The other danger of restricting examinable books to Kenyan authors is that the Ministry of Education might be forced to recommend books of dubious literary merit for study in our schools.
We shouldn’t force students to study books because our compatriots have written them.
The books should be of high literary value in terms language, imagination and creativity, in terms of moral and cultural vision and also of values.
These books should make students to think deeply about life and all its imperfections and possibilities.
The Basic Education Curriculum Framework lists seven core competencies that should be to be achieved by every learner in basic education.
They are communication and Collaboration, self-efficacy, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Creativity and Imagination, Citizenship, Digital Literacy, and Learning to Learn.
Confining students to local literary texts will not only undermine the achievement of these competences, it will also restrict the opportunities that exist for them beyond the boundaries of Kenya.
The government should broaden the study of English beyond grammar, Comprehension, and composition to include more reading matter of great literary materials—both fictional and nonfictional materials.
We should begin to see class learners in Grade four to Grade 12, getting exposed to folk literature not just of Kenya, but Africa, and the rest of the world.
The same should apply to short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays, and speeches.
Nicholas Maiyo, Kenya Parents Association chairman, suggests teachers agree with MoE to approve the extra charges imposed on parents.
The Kenya National Association of Parents has condemned emerging reports of additional fees imposed on parents by secondary school heads ahead of Form One admission on August 2, saying they should follow the right procedure.
These sentiments come after a report by The Standard established most schools were asking Form One parents to pay between Sh5,000 and Sh35,000 ‘development fees’ before being issued with admission letters.
The school heads had earlier argued that the ministry’s funding was not enough to improve schools’ infrastructure, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Some, though not on record, said the extra money was to build more classes and dormitories for the learner’s comfort.
In an interview with KTN News on Monday morning, Nicholas Maiyo, chair of the Parents’ Association urged school principals to ask for approval from the Ministry of Education concerning the additional levy.
“I am surprised to hear parents are paying for admission. Why? Parents should only feed students and provide personal effects,” he told KTN News.
“We (parents) will not pay money that cannot be audited. Any money paid to schools and is not recognised by the Ministry of Education will automatically not be audited. That is a loophole for graft,” he said.
Maiyo challenged school heads to discuss challenges (classrooms and dormitories) openly with the ministry and chart a way forward.
The principals need to sit down in their unions and come up with an MOA that will see the ministry approve the so-called ‘development fee’.
It is only then that we can agree on the way forward because this way, we are hurting the parents.
In a recent interview, Education Permanent Secretary Julius Jwan said any charge levied on parents without the ministry’s approval is illegal and asked parents to stop making such payments.
“The guidelines are clear on what schools’ management boards should do when they want to raise any additional money therefore, we cannot leave it open for all schools to charge extra levies,” said Jwan.
While pushing for fee increment in 2019, principals pointed an accusing finger towards the government saying it does not fund five key maintenance items in the running of a school.
They said fumigation as a result of Covid-19, window maintenance, kitchen and laboratory maintenance, building repair and maintenance have not been funded.
Uasu elections for Mmust Chapter Returning Officer Swaleh Dianga (right) during the counting of votes where the entire Uasu leadership was voted out in protest by lecturers who accused them of causing disunity in the university on March 24, 2021.
University lecturers will today converge in Nakuru County for their annual delegates conference where they will pick their union representatives.
The event, to be held at Nakuru Athletics Club, comes just a week after the High Court in Nairobi stopped the University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) elections following an application by four lecturers from Kenyatta University.
Franklin Kinoti, Chrispus Easier, Antony Wasena, and Moses Opiyo had challenged the Uasu, Kenyatta University chapter, elections.
Uasu Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga yesterday said he will be defending his seat, saying his tenure has witnessed the implementation of two national Collective Bargain Agreements (CBAs) in one cycle
He will face it off with Prof Sammy Kubasu who returns to teaching after getting back his job at Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology.
Kubasu, who served as the union’s chairman, was sacked in 2010 over his refusal to take up an appointment as Biological Sciences chairman, which the university said amounted to insubordination.
The position of Deputy Secretary-General has attracted the interest of Philip Chebunet, a communications specialist at the University of Eldoret.
Chebunet, will square it out with Chacha Nyaigotti from Garissa University.
Others eyeing the seat are Jacob Musembi of Technical University of Kenya and Mulwa Bendibbie.
Wekesa Maloba from the University of Nairobi is the late entrant in the race, having declared his candidature last Friday.
The position of the union national chairperson will be a fierce battle between Kisii University’s Grace Nyongesa and Muga Rugara of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
Dr Nyongesa entered the race after the long-serving Muga Kolale resigned at the weekend and declared he would not be seeking re-election.
For the Organising Secretary position, Nyaberi Mogaka from University of Eldoret faces Onesmus Mutio from Multi-Media University (MMU), Linda Allan from TUK, and Richard Okero from Moi University.
Chief Executive Officer of the Commissioner of University Education (CUE) Mwenda Ntarangwi
The tussle over accrediting of University programmes has continued as it emerged some professional bodies are still pushing to have the responsibility to approve academic courses.
This is despite a court ruling, in June last year, that handed that responsibility to the Commission for University Education (CUE).
Court of Appeal judges Mohammed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Fatuma Sichale ruled that CUE is the only body mandated to regulate standards and accredit courses, in consultation with individual universities.
“We find no reason to suspend the commission’s mandate in regulating and accrediting courses as provided in the Universities Act. The application filed by the professional associations has no merit and we dismiss it accordingly,” ruled the judges.
The Appellate Court’s decision affirmed CUE’s powers in accrediting university courses, bringing to an end a long-running battle between the commission and several professional associations which demanded that they should be given authority to supervise various university courses.
It is now emerging that despite this ruling, some professional bodies are still pushing for the right to accredit university courses.
It a letter dated June 23, and copied to all vice-chancellors of universities and principals of colleges, CUE Chief Executive Mwenda Ntarangwi cited the breach of court order in the demands by the professional bodies.
“It has come to the knowledge of the commission that professional bodies continue to purport to accredit or approve academic programmes in universities,” said Ntarangwi.
In the letter, Ntarangwi says many universities have complained about the professional bodies demands and ahev asked for direction CUE over the matter.
“On a sad note, and despite court judgement, some professional bodies continue to engage universities with little regard, if any, to the commission. This is not only contemptuous but disregard to the sub-sector regulator,” he said.
And now, Ntarangwi has cautioned VCs not to breach court decision and threatened to withdraw already approved courses or decline any further applications.
“Any university engaging anybody, as far as the accreditation, licensing and recognition of university education (including accreditation/approval of academic programmes) not within an agreed framework with the commission, the commission will decline to accredit/approve such programmes if the same is yet to be accredited/approved,” said Ntarangwi.
He said if universities continue to engage any other body over courses they have already accredited or approved without due consideration of the commission, then CUE will be forced to withdraw such programmes.
He said CUE is, however, ready and willing to work with professional bodies as was advised by the court.
“As much as the commission is open to working with the few professional bodies that have taken this route, universities are hereby notified of consequences of disregarding the court directive and guidance of regulator,” said Ntarangwi.
Professional bodies included Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologists Board, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, Kenya Pharmacy and Poison Board, Nursing Council of Kenya, Kenya Nutritionists and Dieticians Institute and Public Health Officers and Technicians Council.
The associations had challenged Section 5A of the Universities (Amendment) Act 2016 that stipulates accreditation, recognition, licensing, student indexing and approval of any programme offered at a university shall be a mandate of CUE.
Adolescents from Nilotic regions are more likely to experience repeat teenage pregnancies compared to Bantus, according to a study whose results were released yesterday.
The study, by the University of Nairobi in collaboration with UN Women, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the State Department for Gender (SDfG), and the National Gender and Equality Commission (NGEC), indicates Nyanza leads in the number of adolescents, who have had more than one child.
Teenagers, who did not profess any religious faith are more likely to get pregnant, while those of the Muslim faith had the least cases of repeat teenage pregnancies, according to the study titled: Women’s Empowerment, Health and Gender-Based Violence for Gender Equality Policies.
Repeat teenage pregnancies were more prevalent among those without education.
Research findings on sexual violence also show 76 per cent of victims who sought help relied on informal channels, while another 53 per cent neither disclosed the violation nor sought help.
“In most cases, the media, and lately social media, is left to decide, manage, opine and disseminate information on this sensitive subject,” said Ms Verity Mganga, the acting director for Policy and Research at SDfG.
Fear of repercussions, shame, stigma, and a feeling of helplessness were identified as factors hindering female victims’ from reporting sexual violence.
Less-educated women were also found to be less likely to report sexual violence against them.
UN Women country director Anna Mutavati said with availability of data, key areas, such as budget, can be reshaped to cater for areas such as teenage pregnancy and other issues that affect women.
“We decided to partner with the University of Nairobi to empower young researchers to focus on solutions that will fill the existing gender data gap,” Mutavati said during the launch of the report in Nairobi yesterday.
University of Nairobi vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Kiama said: “University of Nairobi takes great pride in its role in interpreting our highly technical work into simple yet impactful communication that resonates with diverse users.”
On contraceptive use, the report, found out that women are more likely to use contraceptives when the decision comes from their husbands or partners.
“Couples who reported that the decision to use of contraceptives was made by their husbands or partners, were twice more likely to use contraceptives than those who made the decision on their own,” reads the report.
The study also found out that more than half of Muslim couples and those who didn’t profess any religion, were not using contraceptives.
On the issue of gender-based violence, the study shows sexual violence has been on the rise over the years, and women are the most affected.
Kenyans should brace themselves for longer days of cold weather and rains in the coming months.
The Kenya Meteorological Department days will also be cloudy and it has thus advised people to “wrap up warm. Dress in layers and wear a scarf if possible. Keep the cold out,” according to its official Twitter account which added, “do not miss a cup of hot coffee for Nairobians, Nyeri and Meru.”
The Met also says people should expect rains in parts of the Highlands, West of the Rift Valley, Lake Victoria Basin and South and Central Rift Valley.
The department’s report in June noted increased cases of respiratory diseases, attributed to the cold weather.
There will be thus increased cases of asthma, pneumonia, flu and common cold with the most affected areas being Nairobi, Highlands East of the Rift Valley, Central Rift Valley and parts of the Highlands West of the Rift Valley.
People in Nairobi and the Coast will also experience rains besides cool and cloudy conditions which will extend to counties in Central and South Rift Valley namely Baringo, Nakuru, Narok and Laikipia will experience sunny days, with nights being partly cloudy.
Strong winds with speeds exceeding 25 knots will be felt in parts of the Coastal region and the South-Eastern Lowlands but mornings will be sunny in the Lake Victoria Basin and the Highlands West of the Rift Valley besides “evening showers over several places during the first half of the forecast period and over a few places thereafter.”
Though, occasional afternoon and evening showers are likely to occur in few places, but counties in the Northwest, including Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu, will have morning rains and afternoon showers and thunderstorms, throughout the forecast period.
Nairobi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Murang'a, Kiambu, Meru, Embu and Tharaka Nthi will have cloudy mornings, giving intermittent sunny intervals and “afternoon showers are likely to occur over a few places throughout the forecast period.”
As of June 6, 2021, nearly half a million Kenyans had been fully vaccinated, Ministry of Health says.
In a statement dated June 6, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said only 1.8 percent (475, 000) of adults have been fully vaccinated.
This even as the ministry reported seven more deaths owing to the virus bringing the cumulative fatalities to 3,697.
Ministry of health says the uptake of the second dose among those who received their first dose is at 46.6% with the majority being male.
“All of them are late deaths reported after conducting facility record audits on diverse dates in the month of June 2021,” CS Kagwe said.
Another 400 people have tested positive for Covid-19, from a sample size of 5,068 tested in the last 24 hours bringing the caseload to 186,453.
The positivity rate is now 7.9%
Some 354 patients recovered from the virus’ 259 of whom are from the home based and isolation while 95 from various health facilities.
Total recoveries now stand at 129,165 out of whom 93,650 are from Home Based Care and Isolation program, while 35,515 are from various health facilities.
The capital, Nairobi had 155 new cases followed distantly by Kilifi with 43 new Covid-19 patients, Uasin Gishu had 34, Siaya 21 as the other counties had less than 20 new infections.
Residents of Mukuyu market decry the health and economic impact effects of dust emanating from a rod abandoned by a local contractor
Families in Mukuyu market are suffering from health and economic impact of the dust pollution from the stalled road construction.
The dust has forced about 300 businesses to close shop including food kiosks after customers kept off.
The market is a major artery for the road connecting Mukuyu, Majocye and Kandundu villages to Mukuyu-Murang’a road
Andrew Konja, the chair of the Mukuyu Market Association lamented that the abandoned constructions has had both health and economic impact since “other than losing income, we have also contracted ailments.”
Samuel Kangethe a victim, mourned that the double tragedy of “closing my business and now I’m on medication after contracting a respiratory disease.”
Nicolous Muriu was a self-employed soup seller “but now I depend on casual labour to feed my young family.”
Murang’a County Public Health Officer Danson Mwangi said his department was aware of the issues and advised that they close their business due to the health hazards as the dust led to airborne diseases, irritation and food contamination “along the road leading to food poisoning and other stomach related problems like Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) and the general sanitation as locals can’t maintain the hygiene standards,” said Mwangi.
The dust also affects the health of plants messing with affects photosynthesis besides interfering with solar and terrestrial radiation, the planetary energy balance and atmospheric circulation.
National Environment Management Authority (Nema) officer, Patricia Mumbi, said the matter has not been reported to them for the contractor to comply with dust regulation as required.
Hospitalisation of malaria cases in parts of Nyanza, Rift Valley and Western region is on the rise.
Kisumu County has recorded a surge of malaria cases with health officials confirming that this season marks the peak of the disease.
Reports at the department of health indicate the hardest hit are children.
The worst-hit areas are Nyando, Nyakach, Seme and Kisumu East sub-counties as hospitals express fears that they might run short of antimalarial medicines to meet the demand.
The rapid increase of malaria cases has been attributed to heavy rains and the rising water levels in Lake Victoria.
The County Director of Health, Fredrick Oluoch, said Kenya Medical Supply Agency (Kemsa) supplied antimalarial medicines and test kits in May and was yet to supply another batch.
“We have antimalarial medicines to treat the disease but if we don’t receive another consignment we might run short of supplies,” Oluoch said.
Last month, health officials distributed 930,000 mosquito nets across the county in high-risk areas to help manage the disease.
In Rift Valley, the cases are on the rise in parts of Kerio Valley, in Elgeyo Marakwet County, Nandi and Trans Nzoia, causing an overstretch of facilities
. At least 300 cases have been reported along the Kerio Valley belt in the past one week, according to David Mosop, Arror Ward public health officer. Mosop urged the government to distribute mosquito nets as mitigation in fighting the disease.
In the past, the commodities were supplied by the government, but three years ago, Elgeyo Marakwet was removed from the list of malaria-endemic counties.
“It is worrying that failure by locals to sleep under treated mosquito nets is a major contributor to increased cases of malaria,” said Mosop.
Maureen Kibet’s five-year-old son was rushed to Arror Mission Health Centre after he developed high temperature and vomiting.
The mother revealed the boy has not been sleeping under a mosquito net as she cannot afford one.
“Mosquito nets are sold for Sh300 and are not locally available. One has to travel to Eldoret town, about 200 kilometres away, to get one,” she said.
The Standard established that local shops and chemists at Arror trading centre do not sell mosquito nets.
In Eldoret town, the nets are sold at between Sh300 and Sh1,500 depending on quality and manufacturer.
Arror Mission Health Centre, under the Catholic Diocese of Eldoret, is among the facilities currently receiving an influx of patients.
More than 50 patients are diagnosed with the disease every day, an increase from about 15 patients, according to the facility’s administrator Caroline Kimwattan.
“An outbreak of malaria has been reported in the past one week and the number of patients seeking healthcare is on the rise,” said the official.
Most patients reviewed at the mission facility are aged below 12.
Last year, the Ministry of Health directed Elgeyo Marakwet and Baringo counties to strengthen weekly surveillance, diagnostic and treatment of malaria reported along Kerio Valley.
In a letter by the acting Director-General in the ministry Patrick Amoth, the malaria situation was likely to stretch for a longer period and exert pressure on the health system.
In Nandi, the cases have been on the rise, more so at Tinderet, along the border of Nandi and Kisumu counties.
Maraba Sub-county Hospital has been attending to patients suffering from malaria and reports an upsurge in cases.
Records from the facility show in March they had 89 patients, 93 in April while May recorded 123.
Micha Biwott, the health medical superintendent in Maraba attributed the spike to the warm and humid conditions experienced in the areas bordering Kisumu County.
“This is the nearest health facility in the region and people cross the border even from Kisumu to seek medication. This is why we have recorded high cases of malaria and we have been emphasising that locals adopt preventive measures,” Biwott said.
According to the health department report, Nandi County recorded over 40,000 malaria cases while 37,817 clinical malaria was tested in patients with other ailments.
Bungoma, Kakamega, Busia and Vihiga counties are also grappling with a new wave of malaria infections among children under five and pregnant women.
Bungoma Health executive Antony Walela said public health facilities have recorded more than 50,000 cases up from 30,000 in the last three months.
“The upsurge is worrying. In May alone public hospitals recorded over 50,000 cases and the figures continue to rise especially in Sirisia, Kabuchai, Kanduyi and Bumula constituencies,” said Mr Walela.
Bungoma is among eight counties in Western and Nyanza where malaria vaccination was launched by World Health Organisation (WHO) about two years ago on a pilot basis.
Kakamega County Chief Officer of Health Brenda Makokha said at least 10 sub-counties experience infections throughout the year while two, Lugari and Likuyani, experience infections during rainy seasons.
In Kenya, there are an estimated 3.5 million new clinical malaria cases and 10,700 deaths each year.
According to WHO, malaria causes more than 400,000 deaths each year worldwide with 229 million cases reported in 2019 alone.
The ministry of health together with other stakeholders has launched a strategy that is aimed at preventing, controlling and eliminating leishmaniasis disease by 2030.
According to experts, Kenya is one of the few countries hosting more than 95 per cent of Kala-azar cases worldwide.
Five million Kenyans, mainly children aged five to 14 years are at risk of the disease, mostly in nine ASAL Counties.
Turkana, West Pokot, Isiolo, Wajir, Marsabit, Garissa, Mandera, Kitui, Nakuru and Nyandarua are some of the counties that have been established to have major cases of leishmaniasis.
Nakuru and Nyandarua have reported major cases of disfiguring skin lesions from cutaneous leishmaniasis.
“Visceral Leishmaniasis attacks vital internal organs leading to their failure, if left untreated death occurs within two years. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis affects the skin and causes lesions to appear on it. If left untreated, 95 per cent of people with kala-azar risk death,” said Dr Rashid Aman, the Chief Administrative Secretary in the ministry of health.
According to Dr Sultani Matendechero, the head of the division of Vector-Borne and Neglected Tropical Diseases, Kenya has reportedly faced hitches in controlling the disease due to misdiagnosis and little or no budgetary allocation for the disease.
