British, French Foreign Ministers to Re-Invigorate DRC Peace Process - 2002-01-18
The British and French foreign ministers travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo Monday to kickoff a three-day, four-nation tour of the troubled region of Central Africa.
The mission will be jointly led by British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine.
They will be visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.
Their primary objective is to breathe new life into the peace process in the war-torn Congo.
Specifically, the British and French want to see the withdrawal of foreign troops who back the Congolese government (n Kinshasa, demobilization of rebels who occupy more than half the country, and peace talks to end the conflict.
British Foreign Secretary Straw said the mission also has a broader goal of making sure the Congo does not become another Afghanistan.
"The 11th of September has made it much more urgent that we take earlier action against failed, and failing states," he said.
In Kinshasa, the ministers will meet Congolese President Joseph Kabila. He took power one year ago, after his father, President Laurent Kabila, was assassinated by one of his bodyguards.
Their next stop will be Kigali for talks with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and the leader of the Rally for Congolese Democracy rebels, Adolphe Onusumba.
The ministers will make a brief visit to Burundi to discuss that country's civil war with President Pierre Buyoya.
The tour will end in Uganda, where meetings are scheduled with President Yoweri Museveni and Jean-Pierre Bemba, who leads the Movement for the Liberation of Congo guerrillas.
UNICEF Pushes for Demobilizing Child Soliders Near Africa's Great Lakes - 2002-10-07
The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum.
The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives.
UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units.
"We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations.
We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group.
But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization," Mr. Fontaine said.
He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves.
According to UNICEF, The Democratic Republic of Congo still has some 10,000 children recruited to fight, while Rwanda has up to 2,000 children involved in combat.
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers.
They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory.
Sometimes, boys, but mainly girls, are used as sex slaves. They are exposed to violence and HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
The girls may become pregnant, making it harder for them to reintegrate into their communities.
UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money.
He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units.
Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives. That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care.
"You do not want to stigmatize them and individualize them.
They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited.
So, you are trying to build services in those communities that are broad services, that would be made available to all those children," Mr. Fontaine said.
Mr. Fontaine says, as part of various peace packages in the Great Lakes region, the World Bank and other donors are providing $500 million to help demobilize children.
He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough.
He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again.

World Bank, Nike Team Up for 'The Girl Effect' Initiative
The Adolescent Girls Initiative partners the World Bank, the Nike Foundation and governments of developing and developed nations to empower girls in poor countries.
The two-year-old program is helping girls in Asia, Africa and the Middle East gain the education and skills they need to transition into the workforce.
"My name is Sanchita. I come from a small village called Ishwarpur in Bangladesh," American actress Anne Hathaway delivered her lines as powerfully from behind a podium at the World Bank as she does on the silver screen, telling the story of an impoverished girl.
"When a baby is born in Ishwarpur, families desperately hope it will be a boy," she continued. "It has been this way for as long as anyone can remember.
It is believed that boys will contribute to the family income in a place where people are very poor.
"These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative.
Who benefits?A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.
They were just a few of the girls who benefit from training and education programs that help them transition from school to employment.
Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.
"Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world," explained Hathaway.
"I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.'" Girl power"The Girl Effect" is what the Adolescent Girls Initiative wants to see happen for 600 million girls in developing countries.
Overall, an estimated one-third of young women in developing nations are not employed and not in school.World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.
"If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates," Zoellick said.
"The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty."
Current operations The Adolescent Girls Initiative public-private partnership, with its $20 million in funds, is already at work in seven countries, with plans to expand to Haiti and Yemen. Mayra Buvinic talks about the Adolescent Girls Initiative
"So where we are in Liberia and Nepal, young women are completing the first rounds of training," explained Mayra Buvinic, director of Gender and Development at the World Bank.
"In South Sudan, 100 adolescent girls' clubs will have opened in four states by the end of this month. In Jordan, female community college graduates are gaining access to vouchers.
In Afghanistan, Lao PDR and Rwanda, assessments are being completed, and the projects will be launched at the end of this quarter.
"Thanks and praise Kebbeh Kamara tells the audience how she's benefited from the World Bank/Nike initiative
Kebbeh Kamara said she has benefited from training in Greater Monrovia, Liberia.
Wearing a pink dress and sporty black headband decorated with rhinestones, she addressed the World Bank audience from the stage.
"I learned how to start a business, how to earn money on your own, how to be self-sustainable," she said, "how to save money and what to spend money for.
" Sarah Poni Saturnino, 19, of Juba, Southern Sudan, told VOA she is enjoying her first trip to the United States and all the empowerment training and activities.
She said she hopes to take the lessons she has learned here in workshops back to the Adolescent Girls Initiative clubs in Southern Sudan.
"I learned about how to express yourself. Eye contact. Speak loud," explained Saturnino. "This way can give me really a voice to speak in front of people.
And even if I go back home, I'm not longer Sarah again -- I'm somebody now." Somebody who has earned the admiration of a fellow Southern Sudanese citizen, child-soldier-turned-rapper Emmanuel Jal.
A supporter of the Adolescent Girls Initiative, Jal performed at the World Bank event.
The girls joined him on stage, beaming as they danced behind him -- as did at least one World Bank official -- while the audience of staffers in business suits took to their feet and raised their hands in the air as well.
Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.
She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.
Striving for peace in the region
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.
"The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict," said Rostagno.
Deteriorating situation amid global concern
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.
"A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us," said Rostagno.
"I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today.
"The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.
"They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access," said Rostagno. Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice.
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.
"We waged a war that shouldn't have happened," he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.
"God have mercy on us," he said.The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday."
The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons" he said.
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid.
Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating "a democratic and just society without racial divisions.
" He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa.
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.
"I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world," he said.
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.
"It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur," Tutu said.Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.
But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly "shut up."
"I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed," he said. "I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better."Many say his voice will be missed.
Malawi's Jacaranda School for Orphans Celebrates Christmas
The management for the Jacaranda School for Orphans in Malawis commercial capital Blantyre recently hosted a party for its students as it closed for Christmas and New Years Day holidays.
Around 500 people including students, staff members and others from surrounding areas attended the event, which was held at the schools premises in Chigumula area.
The party included gifts, Santa Claus, and a "dancing show case" by the students.
The school management told VOA that the yearly celebration has been a school tradition for the past 13years.
The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: "[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents.
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children.
So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas. And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."
No media source currently available
Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to "a nice meal" from the students.
"We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables.
And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people," he said.
One of the students, Eddah Zimba, said, "The celebrations are really cool, ... I have enjoyed myself. I have eaten, and now I am here dancing.
What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.
"This party has brought a change in my life. I have learned that we have to have a heart for sharing one another as the Father Christmas was doing," he said.
Founded in 2002, the Jacaranda School for Orphans is the only one in Malawi which provides free primary, secondary and tertiary education to children without parents.
A Malawian woman, Marie Da Silva, started the school after she returned from the United States where she spent nineteen years working as a nanny.
"In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new," said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA.
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom."
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.
Russia, China among worst
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war."
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.
"It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia," Clayton said.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.
"But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia," Clayton said. "At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine."
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention. The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive."
"President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime," RSF's country file states.
Rising authoritarianism
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.
Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence." Afghanistan ranked 154th.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.
"Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks," the group said.
Clayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.
"When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect," he said.
"It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same."
US not perfect
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index.
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.
"We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them.
An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event," said Beth Francesco, senior director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute.
A few bright spots
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.
"If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media," he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index. Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places. But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."
UN’s Guterres Meets with Nigerian Leaders After Visiting Volatile Borno State
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres met with Nigerian leaders Wednesday at the end of a two-day visit to Nigeria and three-nation trip to Africa.
The delegates, led by Nigeria's minister for womens affairs, Pauline Kedem Tallen, discussed gender equality and the inclusion of women in politics with the U.N. secretary-general.
"His coming to Nigeria today has given us hope, because we know that he will lend his voice to all the issues affecting women, gender-based violence, early marriage, lack of implementation of some of our laws," said Tallen.
Guterres afterwards met with Nigeria's religious leaders and later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the U.N. house to remember the 23 people killed during the 2011 bombing of the building.
He began his three-nation Africa visit Sunday in Senegal as part of his Ramadan solidarity tour, and later went to Niger.
On Tuesday, he visited northeastern Borno state and met with the state governor as well as IDPs and families impacted by the Boko Haram conflict.
Guterres also visited repentant Boko Haram fighters and praised authorities' reintegration program for more than 1,000 former fighters.
He also commended authorities efforts to resettle displaced people back to their communities and called for more support to rebuild the region.
"The Borno that I found today is the Borno of hope, the Borno with future and I was very impressed to see the policy that is being deployed here, recognizing that you don't fight terrorism just by military means, you fight terrorism addressing the root causes of terrorism," he said.
"The people that I met today in the IDP camps want to go back home in safety and dignity.
The way to address terrorism effectively is to provide not only hope but a future of reality."
Nigerian authorities have been closing IDP camps since late last year and want to close all camps by 2026. More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009.
But aid groups have been warning some communities may still be attacked.
"There are multiple solutions when it comes to resettlement. We need to get people stabilized," said Adenike Oladosu, a climate justice activist, met with the U.N. secretary-general.
"Climate change is leading to the rise of armed conflicts affecting people in the region and around and the need for us to see that we have more climate action and not always military action."
The U.N. secretary-general ended his visit at the Abuja presidential village, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari and his top Cabinet members.
Al-Shabab Raids African Union Military Base
Al-Shabab fighters stormed an African Union military base in the village of El-Baraf in Somalias Middle Shabelle region early Tuesday, local officials and security sources say.
Officials told VOA Somali that the militants briefly seized the base before withdrawing from it. State media said Burundian solders at the base repulsed the attack.
"The Federal Government of Somalia condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack targeting the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia forward operating base in Elbaraf, Middle Shabelle," the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its official Facebook page.
"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of this terrorist attack and their families."
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs. He said the militants then fought their way onto the base.
Al-Shabab claimed the killing of 173 African Union forces. The group also claimed responsibility for capturing AU forces as prisoners-of-war. Both claims could not be independently verified. AU force headquarters and Somali military officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
In an interview with VOA, Muhumed, who was not at the village at the time of the attack, said he was told there were "many deaths" among Burundian forces but could not give an exact figure.
"Fighting like this never happened in this area," he said. "It was heavy fighting."
He said two civilians were also killed and more than 10 others injured.
Muhumed confirmed to VOA that al-Shabab militants withdrew from the base. He also reported airstrikes targeting the militants as they left the base but did not say who was responsible for the strikes.
El-Baraf, approximately 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu, is one of the forward operating bases of African Union forces from Burundi.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), gives it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity-building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to Somalia. The mission has until the end of 2024 to operate in the country.
India’s Muslims Mark Eid al-Fitr Amid Community Violence
Muslims across India marked Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday by offering prayers outside mosques, even as the celebrations this year came in the backdrop of a series of recent attacks against the community during the month of Ramadan.
"We will not have the same kind of festivity" this time, said Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, a civil engineer in Indias financial capital, Mumbai. "This is the most painful Eid with worst memories for Indian Muslims."
Anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks have surged across the country in the last month, including stone throwing between Hindu and Muslim groups during religious processions and subsequent demolitions of a number of properties mostly belonging to Muslims by authorities.
The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance. Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it. Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions.
In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic. The region also saw a rise in violence during Ramadan, with at least 20 militants, two civilians and five police and soldiers killed.
"As we prepare to celebrate Eid, a strong sense of collective loss jars at us," said Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Srinagar.
Kashmir is the Muslim-majority disputed region where a violent insurgency against Indian rule and New Delhis brutal crackdown has raged for over three decades. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict.
Meanwhile in the capital, New Delhi, hundreds assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of Indias largest mosques, while offering Eid prayers there for the first time in over two years due to pandemic restrictions. Families came together early on Tuesday morning while many people shared hugs and wishes.
Beijing Residents Brace for COVID-19 Lockdown
Unlike Shanghai, Beijing has yet to require that all its residents remain at home to contain the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, many people in its Chaoyang district and elsewhere are preparing for that possibility.
On Wednesday, city officials closed 60 subway stations, more than 10% of Beijing's vast system. They did not say when service would be resumed, according to ABC News.
Beijing, a city of 21 million people, has been on high alert for the spread of COVID-19, as restaurants and bars pivot to takeout, gyms close and schools suspend classes indefinitely, according to CNBC.
People who live in "controlled" areas, neighborhoods where cases have been discovered, have been told to stay in the city, and all residents must test for the virus three times throughout the week, according to ABC.
Chinese authorities reported 5,489 cases nationwide on Wednesday, of which 4,982 were in Shanghai, which has been under a draconian lockdown for weeks.
Beijing reported 46 symptomatic cases and five asymptomatic on Wednesday. The city's total since April 22, what it considers the start of its omicron outbreak, is 544.
Mr. Zhang, a Beijing resident, said he had bought extra food and water, even though he doesn't think Beijing will be locked down like Shanghai. He asked that VOA not use his full name because he was afraid of attracting official attention.
"I have six bags of rice, two bags of noodles, and several boxes of water, instant noodles and (nutritionally dense) biscuits, and I haven't stocked up too much," Zhang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview last week. He said he bought his groceries online because the supermarket was crowded.
Ms. Yao, who lives in the Chaoyang district, told VOA Mandarin that she had been stocking up on necessities since the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Commerce recommended that everyone do so. She asked that VOA Mandarin not use her full name because she wanted to avoid official retribution.
"I have always maintained a good habit of reserving food. So I have a lot of rice, noodles and oil at home," she said, adding that she figured her family would be fine even if Beijing locked down for a month.
And while Beijing has not yet closed the city, citizens' lives have been disrupted.
On April 28, the Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital issued a notice that the outpatient and emergency departments of the hospital would suspend the admission of patients.
On the same day, Chaoyang Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Beijing, announced on its official Weibo account that its emergency department would also suspend the admission of patients. Weibo is China's equivalent of Twitter.
Angry Chinese netizens left more than 800 messages under the official WeChat account "Beijing Headline."
"Why do you stop the emergency room as soon as there is a new COVID case, and how many people will be killed due to the secondary disaster caused by the COVID?" a netizen asked in a Weibo post.
Some Beijing residents said they were not worried about a Shanghai-like lockdown.
"Basically, I'm not afraid," said Mr. Wang, who asked VOA Mandarin to not use his full name so he could avoid attracting authorities' attention. "The party, government and military are here, and the people are here."
However, Wang told VOA Mandarin, in mid-October last year, after one person in his apartment building was diagnosed as positive, about 600 people from more than 200 families were forced into isolation at several hotels in the Changping district for 21 days.
Wang and his wife were not allowed to share a room at their hotel.
What particularly puzzled and annoyed Wang was that on the last day of the mandatory hotel quarantine, in addition to routine nasal and oral swabs during testing, authorities added anal swabs to the regimen.

At US Urging, Fiji Seizes Russian Oligarch’s Yacht
Another Russian oligarchs yacht was seized Thursday as part of efforts to punish Russia over its war in Ukraine.
At the request of the United States, Fijian officials took a $300 million yacht belonging to Suleiman Kerimov, the Justice Department said. Officials say the yacht is in Lautoka, Fiji.
Kerimovs yacht, the Cayman Island-flagged Amadea, reportedly has been in Fiji since last month, arriving from Mexico. Defense lawyers claimed the vessel belonged to another oligarch.
Kerimov had already been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2014 and 2018 for Russias activities in Syria and Ukraine. The European Union also sanctioned him.
In March, the U.S. government announced a comprehensive effort to identify and seize the assets of wealthy Russians who have supported the government of Russian President Vladmir Putin, as part of the response to Moscows February 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The initiative, led by the Justice Department, is called Task Force KleptoCapture.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday in a statement there is "no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime." He also said, "The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who facilitate the death and destruction we are witnessing in Ukraine."
In April, at the urging of the U.S., Spanish authorities seized a yacht belonging to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, the owner of the Russian conglomerate Renova Group.
Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that would allow the U.S. government to sell forfeited Russian properties worth more than $2 million for the benefit of Ukraine. The measures next step is the Senate.

WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.
Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a "modest" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were "not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect" in another spike of disease.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done.
"The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become," he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. "If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission," he said.
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.
Myanmar Supreme Court Rejects Aung San Suu Kyi Appeal on Corruption Charges
An appeal of a five-year jail sentence against ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was rejected Wednesday by the country's supreme court.
The decision reportedly came as soon as the claim for an appeal was lodged, and the court didn't entertain arguments from either side in the case.
Suu Kyi, 76, was sentenced last week after being found guilty of 11 counts of corruption, including taking a bribe of cash and gold bars worth $600,000.
Her lawyer called the charge absurd.
Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to six years for actions against the military, breaking COVID-19 rules and breaking a telecommunications law.
She faces many more charges, and if found guilty could be sentenced to more than 150 years in jail.
Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since a military coup took over the country last year.
Since the coup, on Feb. 1, 2021, there have been widespread protests against the military regime. The regime cracked down violently in many cases, leaving more than 1,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 arrested, charged or sentenced, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma).

Foreign Tourists Begin Arriving in New Zealand After COVID Restrictions Lifted
For the first time in over two years, overseas tourists have been allowed to enter New Zealand starting Monday.
The island nation known for its natural beauty enacted some of the strictest lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, including very restrictive travel limitations.
The country had reopened for tourists from Australia weeks ago, but the new relaxation of restrictions now allows tourists from over 60 countries to visit, including most European countries and the U.S.
"Today is a day to celebrate and is a big moment in our reconnection with the world," said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash.
Tourists must show they are fully vaccinated and test negative for the virus.
Citizens of China, India and other countries not given a waiver Monday are still not allowed to visit.
Before the pandemic, tourism accounted for 5% of the countrys economic activity and 20% of its foreign income.
On Monday, 43 international flights carrying around 9,000 passengers were scheduled to leave or arrive at Auckland International Airport, Reuters reported.

Report: Iran to Execute Swedish-Iranian National by May 21
Iran will later this month execute a Swedish-Iranian national whom it has imprisoned since 2016 and convicted of spying for Israel, media reported.
Irans semiofficial ISNA news agency on Wednesday released a report in which Iranian officials stated that Tehran will implement the death penalty against Ahmad Reza Jalali by May 21.
Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016. In 2017, Jalali was sentenced to death in Iran after he had been found guilty of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel to help it assassinate several nuclear scientists.
Rights groups have condemned Jalalis detention, citing Irans pattern of detaining dual nationals and expatriates without due process.
Iran does not recognize dual nationals.
The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019.
Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest.
On Wednesday, the final day of Nouri's trial, a Stockholm district court judge set the date of the verdict for July 14.
Amnesty International put the number of those executed at the prison at 5,000 but said in a 2018 report that the number could be higher.
Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, said, "Iran continues to be one of the worlds leading implementers of the death penalty."
If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses. Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case.
Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial.
"It indicates that (Iran) sees him as a kind of piece in the jigsaw puzzle, which is very worrying," Aberg told Sweden's TT news agency.
Swedish law allows for the prosecution of Swedish citizens and other nationals for crimes against international law committed abroad.

Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy.
"President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties," said Ogutcu. "Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this. And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed."
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.
"Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support," said Ogutcu. "The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey. But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries. So, there are real economic and political security interests involved."
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.
"Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today," said Ozel. "And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.
"Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength," said Ozel.
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism."
Notorious' system
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.
"The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image," he said.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University.
"As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region," said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added.
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.
Shadow of Khashoggi
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.
"In my view, this is all window-dressing," said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.
"It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer."
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation.
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.
"I want to, many do, but we're scared," said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.
"Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi."
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war. "A terrifying experience," he says.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path."
"It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes," he said.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad." He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said. "I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.
"That period of my life has passed," he said.
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups. Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.
Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported.
The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying "a prominent Russian car maker" requested parts from Iran. He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components.
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions. However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine.
"So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart," said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart. He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability.
Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran "opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine," and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan.
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.
"I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story," the 42-year-old journalist said.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.
She countered with a better offer.
"I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect," she said. "I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA.
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.
"If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict."
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said.
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.
Making connections
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.
"There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting," she said.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that.
"When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust," she said. "If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
"Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out," she said.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.
"Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you," she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.
"While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them," Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.
"Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents," Sancha said.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.
"Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines," Abbas said. "It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.
"The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region," Abbas said.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.
"We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about," she said.
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed.
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country.
It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed "Death to America, Death to Israel" slogans.
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize.
"What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians," Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs.
Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century "are null and void".
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
"Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction," Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran.
"Our responses are painful. You create conditions for your own destruction. We will not leave you alone ...You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action."
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.
In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its "Kheibar Buster" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles).
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list.
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.
"For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation," says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
"It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church," Cox says.
"And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important."
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.
Third places Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.
"If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good," says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.
"It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways," Espinola says.
"So, places like third places can allow us to do that."
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place — a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
"What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community," says Cox. "They're much more likely to engage in other activities there.
They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.
And many are open most days of the week.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.
"I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential," Cox says.
"But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees. … They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other. … I don't know where else they would have gone — maybe a church, but maybe not — to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops."
What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021.
The respondents headed cities with at least 75,000 residents. The local leaders are still focused on traditional issues such as violent crime, the economy and infrastructure, but they are most concerned about the pandemics long-term impact on the mental health of their constituents.
Mental health was top of mind for Michael Udine when he was sworn in as mayor of Broward County, Florida, in November 2021.
"Everything that was a potential issue pre-pandemic has pretty much been exacerbated by the pandemic," he says.
"There were issues going into the pandemic, and it was becoming more and more important on everyone's radar screen about the mental health of people of all ages. And I think the pandemic pretty much supercharged those issues."
It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic.
The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth.
"What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions," Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month. "We've also seen a lot more sadness and depression."
Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors.
"Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 … is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents," Glick says.
"Concerns about polarization over vaccines and just people being pushed to their limits … and certainly less on their city budgets and revenues and having to cut programs and some of those types of things that were probably more top of mind earlier in the pandemic."
Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about "lingering mental health challenges and trauma," according to the survey.
Additionally, more than one-third of mayors, 37%, are worried about learning loss among young people.
"Second only to mental health and trauma, and they're probably not totally independent concerns," Glick says.
"It is part of that shift of mayors concerns from immediate threats to businesses closing and people getting sick, to some of these longer-term consequences that are going to persist in the future.
And learning loss among their students, theyre worried it's going to persist for many, many, many years into the future. It's hard to make up for."
According to the survey, other top concerns for Americas mayors include the financial insecurity of low-income residents (33%), the closing of small businesses (29%) and increased crime and violence (26%).
Just 7% of mayors are worried about the shift to remote work and the long-term impact that could have on outmigration — people moving away from their cities.
The $350 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to local and state governments could help mayors address some of their concerns.
The survey found that 78% of mayors believe the money will allow them to make meaningful change.
"What we're seeing is a large majority are using it for things they consider to be transformative and will make major changes to their cities," Glick says, "instead of feeling obligated or feeling the necessity to use it to plug up over-budget gaps to keep the doors open and the lights on."
Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials — people aged 24 to 40 — and even baby boomers — the over-57 club.
"You have aging millennials who are creating families who should be moving from rental situations into ownership but, because of the lack of housing supply, that has been stopped in a lot of instances.
And so, what you see is the aging millennial population continues to rent," says Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi-Matrix, a commercial real estate data and research firm.
"It's not just about millennials, it's not just about [Gen] Z [people under 24], we also see that boomers are making a transition, he added. "Their percentage of moving into rental properties is growing in the last five years."
There are a variety of reasons older people are opting for rentals, according to Ressler.
"They've lived in a home for so long and they want to be able to reduce their expenses on a fixed income," he says.
"They want to live in a social cohort, like a retirement community, and things like that where it's much more socially amenable to them."
The asking price of apartment rentals was up 10.7% in September 2021 compared to last year at the same time, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).
"It's a hot market. We have never seen this market so hot in the last decade," says Gay Cororaton, NARs senior economist and director of housing and commercial research. "The average rent growth, year-over-year, is about 3-to-5%. We're seeing 11% rent growth now, so, clearly, way above trends weve had in the past."
Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States.
Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021.
The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past.
"The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues," Cororaton says.
"Shipments couldn't come in, the price of lumber was rising, manufacturing slowed, workers could not come in [to work], so you have shortages of frames, appliances. So, essentially, just a short supply."
The housing supply got even tighter during the pandemic as more investors put their money into housing, according to Cororaton, while existing homeowners looked for second homes.
"With the pandemic, there was also a big demand for second homes, for vacation homes. Typically, vacation homes accounted for just about 5% [of the market]," she says.
"Early this summer they rose to about 8%. So again, strong demand and strong imbalance of demand and supply caused home prices to rise, made them less affordable."
The hottest rental markets right now are in the West and South. More renters are moving to Dallas and Houston in Texas, followed by Atlanta, Georgia; New York; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington, D.C., according to NAR.
Cororaton expects the coming year to be a little better but says the housing shortage is likely to continue for the next few years.
"You know, the old adage of moving from rentals into homeownership, that whole polemic may be changing," says Ressler.
"The sweet spot was always the millennials, and now the millennials are being replaced by the [Gen] Zs, but the millennials are staying longer and the Zs are coming on board, and now you've got the demographic of the boomers … What it means is a very profitable and dynamic [rental] market that's going to continue to grow."
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.
"There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things," says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.
"They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.
"They're exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity.
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."
"The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor," says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.
"A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in.
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.
"Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system," Warren says. "Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.
"One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines.
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.
"But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.
"Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses," she says.
"The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids against new things that then come along."
US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments.
That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.
Limon said the administration is "trying to get every last bit out of Title 42" before it expires.
She called it "sobering" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes.
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents.
Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.
"It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants," the bishop said.
"But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date.
"The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone," Ajic said.
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S.
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo.
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November. It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months. It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement.
"This temporary rule will provide those noncitizens otherwise eligible for the automatic extension an opportunity to maintain employment and provide critical support for their families while avoiding further disruption for U.S. employers," USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said in a statement.
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork. In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing.
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.
"For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity.
In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings," according to the USCIS statement.
The USCIS historically has been underfunded because most of the agency's funding comes from application fees that have stalled at $5 billion a year since 2019.
What Is the US-Launched 'Uniting for Ukraine' Program?
U.S. President Joe Biden recently announced the Uniting for Ukraine program, which aims to streamline the process for Ukrainians who have fled their country and are seeking safety in the United States.
The new program, which took effect Monday, will complement existing legal pathways available to those fleeing Russian aggression due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, Biden administration officials said.
"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to provide relief to the Ukrainian people, while supporting our European allies who have shouldered so much as the result of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine," Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to reporters on April 21.
What is Uniting for Ukraine?
The program allows U.S. citizens and residents to sponsor Ukrainian refugees under different immigration statuses. The online portal, open to potential sponsors or organizations, is accepting applications and has received more than 4,000 requests so far, CNN reported.
Who qualifies under the program? Ukrainians, or an immediate family member of a Ukrainian citizen. They must have a U.S. sponsor and have been a resident of Ukraine as of February 11.
What are the requirements? They must pass security checks — including a fingerprint and an FBI name check and biographic and biometric screening — and meet public health requirements, such as having the proper vaccinations, before entering the U.S.
Those approved will be allowed to travel to the U.S., be considered for humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis, stay in the country for two years, and apply for work permits.
"The United States strongly encourages Ukrainians seeking refuge in the United States who do not have and are not eligible for a visa to seek entry via Uniting for Ukraine from Europe.
This will be the safest and most efficient way to pursue temporary refuge in the United States," a DHS statement said.
Who qualifies as a sponsor?
U.S. citizens and other residents who hold lawful status in the United States or who are beneficiaries of Deferred Enforced Departure, Temporary Protected Status, or Deferred Action, among others.
Sponsors will be required to prove they can financially support the refugee while they are in the U.S. They also need to pass security and background vetting "to protect against exploitation and abuse." The Ukrainian applicant will receive authorization only after everything is verified, including that the sponsor has the means to support them while they are in the U.S.
Who is not eligible for parole under the program?
Ukrainian citizens already in the U.S. are not eligible for parole under Uniting for Ukraine.
However, they can apply for Temporary Protected Status, which is another form of humanitarian relief that allows people to legally stay and work in the U.S.
What about those arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border?
Citing safety issues, U.S. officials have urged Ukrainians not to travel to Mexico in hopes of entering the United States. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has no place to hold them while they go through the Uniting for Ukraine vetting process.
Since Uniting for Ukraine's launch on Monday, Ukrainians who arrive at U.S. ports of entry without a valid visa or without preauthorization to travel to the United States through the Uniting for Ukraine program will be denied entry and told to apply to the program.
Biden officials hope this will curb the number of Ukrainian migrants seeking humanitarian parole along the border.
Those at the border must apply under the rules of Uniting for Ukraine, meaning they must have a qualifying sponsor or a non-government agency willing to sponsor them in the U.S. for up to two years. And they need to have all required vaccinations and pass background checks.
The Biden administration announced the private sponsorship initiative as another way the U.S. hopes to achieve President Biden's commitment to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by the Russian military invasion.
As of Thursday, almost 5.4 million refugees have since left Ukraine, according to U.N. data.
Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-15
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide. A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand.
"There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities," he says. "If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders.
"Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view," he says. "All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place," he says.
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government.
Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.
"This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time," said Mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.
"My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation," said Mwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse."
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.
"My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible," said Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.
"We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative," said Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.
"I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them," said Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.
"Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions," said Makonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed."
"I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily," said Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.
"Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. [Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately," said Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people. The organization says it worked well.
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water. But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky. "We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. There are so many risks. You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us."
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river. But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.
"These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked. This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station. Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.
"January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be," Mateyu said.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks. The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.
Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre. The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene."
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.
"I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me. But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace]," said Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.
"As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter," said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.
"At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children," said Ligomeka.
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.
"Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. There was a possibility that something was going to be published. And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem," said Kanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful. But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.
"Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing," he said. "Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.
"We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities," Davis said. "These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."
Slow progress
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said. "Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week. Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.
"In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision," Hebert said.
"Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers. Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.
"It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands," "Msowoya said.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met. "Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted. The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses." Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.
"There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours," noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu. "We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.
There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe. But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.
Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-24
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted. WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. "The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing," she said. "We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries. About half of these people are in Zimbabwe. The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates. It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. "We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said. "If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October. But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.
Canadian PM Impressed With African Development Plan - 2002-04-05
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien says he is impressed with the progress being made towards implementing an African development plan.
Mr. Chretien made the remarks Sunday after meeting with South African President Thabo Mbeki and other regional leaders in Pretoria.
Mr. Chretien, the current chairman of the group of the seven most industrialized nations plus Russia, is visiting Africa to discuss the New Partnership for Africa's Development, known as NEPAD.
He said NEPAD will be one of the top agendas at the June G-8 summit in Kananaskis, Canada.
The G-8 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and Russia.
Mr. Chretien says topics such as human rights, democracy the rule of law, transparency and good governance will be discussed at the G8 summit.
NEPAD outlines objectives of promoting democracy and good governance in Africa in return for Western economic assistance. It seeks to achieve an annual growth rate of seven-percent on the African continent by 2015.
South African President Mbeki said he is convinced that Africa is ready for NEPAD saying there has been definite progress toward democracy in the continent.
Later, Mr. Chretien and Mr. Mbeki were joined by presidents Festus Mogae of Botswana, Bakili Muluzu of Malawi, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Benjamin Makapa of Tanzania and Vice President Enoch Kavindele of Zambia.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who won re-election in disputed voting last month, was not invited.
Reuters news agency reports the Canadian prime minister who has already visited Morocco, Algeria and Nigeria on his six-nation tour will visit Ethiopia and Senegal after South Africa.

Child Labor in Malawi - 2002-02-28
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.
It says these children risk being abused.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre. They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas. He says, "Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization.
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.
" Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates.
He said, "We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates.
There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. "
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country. These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
"If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child," he said, "you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education.
So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. "
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs. "We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child.
At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. "
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.
Over 60 per cent of Malawis nearly 11 million people live below the poverty line.
Malawi Court Convicts 12 People in Albino Attack
A high court in Malawi has convicted five people of murder for the 2018 killing of a 22-year-old albino man, including the victims brother.
The court convicted seven other people of selling the victim's body parts.
Malawi officials say more than 170 albinos have been attacked in the country since 2014 by people who believe their body parts bring luck and wealth.
Family members of the deceased, MacDonald Masambuka, left the courtroom Thursday with hopes of justice being served after the court convicted all 12 people accused in his death. F
amily members, including Masambukas mother, appeared calm and composed as Judge Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga read the judgments.
Those convicted included a Catholic priest, Father Thomas Muhosa, police officer Chikondi Chileka, clinician Lumbani Kamanga, and the deceaseds brother, Cassim Masambuka. Charges included murder, extracting human tissues, causing harm to a person with disability, and trafficking in persons.
Kamanga convicted the victims brother and four others of murder.
The court convicted seven other people, including the priest and police officer, of selling the victim's body parts.
Business with tissue According to the court, Muhosha, Chileka and others offered to conduct business using human tissue extracted from a human corpse.
The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.
She said Masambuka is the latest victim of violent attacks on persons with albinism who have not been protected by the community.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case. He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.
"Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust — that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him," Kayuni said.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.
Enticement Court documents show that Masambuka was enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found a girl for him to marry.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him. Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.
"We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients," Chamkakala said.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.
Serious sentencing'
Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.
"When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case," Simbota said.
The high court is expected to sentence the perpetrators on May 30.
In another case, a high court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old man to life in prison for the 2020 murder of a 14-year-old-boy with albinism in Phalombe district.
Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.
Though "everybody's got the right to demonstrate," there have "been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence," Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview. Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government. They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start. Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court. Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police. Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols. The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.
"Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. There's really nothing that we see coming out of it," James said. "But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy: "We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums."
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption. Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine. With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who had predicted 3.1% growth for 2019, offered a sobering update to Zimbabwe's parliament in early August. "The revised 2019 GDP growth is expected to be negative," Reuters news service reported him as saying.
Ncube did not provide any updated figure.
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people.
"They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people."
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.
Afraid, insecure'
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning. Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.
"I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least," she told VOA.
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday. She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.
Perfectly valid'
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal. But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.
"I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do," he said. "However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression. Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.
Worrying trend'
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.
"This means the continuation of a limited civic space. Because this has happened since 2016. There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space. And it is targeted to people like civil society organizations, the media, hindering the freedom of speech, the freedom of association."
Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns. A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court. Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.
Zimbabweans Claim Police Brutality During Economic Protests
Zimbabweans defied a police ban Friday and held demonstrations to protest the country's deteriorating economy.
Despite the High Court ban on planned protests, members of the Movement for Democratic Change took to the streets and clashed with police. Some of the injured accused police of derailing protests, which they said were meant to persuade President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to breathe life into Zimbabwe's moribund economy.
With tears on her cheeks, 32-year-old Tafadzwa Bvuta said her degree had not helped her get anything for her three children.
"They beat us up," she said of the police. "What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person. Where will we go and survive? Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"
Make Nyashanu, 27, said he would continue protesting because he is miserable about being unemployed.
He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators — even elderly ones and people not protesting. "Is this democracy?" he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos.
The opposition said it will hold another protest Monday in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, and will go to other cities and places until the government addresses the economy.
Government response
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa called the protests counterproductive, saying January's demonstrations against fuel price increases resulted in $20 million to $30 million in losses for businesses from looting and non-productive days.
"Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner," she said. "I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation."
Daniel Molokhele, the spokesman for the opposition, said his party was against Mnangagwa leading talks and accused him of stealing Zimbabwe's last election in 2018. He said the protests would continue until Zimbabwe's economy gets back on track.
UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare. The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.
"We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe. While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans," Colville said.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care. Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear. But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.
"There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders. We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago," Colville said. "So, it is clearly a very tense situation."
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.
"The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products," Cudjoe told VOA.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude. The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa. In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight. At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday. The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.
"Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food," said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."
"There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world."
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries.
"African governments must find a way of responding," he said. 'It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.
"Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities] like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine," Kanyama said.
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.
He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – "is trying to offer some debt relief."
"Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis," Kanyama added.

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic.
Zimbabwes government says it is launching a "national vaccination blitz" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year. The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant.
"We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible. We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally. The situation might change. So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination," Balde said.
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month.
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind.
"Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date. The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so," Ndlovu said.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.
Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns. He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing.
"After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up. But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us. The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up. What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers. There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures," Chimbetete said.
Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance. It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity.
Finland Crowned World's Happiest Nation for Fifth Year
Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year running, in an annual U.N.-sponsored index that again ranked Afghanistan as the unhappiest, followed closely by Lebanon.
Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania recorded the biggest boosts in wellbeing. The largest falls in the World Happiness table, released on Friday, came in Lebanon, Venezuela and Afghanistan.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August. U.N. agency UNICEF estimates one million children under five could die of hunger this winter if not aided.
"This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims," co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data.
It assigns a happiness score on a scale of zero to 10, based on an average of data over a three-year period. This latest edition was completed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch. The United States rose three places to 16th, one ahead of Britain, while France climbed to 20th, its highest ranking yet.
As well as a personal sense of wellbeing, based on Gallup polls in each country, the happiness score takes account of GDP, social support, personal freedom and levels of corruption.
This year the authors also used data from social media to compare people's emotions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. They found "strong increases in anxiety and sadness" in 18 countries but a fall in feelings of anger.
"The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing," report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote.
"World leaders should take heed."
The report raised some eyebrows when it first placed Finland at the top of its listings in 2018.
Many of the Nordic country's 5.5 million people describe themselves as taciturn and prone to melancholy, and admit to eyeing public displays of joyfulness with suspicion.
But the country of vast forests and lakes is also known for its well-functioning public services, ubiquitous saunas, widespread trust in authority and low levels of crime and inequality.
Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.
Kathleen Mpofu — one of Moyo's lawyers — said the journalist will go on trial April 28.
"The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding," Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.
"It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense."
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.
"We just want to see that there's law and order. If somebody has committed a crime or is perceived, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system. That's our position," Mangwana said.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.
"MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial. That is our position throughout till the end of the case. All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial," Moyo said.
Moyo, a Zimbabwean national, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
Zimbabwe Police Block Main Opposition Rallies
Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018. The police says the rally ban in Mavhunga, about 80 kilometers east of Harare, is meant to ensure peace and stability.
Police camped overnight Friday at a venue in Marondera, where the leader of Zimbabwes main opposition, the Citizens Coalition for Change, Nelson Chamisa, was supposed to address his supporters Saturday. The 44-year-old candidate later came to disperse the crowd waiting for him.
"We are a party of peace, a party of the rule of law," he said.
Chamisa said his party does not want to fight with people. He said the government denied permission to hold a rally, so the party asked for permission to come and tell about that. He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death. Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.
In an interview Sunday, Fadzayi Mahere, the Citizens Coalition for Change spokeswoman said her party was not happy with the bias of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and the police in favor of the ruling ZANU-PF.
"Our rally in Marondera was purportedly banned and yet ZANU-PF was car rally and other unsanctioned in the very same area," she said. "Not once have they sought authorization or given notice to the police, yet these unlawful prohibitions are meted out against us. Ours is a struggle of non-violent resistance. However, the thousands that came out just to hear president Chamisa speak shows beyond any doubt that the citizens are prepared to do whatever it takes to reclaim their dignity. We continue to urge supporters to register to vote in their masses so that we attain our target in 2023: A landslide victory."
Zimbabwe police Sunday refused to comment on the ban of the Citizens Coalition for Change in Marondera. It issued a letter to the opposition saying it needed time to prepare to ensure there was peace at the rally. Two weeks ago, violence instigated by suspected ruling ZANU-PF supporters at a Citizens Coalition for Change rally resulted in two deaths and dozens injured.
Alexander Rusero, a former senior politics lecturer at Harare Polytechnic college, says police and political parties must thwart violence at opposition rallies.
Police have arrested 16 suspected ZANU-PF supporters who are accused of causing the violence and who now face murder charges in connection with the deaths at the opposition rally.
Zimbabwes pre-election season has been marred by violence that has claimed lives and left thousands injured since 2000 after a strong opposition party emerged.
A Zimbabwe Court Dismisses Suspension of Striking Teachers
Zimbabwe's High Court has voided the government's three-month suspension of striking teachers, ruling the ministry of education overstepped its authority. The teachers went on strike last week over poor salaries just as schools were set to reopen after a long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts say children's education has been caught in the crossfire.
Zimbabwes High Court has ruled the suspension of striking teachers by Evelyn Ndlovu, Zimbabwes minister of primary and secondary education, was illegal.
Noble Chinhanu of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum represented the teachers in court.
"We managed to present our arguments before the court and the judge has given us an order to the effect that the press statement that was issued by the minister of primary and secondary education is illegal and unconstitutional," said Chinhanu. "We managed to prove that our client has a right not to be suspended in such a manner which was in violation of public service regulations of the nation."
Government officials have not commented on the court ruling.
Schools in Zimbabwe closed last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and had been due to reopen last week.
Gibson Nyikadzino, an independent political analyst, says the government and teachers must settle the strike quickly because students continue to be the losers.
"We are seeing a lot of agitation and politicization of this from the employees," said Nyikadzino. "They are not keen to listen to what the employer is saying. Their parties that are being affected as a result of this, so what has to be done is go to the tripartite negotiating forum and in the spirit find a consensus."
The tripartite he refers to is the government, the workers and private companies.
Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association – the countrys largest teachers union – says educators want to return to work, but need more pay to sustain themselves.
"There are some members who are unable to travel: those who are far distant schools. They are finding it difficult because of the resources," said Ndlovu. "And there are some who are saying while we are within the school environs, we still find it difficult to find food for subsistence. That is what is mitigating against 100 percent attendance. We hope that after pay day (next week Tuesday) things will get back to normal. But that does not mean that the teachers are happy with the remuneration that they are getting. They still want some more."
Taungana Ndoro, is the spokesman for Zimbabwes ministry of primary and secondary education and says the situation in schools now is "encouraging."
"We have gone round in government and non-government schools, and we are quite impressed by the teaching and learning that is going on," Ndoro said. "Of course there are a few schools here and there which still face a bit of challenges."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying civil servants in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teacher wages to about $100 a month. The teachers want the $540 a month they were getting in 2018.
Last week the teachers rejected the governments offer of a 20 percent pay raise along with some incentives, such as housing loans.
Zimbabwe Government Orders Vaccinated Workers Back to Work
Zimbabwes government has ordered civil servants who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to immediately report for duty after more than a year of working from home, citing a declining in new cases of the virus in the country.
Authorities also announced any government workers without proof of vaccination will be barred from workplaces and face punishments, including a freeze on their salaries.
In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person. Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.
"This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off. …In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to," she said.
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.
"A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.
"It is something that we are strongly against. We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.
"Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.
Zimbabwe Teachers, Calling Pay Insufficient, Refuse to Teach
Many Zimbabwean schools that closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic remain shuttered as teachers refuse to return to the classroom, citing a need for better pay.
No media source currently available
The teachers are paid less than $100 a month. The government has offered a 20 percent pay increase and other incentives, but the teachers have rejected that offer as insufficient.
Meanwhile, some youths are studying independently. One such student, a 16-year-old, said, "My appeal [to the government] is for a salary increment for teachers so that they come to work, because we arent learning. Its like we are paying fees for nothing. Its so painful as my parents are struggling for it when I am not learning at all."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teachers' wages.
Obert Masaraure, president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, said the instructors want their old salaries restored and that the offer of a 20 percent raise amounted to almost nothing.
"We asked for the restoration of salaries, which were robbed from us by the government of the day," Masaraure said. "And the message to the government is clear: We need our pre-October 2018 salaries of 540 dollars U.S. We know these shenanigans of adding an extra dollar to our salaries — that does not add up."
Government officials see the ongoing talks in a different light and voice optimism about a successful resolution.
Paul Mavima, Zimbabwe's minister of public service, labor and social welfare, said, "In many ways we already have a breakthrough. The leaders of the workers have to a very large extent welcomed this package and they are only saying: Lets discuss how it is going to be implemented."
The teachers and government are expected to meet in coming days to resume negotiations. Meanwhile, students wait to resume their studies months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced their schools to close.
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" — an entity with no known legal status.
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.
"Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank.
"The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk," he added.
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP.
"Every state has the right to defend its business assets," he added.
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow.
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee.
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said.
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.
No questions asked
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.
"Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions," he added.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions."
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said.
"They didn't have what it took to succeed," she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.
"If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed," Doxsee said.
"If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."
