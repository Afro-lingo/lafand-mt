In Tanzania, Hope Rises for a Better Journalism Climate 	Chiyembekezo cha kuti atolnkhani azigwira bwino ntchito yawo chikula ku Tanzania
Tanzanias president has called for a review of the East African countrys media laws and regulations, saying she wants to ensure measures "to protect journalists and open more space for freedom of expression and the media." 	Pulezidenti wa dziko la Tanzania wati malamulo ndi malangizo a ofalitsa nkhani a m'maiko a ku m'mawa kwa Afrika awunikidwenso kuti pakhale njira zotetezera ufulu wa olemba zochitika komanso kupereka ufulu woyankhula ndi wofalitsa nkhani.
Samia Suluhu Hassan delivered her remarks on Tuesday, World Press Freedom Day, at a gathering of journalists, government officials and others in Arusha, in northern Tanzania, according to The East African newspaper. 	Nyuzi pepala ya ku m'mawa kwa Africa yati a Samia Suluhu Hassan anena izi lachiwiri, patsiku lokumbukila ufulu wa atola nkhani pa dziko lonse ku msonkhano wa atolankhani, akulu akulu a boma ndi ena womwe unachitikira ku Arusha, kumpoto kwa dziko la Tanzania. 
Maxence Melo Mubyazi, an award-winning journalist in Tanzania, said he takes this as an encouraging sign after "lots of arrests, lots of attacks on the press" in recent years. 	Maxence Melo Mubyazi, yemwe anawina mphoto ya olemba nkhani ku Tanzania wati ichi ndi chilimbikitso pamene "atolankhani akhala akumangidwa ndi kuukiridwa" zaka zamm'buyozi.
"We welcome this kind of political will from the president to review the current draconian laws in the country," said the founding editor of the online discussion platform Jamii Forums, who has himself endured arrests and jail time. 	 "Talirandira ganizo la boma lofuna kuwunikanso malamulo opondereza m'dziko muno," yemwe anakhazikitsa malo a zokambirana pa intaneti otchedwa Jamii Forums, yemwenso anamangidwapo ndi kukakhala ku ndende, ananeza izi.
He told VOA Wednesday he hoped this would ensure "that at least we have frameworks in place and we dont go by the presidential decree." Melo was alluding to Hassans predecessor, John Magufuli, president from 2015 until his death in March 2021 at age 61. 	Iwo anawuza VOA lachitatu kuti ali ndi chiyembekezo kuti pakhala kuonetsetsa kuti "tili ndi ndondomeko zathu osati kutsatira malamulo a pulezidenti." A Melo amatanthauza a John Magufuli, omwe anali pulezidenti a Hassan asanakhale pa mpando kuchoka m'chaka cha 2015 kufikira nthawi yomwe anamwalira mu March 2021 ali ndi zaka 61 
During Magafulis tenure, journalists were often arrested for critical coverage of government and political dissent was discouraged. Tanzanias ranking in Reporters Without Borders annual press freedom index plummeted from 71st to 124th over five years beginning in 2016. 	Mu nthawi ya ulamuliro wa a Magufuli, olemba nkhani amamangidwa kamba kolemba nkhani zotsutsa boma. Kuchoka m'chaka cha 2016, dziko la Tanzania linachoka pa nambala 71 kufika pa nambala 124 mu zaka zisanu kuchoka mu 2016 pa ndandanda wa ufulu wa atola nkhani padziko lonse, Reporters Without Boarders.
Reporters Without Borders noted in its latest report that Magufuli "had become increasingly authoritarian and hostile" toward media and that Hassans rise to power has "brought initial hopeful signs that have yet to come to fruition." 	Lipoti lomwe Peporters Without Boarders latulutsa lapeza kuti a Magufuli "amachita ulamuliro wankhanza" kwa ofalista nkhani pomwe ulamuliro wa a Hassan wabweretsa chiyembekezo choti zinthu zikhoza kusintha. 
In February, Hassans administration lifted bans on four media outlets: Mseto, Mawio, Mwanahalisi and Tanzania Daima. They had been shuttered for offenses related to their coverage of alleged corruption, according to Amnesty International. 	Amnesty International yapeza kuti m'mwezi wa February, boma la a Hassan linachotsa chiletso ku malo anayi owulutsira nkhani omwe ndi: Msetso, Mawio, Mwanahalisi ndi Tanzania Daima. Malowa anatsekedwa kamba ka milandu yokhudzana ndi kuulutsa nkhani za katangale.
And Hassan has instructed the Ministry of Information, Communication and Information Technology to work with media stakeholders and others on reviewing laws and possibly loosening restrictions. 	A Hassan alangiza unduna wa zofalitsa nkhani, mauthenga, ndi mauthenga a pa kompyuta kuti agwire ntchito limodzi ndi wofalitsa nkhani ndi ena powunikanso malamulo ndi kuchotsa ziletso. 
Melo is among those being asked to weigh in on what he calls "draconian" measures such as the 2015 Cybercrimes Act and 2016 Media Services Act. 	A Melo ndi m'modzi mwa omwe akufunsidwa kuti afananitse zina mwa ndondomeko zopondeleza monga milandu ya pa intaneti, 2015 Cybercrimes Act ndi 2016 Media Services Act.
"Ive been part of the team that has been reviewing the laws," said Melo, who had previously felt their bite. He was convicted in April 2020 of obstructing police investigations, and paid a fine of 3 million Tanzanian shillings, or $1,300, rather than face a year behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 	"Ndinakhalapo gawo la gulu lowunika malamulo" anatero a Melo omwe anakumanapo ndi zotsatira zake. Iwo anamangidwa mu April m'chaka cha 2020 pa mlandu wosokoneza kafukufuku wa apolisi ndipo analipira chindapusa cha ndalama zokwana 3 miliyoni Tanzanian Shilings yomwe ili 1,300 US dollars m'malo mokakhala kundende kwa chaka chimodzi. Izi zatsimikidwa ndi komiti yoteteza wolemba nkhani ya Committee to Protect Journalists.
CPJ, which honored Melo with its 2019 International Press Freedom Award, noted that the "charge stemmed from Melos alleged refusal to disclose the identities of whistleblowers on the Jamii Forums platform. 	CPJ, yomwe inapereka mphatso ya pa tsiku lombukira ufulu wa atola nkhani padziko lonse m'chaka cha 2019 kwa a Melo yati a Melo anamangidwa kamba kokana kuulura mayina a anthu omwe amawatsina khutu pa tsamba la pa intaneti la Jamii Forums. 
Melo told VOA that Jamii Forums, founded as a for-profit business, now is a nongovernmental organization. "We are focusing on good governance, accountability and democracy," he said. 	A Melo awuza VOA kuti tsamba la pa intaneti la Jamii Forums lomwe cholinga chake poyamba chinali kuchitirapo malonda, tsopano lakhala bungwe loyima palokha. Iwo anati, "chidwi chathu chili pa ulamuliro wabwino, kukhulupirika komanso ufulu."
Since Hassan took office, Melo said, "people on the cyberspace can now at least criticize the government or critically analyze whatever kind of statement that comes from any political figure. … At the moment, journalists are now writing stories that could not be written in the past six years." 	Kuchokera nthawi yomwe a Hassan analowa m'boma, a Melo ati, "tsopano anthu akhoza kuyankhula zotsutsana ndi boma komanso kutsutsa zomwe zanenedwa ndi akulu akulu ena a ndale pa intaneti. Tsopano wolemba nkhani akhoza kulemba nkhani zomwe sizikanalembedwa mu zaka zisanu ndi chimodzi zapitazo."
When it comes to news media, "indeed, the environment is slowly opening up," agreed Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher. Based in Nairobi, he monitors Tanzania and Uganda. 	Kukambapo za wofalitsa nkhani, wofufuza za Amnesty International, a Roland Ebole ati, "inde mpata ukupezeka pang'onopang'ono." Iwo amakhala ku Nairobi komwe amayang'anira Tanzania ndi Uganda.
Amnesty praised Tanzanias lifting of the newspaper ban in February but also said the government "must do more to guarantee media freedom going forward." 	Amnesty yayamikira dziko la Tanzania pochotsa chiletso cha nyuzipepala m'mwezi wa February komanso yawuza boma kuti "likuyenera kuchita zambiri potsimikizira kuti ufulu wa wofalitsa nkhani ukupita patsogolo."
A free press, Ebole told VOA, "would mean Tanzanians looking into the future with most hope in terms of expressing themselves and getting information – and information that would benefit them in all aspects of their lives, whether its economic, social and cultural." 	Mtolankhani oyima payekha, a Ebole awuza VOA kuti, "ufulu wa atola nkhani ukutanthauza kuti nzika za ku Tanzania ziziyang'ana tsogolo lawo ndi chiyembekezo choyankhula za kukhosi kwawo ndi kupeza mauthenga omwe angawapindulire m'mbali zonse za moyo wawo kuphatikizapo zachuma, maubale ndi chikhalidwe."
"We are somehow optimistic," Melo said of journalists and rights activists. But, he cautioned, "the laws are still there, really draconian laws. If they are not amended, they can be used by anyone who is against us." 	"Mwa njira ine ndife osakayika" anatero a Melo ponena za wolemba nkhani ndi womenyera ufulu. Koma iwo achenjeza kuti, "malamulo omwe alipo ndi opondereza omwe aja. Ngati sakonzedwa, malamulowa akhoza kugwiritsidwa ntchito ndi aliyense yemwe akufuna kuukira."
Separately, a Tanzanian government spokesman told VOA that measures could be loosened - to a point.	Mneneri wa boma la Tanzania wauza VOA mwapadera kuti ndondomekozi zitha kuchepetsedwako mphamvu.
"You cannot have a profession without rules to govern, like a tire moving without any control," spokesman Greyson Msigwa said in a recent interview. "We must reach a place that we all agree that we need to protect the interests of media and the people as well." 	"Palibe ntchito yopanda malamulo ake, zili ngati teyala longoyenda popanda oliyendetsa," anatero mneneri Greyson Msigwa. "Tonse tigwirizane kuti tikuyenera kuteteza zofuna za wofalitsa nkhani ndi anthu."

Islamic extremist rebels have killed at least seven people in an attack in northeast Borno state in Nigeria, witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 	Asilamu owukira otsutsa apha anthu osaposera asanu ndi awiri pa ziwawa za ku mpoto kwa Borno state ku Nigeria, omwe anaona izi awuza atola nkhani a The Associated Press lachitatu.
The rebels attacked Kautukari village in the Chibok area of Borno on Tuesday evening, said residents. The attack happened at the same time that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the state to meet with survivors of jihadi violence. 	Anthu owukirawa anaononga mudzi wa Kautukari lachiwiri madzulo, anthu okhala m'dera la Chibok ku Borno anatero.

The Chibok area is 115 kilometers (71 miles) away from Maiduguri, the state capital, where Guterres met with former militants being reintegrated into society and thousands of people displaced by the insurgency. 	Dera la Chibok ndilotalikirana ndi Maiduguri, lomwe ndi likulu la mzindawu, ndi ma kilomita 115, komwe Guterres amakumna ndi zigawenga zakale pamene amabwezeretsedwa mmudzi pamodzi ndi anthu mazana mazana omwe anathamangitsidwa ndi zigawenga.
"They came in large number with superior firepower (and) took over the community," said Hassan Chibok, a community leader. Troops from a nearby military base were deployed to repel the attack but "the damage had been done," Chibok said, adding that "casualties are up to 10." 	"Anabwera anthu ochuluka ndi zida zankhondo ndikulanda mudzi," anatero Hassan Chibok, mfumu ya mudziwu. Asilikari omwe anatumizidwa kuti akakhazikitse bata anapeza "zinthu zitawonongeka kale".

Nigerian police did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the attack. 	Apolisi a ku Nigeria anachedwa kuyankha pempo lotsimikiza kuti zachiwembuzi zinachitikadi.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 206 million people, continues to grapple with a 10-year-old insurgency in the northeast by Islamic extremist rebels of Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province. The extremists are fighting to establish Shariah law and to stop Western education.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier this week that the war against the extremists is "approaching its conclusion," citing continued military airstrikes and the mass defection of thousands of the fighters, some of whom analysts say are laying down their arms because of infighting within the jihadi group. 	Kumayambiliro kwa sabata lino, pulezidenti wa ku Nigeria, a Muhammadu Buhari ati nkhondo yolimbana ndi magulu owukira ikupita kumapeto kamba ka chiwerengero chochuluka cha anthu owukira a gulu la jihadi omwe ayamba kumenyana okhaokha
The violence, however, continues in border communities and areas closer to the Lake Chad region, the stronghold of the Islamic State-linked group, ISWAP. 	Ziwawazi zikupitilira kukhudza madera ndi midzi yomwe ili kufupi ndi nyanja ya Chad, komwe ndi kuchimake kwa glu la Islamic State-linked, ISWAP.
"Things are getting worse" in Kautukari village in Chibok and adjourning areas closer to the forest, said community leader Chibok, saying the extremists' presence near the forest is a contributing factor. 	"Zinthu sizili bwino" m'mudzi wa Kautukari ku Chibok ndi madera oyandikana ndi nkhalango. Oyang'anira dera la Chibok ati kupezeka kwa magulu a ziwawa kufupi ndi nkhalango ndi komwe kukuchititsa izi.

"Last month, we registered four articles removed from newspapers," she said. 	"Mwezi watha nkhani zinayi zinachotsedwa mu nyuzipepala," iwo anatero.
Between January and March alone, security personnel removed dozens of articles from the Juba Monitor, Anna Namiriano, editor-in-chief of an English-language daily, told South Sudan in Focus. "They removed stories and we left the space blank. They say why we are not listening to them, so on 17th of March, they suspended the newspaper."

Ndikunena kuti motengera ndi malamulo chifukwa palibe chinthu chopanda vuto padziko pano." Anatero a Makuei kuwuza South Sudan Focus.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights refutes that assertion. In a report issued last October, it said the government is harassing activists, journalists and their families, limiting their activities and targeting their work and finances. South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, according to the commission. 	Bungwe la United Nations Commission on Human Rights latsutsa zomwe ananena a Makuei.

"We have seen some of the local radio stations shut down over very trivial matters," Renz said. "And we also are aware that journalists of radio and television and even social media are self-censored" and wary of local and national governments actions "to penalize journalists who say things the government would prefer that they not say." 	"Taonapo ena mwa ma wayilesi akutsekedwa pa nkhani zazing'ono, " anatero a Renz.

M'dindo wa ku Burundi watsimikiza izi.
The official, who requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to media, told VOA Somali that 10 soldiers died on the spot, and the rest of the soldiers succumbed to their wounds. He confirmed that other soldiers are still missing.

Al-Shabab said it killed 173 soldiers in the attack on the AU base in the village of El-Baraf, about 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu. The casualty figure has not been independently verified. A separate source told VOA Somali that 161 soldiers were at the camp at the time of attack. The Burundian official confirmed that number.

It's been a year since Bernard Njenga learned his wife, Esther Thuku, had died in Saudi Arabia, where she had been a domestic worker for three years. 	Padutsa chaka kuchokera nthawi yomwe a Bernard Njenga anadziwa kuti akazi awo a Esther Thuku, anamwalira ku Saudi Arabia komwe amagwira ntchito ya m'nyumba kwa zaka zitatu.
Saudi authorities reported that his wife had committed suicide at her employer's home, Njenga said, but he believes the mother of four was murdered. 	Akuluakulu a ku Saudi ati mkazi wawo anachita kudzipha kunyumba yomwe amagwirako ntchito, anatero a Njenga, koma iwo akukhulupilira kuti mkazi wawo yemwe anali ndi ana anayi anachita kuphedwa.
Njenga said his wife's body did not have any marks that would show that she had hanged herself.

A Njenga ati thupi la mkazi wawo linalibe chizindikilo chilichonse chosonyeza kuti anachita kudzimangilira. Iwo anaonjezera kuti thupi la malemuyu limaoneka kuti linayikidwa m'manda chifukwa linali lakuda komanso linabayidwa kumanzere.

Saudi authorities have reported that all 23 of those deaths resulted from cardiac arrest. 	Akuluakulu a ku Saudi Arabia ati imfa zonse 23, zinadza kamba ka matenda a mtima otchedwa cardiac arrest.
In April of 2020, rights advocacy group Amnesty International reported that Kenyans who have jobs as domestic workers in the Middle East often complain of lack of payment, forced labor, physical abuse, rape and dangerous working conditions. 	M'mwezi wa April 2020, gulu lomenyera ufulu la Amnesty International linapeza kuti anthu a ku Kenya omwe amagwira ntchito za m'nyumba ku mayiko a aluya amadandaula za kusapatsidwa malipiro awo, kugwiritsidwa ntchito mokakamiza, kumenyedwa, kugwiliridwa komanso kugwira ntchito m'malo owopsa. 
Now, Kenya is offering safety training for domestic workers who take jobs abroad. 	Tsopano dziko la Kenya likuphunzitsa za chitetezo kwa onse omwe amakagwira ntchito za m'nyumba kunja kwa dzikolo.
"When you don't train them, basically, you are exposing them to a lot of exploitation and abuse," said Edith Murogo, director at East Africa Institute of Homecare Management in Nairobi. "Part of the training also includes labor rights awareness. They have to know how to bargain and talk to employees about decent terms and conditions of employment." 	"Mukapanda kuwaphunzitsa, ndiye kuti mukuwayika pa chiopsezo chochitiridwa nkhanza," anatero a Edith Murogo, mkulu wa East Africa Institute of Homecare ku Nairobi. "Gawo lina la maphunzirowa ndi kudziwa ufulu wa ogwira ntchito. Akuyenera kudziwa kuyankhula bwino ndi ogwira ntchito za zoyenera kuchita pa ntchito yawo."
An estimated 30,000 Kenyans migrate to the Middle East to find work each year. 	Pafupifupi anthu 30,000 a ku Kenya amasamukira ku mayiko a aluya kukafuna ntchito chaka chilichonse.
Kenya's cabinet secretary for labor, Simon Chelugui, said his department is working with Saudi officials on labor law reforms. 	Mlembi woyan'ganira ogwira ntchito ku Kenya, a Simon Chelugui, ati ofesi yawo ikugwira ntchito ndi adindo a ku Saudi kuti asinthe malamulo a ogwira ntchito.
"We would want them also to upscale their law to protect workers and employers equally, not to discriminate and have the attitude of the employer is right always," Chelugui said. "Number two is the pay is reasonable and commensurate to the work." 	"Timafuna kuti malamulowa akhwimitsidwe kuti aziteteza olemba komanso olembedwa ntchito, osati kusalana kapena kukhala ndi maganizo oti olemba ntchito samalakwitsa," anatero a Chelugui. "Chachiwiri, malipiro azikhala omvelera komanso ogwirizana ndi ntchito."
VOA reached out to the Saudi embassy in Nairobi for comment on alleged mistreatment and deaths of Kenyan workers. In an email response, the embassy said the kingdom does not condone illegal and ill treatment of anyone and said Riyadh is working with Nairobi to protect citizens from any offense. 	VOA inafikira nyumba ya kazembe ya ku Saudi ku Nairobi kuti ayankhulepo pa za nkhanza komanso imfa za ogwira ntchito a ku Kenya. Nkuyankha kwawo pa email, iwo anati, ufumu wawo sumalora kuchitira nkhanza wina aliyense ndipo mzinda wa Riyadh ukugwira ntchito ndi mzinda wa Nairobi kuti ateteze nzika zawo ku milandu.
Meanwhile, officials say with an estimated 2 million young people graduating each year, according to national figures, and only about 800,000 new jobs, many Kenyans will continue to go abroad to find work.

South Africa Urges Africa’s First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open 	South Africa yapempha kuti kukhazikitsa kwa katemera woyamba wa COVID-19 wa mu Africa kupitilire.
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open. This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine. 	Adindo a zaumoyo ku South Africa apempha okonza katemera wa COVID-19, Aspen, kuti apitilize kutsegula malo awo mu dera la Eastern Cape. Izi zadza potengera nkhani yomwe a Reuters analemba kuti mkulu wa Aspen anali ndi ganizo lotseka malowa chifukwa choti katemera watsopanoyu samagulidwa. 
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa. 	Nthambi yowona za mankhwala ya ku South Africa, ya Aspen, inagwirizana ndi kampani ya ku America ya Johnson & Johnson m'mwezi wa March kuti azilongedza, kuyika mitengo, kugulitsa komanso kugawa katemerayu mu Africa.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax. 	Katemerayu anakonzedwanso ndi kukhala Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply. 	Ganizoli linalandiridwa ndi anthu ambiri chifukwa panali madando oti Africa imadalira kuyitanitsa katemerayu kuchoka kunja zomwe zinali zokwera mtengo komanso katemerayu amakhala wosakwanira.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax. South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally. 	Koma palibe yemwe akugula katemera wa Aspenovax. M'neneri wa National Health Department ku South Africa, a Foster Mohale, ati izi zachitika kamba ka kuchepa kwa anthu obayitsa katemerayu m'dzikomo komanso pa dziko lonse.
"Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low. So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them," he said. 	"Kuzengereza kubayitsa katemerayu ndi chimodzi mwa zifukwa zomwe zikuchepetsa chiwerengero cha anthu obayitsa kapena kufuna katemera wochuluka zomwe zimakhudza kapangidwe. Chifukwa mwachidziwikire ife tikuwamvetsa kuti akuchita malonda choncho sangamakonze katemera wochuluka pamene akudziwa kuti omufuna ndi ochepa. Kotero ife tikuwamvetsa ndipo tili okhudzika," iwo anatero.
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines. He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired. And more are due to expire in June and July. 	A Mohale ati  pakali pano dziko la South Africa lili ndi katemera wokwanira. Iwo awonjezera kuti, m'mwezi wa March, katemera 100,000 anaonongeka ndipo wina wochuluka akuyembekezeka kuwonongeka m'mwezi wa June ndi July.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds. 	Komabe, iwo ati kukhazikitsidwa kwa katemera wa Aspen ndi kofunika popeza palibe yemwe amadziwa zobwera m'tsogolo.
"We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days," he said. 	"Tiyesetsa kuwapempha kuti asapitilire ndi ganizoli chifukwa tikuyembekezera wodziwa sayansi ndi owona za kufala kwa matenda kuti mwina nyengo yachisanu ya COVID-19 ikhoza kufika ku South Africa pamene nyengo ya dzinja ikufika m'ma sabata akubwerawa. Monga mmene mukuwonera, chiwerengero cha anthu odwala COVID-19 chakhala chikukwera mmasiku asanu ndi awiri apitawo," iwo anatero.
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry. 	Pulofesa Petro Terblanche, mkulu wa kampani ya ku South Africa yotchedwa Afrigen, yomwe inali yoyamba kukonza katemera wa COVID wotchedwa mRNA kugwiritsa ntchito Modernas data, wati zomwe zachitika ku Aspen ndi zodzetsa chiwopsezo pa malonda awo.
"This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies. How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity? Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security," said Terblanche. 	"Izi zikusonyeza kufunika kosintha malamulo mu Africa. Izi ndi zokhudzana ndi mmene tingaperekere mwayi kwa makampani ang'onoang'ono kuti tipange misika komanso njira yabwino yoti anthu azipezera katemerayu mosavuta. Tikapanda kutero, tidzavutika mliriwu ukadzabweranso," iwo anatero.
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines. 	Iwo akukhulupilira kuti ndalama zikuyenera kugwiritsidwa ntchito pophunzitsa anthu za ubwino wa kayemerayu.
"We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated. We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic," she said. 	"Tikuyenera kuwonetsetsa kuti tikuyesetsa kulimbikitsa ubwino wa katemerayu chifukwa pakali pano, anthu 17 pa 100 ali wonse ndi amene anabayitsa katemerayu mu Africa. Nambalayi ikuyenera kukula kufika pa anthu 40 pa 100 ali wonse kuti tithane ndi mliriwu," iwo anatero.
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives. 	A Mohale anakanika kunena tsiku lomwe ofesi ya zaumoyo idzakumane ndi akuluakulu a Aspens.
	
	
Journalists in Ethiopia Say Press Freedom is at 'Crossroads' 	Wolemba nkhani ku Ethiopia ati ufulu wa atola nkhani uli pa mpanipani.
When Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office four years ago, Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based group that promotes press freedom, raised Ethiopia's ranking in its international press freedom index by 40 places. 	Pamene pulezidenti wa ku Ethiopia, a Abiy Ahmed, anakhala pampando zaka zinayi zapitazo, gulu la atolankhani la ku Paris lotchedwa Reporters Without Boarders, lomwe limamenyera ufulu wa atolankhani, linakwanitsa kukweza dziko la Ethiopia mu ndandanda wa ufulu wa atolankhani pa dziko lonse ndi malo 40.
It was a giant leap forward after decades of media repression by the state. But since the war between federal government forces and rebels in the Tigray region began in late 2020, Ethiopia has dropped in the rankings. 	Uku kunali kusintha kwakukulu patadutsa zaka zambiri pamene boma limachitira nkhanza wofalitsa nkhani. Koma kuchokera nthawi imene asilikari a boma anayamba kumenyana ndi owukira m'chigawo cha Tigray kumapeto kwa chaka cha 2020, Ethiopia inatsikanso pa ndandandawu.
To mark World Press Freedom Day 2022, VOA spoke to Ethiopian journalists about how free they feel to carry out their work. 	Pa tsiku lokumbukira ufulu wa atolankhani pa dziko lonse, VOA inayankhula ndi ena mwa wolemba nkhani ku Ethiopia ngati amagwira ntchito yawo mwa ufulu.
Elias Meseret, who worked with the Associated Press, told VOA that press freedom in Ethiopia is at a crossroads. 	A Elias Meseret, omwe anagwirapo ntchito ndi Associated Press, awuza VOA kuti ufulu wa atolankhani ku Ethiopia uli pa mpanipani.
"Overall, I can say that lack of professionalism and also extreme views have become the hallmarks of the state of the media in Ethiopia, at this point in time," Elias said. "For this to change, I think the government has a responsibility to let media professionals do their job freely. This means without any harassment and intimidation." 	"Pakali pano tikhoza kunena kuti, kusowekera luso logwilira ntchito komanso kaperekedwe ka maganizo ndi zizindikiro zosonyeza nyengo yomwe wofalitsa nkhani ali ku Ethiopia," anatero a Elias. "Kuti zinthu zisinthe, boma lili ndi udindo wopereka mpata kwa wofalitsa nkhani kuti azigwira ntchito yawo mwaufulu, opanda kuwasokoneza kapena kuwaopseza."
Assegid Mulugeta, a radio presenter for the government-owned broadcaster, the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, or EBC, thinks press freedom has improved in recent years. In 2018, the prime minister released all journalists from prison, However, that progress has since been reversed according to Ethiopian journalists, who documented that 46 journalists were detained in the country in 2021, making Ethiopia one of the worst jailers of journalists in Africa. 	Assegid Mulugeta, wogwira ntchito yowulutsa mawu ku nyumba yowulutsira mawu ya boma yotchedwa Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, EBC, akuganiza kuti pali kusintha makamaka pa ufulu wa atolankhani mu zaka zapitazi.

Bungwe la boma lowona za ma ufulu la Ethiopian Human Rights Commission latulutsa lipoti losonyeza kukhudzidwa ndi wolemba nkhani wina wotchedwa Gobeze Sisay, yemwe sakudziwika komwe ali kuchokera lamulungu pomwe anamangidwa ndi apolisi osavala yunifomu.
Another journalist, Amir Aman Kiyaro, and his colleague Thomas Engida were arrested in November and released in March. But they still may face years in prison if convicted of violating the country's wartime state of emergency law and anti-terrorism law. 	Wolemba nkhani wina, Amir Aman Kiyaro ndi mnzake Thomas Engida anamangidwa m'mwezi wa November ndipo anatulutsidwa mu March.

Still, radio presenter Assegid said he sees improvement. 	Ngakhale izi zili chomwechi, wogwira ntchito yowulutsa mawu pa wayilesi, a Assegid akuti akuona kusintha.
Under the pre-2018 government where the Tigray People's Liberation Front political party dominated, he said, there were "lots of stifling systems, there was lots of censorship, there was beating of journalists, there was lots of pressures and censorship against journalists and now we are seeing the booming of YouTube and online media … this is a good thing to hear." 	Lisanalowe boma latsopano mu 2018, munthawi yomwe chipani cha Tigray People's Liberation Front chimalamula, wolemba nkhani amazunzidwa, kuchitidwa upandu, kumenyedwa komanso kuletsedwa kulemba nkhani zina. Tsopano tikuona wofalitsa nkhani ambiri pa masamba a mchezo komanso  pa YouTube zomwe zili zabwino kuzimva," iwo anatero.
Sisay Sahlu, editor at The Reporter, a private newspaper based in Addis Ababa, said independent media often get stonewalled by the government. 	A Sisay Sahlu, wokonza nkhani ku nyuzipepala yoyima payokha ya The Reporter ku Addis Ababa, ati nyuzipepala zoyima pazokhazi sizimathandizidwa ndi boma maka pankhani ya mauthenga.
"My experience and the experience of my friends from public media is totally different," he said. "As a private newspaper employee, it's tough to get information for me." 	"Kagwiridwe kanga ka ntchito ndi kosiyana ndi anzathu ogwira ntchito m'boma. Ngati wogwira ntchito ku nyuzipepala yoyima payokha, ndikovuta kuti ndipeze uthenga woyenera," iwo anatero.
Sisay said that for a simple story, he might call 10 officials, who all may be unwilling to answer his questions. 	A Sisay ati ngakhale pa nkhani zazing'ono, amatha kuyimbira lamya adindo khumi omwe samafuna kuyankha mafunso awo.
"When you call them, they don't give us any clue," he said. "We write a letter to them, they are not talking. Finally, when we publish [the story], they are coming to our office. Sometimes they are on the phone and start a verbal fight. Either they are giving us information or not." 	"Tikawayimbira lamya, samanena kalikonse. Iwo anatero. "Tikawalembera kalata, samayankha. Pamapeto pake tikasindikiza nkhaniyo ndi pamene amabwera ku ma ofesi athu. Nthawi zina amalalata pa lamya, ngakhale akutipatsa uthenga kapena ayi."

As Tigray Aid Blockade Continues, Nearby Areas Also in Desperate Need of Food, Medicine 	Pamene Tigray yasiya kuthandizidwa, madera ena ozungulira akusowanso chakudya ndi mankhwala.
Despite Ethiopias declared humanitarian cease-fire with Tigrayan rebels, aid groups said they are struggling to get food and medicine to those in need. Even outside the worst affected areas in Tigray, which are off limits to reporters, providing aid is fraught with risks and challenges. 	Ngakhale dziko la Ethiopia linalengeza kuti gulu lowukira la ku Tigray lithetse ziwawa, magulu othandiza ati akuvutika kupeza chakudya ndi mankhwala zothandizira omwe akuvutika.

In Ethiopias northern Amhara region, burned tanks and other ruined military equipment lie at the roadside four months after occupying forces of the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front, or TPLF, left the area. As the region recovers from a brutal civil war, the U.N. said some 9.4 million people in the Amhara region and neighboring Afar and Tigray regions need humanitarian assistance. But aid has been slow to arrive. 	Kumpoto kwa dziko la Ethiopia, ku Amhara, akasinja omwe anawotchedwa komanso zida zina za nkhondo zomwe zinawonongedwa, zakhala zili m'bali mwa nsewu kwa miyezi inayi tsopano, chichokereni gulu la chipani cha Tigray People's Liberation Front, TPLF.

Seventeen-year-old Ahmed Nuru was living in the Oromia region, but said he had to flee after facing persecution for his Amhara ethnicity. He lost his mother when he was young. Last year, his father died after being unable to get lifesaving treatment due to the wars impact on the local health care system. 	Mnyamata wa zaka 17, Ahmedu Nuru, yemwe amakhala ku Oramia wati anathawa chifukwa cha nkhanza zomwe amakumana nazo kamba kokhala wa mtundu wa chi Amhara. Mayi ake anamwalira ali wachichepere .

Tens of thousands live in camps for the displaced in the Amhara region. Others live in host communities, like Tsgenet Tibebu, who lost her husband during the conflict with the TPLF. 	Anthu mazana makumi makumi akukhala ku malo osungirako anthu othawa kwawo m'chigawo cha Amhara. Anthu ena, akukhala m'midzi ina, monga a Tsgenet Tibebu, omwe mwamuna wawo anamwalira pamene amatsutsana ndi TPLF.
Tibebu said she and her son rely on what her husbands friends provide as charity, which includes a room to stay in. As tears begin to flow, she said she is a housewife who has nothing and is waiting for support to help her raise her two children. She believes she should pay rent even though the owners have given her a place to stay. She wonders how she can plan for the future when she has nothing. 	Tibebu wati iye ndi mwana wake akudalira thandizo lomwe anzawo a mwamuna wake amawapatsa kuphatikizapo chipinda chokhala. Misonzi ikutsika, iwo anati ndi mayi wapakhomo yemwe alibe kalikonse ndipo akudikira thandizo kuti athe kulera ana ake awiri. Iwo atinso akukhulupilira kuti akuyenera kulipira lendi ngakhale anapatsidwa malo okhala. Iwo sakudziwa kuti akonzekera bwanji tsogolo lawo pamene alibe kalikonse.
Mulugeta Kebede, an aid worker who works in the Hayk camp, spoke to VOA and said stories like Nurus and Tibebus are not uncommon across Amhara. 	Muguleta Kedebe, wogwira ntchito yothandiza anthu ku malo omwe anthu othawa kwawo amakhala ku Hayk, anayankhula ndi VOA kuti nkhani ngati za Nuru ndi Tibebu zimachitikachitika.
He said the situation makes aid workers cry day and night. He said if someone is hungry, they cant sleep because they think about their empty stomach. He said he has seen displaced people sell pans or mattresses to surved and added that the situation is at a critical stage. 	Iwo ati izi zimaliritsa ogwira ntchito yopereka chithandizo usana ndi usiku. Ngati wina ali ndi njala, iwo sangagone chifukwa amangoganizira njala yake. Kamba ka mavutowa, iwo awonapo anthu ena othawa kwawo akugulitsa miphika ndi matilesi kuti athe kudzithandiza. Zinthu sizili bwino.
About 30,000 people displaced by conflict live just north of Hayk, in Weldiya. A local government representative, Habtemariam Assefa, North Wollo Zone spokesperson, said there was a little support shortly after TPLF left, after the area had been a conflict zone for months. But, he said, aid has been distributed only twice since and the aid provided by the U.N. or the federal government is not enough. 	Pafupifupi anthu 30,000 omwe anathawa kwawo kamba ka kusamvanaku, akukhala ku mpoto kwa Hayk ku Weldiya. 
North of the Amhara region, in Tigray where journalists are banned from entering, the U.N. said the situation is worse, with famine-like conditions. Tigray is under a de facto humanitarian blockade, according to the U.N. 	U.N yati zinthu sizili bwino pamene kumpoto kwa chigawo cha Amhara ku Tigray, komwe wolemba nkhani sakuloledwa kufika, kuli njala. U.N yati Tigray siikulandila thandizo lililonse.
For now, all Ahmed Nuru and his sisters can do is try to scrape by and hope more assistance arrives soon. 	Pakali pano, chomwe Ahmed ndi azichemwali ake angachite ndi kudikira komanso kukhala ndi chiyembekez kuti thandizo lifika posachedwa.
	
	
State Group Investigates Video Allegedly Showing Abuse by Ethiopian Army 	Gulu la aboma likufufuza kanema amene akuonetsa nkhanza zomwe asilikari a ku Ethopia amachita.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission is investigating a video shared online that appears to show government troops abusing and shooting an ethnic Tigrayan boy. 	Bungwe loona za ma ufulu la Ethopian Human Rights Commission likufufuza kanema amene akupezeka pa intaneti woonetsa gulu la nkhondo la boma likuzunza komanso kuwombera mnyamata wa mtundu chi Tigray.
The four-minute video shows an alleged ethnic Tigray teenager being surrounded by men in Ethiopian army uniforms. The forces are seen abusing the boy, who they refer to as being from Abbi Adi, a location in the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia. 	Kanemayu yemwe ndi wa mphindi zinayi akuwonetsa anthu ovala yunifomu ya asilikari a ku Ethiopia atazungulira mnyamata wa mtundu wa chi Tigray. Asilikaliwa amazunza mnyamatayu akumutchula kuti Abbi Adi, omwe ndi malo a kumpoto kwa chigawo cha Tigray ku Ethiopia.
In response to a query from VOA, the state-run Human Rights Commission said it was "gathering information regarding the incident." 	Poyankha mafunso omwe VOA inafunsa, bungwe la boma la Human Rights Commission lati likusonkhanitsa uthenga pa zomwe zinachitikazi.
In the video, the boy, with blood on his face, is seen sitting while the men in uniform surround him and threaten him with death. One of the men in uniforms calls for the boy to suffer rather than being killed immediately. 	Mu kanemayu, mnyamatayu yemwe ali ndi magazi kunkhope yake, akuoneka atakhala pansi, asilikari atamuzungulira ndikumamuopseza kuti amupha. M'modzi wa asilikariwa anapereka ganizo loti ayambe kaye azunza mnyamatu, asanamuphe.
They tell a teenage girl to forcefully feed the boy. Finally, one man steps forward and shoots the boy, and the video ends. 	Iwo anawuza mtsikana kuti amukakamize kudya mnyamatayu. Kanemayu akuthera pamene munthu m'modzi anabwera ndikuwombela myamatayu.
VOA cannot independently verify the location of the incident or the identities of the individuals in the footage. Asked about the video, both the Ethiopian government communication minister and Ethiopian ministry of defense spokesperson declined to comment. 	VOA payokha siingathe kudziwa malo omwe izi zimachitika ngakhale mayina a anthu omwe awoneka mu kanemayu. Atafunsidwa za kanemayu, nduna yoona za mauthenga ku Ethiopia ndi m'neneri wa unduna wa chitetezo anakana kuyankhulapo pa nkhaniyi.
A similar incident was reported by rights groups in January 2021 in which Ethiopian army members were seen executing a number of civilians in Mahibere Dego, in central Tigray. 	Magulu a ufulu mu January, 2021 anatulutsa lipoti lofanana ndi zomwe zachitikazi pamene asilikali  ku Ethiopia anapha anthu a ku Mahibere Dego, m'chigawo cha pakati cha Tigray.
Rights group Amnesty International has verified the killing of 11 civilians in that incident. 	Gulu lomenyera ufulu la Amnesty International latsimikiza za kuphedwa kwa anthu khumi ndi m'modzi pa zomwe zinachitikazi.
Forces from the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front also have been accused of committing human rights violations. In February 2022, Amnesty International reported that TPLF forces and their affiliates have killed more than a dozen people and gang raped women in towns of the Amhara region they occupied. 	Asilikari owukira a chipani cha Tigray Peoples Liberation Front ndi omwe akunenedwa kuti anaphwanya ufulu wa anthu. M'mwezi wa February 2022, Amnesty International inatulutsa lipoti loti asilikari a TPLF ndi othandizana nawo, anapha anthu oposera khumi ndi awiri komanso kugwililira azimayi m'ma tawuni a m'chigawo cha Amhara komwe amakhala. 
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission recently reported that more than 740 civilians were killed in the Tigray war between July 2021 and March 2022. 	Bungwe loona za maufulu la Ethopian Human Rights Commission lapereka lipoti lotsimikiza kuti kuchokera July 2021 kufika March 2022, anthu 740 anaphedwa mu nkhondo ya ku Tigray.
Both the government and the TPLF deny accusations of rights violations, saying their operations do not target civilians. 	Boma ndi chipani cha TPLF akana zoti anaphwanya maufulu ponena kuti zochita zawo sizimakhudza anthu wamba.
	
	
Disinformation, Censorship, Trigger Global Retreat of Press Freedom 	Kufalitsa nkhani zabodza ndi kulamulira wofalitsa nkhani kubwezeretsa m'mbuyo ufulu wa atola nkhani pa dziko lonse.
Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and propaganda is having a disastrous effect on independent news around the world, a new report finds. 	Lipoti latsopano lapeza kuti kutengera chitsanzo cha ku Kremlin, kukula kwa kufala kwa nkhani zabodza komanso kuyipitsirana mbiri kukuwononga nyuzi zoyima pazokha pa dziko lonse.
In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda. 	Mu ndandanda wa 2022 wa ufulu wa atolankhani pa dziko lonse womwe unatulutsidwa lachiwiri, atolankhani a ku Paris otchedwa Reporters Without Boarders (RSF) ati nkhondo ya pakati pa Russia ndi Ukraine ndiyomwe kukupititsa patsogolo kufala kwa nkhani zabodza komanso kuyipitsirana mbiri.
The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level. 	Gulu loyang'anira wolemba nkhani lati izi ndi zodandaulitsa chifukwa zikuwonetsa kugawanika kwa atolankhani m'maiko komanso pakati pa mayiko.
"In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new," said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA. He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism. 	"M'chaka cha 2022, sitingatsutse kuti kugawanikana pakati pa wofalitsa nkhani komanso chisokonezo pa mauthenga ndi zomwe zikusokoneza maubale mu njia zatsopano," a ClaytonWeimers , wachiwiri kwa mkulu wa RSF ku United States anawuza VOA. Iwo anati kuchuluka kwa nkhani zokomera mbali imodzi padziko lonse kwabisa utolankhani weniweni.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism. This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions. 	Lipoti la pachaka la gululi lili ndi ndandanda wa mayiko 180 kutengera ndi mmene wolemba nkhani amagwilira ntchito. Chaka chino, RSF yati yagwiritsa ntchito njira yatsopano yomwe ikuphatikiza kayendetsedwe ka ndale, malamulo, chuma, maubale komanso chitetezo cha dziko lililonse
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom." That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine. 	Ndandandayu wapeza kuti mayiko 28 samapereka ufulu kwa wofalitsa nkhani. Dziko la China ndi limodzi mwa mayiko omwe ali m'gululi pamene likulamula wolemba nkhani ngakhale a m'mayiko ena komanso kupitiliza kuyipitsa mbiri ya ku Kremlin pa nkhondo ya ku Russia ndi Ukraine.
Russia, China among worst 	Russia ndi China ali pakati pa mayiko oyipitsitsa
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war." 	Kuchokera 24 February pomwe dziko la Russia linalowa mu dziko la Ukraine mwa upandu, dziko la Russia likulamula nkhani zoyenera kulembedwa pobweretsa lamulo loti wolemba nkhani zabodza zokhudza asilikari akakhala kundende kwa zaka khumi ndi zisanu. Dziko la Russia likukananso kutchula kusagwirizanaku kuti ndi nkhondo.
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating. 	Izi zachititsa kuti nyumba zowulutsa mawu komanso nyuzipepala zoyima pazokha kuphatikizapo nyuzipepala yotchuka ya Novaya Gazeta, wayileis ya Ekho Moskvy ndi kanema wa Dozhd zitseke ma ofesi awo kapena kusamuka ku Russia kuti akapitilire kugwira ntchito yawo.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion. 	Popanda nyumba zowulutsa mawu zoyima pazokha, dziko la Russia likufalitsa nkhani zosokoneza makamaka pa upandu wa ku Kremlin kudzera m'ma wayilesi oyendetsedwa ndi boma.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least. 	Kuzunzidwa kwa wofalitsa nkhani kwapangitsa kuti dziko la Russia likhale pa nambala 155 pa mayiko 180 omwe ali pa ndandanda wa RSF. Pa nambala yoyamba pali dziko lomwe limapereka ufulu wonse kwa atola nkhani pamene pa nambala 180 pali dziko lomwe silipereka ufulu wonse.
"It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia," Clayton said. 	"Pakali panopa tikhoza kunena kuti ufulu wa atolankhani ku Russia ndi mbiri yakale," anatero a Clayton.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said. 	Mu ulamuliro wa zaka 22 wa pulezidenti wa ku Russia, Vladimir Putin, Moscow yakhala ikulimbana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso atola nkhani omwe si a boma.
"But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia," Clayton said. "At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine." 	"Kuchokera pomwe dziko la Russia linalowa m'dziko la Ukraine mwa upandu, zikuwonetsa kuti a Putin athana ndi nyumba zonse zowulutsa mawu zoyima pazokha ku Russia," anatero a Clayton. "Panopa ndi zosatheka kutulutsa lipoti lolondola lokhudza nkhondo ya ku Ukraine."
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites. 	Dziko la China lili pa nambala 175 mu lipoti latsopano. Kutengera zomwe zikuchitika ku Beijing, Hong Kong nayo yatsika pa ndandandawu kufika pa nambala 148 mwa 180 kutsatira ziwawa zomwe zakhala zikuchitika kwa nthawi yaitali komanso kumangidwa kwa anthu zomwe zachititsa kuti malo atsopano ogwirizana ndi ulamuliro wa demokalase atsekedwe.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention. The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive." 	RSF, mu lipoti la sabata iliyonse yati, pa mayiko onse, dziko la China ndi lomwe limapititsa atolankhani ambiri kundende. Pakali pano atolankhani 120 ali kundende. Ulamulirowu umagwiritsa ntchito mphamvu, nkhanza, kuopseza komanso kuwonetsetsa kuti atolankhani omwe si a boma komanso a kunja sakulemba nkhani zokhudzana ndi zomwe zikuchitika.
"President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime," RSF's country file states. 	Pulezidenti Xi Jinping, yemwe wakhala pampando kuchoka m'chaka cha 2013, wabwezeretsa ulamuliro wakale wa mu nthawi ya Maoist pamene kupeza nkhani ndi mlandu ndipo kupereka uthenga ndi mlandu wawukulu, lipoti la sabata la RSF latero.
Rising authoritarianism 	Kukula kwa ulamuliro wankhanza.
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress. 	Dziko la North Korea ndi lomwe lili pamapeto pa nambala 180. Mbali ina ya chigawo cha Asia-Pacific, chisokonezo pankhani zandale, kusamvana komanso kukula kwa ulamuliro wa chipani chimodzi ndi zomwe zikubwezeretsa chitukuko m'mbuyo.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile. Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists. 	Kulanda boma mwaupandu komwe kunachitika ku Myanmar mu 2021 kwawonetsa kuti kwa zaka khumi tsopano ufulu wa wofalitsa nkhani unabwerera m'mbuyo pamene atolankhani ena anamangidwa, wofalitsa nkhani kuletsedwa kugwiritsa ntchito ziphaso zawo komanso nyumba zowulutsila mawu zina zinathawa m'dzikomo. Pansi pa ulamuliro wa asilikari a jinta, Myanmar ili pa nambala 176 ndipo ndi limodzi mwa omwe amapititsa atolankhani ambiri kundende.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021. Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence." Afghanistan ranked 154th. 	Zigawenga za Taliban ku Afghanistan zinalonjeza kuti zikadzatenga boma mu August 2021, ufulu wa atolankhani udzalemekezedwa. Koma RSF yati kutenga boma kwa Taliban kwawonjezera mavuto a atolankhani komanso mabungwe a wofalitsa nkhani omwe akuchitidwa chipongwe ndi upandu. Dziko la Afghanistani lili pa nambala 154.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information. 	Mu Africa, malamulo otsegulira mulandu utolankhani wa pa intaneti akutsekereza ufulu wopeza uthenga mu Africa, inatero RSF, pamene kufala kwa mphekesera, nkhani zabodza ndi kuyipitsirana mbiri kukuchititsa kuti kupeza uthenga woyenera kuzivuta.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index. Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively. 	Nkhondo ya m'chigawo cha Tigray ku Ethiopia komanso kutsekereza mapezedwe a mauthenga ndi komwe kwapangitsa kuti dzikoli likhale pa nambala 114 pa ndandanda. Mayiko oyandikana nawo a Eritrea ndi Djibouti alinso kumapeto pa ndandandawu pomwe ali pa nambala 179 ndi 164.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis. 	Wofalitsa nkhani a mu Africa akupitilira kukumana ndi mavuto a zachuma, inatero RSF potsatira kafukufuku wawo.
"Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks," the group said. 	"Ngakhale panali ufulu mu zaka za mma 1990, pali nkhani zomwe zikuchitika zokhudza kulamulila wofalitsa nkhani, makamaka pa intaneti pamene kawirikawiri netiweki zikutsekedwa m'mayiko ena, atolankhani akumangidwa komanso kuchitidwa upandu," linatero gululi.
Clayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself. 	A Clayton ati palibe chomwe chikuyambitsa ulamuliro wankhanza.
"When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect," he said. "It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same." 	"Tikamapanda kupereka chilango kwa akuluakulu omwe amalimbana ndi atolankhani powachita nkhanza, kuwamanga, kuwamenya m'misewu komanso kuwapha zotsatira zake ndi zoti akuluakuluwa azichita izi mobwereza-bwereza ndipo alimbikitsa akuluakulu ena kuchita chimodzimodzi," iwo anatero.
US not perfect 	US nayo ili ndi mavuto ake
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index. That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings. 	Patapita nthawi pamene pulezidenti wakale, a Donald Trump, anati wofalitsa nkhani amafalitsa nkhani zabodza, dziko la United States likafika pa nambala 42 mu ndandanda wa RSF. Izi zachitika kamba ka misonkhano ya atolankhani yomwe imachitika-chitika yofotokoza zochitika  ku White House ndi nthambi za boma.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others." 	Koma RSF yati mavuto alipobe monga nyuzipepala zina kuasiya kugwira ntchito, kugawanika kwa wofalitsa nkhani komanso intaneti kutenga malo a utolankhani pamene udani ndi kuzunzidwa kwa atolankani zikupitilira.
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests. 	Zotchinga zimadza panthawi yofuna kufalitsa uthenga wa zochitika ku boma komanso zionetsero.
"We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them. An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event," said Beth Francesco, senior director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute. 	"Timapeza kuti izi zimachitika chifukwa chosasamala kapena kutanthauzira molakwika malamulo obweretsa poyera misonkhano. Munthu akhoza kusamvetsa kuti atolankhani akuyenera kupezeka pa zochitika zina," a Beth Francesco, mkulu wa National Press Club Journalism Institute ndiwo ananeza izi. 
A few bright spots 	Pali chiyembekezo.
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives. 	Ngakhale pali kubwelera m'mbuyo, a Clayton ati pali chiyembekezo.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence. 	Ma boma ena amapereka thandizo la chuma kwa wofalitsa nkhani opanda kulowelera kagwiridwe ka ntchito yawo kuti wofalitsa nkhaniwa akhale oyima pawokha, osaphatikiza ntchito yawo ndi ndale.
"If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media," he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media." 	"Mukayang'ana pa ndandanda wathu mupeza kuti mayiko omwe amathanziza wofalitsa nkhani pa chuma ndi omwe ali patsogolo," iwo anatinso, "ndikofunika kukhala ndi thumba lothandiza wofalitsa nkhani oyima pawokha komanso a boma."
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index. Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th. 	Mayiko atatu a mtundu wa chi German - Norway, Denmark ndi Sweden - ndi omwe akutsogolera ndandanda wa RSF. Dziko la Estonia lomwe linali mu Soviet Union ndi lomwe lili pa nambala yachinayi.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90. 	RSF yati kuchita utolankhani mwaufulu kumatenga gawo lalikulu poyambitsa ulamuliro wa demokalase monga dziko la East Timo lomwe lili pa nambala 17, dziko la Bhutan panambala 33 ndi dziko la Mongolia pa nambala 90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places. But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021." 	East Timor ndi limodzi mwa mayiko omwe anakwera pa ndandandawu ndi malo 54. RSF yachenjeza kuti kamba ka kusintha mmachitidwe a zinthu, ndi pofunika kusamala pofananitsa ndandanda wa 2022 ndi wa 2021.
	
	
UN’s Guterres Meets with Nigerian Leaders After Visiting Volatile Borno State  	Mlembi wa UN akumana ndi atsogoleri a ku Nigeria atayendera ku Borno State komwe kunachitika za upandu.
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres met with Nigerian leaders Wednesday at the end of a two-day visit to Nigeria and three-nation trip to Africa. On Tuesday, he visited internally displaced people (IDPs) in northeast Nigeria and called for them to be safely returned to their homes. Nigerian authorities plan to close all IDP camps in the next few years despite security concerns.  Antonio Guterres arrived the United Nations house in Abuja around 9 a.m. Wednesday and met with U.N. local coordinators before holding talks with Nigerian womens representatives. 	Mlembi wa U.N a Antonio Guterres anakumana ndi atsogoleri a ku Nigeria lachitatu pamene anali paulendo woyendera dziko la Nigeria kwa masiku awiri komanso mayiko atatu a mu Africa. Lachiwiri, mlembiyu anayendera anthu omwe anathawa kwawo, Internally Displaced People (IDPs,) ndipo wapempha kuti anthuwa abwelere kwawo alibwino. Akuluakulu a ku Nigeria ali ndi chikonzero chofuna kutseka malo onse omwe anthu othawa kwawo amakhala ngakhale kuti izi zikhoza kuyika miyoyo yawo pachiopsezo. Antonio Guterres anafika kunyumba ya United Nations ku Abuja lachitatu nthawi ya 9 koloko m'mawa ndipo anayamba kukumana ndi oyang'anira UN asanayankhule ndi nthumwi ya azimayi ku Nigeria.
The delegates, led by Nigeria's minister for womens affairs, Pauline Kedem Tallen, discussed gender equality and the inclusion of women in politics with the U.N. secretary-general. 	Mnthumwizi motsogozedwa ndi nduna yowona za azimayi a Pauline Kedem Tallen, anakambirana ndi mlembi wa U.N za kusasiyanitsa pakati pa amayi ndi abambo komanso ubwino wophatikiza azimayi pandale.
"His coming to Nigeria today has given us hope, because we know that he will lend his voice to all the issues affecting women, gender-based violence, early marriage, lack of implementation of some of our laws," said Tallen. 	"Kubwera kwawo kwatipatsa chiyembekezo chifukwa tikudziwa kuti atiyankhulira pa nkhani zokhudza azimayi monga nkhanza zochitira amayi, kukwatiwa nsanga komanso kusagwiritsa ntchito malamulo ena," anatero a Tallen.
Guterres afterwards met with Nigeria's religious leaders and later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the U.N. house to remember the 23 people killed during the 2011 bombing of the building. 	A Guterres anakumananso ndi atsogoleri a mipingo ku Nigeria komanso anakhala nawo pa mwambo woyika nkhata ku nyumba ya U.N pokumbukita anthu 23 omwe anafa bomba litaphulitsidwa pa nyumbayi.
He began his three-nation Africa visit Sunday in Senegal as part of his Ramadan solidarity tour, and later went to Niger. 	Iwo anayamba ulendo wawo woyendera mayiko atatu a mu Africa lamulungu ndipo anayambira kupita ku Senegal ngati gawo la mwambo wa Ramadan kenako anapita ku Niger.
On Tuesday, he visited northeastern Borno state and met with the state governor as well as IDPs and families impacted by the Boko Haram conflict. 	Lachiwiri, iwo anayendera kumadzulo kwa chigawo cha kumpoto ku Borno State komwe anakumana ndi ma gavanala, IDPs komanso maanja onse omwe anakhudzidwa ndi ziwawa za Boko Haram.
Guterres also visited repentant Boko Haram fighters and praised authorities' reintegration program for more than 1,000 former fighters. 	A Guterres anayenderanso anthu omwe anatuluka m'gulu la Boko Haram ndipo ayamikira akuluakulu a pologalamu yobwezeretsa anthuwa chifukwa cha anthu oposera 1000 omwe anatuluka m'gulili.
He also commended authorities efforts to resettle displaced people back to their communities and called for more support to rebuild the region.  "The Borno that I found today is the Borno of hope, the Borno with future and I was very impressed to see the policy that is being deployed here, recognizing that you don't fight terrorism just by military means, you fight terrorism addressing the root causes of terrorism," he said. "The people that I met today in the IDP camps want to go back home in safety and dignity. The way to address terrorism effectively is to provide not only hope but a future of reality." 	Iwo ayamikiranso akuluakulu kamba koyesetsa kubwezeretsa anthu omwe anathawa kwawo ndipo apempha thandizo kuti amangenso mzindawu. "Borno yemwe ndampeza lero ndi wodzala ndi chiyembekezo komanso ali ndi tsogolo. Ndasangalala ndi malamulo omwe akugwiritsidwa ntchito pozindikira kuti sitimathana ndi ziwawa pochita nkhondo koma pothana ndi chomwe chimayambitsa ziwawazo," iwo antero. "Anthu omwe ndakumana nawo lero ku malo osungirako anthu othawa kwawo akufuna kubwerera kwawo mwaulemu komanso alibwino. Njira imodzi yofuna kuthana ndi ziwawa si kupereka chiyembekezo chokha komatsogolo lenileni."
Nigerian authorities have been closing IDP camps since late last year and want to close all camps by 2026. More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009. 	Akuluakulu a ku Nigeria akhala akutseka malo osungirako anthu othawa kwawo kuyambira ku mapeto a chaka chatha ndipo akufuna kuti pofika m'chaka cha 2026 malo onsewa adzakhale atatsekedwa. Anthu oposa 2 miliyoni anathawa kwawo kuchoka m'chaka cha 2009 pomwe ziwawa za Boko Haram zinayamba.
But aid groups have been warning some communities may still be attacked. 	Magulu osamalira anthu achenjeza kuti madera ena akhonza kuchitidwabe chiwembu.
"There are multiple solutions when it comes to resettlement. We need to get people stabilized," said Adenike Oladosu, a climate justice activist, met with the U.N. secretary-general.

Al-Shabab Raids African Union Military Base 	Al-Shabab iwukira maziko a asilikali a African Union.

"The Federal Government of Somalia condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack targeting the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia forward operating base in Elbaraf, Middle Shabelle," the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its official Facebook page. 	"Boma la ku Somalia likudzudzula mtchitidwe woyipa wolimbana ndi asilikari a African Union Transition Mission ku Somalia omwe akukhala ku Elbaraf, pakati pa Shabelle," unduna woona zakunja ku Somalia unanena izi pa tsamba lawo la mchezo la Facebook.
"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of this terrorist attack and their families." 	"Tikupepesa onse omwe akhudzidwa ndi ziwawazi komanso mabanja awo."
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs. He said the militants then fought their way onto the base. 	Mfumu ya mzinda wa El-Baraf, a Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, ati zigawengazi zinayamba upanduwu pophulitsa mabomba awiri kenako kupita komwe kunali asilikari.
Al-Shabab claimed the killing of 173 African Union forces. The group also claimed responsibility for capturing AU forces as prisoners-of-war. Both claims could not be independently verified. AU force headquarters and Somali military officials could not be immediately reached for comment. 	Al-Shabab yati inapha asilikari 173 a African Union. Gululi lavomerezanso kuti ndilo linagwira asilikari a AU kuti akhale akaidi awo owathandizira kumenya nkhondo, koma izi sizinatsimikizidwe.

In an interview with VOA, Muhumed, who was not at the village at the time of the attack, said he was told there were "many deaths" among Burundian forces but could not give an exact figure. 	Poyankhula ndi VOA, a Muhumed ati iwo sanali m'mudzimu pamene ziwawazi zimachitika. Iwo ati, "inali nkondo yoopsa."
"Fighting like this never happened in this area," he said. "It was heavy fighting." 	"Sitinaonepo nkhondo ngati imeneyi," iwo anatero. "Inali nkhondo yayikulu."
He said two civilians were also killed and more than 10 others injured. 	Iwo anati anthu awiri anaphedwa ndipo ena oposera khumi anavulazidwa.
Muhumed confirmed to VOA that al-Shabab militants withdrew from the base. He also reported airstrikes targeting the militants as they left the base but did not say who was responsible for the strikes. 	A Muhumed atsimikizira VOA kuti zigawenga za Al-Shabab zinachokadi kumalowa. Iwo anenanso kuti panthawi yomwe zigawengazi zimachoka pamalopa, panali ndege zomwe zimawalondola koma sanatchule mwini wa ndegezo.
El-Baraf, approximately 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu, is one of the forward operating bases of African Union forces from Burundi. 	El-Baraf, yomwe ili pafupifupi makilomita 150 kumpoto kwa Mogadishu, ndi limodzi la madera omwe asilikari a African Union ochokera ku Burundi amakhalako.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month. 	Aka kanali koyamba kuti Al-Shabab ichite zaupandu kwa asilikari a AU kuchokera nthawi yomwe AU inasintha dzina komanso magwiridwe ake a ntchito mwezi watha.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), gives it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity-building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to Somalia.

India’s Muslims Mark Eid al-Fitr Amid Community Violence 	Asilamu a ku India achita chikondwelero cha Eid al-Fitr nthawi ya ziwawa.
Muslims across India marked Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday by offering prayers outside mosques, even as the celebrations this year came in the backdrop of a series of recent attacks against the community during the month of Ramadan. 	Asilamu m'dziko la India amakondwelera Eid al-Fitr lachiwiri pochita mapemphero panja pa mizikiti yawo ngakhalekuti chikondwerelo cha chaka chino chinali ndi zovuta zake kutsatira zachiwembu zomwe zinachitika m'derali m'mwezi wa Ramadan. 
"We will not have the same kind of festivity" this time, said Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, a civil engineer in Indias financial capital, Mumbai. "This is the most painful Eid with worst memories for Indian Muslims." 	"Sitidzakhalanso ndi chikondwelero cha mtundu wotere," a Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, omwe amagwira ntchito yoyang'anira mamangwidwe a zinthu ku Mumbai ndiwo ananena izi. "Eid imeneyi ndiyowawa chifukwa ikukumbutsa asilamu a ku India zomwe zinachitika."
Anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks have surged across the country in the last month, including stone throwing between Hindu and Muslim groups during religious processions and subsequent demolitions of a number of properties mostly belonging to Muslims by authorities. 	Kudana ndi asilamu komanso ziwembu zakhala zikuchitika m'dzikoli mwezi watha kuphatikizapo kugendana miyala pakati pa anthu a mtundu wa chi Hindu ndi magulu a asilamu mapemphero ali nkati komanso akuluakulu kugwetsa nyumba za asilamu
The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance. Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it. Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions. 	Anthu 14 pa 100 aliwonse mu chiwerengero cha anthu 1.4 billion a ku India amachokera m'derali. Anthu a mtundu wa chi Hindu akhala akuyipitsa mbiri ya derali kamba koti amadana ndi asilamu. Atsogoleri a chipani cholamula cha Bharatiya Janata, chomwe ndi cha anthu a mtundu wa chi Hindu, akuthandizira nawo ziwawazi mwakachetechete pamene pulezidenti Narendra Modi sanayankhulepo kanthu pankhaniyi. Pokondwerela Eid al-Fitr, pamakhala mapemphero, maphwando komanso zovala zatsopano koma mu zaka ziwiri zapitazi, mwambowu wakhala ukusokonekera kamba ka ziletso za COVID-19 ku India.
In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic. The region also saw a rise in violence during Ramadan, with at least 20 militants, two civilians and five police and soldiers killed. 	Mwambo wa asilamu ku India wa Kashmir wakhala usakuchitika kwa zaka zitatu zapitazo kamba ka ziletso zomwe zinabwera pofuna kupewa mliri wa COVID-19. Ziwawa zambiri zinachitika panthawi ya Ramadan pomwe zigawenga makumi awiri, anthu awiri, apolisi asanu komanso asilikari anaphedwa.
"As we prepare to celebrate Eid, a strong sense of collective loss jars at us," said Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Srinagar. 	"Pamene tikukonzekera kusangalala mwambo wa Eid, tikumakhala ndi chikumbumtima cha imfa," anatero a Bashir Ahmed wochita malonda ku Srinagar.
Kashmir is the Muslim-majority disputed region where a violent insurgency against Indian rule and New Delhis brutal crackdown has raged for over three decades. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict. 	Kashmir ndi chigawo chomwe chili ndi asilamu ochuluka, komwenso kwakhala kuli ziwawa zowukira ulamuliro wa ku India, komanso kuchitiridwa nkhanza kwa mzinda wa New Delhi kwa zaka zoposa makumi atatu.
Meanwhile in the capital, New Delhi, hundreds assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of Indias largest mosques, while offering Eid prayers there for the first time in over two years due to pandemic restrictions. Families came together early on Tuesday morning while many people shared hugs and wishes. 	Izi zili chomwechi, anthu mazana mazana anasonkhana ku umodzi mwa mizikiti yayikulu ku India, ku Jama ku New Delhi, kuchita mapemphero a Eid koyamba mu zaka ziwiri kamba ka ziletso za mliri wa COVID-19.

Beijing Residents Brace for COVID-19 Lockdown 	Anthu okhala ku Beijing akonzekera m'bidikiro wa COVID-19.

Mr. Zhang, a Beijing resident, said he had bought extra food and water, even though he doesn't think Beijing will be locked down like Shanghai. He asked that VOA not use his full name because he was afraid of attracting official attention. 	Bambo Zhang omwe amakhala ku Beijing ati anaguliratu zakudya ndi madzi zoonjezera ngakhale sakuganiza kuti akhoza kuletsedwa kuyenda ngati ku Shanghai. Iwo anapempha VOA kuti isagwiritse ntchito dzina lawo lonse kuopa adindo a m'dzikoli.
"I have six bags of rice, two bags of noodles, and several boxes of water, instant noodles and (nutritionally dense) biscuits, and I haven't stocked up too much," Zhang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview last week. He said he bought his groceries online because the supermarket was crowded. 	"Ndili ndi matumba asanu ndi limodzi a mpunga, matumba awiri a ma noodles, mabotolo angapo a madzi ndi mabisiketi osapatsa nthanzi.

Ms. Yao, who lives in the Chaoyang district, told VOA Mandarin that she had been stocking up on necessities since the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Commerce recommended that everyone do so. She asked that VOA Mandarin not use her full name because she wanted to avoid official retribution.

So I have a lot of rice, noodles and oil at home," she said, adding that she figured her family would be fine even if Beijing locked down for a month. 	 "Ndinazolowera kusunga chakudya, kotero ndili ndi mpunga wambiri, ma noodles ndi mafuta ophikira kunyumba," iwo anatero, kuwonjezera kuti atati aletsedwe kuyenda ku Beijing, banja lawo silingasowe kanthu kwa mwezi wathunthu.
And while Beijing has not yet closed the city, citizens' lives have been disrupted. 	Ngakhale kuti mzinda wa Beijing sunatsekedwe, miyoyo ya anthu yasokonezeka.
On April 28, the Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital issued a notice that the outpatient and emergency departments of the hospital would suspend the admission of patients.

"Basically, I'm not afraid," said Mr. Wang, who asked VOA Mandarin to not use his full name so he could avoid attracting authorities' attention. "The party, government and military are here, and the people are here." 	"Poyamba ine sindikuwopa," anatero bambo Wang omwe anapempha VOA Mandarin kuti isagwiritse ntchito dzina lawo lonse kuwopa akuluakulu. "Chipani, boma ndi asilikari ali pano, anthunso ali pompano."
However, Wang told VOA Mandarin, in mid-October last year, after one person in his apartment building was diagnosed as positive, about 600 people from more than 200 families were forced into isolation at several hotels in the Changping district for 21 days.

At the request of the United States, Fijian officials took a $300 million yacht belonging to Suleiman Kerimov, the Justice Department said. Officials say the yacht is in Lautoka, Fiji. 	Kutengera pempho la United States, adindo a ku Fiji anatenga bwato la a Suleiman Kerimov, la ndalama zokwana 300 miliyoni US Dollars, gawo loyendetsa za chilungamo latero.

WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa 	Lipoti la WHO lati chiwerengero cha matenda a COVID chikutsika kupatula ku America ndi ku Africa.
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March. 	World Health Organization, lachitatu yanena kuti nambala ya anthu omwe akupezeka ndi corona virus komanso kumwalira padziko lonse ikupitilira kutsika msabata yatha, kupitiliza kutsika komwe kunayamba March.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance. 	Mu lipoti lake la sabata iliyonse la mliriwu, nthambi ya U.N yoyang'anira umoyo yati pali anthu pafupifupi 3.8 miliyoni omwe apatsirana matendawa komanso anthu oposa 15,000 amwalira sabata yatha zomwe zapangitsa chiwerengerochi kutsika ndi 17% komanso 3%. Koma nambalayi ikuoneka kuti yachepetsedwa poyendera ndi zotsatira za COVID-19 pamene mayiko ochuluka anasiya kuyesa matendawa komanso kuyang'anira mayiko awo.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease. 	Komabe WHO yapeza kuti chiwerengero cha odwala chakwera ndi magawo atatu pamene anthu 13 mwa 100 aliwonse ku America ali ndi matendawa. Pafupifupi anthu 70 pa 100 aliwonse amwaliraku India ngakhale akuti izi zili chomwechi kamba kotulutsa lipotili mochedwa osati kufala kwa matenda komwe kwachitika pompano.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death. 	Sabata yatha, adindo a ku South Africa ati apeza kuti pali kukwera kwa chiwerengero cha anthu odwala mtundu wina wa COVID-19 wotchedwa BA.4 omicron ngakhale kuti pakali pano sangathe kunena ngati iyi ingakhale nyengo ina ya mliriwu. Ngakhale kuti BA.4 omicron COVID-19 ndiyosiyana komanso yofala kwambiri kuposa omicron, WHO yati palibe umboni woti mthendayi ndi yomwe ikuchititsa anthu ambiri kugonekedwa kuchipatala kapena kumwalira.
Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a "modest" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were "not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect" in another spike of disease. 	Salim Abdool Karim, katswiri wa zaumoyo ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya KwaZulu-Natal, wati ngakhale pali chiwerengero chochepa cha odwala COVID, South Africa inali pakati pa tchuthi ndipo chiwerengero cha oyezetsa matendawa chinatsika. Iwo ati chiwerengerochi chimachepa ndipo, "sichimakwera ngati mmene timayembekezera," pa matendawa.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done. 	Pa msonkhano wa atolankhani womwe unachitika lachitatu, mkulu WHO woona za ngozi zadzidzidzi, Dr. Michael Ryan, ati osafulumira kunena kuti COVID-19 ikusintha kamba ka kusintha kwa nyengo ndipo achenjeza mayiko omwe asiya kutsata njira zopewera mnthendayi mwansanga monga mmene achitira mayiko a azungu.
"The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become," he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. "If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission," he said. 	"Oweruza akufufuzabe ngati kachilombo koyambitsa matendawa kamasintha ndi nyengo," Iwo anatero kufotokoza kuti sizinatsimikidwe ngati chiwerengero cha odwala COVID-19 chingatsike m'nyengo yotentha kapena ngati tingawonenso kusintha. "Ngati anthu angamachulukane mmalo omwe matenda atsopanowa akufala ndiye kuti chiwerengero chopatsirana chikhoza kukweranso," iwo anatero.
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes. 	Izi zili chomwechi, akuluakulu a ku China akupitilia kutseka mizinda kuphatikizapo Beijing komwe malo okwelera sitima 10 pa 100 aliwonse anatsekedwa pofuna kuchepetsa kufala kwa mthendayi komanso akuluakulu anatseka kale malo odyera, malo olimbitsira thupi komanso sukulu.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger. 	Ziletso zokhwima komanso zonyoza ku Shanghai zapangitsa kuti pakhale kuchepa kwa chakudya ndi thandizo la mankhwala komanso zili ndi zotsatira pa chuma cha dziko. Mzika zokwiya zafunsa akuluakulu kochoka mnyumba zawo komanso pa intaneti.

 Report: Iran to Execute Swedish-Iranian National by May 21.	Lipoti: Iran ikufuna kupha munthu wa chi Swedish wokhala ku Iran pasanafike pa 21 May.
Iran will later this month execute a Swedish-Iranian national whom it has imprisoned since 2016 and convicted of spying for Israel, media reported. 	Wofalitsa nkhani ati dziko la Iran kumapeto kwa mwezi uno lipha munthu wa chi Swedish yemwe ali mzika ya ku Iran, yemwe wakhala kundende kochoka mu 2016 kamba kopezeka wolakwa pokhala mzondi wa Israel.
Irans semiofficial ISNA news agency on Wednesday released a report in which Iranian officials stated that Tehran will implement the death penalty against Ahmad Reza Jalali by May 21. 	Nthambi yofalitsa nkhani ya ku Iran ya ISNA, yatulutsa lipoti lachitatu loti mzinda wa Tehran upereka chilango chokupha a Ahmed Reza Jalali pasanafike pa 21 May.
Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016. In 2017, Jalali was sentenced to death in Iran after he had been found guilty of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel to help it assassinate several nuclear scientists. 	A Jalali omwe ndi wofufuza komanso dokotala wothandiza pa ngozi zadzidzidzi, anamangidwa pamene anakayendera dziko la Iran mu April, 2016. Mu 2017, a Jalali anagamulidwa kuti akuyenera kuphedwa ku Iran atapezeka olakwa pa mlandu wopereka uthenga wokhudzana ndi a sayansi awiri ochita za nukiliya ku Iran pofuna kuthandiza dziko la Israel kupha ochita sayansi ya nukiliya angapo.
Rights groups have condemned Jalalis detention, citing Irans pattern of detaining dual nationals and expatriates without due process. 	Magulu a maufulu adzudzula kusungidwa kwa a Jalali ponena kuti dziko la Iran lilibe njira zoyenera zosungira kundende anthu omwe ndi mzika za m'mayiko awiri komanso anthu okhala kunja kwa dzikolo.
Iran does not recognize dual nationals. 	Anthu omwe ndi mzika za mayiko awiri samatengedwa ngati mzika za ku Iran.
The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019. 	Chidziwotsochi chabwera pamene akuluakulu a ku Stockholm amamalizitsa kumvera mlandu wa a Hamid Nouri, omwe anali m'dindo wozenga milandu, ndipo anamangidwa ndi adindo a chi Swedish mu November, 2019.
Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest. 	Akuluakulu ati a Nouri anatengapo gawo pa imfa za akaidi omangidwa kamba ka ndale pomwe boma la Iran linalamula kuti aphedwe ku ndende ya ku Iran ya Gohardasht kumapeto kwa nkhondo ya Iran ndi Iraq m'chaka cha 1988. A Nouri akhala akusungidwa ku Sweden kuchoka nthawi yomwe anamangidwa.
On Wednesday, the final day of Nouri's trial, a Stockholm district court judge set the date of the verdict for July 14. 	Lachitatu lomwe linali tsiku lomaliza kumvera mlandu wa a Nouri, woweluza milandu wa ku khothi la m'boma la Stockholm, wasankha 14 July ngati tsiku lopereka chigamulo.
Amnesty International put the number of those executed at the prison at 5,000 but said in a 2018 report that the number could be higher. 	Amnesty International yati omwe anaphedwa kundende ndi anthu 5,000 koma mu lipoti la 2018, nambalayi ikhoza kukhala yokwera.
Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, said, "Iran continues to be one of the worlds leading implementers of the death penalty." 	Mu lipoti lomwe latulutsidwa kumene, bungwe loona za ufulu la Human Rights Watch lati, "dziko la Iran ndilo lili patsogolo ndipo likupitilira kukhala limodzi mwa mayiko omwe akuperekabe chilango chakupha pa dziko lonse."
If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses. Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case. 	Ngati a Nouri angapezeke olakwa, akhoza kukakhala kundende moyo wawo onse chifukwa cha milandu ya nkhondo ya pakati pa mayiko komanso kuphwanya ufulu. Posachedwapa, dziko la Iran lagwira nthumwi za chi Swedish ngati gawo la zionetsero zosonyeza kusakondwa ndi kumangidwa kwa a Nouri.
Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial. 	Maja Aberg, mlangizi wa za malamulo pamodzi ndi Amnesty International ya ku Sweden, wati sikuti zangochitika kuti dziko la Iran lalengeza za kuphedwa kwa a Jalali panthawi yomwe oweruza milandu a chi Swedish anayamba kumvera mlandu wa a Nouri.
"It indicates that (Iran) sees him as a kind of piece in the jigsaw puzzle, which is very worrying," Aberg told Sweden's TT news agency. 	"Zikusonyeza kuti dziko la Iran limawasunga pokonzekera nthawi ngati ino zomwe zili zodandaulitsa kwambiri," Aberg anawuza nyuzi ya ku Sweden ya TT.
Swedish law allows for the prosecution of Swedish citizens and other nationals for crimes against international law committed abroad. 	Malamulo a chi Swedish amalola kuzenga milandu mzika za chi Swedish ndi ena okhala m'dzikomo pa milandu yolakwira malamulo a pakati pa mayiko, yomwe imachitika kunja kwa dzikolo.

Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement 	Erdogan apita ku Riyagh kukabwezeretsa ubale.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh. 	Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wapita ku Saudi Arabia lachinayi, pa ulendo wake wa masiku awiri womwe cholinga chake ndi kuthetsa udani womwe unali pakati pa Ankara ndi Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries. 	Atsogoleri a chi Turkish ayendera mfumu ya ku Saudi patadutsa zaka mayikowa ali pa udani ngakhale anali pa ubwenzi kale.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy. 	Mehmet Ogutchu ndi mkulu wa gulu la London Energy Club, lomwe ndi gulu la boma ndi atsogoleri a chigawo choyang'anira mphamvu. A Ogutcu ati ulendowu ulimbikitsa ubale wa pakati pa mayiko. 
"President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties," said Ogutcu. "Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this. And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed." 	"Pulezidenti Erdogan ali pa ubale wabwino ndi a mfumu; tinali ndi mavuto aakulu ndi mwana wa mfumu, Muhammad Bin Salman," atero a Ogutcu. Tsopano zikuoneka kuti ndikukhulupilira kuti anthu a ku Briton, America ndi ku Qatar anatengapo gawo ngakhale anthu a ku Azeris akhoza kukhala kuti anachita izi. Zinthu zikusintha komanso kusiya kuvuta, tsopano chifukwa cha a pulezidenti izi zisindikizidwa.
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul. 	A Erdogan ndi mwana wa mfumu akhala pa udani woopsa. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish ndi yemwe anatsogolera mayiko kudzudzula dziko la Saudi Arabia pa kuphedwa kwa mtolankhani wa ku Saudi, a Jamal Khaashoggi, yemwe anaphedwa mu ofesi ya ku Istanbul ku Saudi Arabia.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit. 	Mwana wa mfumuyi amakhudzidwa ndi imfayi koma iye anakana mlanduwu. Koma ganizo loti mlandu wa kuphedwa kwa Khashoggi ukazengedwe ku Istanbul kuchoka ku Riyadh ndi chisonyezo choti Ankara ikuwalandira a Erdogan pa ulendo wawo.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy. 	A Ogutcu ati pamene zisankho za pulezidenti zili chaka cha mawa, a Erdogan akufuna Saudi iwathandize kukweza chuma cha Turkish.
"Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support," said Ogutcu. "The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey. But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries. So, there are real economic and political security interests involved." 	"Turkey ikufuna kuyambitsanso ubale wake ndi Riyadh chifukwa dziko la Turkey likufuna thandizo la ndalama," anatero a Ogutcu. "Chuma cha ku Turkish sichikukopa magulu ambiri  kapena anthu a chuma chawo kudzachita malonda m'dzikomo. Koma tsopano pakhala mgwirizano wopereka ndi kulandila pakati pa mayikowa. Kotero pali chuma komanso ndale zofunika chitetezo."
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China. 	Pali kudandaula kuti ganizo la dziko la Iran lofuna kupitilira ndi kukhazikitsidwa kwa mphamvu ya nukiliya ndi komwe kukuyanjanitsa Riyadh ndi Ankara, a polofesa Soli Ozel a ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Kadir yomwe ili ku Istanbul ndiwo ananena izi. Iwo anatinso, izi zili chomwechi makamaka pamene chidwi cha America chikuyembekezeka kuchoka ku mayiko a aluya kupita ku China.
"Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today," said Ozel. "And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence." 	"Dziko la Turkey limadziona ngati lili ndi mphamvu zambiri zoposera dziko la Iran. Mayiko onsewa pamodzi ndi mayiko onse a kwa azungu amafuna kuti dziko la Iran lisakhale ndi mphamvu m'chigawo chonse monga mmene zilili lero," anatero a Ozel. "Anthu a ku Iran nawo akuwonetsa zizindikiro zosonyeza kuti salola kuti ena awachotse ku mayiko a Iraq, Lebanon ndi Syria, komwe ali ndi mphamvu."
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog. 	Ulendo wa a Erdgan wopita ku Saudi ndi gawo la lamulo lalikulu lofuna kukonzanso maubale m'chigawochi pofuna kuthetsa kudzipatula. Pulezidenti wa chi Turkish anayenderanso United Arab Emirates posachedwapa komanso kumayambiliro a mwezi uno analandira pulezident wa ku Israel, a Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position. 	Koma akatswiri Ozel wachenjeza kuti Ankara ili pachiopsezo.
"Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength," said Ozel. 	"Dziko la Turkey linadzipatula, kunyoza komanso kukhumudwitsa mayiko ambiri omwe linali nawo pa ubale wabwino. Ndipo onsewa akuzindikira kuti mgwirizano wadzidzidziwu ukubwera kamba ka kufooka osati kulimbika kwa Turkey," anatero a Ozel.
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back. 	Koma akastwiri ati Ankara ikutenga ubwino wake ngati kuthekera kodzimangira linga pofuna kudziteteza ku zofuna za Iran, njira yomwe ingathandize kuthana ndi udani pakati pa omwe ayandikana nawo kuti ubale ubwelere.
	
	
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms 	Kupha, komanso kumanga kutsalira kusintha kwa malamulo ku Saudi.
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change. 	Saudi Arabia ikufuna kukonza malamulo ake a nkhanza koma kusinthaku kukutsekerezedwa ndi kupha komanso kuzunza otsutsa zomwe zikubweretsa mafunso odabwa kuti ndi zinthu ziti zomwe zitasinthe.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system. 	Ufumuwu umadziwika ndi kutanthauzira kwake kwa lamulo la chisilamu la sharia lomwe ndi gwero la malamulo okhudzana ndi milandu.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East. 	Koma m'miyezi yapitayi, dzikoli lapitilira ndi kusintha malamulo zomwe akatswiri ati zikhoza kupangitsa kuti makhothi awo azigwira ntchito ngati ena onse ku mayiko a aluya.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences. 	Izi zagwirizana ndi m'ndandanda wa malamulo atsopano okhudza ufulu wa azimayi banja likatha komanso mphamvu ya oweruza milandu kupereka chigamulo kwa olakwa.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image. 	Chaka chatha, mwana wa mfumu, Prince Mohammed bin Salman yemwe anadziika yekha pampando analengeza kuti njira zimenezi kuphatikizapo malamulo omwe analembedwa koyamba okhudzana ndi milandu komanso zilango zake, akufanana ndi cholinga cha Saudi Arabia chofuna kumasukira dziko ndi kuchotsa chithunzithunzi choyipa.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases. 	Ngakhale otsutsa avomereza kuti kusinthaku kupangitsa zochitika ku ma Khothi a ku Saudi zizidziwika pena.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government. 	Koma palibe chiyembekezo choti pakhala kufewetsa malamulo okhwima oletsa kuyankhula zakukhosi kapena ngati makhothi asiye kuwonetsa tsankho kwa omwe akuoneka kuti ndi otsutsa boma.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism." 	Pamene pali kusintha, pa nthawi yomweyo akuluakulu akukumbutsa zomwe zinachititsa kuti Saud Arabia ikhale ndi mbiri yankhanza, ndipo ati izi zili chomcho kamba ka kuphedwa kwa anthu 81 pa tsiku limodzi m'mwezi wa March pa milandu yokhudzana ndi ziwawa.
'Notorious' system 	Kachitidwe koyipa ka zinthu 
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion. 	Malamulo awiri atsopano avomerezedwa ndi boma la ku Saudi. Lamulo loyamba ndi lolola kupereka umboni wovomerezedwa ndi woweruza milandu.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children. 	Lamulo lachiwiri ndi lokhudza mabanja lomwe liyambe kugwira ntchito mu June. Kutengera pachikhalidwe chomwe abambo amalamula, lamuloli likutambasula ufulu wa amayi wolandila malipiro komanso kusunga ana banja likatha.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability." 	Polengeza za lamulo latsopano m'mwezi wa March, Prince Mohammed ati lamuloli likusonyeza "kusintha kwakukulu" pa ufulu wa amayi  ndi "kulimba kwa mabanja."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights. 	Wachiwiri kwa mtsogoleri wa bungwe la European Saudi Organization for Human Rights, a Adel al-Saeed, ati  kusinthaku mbali ina kupereka mpata kwa ochita malonda a m'mayiko ena omwe zotsatira zake ndi zomwe ufumuwu ukufuna.
"The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image," he said. 	"Eni ake a mpamba amachita mantha kudzachita malonda m'dziko lino lomwe lili ndi malamulo ankhanza, kotero malamulowa akufuna kusintha zimenezi," iwo anatero.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes. 	Malamulo atsopano okhudza milandu ndi zilango zake, omwe pakalipano sanadziwike, akhoza kupitiliza kubweretsa kusintha.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases. 	Pansi pa lamulo la sharia, milandu ya mpakuto pa chipembedzo, kuba, kuwukira, kuba ndi mfuti, chigololo, kumwa mowa ndi kunyozana ndi yomwe ili zigamulo zake zodziwikiratu. Milandu ina yonse woweruza milandu ndi omwe amasankha zilango zake.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University. 	Pamene pali malamulo a milandu ndi zilango zake, "boma likuyembekeza kuti woweruza milandu sazidalira kuphunzira kwawo kwa lamulo la sharia, koma malamulo (omwe gwero lake ndi lamulo la sharia) ovomerezedwa ndi boma," anatero a Nathan Brown, wophunzira ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya George Washington. 
"As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region," said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms. 	"Zotsatira zake ndi zoti Saudi Arabia iwoneka ngati dziko la malamulo okhudza anthu, monga maboma ena onse m'chigawochi," atero a Brown omwe anaphunzira za malamulo atsopano a ku Saudi.
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have." 	Zotsatira zake zikhale "zodziwika," anatero a Abdullah Alaoudh, katswiri wa malamulo komanso otsutsa boma omwe amakhala ku U.S, pamene malamulo atsopano "akutenga ufulu umene woweruza milandu anali nawo."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added. 	Koma malamulo okhwima opangidwa ndi mafumu "amabweretsa vuto lalikulu: kusadziyimira panokha," iwo anawonjezera.
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal. 	Mfumu ndiye mtsogoleri wa makhothi a ku Saudi ndipo amakhala ngati khothi lalikulu lochitila apilu.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar. 	Bambo awo a Alaoudh, a Salman al-Awdah, womwe ndi wansembe wodziwika, akhala atamangidwa kuchoka mu 2017 kamba koyankha zosagwirizana ndi lamulo la Saudii Arabia pa tsamba la mchezo la Twitter, panthawi yomwe dzikoli limadzipatula ku dziko la Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power. 	Iwo ndi mmodzi mwa ambiri omwe anamangidwa mwankhanza kamba kotsutsa pamodzi ndi  omwe amapikisana ndi mphamvu za mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession. 	Chimodzi mwa zitsanzo zodziwika bwino ndi mwana wamfumu Mohammed bin Nayef yemwe anagwirizanitsa CIA, komanso amalemekezedwa ndi mayiko a azungu chifukwa choyesetsa kuthana ndi nkhanza ngakhale mfumu Salman anamuchotsa pa ndandanda wa anthu otenga ufumu. 
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed. 	Mwana wa mfumu Nayef wakhala asakuoneka ku gulu la anthu kuchokera m'mwezi wa March pamene kunatuluka lipoti loti wamangidwa. Koma kumangidwa kwake sikunatsimikizidwe.
Shadow of Khashoggi 	Chithunzithunzi cha Khashoggi.
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make. 	Kwa anthu otsutsa boma, milandu ngati imeneyi imadzetsa mafunso kuti ndi kusintha kwanji komwe malamulo omwe akonzedwawa kungabweretse.
"In my view, this is all window-dressing," said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles. 	"Ine ndikuona kuti izi ndi zachionetsero chabe," anatero a Madawi al-Rasheed, omwe amakhala ku U.K, omwenso ndi wophunzira komanso m'neneri wa chipani chotsutsa cha National Assembly chomwe chinayambitsidwa ndi anthu othamangitsidwa kwawo.
"It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer." 	"Ndizovuta kwambiri kupeza tanthauzo la malamulo osinthidwawa kupatula kuti ndi ntchito yofuna kuwonetsa mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed, ngati munthu wosintha zinthu."
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. 	Nkhani yomwe ikumveka pakakambidwa za chilungamo ndi kukonza malamulo ku Saudi Arabia ndi nkhani ya kuphedwa ndi kudulidwa ziwalo kwa wotsutsa komanso wolemba nkhani, a Jamal Khashoggi, m'chaka cha 2018 ku ofesi ya ufumu ku Istanbul.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation. 	A.U.S itafufuza yapeza kuti mwawa wa mfumu Mohammed "anavomereza" kuti za kugwidwa kapena kuphedwa kwa a Khashoggi, ngakhale adindo a ku Saudi atsutsa izi ponena kuti zomwe zinachitikazi zinali zochotsa ulemu.
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia. 	M'mwezi wa April, mtsogoleri wa ku Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, asanapite ku Riyadh ndi kukumbatira mwana wa mfumu, Mohammed, lachinayi, dziko la Turkey linasamutsira mlandu wa a Khashoggi ku Saudi Arabia popanda mboni 26.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial. 	Chiganizo cha dziko la Turkey chinapangitsa kuti maloya okhudzidwa ndi bwenzi la a Khashoggi achite zionetsero ponena kuti ma khothi a ku Saudi sangapereke chigamulo mwachilungamo.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out. 	Kwa omwe okondedwa awo anatsekeredwa kundende, kuphedwa kwa a Khashoggi kwabweretsa mantha okanika kuyankhulapo.
"I want to, many do, but we're scared," said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018. 	"Ndikufuna kuyankhula, ambiri akufuna kutero, koma tili ndi mantha," anatero mnzake wa mwana wa mfumu Salman bin Abdulaziz, yemwe wakhala kundende pamodzi ndi bambo ake kuchoka m'chaka cha 2018.
"Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi." 	"Aliyense akudziwa zomwe zinawachitikira a Khashoggi."
	
	
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans 	Ndondomeko ya kundende ya ku Morocco ikufuna kusintha nkhalakale za IS.
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war. "A terrifying experience," he says. 	Msilikari wa gulu la Islamic State yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Morocco ndi cholinga chokamenya nawo nkhondo yoyera (yachilungamo) ku Syria, a Mohsin, ati anaona zoopsa zonse za nkhondo. "Zinali zinthu zochititsa mantha," iwo anatero.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges. 	A Mohsin a zaka 38 omwe pano ndi mkaidi ati tsopano alibe chidwi ngati mmene analili kale, wodzadza ndi mkwiyo komanso wofuna kupha onse omwe si asilamu. Iwo anagwidwa ku Turkey ndipo anawasamutsira ku Morocco komwe anagamulidwa kukakhala kundende kwa zaka khumi pa mlandu wochita ziwawa.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release. 	Msilikari wakaleyu pamodzi ndi akaidi ena 14, omwenso ali kundende pa mlandu wochita ziwawa, amaliza maphunziro awo kuchokera ku ndondomeko ya ku Morocco yofuna kusintha anthu yomwe ingawapangitse kukhala oyenera kutulutsidwa mwansanga.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed. 	Associated Press ndi wofalitsa nkhani ena anayitanidwa kukakhala nawo pa mwambo wotsiliza maphunzirowa womwe unachitika lachinayi kufupi ndi mzinda wa Morocco ku Rabat, komanso kukafunsa mafunso akaidi ena omwe akuyang'aniridwa. Adindo oyang'anira ndende anasankha anthu atatu omwe anali okonzeka kufunsidwa mafunso.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons. 	Akuluakulu anapempha kuti akaidiwa asatchulidwe mayina komanso asawaonetse nkhope pofuna kuwasungira chinsinsi.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers. 	Koma akuluakulu a ndende sanamvere nawo pomwe akaidi amafunsidwa mafunso ngakhale kulowelera mafunso oyenera kufunsidwa ndi wofalitsa nkhani kapena mayankho a akaidi.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017. 	Akaidi 15 atavala malaya ndi mabuluku oyera bwino anayima chiliri poyimba nyimbo ya fuko la Morocco ndipo anapatsidwa zikalata zosonyeza kumaliza maphunziro. Akuluakulu a ndende ati ndondomeko yosintha anthuyi yachitika kwa miyezi itatu pomwe akaidi amalowa mkalasi kundende komweko, kuphunzira za chipembedzo, malamulo ndi zachuma. Iwo atinso akaidiwa aphunzira mmene angayambire kuchita malonda. Omwe atsiriza maphunzirowa kumene ndi gulu la chisanu ndi zinayi kochokera nthawi yomwe ndondomekoyi inayamba mu 2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path." 	Mkulu woyang'anira maubale ndi chikhalidwe komanso kubwezeretsa akaidi kwawo, a Moulay Idris Agoulmam omwenso ndi mmodzi wa ogwira ntchito ku ndende ya Morocco, ati ndondomekoyi siyokakamiza komanso imachitika kwa akaidi okha, "kuti asinthe khalidwe ndi kusintha njira ya moyo wawo."
"It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes," he said. 	"Zimathandiza akaidi kuzindikira kukula za kulakwa zawo," iwo anatero.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons. 	Kumaliza maphunzirowa sikutanthauza kuti akaidi atuluka nsanga koma kuwonjezera mwayi wotulutsidwa ndi a mfumu kapena kuchotseredwa zaka. Woyang'anira ndende ati izi ndi zomwe zakhala zikuchutika kwa theka la anthu 222 omwe amaliza maphunziro a ndondomekoyi. Kuyambira mchaka cha 2019, maphunzirowa amaperekedwa kwa amayi omwe anali kundende pa mlandu wochita ziwawa, kutengera ndi lamulo lotsutsana ndi ziwawa la Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Amayi khumi ndi omwe anamaliza maphunzirowa ndipo anatulutsidwa kundende ndipo asanu ndi anayi anakhululukiridwa milandu yawo.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism. 	Ndondomekoyi yomwe imatchedwa "Moussalaha" mu chi Arabic kutanthauza kuti "chiyanjano," imaperekedwa kwa akaidi omwe awonetsa kuti ali okonzeka kusiya kuchita zinthu moonjeza.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad." He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims." 	A Mohsin ati anapita kukamenya nkhondo ku Syria mu 2012. Iwo anasiya sukulu ali wachinyamata ndipo anena kuti, "sanali ophunzira kwenikweni choncho samatha kusiyanitsa pakati pa chabwino ndi choyipa." Iwo anasintha kamba ka anthu omwe anawaonetsa kanema wa anthu ochita zinthu moonjeza "wokhudzana ndi lamulo lochoka kwa mulungu loti azilimbana ndi onse omwe samatsatira malamulo achisilamu komanso kupha omwe si asilamu."
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said. "I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion." 	Ku Syria, "ndinawona kuphedwa kwa anthu ambiri, kugwililira ndi kuba," iwo anatero. "Patadutsa nthawi ndinazindikira kuti nkhondoyi yomwe imachitika mu dzina la chisilamu siimakhudzana konse ndi chipembedzo chathu."
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco. 	Iwo anathawira ku Turkey m'chaka cha 2018, komwe anakhala kundende kwa chaka asanawasamutsire ku Morocco.
He says he has now disavowed extremism. 	Iwo ati tsopano anasiya  kuchita zinthu moonjeza.
"That period of my life has passed," he said. 	"Nthawi imeneyi m'moyo wanga inadutsa," iwo anatero.
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups. Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists. 	Anthu ambiri a ku Morocco anapita ku Syria, Iraq ndi kwina konse, kukalowa magulu a ziwawa. Ku Morocco nako kwakhala kukuchitika ziwawa. Ziwawa zomwe zinachitika kasanu ku Casablanca mu 2003 zinapha anthu 33. M'chaka cha 2011, bomba lomwe linaphulitsidwa ku malo odyera a Marrakech, linapha anthu 17, ambiri mwa iwo anali alendo ochoka mayiko ena.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again. 	A Al Mustapaha Razrazi, omwe ndi wachipatala woona mthenda ya m'maganizo komanso membala wa komiti ya sayansi ya ndondomekoyi, ati pa anthu 156 omwe anamasulidwa atachita maphunzirowa, m'modzi yekha ndi yemwe anagwidwa akupalamulanso mulandu.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said. 	Munthuyi anapalamula mulandu wina wosakhudzana ndi kuchita ziwawa.
	
	
	
Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker 	Iran ipeza mwayi wogulitsa zida kwa wokonza galimoto wa ku Russia.
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported. 	Lipoti la wofalitsa nkhani a boma lati, membala wa gulu la makampani lokonza zida za galimoto ku Iran, wati okonzawa ali ndi mwayi wotumiza katundu wawo kwa wokonza galimoto ku Russia. 
The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying "a prominent Russian car maker" requested parts from Iran. He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components. 	Lipoti lomwe latuluka lolemba madzulo lati a Hossein Bahrainian anena kuti "wokonza galimoto wodziwika wa ku Russia" wapempha zida kuchoka ku Iran. Iwo sanamutchule wokonzayu. Iwo atinso okonza galimotoyu wapemphanso zida zoyimitsira galimoto, zopewera ngozi, zobweretsera mphepo yabwino ndi zida zina zazikulu.
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions. 	Mayiko a Iran ndi Russia ali pansi pa chilango cha U.S koma kugulitsa galimoto ndi zida za galimoto sikukhudzana ndi chilangochi.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions. However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran. 	Kubweretsa galimoto ku Iran sikukukhudzananso ndi chilangochi. Komabe, mzinda wa Tehran sunabweretse galimoto kuchoka mu 2018 pamene dziko la U.S linachoka mu pangano la nukiliya pakati pa Iran ndi World Powers ndikupereka zilango pa mafuta ndi banki pa dziko la Iran.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. 	Mayiko a kwa azungu anasiya kugulitsa ku Russia kuchokera nthawi imene Russia inalowa ku Ukraine mwaupandu.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela. 	Mu zaka zadutsazi, Iran yagulitsa ma ladiyeta ndi mateyala a galimoto ku Russia. M'buyomo amagulitsa galimoto ku Iraq, Syria ndi Venezuela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia. 	Mzinda wa Tehran ndi mzinda wa Moscow anali paubale waukulu mu zaka zapitazi makamaka pamene Russia inathandiza Iran kuyika pa intaneti ntchito yake yokhazikitsa mphamvu za nulikiya.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine. 	Mwapadera lachiwiri, Iran yati inatengapo gawo lokhala mkhalapakati pa nkhondo ya Ukraine.
"So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart," said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart. He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability. 	"Kufikira pano, ndapereka uthenga wochokera kwa nduna yoona zakunja ku Ukraine kupita kwa anzanga a ku Russia, kawiri konse," anatero nduna yoona zakunja a Hossein Amir Abdollahian pa lamya ndi mnzawo wa ku Iris. Iwo ati Iran ikuthandiza kupeza mayankho obwezeretsera mtendere ndi bata.
Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran "opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine," and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan. 	A Abdollahian sanatsindike koma anangoti Iran "ikutsutsana ndi nkhondo komanso kusamuka kwa anthu ku Ukraine," ndi malo ena monga ku Yemen, malo a ku Palestine ndi Afghanistan.
	
	
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage 	Njira zosiyanasiyana zatsopano zikugwiritsidwa ntchito ku mayiko a aluya pofalitsa nkhani.
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives. 	Natalia Sancha anasankha kugwira ntchito ndi anthu ena ngati njira yochitila utolankhani. Akapita kukagwira ntchito, iwo amayankhula ndi ena omwe akulemba nkhani yomweyo kuti amve mbali yawo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important. 	Mbali ina, izi zikuchitika chifukwa chofuna kuyankhulapo pa nkhani zomwe sizimakambidwa, koma ngati wolemba nkhani wamkazi mu chigawo chomwe abambo akulamula, iwo ati kugwirizana ndi kuthandiza amayi omwe amagwira nawo ntchito kwakhala kofunika.
"I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story," the 42-year-old journalist said. 	"Ndimatha kuyankhula ndi wolemba nkhani aakazi komanso aamuna ndipo ndimazindikira kuti akazi amaganiza komanso kuona zinthu mofanana akamalemba nkhani," anatero wofalitsa nkhaniyu yemwe ali ndi zaka 42.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria. 	Ganizo lochita mgwirizanowu linabwera mu 2020 pamene wosindikiza mabuku anawafunsa a Sancha ngati ali ndi chidwi cholemba bukhu lokhudzana ndi Syria.
She countered with a better offer. 	Iwo anatsutsa izi ndipo anapereka ganizo lina labwino.
"I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect," she said. "I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense." 	"Ndinawauza kuti kutolera nkhani zambiri za wolemba nkhani achikazi zokhudzana ndi chigawo chachikulu, kukhoza kubweretsa zotsatira zina," iwo anatero. "Ndikanatha kulemba bukhuli ndekha, koma silikanamveka chimodzimodzi."
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia. 	A Sancha omwe kwawo ndi ku Andalusia, ku m'mwera kwa Spain, akhala ku mayiko a aluya kwa zaka 14 zapitazo, kulemba nkhani zokhudza kusamvana ku Iraq, Syria ndi Yemen komanso kuchita lipoti kuchokera ku Egypt, Lebanon ndi Tunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020. 	Masiku apitawa, iwo akhala akugwira ntchito kwambiri ndi chigawo cha mauthega ku European Union, atachoka ku Beirut kamba ka mavuto a zaumoyo omwe anayambika chifukwa cha mabomba omwe anaphulitsidwa mu mzindawu m'chaka cha 2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA. 	Akazi "akudziwa zambiri chifukwa timatha kupita malo omwe abambo ogwira nawo ntchito sanazolowele. Osati chifukwa ndife anzeru koma chifukwa anthu ambiri m'chigawochi akanali a mtundu wa chi Arab, asilamu komanso amasiyanitsa amayi ndi abambo," a Sancho anawuza VOA.
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted. 	Iwo anazindikira kuti kukhala ndi atolankhani aakazi kuli ndi ubwino.
"If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict." 	"Nditakhala wowerenga nkhani, ndikhoza kukonda kuti wofotokoza nkhaniyo akhale mzimayi chifukwa ikhala yokhudzana ndi chiwerengero chonse, zomwe zikutanthauza kuti mu nkhaniyi mukhala zonse zokhudzana ndi kusamvana."
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters. 	Mu bukhu lawo, a Sancha anafikira amayi ena omwe amalemba nkhani ku mayiko aluya, pofuna kuwonetsetsa kuti pali maganizo osiyanasiyana kuchoka kwa atolankhani akunja ndi apafupi.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April. 	Zotsatira za mgwirizano wa pafupifupi zaka ziwiri ndi Bullets for All, yomwe inatulutsidwa m'mwezi wa April ku Spain.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said. 	Mu bukhuli, "anthu osiyanasiyana akufotokoza nkhani imodzi yomwe ikuyimira amayi onse," a m'chigawochi, anatero a Sancho.
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment. 	Aliyense amapereka maganizo ake pa kulemba nkhani za mbiri yakale kuphatikizapo kugwa kwa ulamuliro wa chipani chimodzi, ziwonetsero ndi nkhondo. Bukhuli likuwunikanso kusalidwa ndi nkhanza zomwe amayi amakumana nazo ku ma ofesi olemba nkhani komanso pogwira ntchito.
Making connections 	Kuchita mgwirizano.
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book. 	Kumvetsa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe kumathandiza kupita chitsogolo m'chigawochi," anatero a Maya Gebeily. Iwo monga mkulu wa ofesi ya The Reuters ku Lebanon, Syria ndi Jordan anathandiza nawo pa bukhuli.
"There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting," she said. 	"Pali zambiri zofuna kunena ndi kuwonetsa kuchoka ku mbali ya atolankhani aakazi omwe anasintha chifukwa cha amayi omwe amakumana nawo pamene amachita utolankhani," iwo anatero.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters. 	A Gebeily, omwe anabadwa kwa makolo a chi Lebanise ku U.S, anayamba ntchito yawo yolemba nkhani mu 2013 ku ma ofesi olemba nkhani ku Beirut ku Lebanon. Iwo anapita m'chigawochi kukagwilira ntchito Agence France-Presse asapite ku Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that. 	A Gebeily ati kukhala wa mtundu wa chi American ndi Lebanese kwawathandiza kumvetsa bwino chigawochi komanso kwasintha utolankhani wawo. Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi gawo lofunikira la zimenezi.
"When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust," she said. "If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access." 	"Pofunsa mafunso nduna, munthu wothawa kwawo kapena wofuna kusintha zinthu, chinthu chofunika kwambiri ndi kupeza chikhulipliro chawo," iwo anatero. "Kutha kuyankhula chiyankhulo chawo ndi kuwapangitsa kuti akhale omasuka, kumasintha kalikonse. Izi zimapereka mwayi wabwino.
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group. 	Kuwonjezera Iraq ndi Lebanon, a Gebeily a zaka 30, anapitako ku Syria kukalemba nkhani zokhudza nkhondo yolimbana ndi gulu la zigawenga la Islamic State (IS) 
"Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out," she said. 	"Ndakhala ndi mwayi woyankhula ndi anthu mwachindunji m'madera ena popanda wotanthauzira kapena wothandizira,zomwenso zimathandiza mmene nkhani zitulukire," iwo anatero.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that. 	Wolemba nkhani wa mtundu wa chi Syrian-Kurdish, a Khabat Abbas, omwe analemba nkhani za nkhondo ya ku Syria, akuvomereza za kufunika kwa izi.
"Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you," she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria. 	"Kudziwa chiyankhulo ndi chikhalidwe ndi komwe kumapangitsa anthu kuti akumasukire ndi kukuuza zinthu," iwo anawuza VOA kuchoka ku Qamishli, ku Syria.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais. 	Kudziwa kumeneku kunathandiza pamene a Abbas a zaka 34, anakagwira ntchito ndi a Sancha mu March, 2021. Iwo anapita ku malo osungira anthu ku Kurdish, kumpoto kwa Syria, kukafunsa mafunso akazi omwe amamenya nawo nkhondo yoyera (yachilungamo) yokhudzana ndi IS, kuti alembe nkhani mu El Pais.
"While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them," Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS. 	"Pamene ndinali ku Qamashli (kumpoto kwa Syria), ndinakumana ndi wolemba nkhani komanso anzanga a chi British awiri, omwe anali okhumudwa kuti Shamima Begum ndi akazi ena kumaloku anakana kuyankhula nawo," anatero a Sancha kutanthauza mtsikana yemwe anachoka kwawo ku Britain ali ndi zaka 15 kukalowa gulu la IS.
"Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents," Sancha said. 	"Yemwe amawathandiza anali munthu wabambo kotero akazi omenya nkhondowa sanayankhule nawo chifukwa anasintha ndipo sayankhula ndi anthu aamuna. Koma ine ndinakhala pansi ndi Shamima komanso akazi ena omwe anayankha bwino mafunso mkati mwa hema wawo," anatero a Sancha.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added. 	A Abbas anali ndi gawo kuti ayankhule ndi amayiwa, iwo anawonjezera.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist. 	Kusiyana ndi a Sancha ndi a Gebeily, a Abbas anakulira ku chigawo chaching'ono cha Kurdish komwe kunalibe kulemba nkhani kufikira nthawi yomwe nkhondo inayamba mu 2011.
"Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines," Abbas said. "It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues." 	"Anthu m'chigawochi anazolowera kuwona amayi akutenga zida ndi kumenya nkhondo osati kuwona amayi atatenga chojambulira munsewu kapena akuyima patsogolo, " anatero Abbas. "Zinatengera kudzipereka kuti banja ndi dera langa atsimikize kuti ndimachita zinthu bwino mwinanso kuposera anzanga achimuna omwe ndimagwira nawo ntchito.
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign. 	Kulemba nkhani kunawasangalatsa chifukwa nkhani za mayiko aluya zimakambidwa ndi wolemba nkhani achimuna, pafupi ngakhalenso kunja.
"The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region," Abbas said. 	"Kulemba nkhani sikunasinthe chifukwa cha izi, ngati amayi olemba nkhani a konkuno komanso kunja angapatsidwe mwayi wolemba nkhani za mayiko aluya, kalembedwe ka nkhani kakhoza kusintha, zomwenso zingasinthe mmene anthu ena amawonera chigawo chino," anatero a Abbas.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol. 	A Sancha akukhulupilira kuti amayi olemba nkhani ndiwokhudzidwa ndi mmene anthu amaonera zinthu m'chigawochi, kuphatikizapo kukhala ndi maganizo oopsa kamba ka zomwe zinachitika ndi zotsatira zake pa umoyo wa amayi komanso pa ziwawa ndi mowa.
"We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about," she said. 	"Timakamba zinthu zomwe abambo samayankhulapo," iwo anatero.
	
	
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction 	Mkulu wa asilikari ku Iran wati Israel ikuchita zinthu zowononga dziko lake.
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed. 	Zochita za Israel zipangitsa kuti dzikoli liwonongeke, mkulu wolamula asillikari ku Iran wanena izi pa msonkhano wa pa tsiku la Yerusalemu pa mwambo woonetsa bomba lomwe dzikolo lapanga lokha, lotchedwa Kheibar Buster
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country. 	Kanema wa boma wati anthu okwana ma miliyoni anapita ku misonkhano ya tsiku la Yerusalemu lomwe ndi Quds Day mu chi Arabic, kukaonera kuguba komwe kunakonzedwa ndi boma m'dzikomo.
It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed "Death to America, Death to Israel" slogans. 	Kanemayu amawonetsa mbendera ya Israel ikuwotchedwa komanso magulu a anthu m'dzikolo akukuwa mawu olembedwa kuti "imfa ku America, imfa ku Israel."
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel. 	Poyankhula pa kanema, mtsogoleri Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wati ziwonetsero zodana ndi Israel zikuwonetsa kuti anthu a ku Palestine anakana pempho la akuluakulu a ku Arab kuti amvane ndi Israel.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize. 	Kutsutsana ndi Israel ndi chimodzi mwa zikhulupiliro za ku Iran, zomwe zimapangitsa kuyikira kumbuyo magulu a zigawenga a ku Palestine ndi ku Lebanon omwe amatsutsana ndi mtendere wa ku Israel, zinthu zomwe mzinda wa Tehran sumazindikira.
"What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians," Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs. 	"Zomwe zachitika ku Palestine mu zaka zapitazi, zithetsa chikonzero cha mgwirizano ndi adani a Ziyoni (Israel) chifukwa palibe chikonzero cha Palestine chomwe chingatike eni ake palibe kapena ngati pali kuchita zosemphana ndi maganizo a anthu a ku Palestine," anatero a Khamenei, kuyankhula chi Arabic ndi anthu a ku Palestine komanso anthu a chi Arab.
Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century "are null and void". 	A Khamenei ati, mgwirizano wokhazikitsa mtendere womwe unachitika kale--monga Oslo Accords mu 1993 womwe umatanthauza kugawa mayiko a Israel ndi Palestne kuti akhale oyima pawokha pofuna kuthetsa kusamvana komwe kuli pakati pawo komanso chikonzero cha mtsogoreli wakale wa ku U.S a Donald Trump chotchedwa Deal of the Century, tsopano zilibe ntchito.
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago. 	Pulezidenti Ebrahim Raisi, akuluakulu a asilikari ku Iran ndi adindo ena anapita nawo ku misonkhanoyi komwe anthu analoledwa kuyenda mmisewu koyamba kuchokera pomwe mliri wa coronavirus unafala, zaka ziwiri zapitazo. 
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. 	Dziko la Iran limachita misonkhano ya tsiku la Yerusalemu chaka chilichonse pofuna kuthandiza anthu a ku Palestine  omwe akufuna kuti kum'mawa kwa Yerusalemu kukhale mzinda wa boma lakutsogolo mzigawo zomwe Israel inatenga pa nkhondo ya 1967, lachisanu lotsiriza la mwezi wosala kudya asilamu wa Ramadan.
"Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction," Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran. 	"Siyani kuchita zinthu zankhanza. Mukudziwa bwino kuti ndife anthu ochita komanso obwezera," mkulu wa asilikari, HosseinSalami, ananena izi poyankhula ndi Israel komanso kuuza omwe akuchita ziwonetsero ku Tehran.
"Our responses are painful. You create conditions for your own destruction. We will not leave you alone ...You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action." 	"Mayankho athu ndi opweteka. Mukupanga zinthu zodziwononga nokha. Sitikusiyani..mukudziwa kuposa ine zomwe zitakuchitikireni mukapanga zinthu zoyipa."
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only. 	Asilikari a ku Iran alonjeza kubwezera mwaukali ziwawa zilizonse zochoka ku Israel, zomwe zakhudza ndondomeko ya nukiliya ku Iran. Tehran yati ndondomekoyi cholinga chake ndi kubweretsa mtendere basi.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful. 	Dziko la Israel, lomwe kwa boma la asilamu ndi lopanda pake, lakhala likuwopseza kuchita nkhondo ndi dziko la Iran ngati kukambirana pakati pa Tehran ndi mphamvu za dziko lonse kungalephere kuletsa Iran kukonza zinthu za nukiliya. Iran yati zolinga za nukiliya ndi zamtendere.
In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its "Kheibar Buster" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles). 	M'mwezi wa Febuluwale, boma la asilamu linabweretsa poyera bomba lawo la "Kheiber Buster" lomwe likhoza kuyenda mlengalenga mtunda okwana ma kilomita 1,450 (900 mayilosi).
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region. 	Iran, yomwe ili ndi imodzi mwa ndindomeko zokonzera mabomba ku mayiko aluya, yati mabomba owuluka mlengalengawa akhoza kuyenda mtunda wa makilomita 2000 (1200 mayilosi) ndipo ali ndi kuthekera kokafika komwe kuli adani awo a ku Israel ndi U.S m'chigawochi.

Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it. 	Tehran ikuona kuti ndondomeko yake yokonza mabomba ndi yofunika chifukwa ilepheretsa United States, Israel ndi adani ena ndipo yakana zofuna za mayiko a azungu kuti asiye.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.

As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void? 	Pamene anthu a ku America ochepa akupita ku tchalitchi, sitolo zogulitsira khofi zitenga malo?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society. But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.   	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphelera, kwanthawi tsopano zatengapo gawo pa ubale komanso ndale za anthu a ku America. Koma ndi anthu ochepa omwe amapita kopemphera ndipo kuchepa kwa chiwerengero cha ma tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopembedzera kukuopseza kusiya mpata womwe sitolo za khofi zingalowepo.
"For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation," says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.   	"Mu mbiri ya America, tchalitchi - kapena anthu osonkhanawa- akhala ofunikira potenga gawo mwakachetechete pogwira ntchito limodzi komanso kulumikizana m'dera lawo, kulimbikitsa kuthandiza dera komanso kutengapo mbali pa ndale," atero a Daniel Cox, mkulu wa Survey Centre on American Life komanso mkulu wa American Enterprise Institute.
"It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church," Cox says.  	"Sikuti zinangochitika kapena kuti ndi mwayi kuti gulu lomenyera ufulu wa anthu linayambira mu tchalitchi," anatero a Cox.
"And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important." 	"Mukhoza kuwona kuti pachikhalidwe, kaya ndi ku midzi kwa azungu ambiri kapena madera okulirapo, ndi kwina konse, tchalitchi zakhala zofunika kwambiri.
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says. 	Tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphererako zatenganso udindo pothandiza anthu wobwera kuti akhazikike akafika ku America, atero a Cox.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.  	Mu 1999, anthu 70 pa 100 aliwonse ku America anati amapita ku tchalichi, ku mzikiti kapena ku kachisi.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.   	Pofika 2020, nambalayi inatsika kufika pa anthu 47 pa 100 aliwonse. Kafukufuku wa 2019 wapeza kuti anthu atatu pa anthu khumi aliwonse a ku America ndi omwe amapita kopemphera sabata iliyonse.
Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.   	Malo achitatu, kusakhudzidwa ndi kulumikizana ndi ma tchalitchi, mizikiti komanso ma kachisi kukutanthauza kuti anthu akusowekera zomwe katswiri woona za anthu m'matawuni, a Ray Oldenburg, akutchula kuti "malo achitatu."- msonkhano omwe umapereka zomwe khomo lomwe ndi "malo oyamba" komanso ntchito yomwe ndi "malo achiwiri" sizingapereke.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.  	A Oldenburg ati malo achitatu amatsutsana ndi maubale komanso umoyo wa anthu m'madera.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.   	Kafukufuku wa mu October, 2021, yemwe anachitidwa ndi gulu la American Survey Centre, anapeza kuti malo ochitila malonda monga nyumba zogulitsira khofi, zimayambitsa kukhulupilirana ndi kulumikizana m'madera a ku America zomwe zinatenga malo a tchalitchi.
"If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good," says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.   	"Ngati umapitapita ku malo omwera khofi, ogulitsa amadziwa zomwe umakonda kugula, amakupangira ndipo izi zimamveka bwino," ananena izi ndi wachipatala woona zokhudzana ndi maganizo, Dr. Maria Espinola, komanso pulofesa wothandizira mu chigawo cha Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Cincinnati College of Medicine.
"It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways," Espinola says.  	"Zimakhala bwino kudziwa kuti anthu amakuzindikira, akukudikira komanso amasamala za iwe, komanso kudziwa kuti ndiwe m'modzi mwa iwo chifukwa kufuna kukhala m'modzi wa gulu ndi kulumikizana ndi anthu ndi chimodzi mwa zinthu zomwe tonse timafuna ndipo ndikofunika kuti tonse timapeza izi munjira zosiyanasiyana," atero a Espinola.
"So, places like third places can allow us to do that." 	"Kotero malo achitatu amatilola kuchita zimenezi."
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.  	Kalekale, tchalitchi ndi nyumba zopemphelera zinali malo achitatu kwa anthu ambiri a ku America.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place — a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.  	Mu 2019, anthu 67 pa 100 aliwonse omwe anafufuzidwa anapeza kuti ali ndi malo achitatu- malo ogulitsira khofi, malo omwela mowa, malo odyera, malo ochezera kapena malo ena aliwonse m'dera lawo omwe amapitako kawirikawiri.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.   	Nambalayi inatsika mu 2021 kufika pa anthu 56 pa 100 aliwonse- nambala yomwe inatsika kamba ka mliri wa COVID-19.
"What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community," says Cox. "They're much more likely to engage in other activities there.  	"Tinapeza kuti anthu omwe ali ndi malo achitatu anali olumikizana ndi dera lawo," anatero a Cox. "Ali ndi kuthekera kochita nawo zinthu zina kumeneko."
They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."   	Amakhulupilira anthu okhala nawo pafupi. Pali ndandanda wa zotsatira zabwino zokhudza ubale zomwe zimalumikizana ndi kukhala ndi malo achitatu…ndipo kwa anthu ambiri a ku America, malowa ndi malo ogulitsira khofi kapena malo omwera.
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.  	Ubwino wa malo ogulitsira khofi ndi woti malowa amapezeka kulokonse m'dzikomo ndipo aliyense amene akufuna akhoza kupitako kawirikawiri.
And many are open most days of the week.   	Ambiri mwa iwo amatsegula masiku ambiri a mkati mwa sabata.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.   	A Cox ati kukumana kwa nthawi yochepa ku malo ogulitsira khofi kukhoza kupititsa patsogolo mtima wodziwa kuti ndiwe m'modzi mwa gulu.
"I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential," Cox says.  	"Ndikuona ngati pali kuthekera, kuthekera komwe sikunazindikiridwe," atero a Cox.
"But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there.  	"Koma kutengera ndi zomwe angathe kuchita, pali zambiri pamenepo.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.  	Ndapitako ku malo kome gulu lomwelo la anthu limapita kukachita masewera a chess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees. … They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other. … I don't know where else they would have gone — maybe a church, but maybe not — to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.  	Kapena ali ndi gulu la anthu omasuka omwe anapuma ntchito…Amakumana, kuyankhulana, kucheza ndi kusangalala wina ndi mnzake….Sindikudziwa ngati pali kwina komwe akanatha kupita- mwina ku tchalitchi, mwina ayi- kukagawana uthenga, kulimbikitsana kutenga gawo pa zochitika .
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops." 	Ndipo ndikuganiza kuti izi ndi zomwe zili mphamvu ya malo ogulitsira khofi.
	
	
What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic 	Zomwe mafumu a mizinda ku U.S akudandaula ukatha mliri
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021. 	Mafumu a mizinda ku U.S ndiwokhudziwa ndi kutsalira kwa zotsatira za mliri wa COVID-19 pa maganizo a anthu, kutengera ndi kafukufuku wa mafumu a mizinda 126, yemwe anachitika m'dzikolo mu nyengo yotentha mu 2021.
The respondents headed cities with at least 75,000 residents. The local leaders are still focused on traditional issues such as violent crime, the economy and infrastructure, but they are most concerned about the pandemics long-term impact on the mental health of their constituents. 	Oyankhawa amatsogolera mizinda ya anthu pafupifupi 75,000. Atsogoleri a madera ang'ono-ang'ono akanali ndi chidwi pa nkhani monga milandu ya ziwawa, zachuma ndi zomangamanga, koma iwo akukhudzidwa ndi zotsatira za nthawi yaitali za mliri pa maganizo a anthu a misinkhu yonse m'madera awo.
Mental health was top of mind for Michael Udine when he was sworn in as mayor of Broward County, Florida, in November 2021. 	Thanzi labwino lokhudza maganizo ndilo linali patsogolo pa maganizo a Michael Udine pamene ankalumbira kukhala mfumu ya mzinda wa Broward County, ku Florida, mu Novembala, 2021.
"Everything that was a potential issue pre-pandemic has pretty much been exacerbated by the pandemic," he says. "There were issues going into the pandemic, and it was becoming more and more important on everyone's radar screen about the mental health of people of all ages. And I think the pandemic pretty much supercharged those issues." 	"Chilichonse chomwe chinali ndikuthekera kokhala vuto mliri usanabwere, zapitilira kukhala mavuto aakulu kamba ka mliriwu," iwo atero. "Panali mavuto pamene mliri unayamba, ndipo kunali kofunikira kuti aliyense azindikire ubwino wa thanzi labwino pa maganizo a anthu a misinkhu yonse. Ndikuganiza kuti mliriwu unawonjezera mavuto amenewa."
It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic. 	Sizachilendo kuti kufala kwa matenda kukhale ndi zotsatira pa maganizo a anthu, kutengera ndi lipoti lomwe bungwe loona za matenda ndi kupewa kwake la Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lapereka, loti chiwerengero cha nkhawa ndi kukhumudwa pakati pa anthu akuluakulu chakwera panthawi ya mliriwu.
The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth. 	Mliriwu wawononganso maganizo ndi thanzi lokhudza maganizo a theka la achinyamata ku America.
"What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions," Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month. "We've also seen a lot more sadness and depression." 	"Zomwe taona ndi nkhawa zokha, kwa ana omwe samaoneka okhumudwa kale, koma chifukwa cha kusintha kwakukulu,ndizovuta kuzolowera kusintha kwa zinthu," woona za maganizo ku Maryland, a Mary Karapetian Alvord anawuza VOA mwezi watha. "Tawonanso chisoni ndi kukhumudwa kwambiri."
Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors. 	Kumayambiliro kwa mliriwu, mafumu a mizinda anali ndi chidwi pa zochitika m'mizinda, mavuto a ndondomeko za chuma komanso chiopsezo chomwe mliriwu umabweretsa pa malonda ang'ono ang'ono, kutengera ndi zomwe anena a David Glick, wothandiza kuphunzitsa zandale ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Boston komanso analemba nawo kafukufuku wa Menno Survey of Mayors mu 2021.
"Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 … is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents," Glick says. "Concerns about polarization over vaccines and just people being pushed to their limits … and certainly less on their city budgets and revenues and having to cut programs and some of those types of things that were probably more top of mind earlier in the pandemic." 	"Zodandaulitsa zikanalipo koma zomwe tinaona mu 2021…ndi kukhudzidwa ndi zotsatira zanthawi yaitali pa anthu okhala okha," atero a Glick. "Kukhudzidwa ndi kugawanika pa nkhani ya katemera komanso kupanikizidwa kwa anthu…Izi zachititsa kusiya kulabadira kwenikweni za ndondomeko yachuma cha mzinda ndi misonkho komanso kusiya kuchita zinthu zomwe zinali patsogolo kumayambiliro kwa mliriwu. 
Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about "lingering mental health challenges and trauma," according to the survey. Additionally, more than one-third of mayors, 37%, are worried about learning loss among young people. 	Kafukufuku wati mafumu a mizinda 52 pa 100 aliwonse akudandaula za "kutsalira kwa mavuto a mmaganizo ndi mantha obwera kamba ka zochitika zam'mbuyo." Kuwonjezera apo, theka la mafumu a mizinda lomwe ndi 37 pa 100 aliwonse, akudandaula za kusiya kuphunzira kwa achinyamata. 
"Second only to mental health and trauma, and they're probably not totally independent concerns," Glick says. "It is part of that shift of mayors concerns from immediate threats to businesses closing and people getting sick, to some of these longer-term consequences that are going to persist in the future. And learning loss among their students, theyre worried it's going to persist for many, many, many years into the future. It's hard to make up for." 	"Chachiwiri kwa mavuto a mmaganizo ndi mantha obwera kamba ka zochitika zam'mbuyo, ndipo sizokhudza kwenikweni," atero a Glick. "Ndi gawo la kusintha kwa zokhudza mafumu a mzinda kuchoka pa ziopsezo zotseka malonda komanso kudwala kwa anthu kufika pa zotsatira za nthawi yaitali zomwe zidzakhalepobe mtsogolo. Kusiya sukulu kwa ophunzira, kukudandaulitsa zomwe zidzachitike kwa zaka zochuluka zomwe zikubwera kutsogolo. Ndizovuta kubwezeretsa."
According to the survey, other top concerns for Americas mayors include the financial insecurity of low-income residents (33%), the closing of small businesses (29%) and increased crime and violence (26%). 	Kafukufuku wati, zina zomwe akudandaula mafumu a mizinda ndi kusowa kwa chuma kwa anthu amene amapeza ndalama zochepa omwe ndi anthu 33 pa 100 aliwonse, kutseka malonda ang'ono angono' omwe ndi 29 pa 100 aliwonse, komanso kuchuluka kwa ziwawa ndi 26%.
Just 7% of mayors are worried about the shift to remote work and the long-term impact that could have on outmigration — people moving away from their cities. 	Mafumu a mizinda 7 pa 100 aliwonse ndi omwe akudandaula za kusintha kogwilira ntchito kutali komanso zotsatira za nthawi yaitali zomwe zingakhudze kusamuka-anthu kuchoka mmizinda yawo.
The $350 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to local and state governments could help mayors address some of their concerns. The survey found that 78% of mayors believe the money will allow them to make meaningful change. 	Thandizo la ndalama zokwana 350 biliyoni U.S Dollars lochoka ku bungwe la American Rescue Plan kwa ma boma ang'ono ang'ono ndi ma boma aakulu, likhoza kuthandiza mafumu a mmizinda kuthana ndi ena mwa mavuto awo. Kafukufuku anapezanso kuti mafumu a mmizinda 78 pa 100 aliwonse amakhulupilira kuti ndalama ziwathandiza kusintha zinthu.
"What we're seeing is a large majority are using it for things they consider to be transformative and will make major changes to their cities," Glick says, "instead of feeling obligated or feeling the necessity to use it to plug up over-budget gaps to keep the doors open and the lights on." 	"Zomwe tikuwona ndi zoti, ambiri mwa iwo akugwiritsa ntchito ndalamazi pa zinthu zomwe akuganiza kuti zikhoza kusintha mizinda yawo," anatero a Glick, "mmalo moona ngati akuyenera kugwiritsa ntchito ndalamazi kuwonjezera ndondomeko yachuma kuti zitseko zikhalebe zotsegula komanso magetsi oyaka."
	
	
Young Compete Against Old in Hottest US Rental Market in a Decade 	Achinyamata akupikisana ndi akulu pa msika wochita lendi nyumba ku U.S mu zaka khumi
Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials — people aged 24 to 40 — and even baby boomers — the over-57 club. 	Kupeza nyumba yochita lendi kukhoza kukhala vuto makamaka kwa omwe amaliza kumene maphunziro awo a ukachenjede pomwe akumana ndi msika wochititsa lendi ku U.S mu zaka khumi, pamodzi ndi mpikisano womwe sanawuyembekezere ndi anthu obadwa mu zaka za pakati pa 1981 ndi 1996, zaka 24 mpaka 40- komanso anthu opitilira zaka 57 omwe anabadwa nkhondo yachiwiri yadziko lonse litatha.
"You have aging millennials who are creating families who should be moving from rental situations into ownership but, because of the lack of housing supply, that has been stopped in a lot of instances. And so, what you see is the aging millennial population continues to rent," says Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi-Matrix, a commercial real estate data and research firm. 	"Tili ndi anthu a zaka zakubadwa za pakati pa 24 ndi 40, omwe ali ndi mabanja ndipo amayenera kusiya kupanga lendi ndi kukhala ndi nyumba zawo, koma kuchepa kwa nyumba ndikomwe kwaletsa izi. Choncho anthu a zaka zapakati pa 24 ndi 40 akukula pamodzi ndi chiwerengero chawo ndipo akupitiliza kuchita lendi," anatero a Doug Ressler,mkulu wa malonda ku Yardi-Matrix, kampani yogulitsa nyumba komanso yofufuza.
"It's not just about millennials, it's not just about [Gen] Z [people under 24], we also see that boomers are making a transition, he added. "Their percentage of moving into rental properties is growing in the last five years." 	"Sizokhudza anthu a zaka 24 mpaka 40 okha ndi [Gen] Z omwe ndi anthu a zaka zosapitilira 24, tikuwonanso kuti anthu a zaka zoposa 57 nawonso akusintha, iwo anawonjezera. "Chiwerengero chawo cholowa m'nyumba za lendi chakhala chikukwera mu zaka zisanu zapitazo."
There are a variety of reasons older people are opting for rentals, according to Ressler. 	A Ressler ati palii zifukwa zosiyanasiyana zomwe zikupangitsa anthu achikulire kusankha kukhala pa lendi.
"They've lived in a home for so long and they want to be able to reduce their expenses on a fixed income," he says. "They want to live in a social cohort, like a retirement community, and things like that where it's much more socially amenable to them." 	"Akhala ku malo osamalira anthu achikulire kwa nthawi yaitali kotero akufuna kuchepetsa ndalama zogwiritsa ntchito kuchoka ku ndalama zomwe amalandira," iwo anatero. Akufuna kukhala pamodzi ndi anthu, malo apawokha, ndi ena otero komwe akhoza kukhala bwino."
The asking price of apartment rentals was up 10.7% in September 2021 compared to last year at the same time, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). 	Bungwe logulitsa nyumba la National Assembly of Realtors (NAR), lati mtengo wochitira lendi unakwera ndi 10.7% mu September kusiyana ndi nthawi yomweyo chaka chatha.
"It's a hot market. We have never seen this market so hot in the last decade," says Gay Cororaton, NARs senior economist and director of housing and commercial research. "The average rent growth, year-over-year, is about 3-to-5%. We're seeing 11% rent growth now, so, clearly, way above trends weve had in the past." 	"Ndi msika wotentha. Sitinawonepo msikawu ukuyenda chonchi mu zaka khumi zapitazo," atero a Gay Cororaton, mkulu wa zachuma komanso woyang'anira nyumba ndi kukufuza malonda. "Chiwerenegro cha ochita lendi chimakwera pachaka chilichonse ndi 3 kapena 5%. Tsopano chiwerengerochi chakwera ndi 11%, kupitilira mmene zimakhalira kale."
Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States. Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021. The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past. 	Ochita lendi apanikizika chifukwa mliri wa COVID-19 umachedwetsa kubwera kwa zinthu, zomwenso zachedwetsa kumanga nyumba ku United States. M'malo mochita ngati kale kuti pa miyezi isanu kapena isanu ndi umodzi nyumba yokhala banja limodzi imakhala yapezeka, tsopano izi zabwerera m'mbuyo ndi miyezi iwiri kuchoka mu Januwale 2021. Kusowa kwa nyumba kukutanthauza kuti anthu a zaka zapakati pa 24 mpaka 40 akuvutika kuti agule nyumba yokhala banja limodzi, ngati momwe zimachitikira m'mbuyomu.
"The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues," Cororaton says. "Shipments couldn't come in, the price of lumber was rising, manufacturing slowed, workers could not come in [to work], so you have shortages of frames, appliances. So, essentially, just a short supply." 	"Ogwira ntchito ya zomangamanga anakhudzidwa ndi mavuto opeza katundu," anatero a Cororaton. "Katundu wochoka kwina samatha kubwera, matabwa amakwera mtengo, kukonza zinthu kumachedwa, ogwira ntchito samabwera ku ntchito, mafelemu ndi zipangizo zina zinachepa. Tingoti pali zinthu zochepa."
The housing supply got even tighter during the pandemic as more investors put their money into housing, according to Cororaton, while existing homeowners looked for second homes. 	 A Cororaton ati kupeza nyumba kunavutanso nthawi ya mliri pamene anthu ambiri anagwiritsa ntchito ndalama zawo pomanga nyumba pamene anthu omwe ali ndi nyumba kale amayang'ana nyumba zachiwiri.
"With the pandemic, there was also a big demand for second homes, for vacation homes. Typically, vacation homes accounted for just about 5% [of the market]," she says. "Early this summer they rose to about 8%. So again, strong demand and strong imbalance of demand and supply caused home prices to rise, made them less affordable." 	"Malingana ndi mliriwu, chiwerengero cha anthu ofuna nyumba zachiwiri kapena nyumba zokapumulako, chinachuluka. Nthawi zambiri, nyumba zopumulirako zimakwanitsa 5% ya msika," iwo anatero. "Kumayambiliro kwa nyengo yotentha ino panali kukwera ndi 8%. Choncho kukula kwa chiwerengero cha anthu ofuna nyumba ndi kusagwirizana kwa chiwerengero cha wogula ndi wogulitsa ndi komwe kwapangitsa kuti mitengo ya nyumba ikwere, kuchititsa kuti anthu ena akanike kugula.
The hottest rental markets right now are in the West and South. More renters are moving to Dallas and Houston in Texas, followed by Atlanta, Georgia; New York; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington, D.C., according to NAR. 	NAR yati misika yochititsa lendi yomwe ikuyenda kwambiri panopa ndi ya kumadzulo ndi ku m'mwera. Ambiri ofuna kuchita lendi akusamukila ku Dallas ndi ku Houston, ku Texas, motsatizana ndi Atlanta ku Georgia; New York ku Los Angeles, Austin ku Texas; Phoenix ku Arizona ndi Washington, D.C.
Cororaton expects the coming year to be a little better but says the housing shortage is likely to continue for the next few years. 	A Cororaton akuyembekeza kuti mu chaka chikubwerachi zinthu zikhalako bwino koma kuchepa kwa nyumba kupitilirabe  kwa zaka zingapo mtsogolomu.
"You know, the old adage of moving from rentals into homeownership, that whole polemic may be changing," says Ressler. "The sweet spot was always the millennials, and now the millennials are being replaced by the [Gen] Zs, but the millennials are staying longer and the Zs are coming on board, and now you've got the demographic of the boomers … What it means is a very profitable and dynamic [rental] market that's going to continue to grow." 	"Mukudziwa kuyankhula kwakale koti kuchoka pa lendi ndi kukhala mwini nyumba, maganizo amenewa mwina akusintha," atero a Ressler. "Omwe amakonda kuchita lendi kale anali anthu a zaka zapakat pa 24 mpaka 40, koma anabwezeretsedwa ndi [Gen] Z, omwe ndi anthu a zaka zosaposera 24.

Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems? 	Kodi ziletso za COVID-19 zikuchepetsa kukula kwa chitetezo mmatupi mwa ana?
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.   	Akatswiri a zaumoyo ena asonyeza kukhudzidwa ponena kuti njira zopewera COVID-19, monga kuvala zotchinga kukamwa ndi kuphunzilira pa intaneti, ndi zomwe zikufooketsa chitetezo cha mmatupi mwa ana chifukwa ana sakudwalanso matenda oyenera kudwala pa umwana wawo.
"There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things," says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.   	"Pali zifukwa zambiri zopangitsa kukhulupilira kuti ana amayenera kuyikidwa poyera ku zinthu kuti chitetezo chawo cha mnthupi chilimbe mu njira zosiyanasiyana, kuti akadzakumana ndi zina zoopsa, adzakhale ndi mbali ina ya chitetezo chawo cha mnthupi yomwe idzathandize kuwateteza ku zinthu zimenezi," anatero a Sara Sawyer, polofesa tinthu tosaoneka, maselo ndi zinthu zamoyo ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.  	Pobadwa, makanda opanda chitetezo chilichonse amatenga chitetezo kuchoka ku mkaka wa mmawere wa amayi awo omwe umawateteza kufikira nthawi yomwe adzakhale ndi chitetezo chawo.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.  "They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.  	Sikuti ndi ngozi kuti ana amayamba kuyika chilichonse mkamwa mwawo pamene ayamba kutha kugwira zinthu. "Amachita izi chifukwa amakhala akuzindikira malo omwe awazungulira komanso kumanga chitetezo chawo cha mnthupi. Uku ndiye kusintha," a Sawyer anatelo.
"Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity.  	"Sakubisa thupi lawo kwa tizilombo toyambitsa matenda, mwa njira ina akumanga chitetezo cha mnthupi mwawo.
So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things." 	Anthu ena akhoza kunena kuti matenda a ku umwana monga chimfine, kuwawa kwa m'mimba zimamanga chitetezo mnthupi kuti zinthu zina zoopsa zikadzabwera, zidzapeze kuti takonzeka ndipo sitingadwale ndi zinthu zimenezi.
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.  	Ngakhale nthawi imene mliri unali usanabwere, sayansi yoona za kufala ndi kupewa matenda, inachitira umboni kuti ana a m'mayiko otukuka, komwe amasamba mmanja komanso kugwiritsa ntchito mankhwala ophera tizilombo toyambitsa matenda pafupipafupi, atha kukhala ndi chitetezo chofooka mnthupi kusiyana ndi ana a m'mayiko omwe akutukuka kumene omwe amakhala poyera ndi tizilombo toyambitsa matenda komanso kudwala kamba kodana ndi zinthu.
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."   	Izi zimapangitsa ana a m'mayiko otukuka kudwala matenda omwe thupi limayambitsa lokha kutengera ndi kafukufuku wa ukhondo wotchedwa, "hygiene hypothesis."
"The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor," says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.  	Kafukufuku wa ukhondo, hygiene hypothesis, amabweretsa maganizo osiyanasiyana pomwe ena amati kukhala osabisika ku tizilombo toyambitsa matenda si chifukwa chokha," anatero a Cody Warren, wowona za tizilombo toyambitsa matenda komanso chitetezo mnthupi yemwe anali dotolo wa ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Colorado Boulder.
"A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in.  	"Zambiri mwa izi zikhoza kudziwika potengera chibadwa, zakudya ndi malo amene atizungulira.
That also shapes our immune system… it's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.  	Izi zimawumbanso chitetezo chathu chamnthupi…pali zinthu zambiri zomwe sitingathane nazo pongovala zotchinga kukamwa.
There are other things that go into that equation." 	Palinso zinthu zina zokhudzana nazo."
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.   	A Warren, omwe ali ndi ana aangono atatu, ati kukhala nthawi yaitali panja ndi njira imodzi yothana ndi zotsatira za kudzipatula.
"Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system," Warren says. "Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.  	"Kufufuza tizilombo m'malo omwe atizungulira ndikofunika komanso kumalimbitsa chitetezo chathu cha mnthupi," anatero a Warren. "Chitetezo cha mnthupi chimalimba kudzera mu zakudya zomwe timadya, zomwenso zimakhala ndi tizilombo.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up." 	Choncho, ngakhale kuti tasimphina pang'ono, chitetezo chathu cha mnthupi chibwelera."
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.  "One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines.  	Pali zinthu zina zomwe makolo angachite pofuna kukweza chitetezo cha mnthupi mwa ana awo munthawi ya mliri. "Imodzi mwa zinthu zofunika kuchita ndi kulandira katemela watsopano aliyense."
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.  	Iyi ndi njira yabwino kwambiri yolimbitsa chitetezo mmatupi mwathu," anatero a Warren.
"But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.  	"Koma njira ina yofunikanso ndi kuwonetsetsa kuti ana athu akudya zakudya zopatsa thanzi komanso amachotsa nkhawa.
It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system." 	Zatsimikizika kuti njira zonsezi- kudya zakudya zopatsa thanzi komanso kukhala malo opanda nkhawa- zili ndi ubwino pa chitetezo chathu cha mnthupi."
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.   	Adindo a zaumoyo akadzanena kuti kuvala zotchinga kukamwa sikofunikiranso, a Sawyer akuganiza kuti kufotokoza ubwino wosiya kovala zotchinga kukamwa kukhoza kulimbikitsa makolo ozengereza omwe amadandaula kuti ana awo akhoza kudwala.
"Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses," she says.  	"Mwina tidzayankhulane ndi anthu za zifukwa zosiyira kuvala zotchinga kukamwa, ngati ali kusukulu, ndi kubwelera ku moyo wakale wodwala matenda osaopsa osiyanasiyaan a umwana," iwe anatero.
"The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids against new things that then come along." 	"Ubwino wa matenda a ubwana ndi woti ukhoza kumanga chisa cha chitetezo cha mnthupi chomwe chingateteze ana ku zinthu zatsopano zomwe zingabwere."
	
	
US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them 	Boma la America  laonjezela malire osungira anthu othawa mavuto mu dzikolo pamene likukonzekera kuthetsa kutero.
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday. 	Utsogoleri wa a Biden wayamba kusamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua kupita  ku Mexiico potsatira mphamvu zokhudzana ndi  mliri mu njira yowakanizira anthu othawa maiko awo  kukhala mdzikolo, kukulitsa ntchito ya lamulori mmene anafotokozera poyera pamene akuyesera kulithetsa, akukuakulu anatero lachitatu.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort. 	Dziko la United States linapanga mgwirizano ndi dziko la Mexico wotulutsa  anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua tsiku lilironse kuchokera ku San Diego, El Paso, Texas ndi Rio Grande Valley, malinga ndi mkulu wa dziko la U.S yemwe akudziwa za mchitidwewu.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.  	Kuthamangitsidwaku, kunayamba pa 27 April ndipo kudzatha pa 22 mwezi wa May. Mkulu wa bomayu  anauza a zofalitsa nkhani kuti iwo asadziwike chifukwa mgwilizanowu siunalengezedwe poyera.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes. 	Izi zikuchitika pansi pa mutu 42, lamulo la zaumoyo lomwe likugwilitsidwa ntchito kutulutsa anthu osamuka mmaiko awo pazifukwa zopewera kufala kwa matenda a Covid-19' Mutu 42 utha ntchito mu mwezi wa Meyi, pokhapokha  oweruza atalowelera.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.  	Maiko America ndi Mexico  pa 26 mwezi wa Epulo zothamangitsa anthu owerengeka a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua, malinga ndi mkulu wogwira ntchito ku Mexico amene anayankhula mobisika chifukwa samaloledwa kupereka ndemanga poyera.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border. 	Izi zinachitika chifukwa cha kuchuluka kwa anthu osamuka kuchokera ku maiko awiriwa  kubwe ku malire a dziko la America.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans. 	Dziko la Mexico linazindikira kuti boma la America linayambanso kukonza ziphaso zokhalira mdzikolo ku Cuba,  anatero akuluakuluwo. Boma la Mexico linali litayambanso kupangira anthu a ku Cuba ziphaso zokhalira mu dzikomo.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42. 	Mkulu winanso wa boma  wa dziko la Mexico amene sanaloledwenso kupereka ndemanga poyera, anatsimikiza kuti anthu makumi khumi a ku Cuba ndi makumi awiri a ku Nicaragua anathamangitsidwa kuchokera ku San Diego pansi pa mutu 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 	Unduna owona za chikhalidwe cha anthu ndi chitetezo  sunaperekepo ndemanga mwachangu monga mwa pempho.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries. 	Kuchokera sabata latha, Boma la Mexico linavomera kutenga anthu a ku Guatemala, Hondura, ndi ku El Salvadora poonjezerapo anthu a ku Mexico pansi pa mutu 42. Maiko enanso ali pansi pa mutuwu koma kamba ka chuma, kupsyinjika kwa mgwirizano wa maiko ndi zifukwa zina ndizomwe zikuvutitsa kuwabweza ku maiko akwao.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States. 	Ndizosatheka ku Boma la America kubweza anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ku maiko akwawo chifukwa cha ubale osakhala bwino omwe uli pakati pa mabomawa. Izi zinayambita mavuto mu utsogoleri wa a Biden pamene anthu ambiri ochokera mu maikowa amafuna kuti akakhale pabwino ku America ko.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas. 	anthu a ku Cuba anaimitsidwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera kokwana 32,000 pa malire a dziko la Mexico mu mwezi wa Malichi, kuonjezera nambalayi kawiri mu mwezi wa Febuluwale ndi kuposa kasanu mu chiwerengero cha mwezi wa Okotobala, malinga ndi  a chitetezo ndi oyendetsa katundu pa malire  a dziko la America. Boma la Nicaragua linakhwefula malamulo a mayendedwe kochokera ku Cuba mu mwezi wa Novembala zomwe zinapangitsa anthu a ku Cuba kupitilila ndikukafika ku malire a boma la America. Ambiri mwa iwo amalowa dziko la America kudzera kapena kuyandikila malo a ku Yuma, Arizona ndi ku Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas. 	Mu mwezi  wa Malichi anthu a ku Nicaragua analetsedwa ndi akuluakulu a ku America koposera ka 16000, kumene kunaposa mwezi wa September kawiri . Ambiri mwaiwo amalowa ku mmwera kwa dera la ku  Texas.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years. 	kuchotsa mutu 42 kwakhala kotsutsana pamene pakati pa nthawi yochita masankho yayandikira, ngakhalenso ku Chipani cha mtsogoleri Biden, pakati pa kukhudzidwa kwa boma la America kuti silili lokonzeka kuonjezera chiwerengero cha anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko lawo kufuna pokhala. Akuluakulu aboma analetsa anthu ofuna kulowa mdziko koposera ka 221,000 mu mwezi wa March imene ili nambala yaikulu kuchokera mu zaka makumi awiri ndi ziwiri zapitazo.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health. 	Nyumba ya chifumu ya ku America ndi unduna woona za chittezo ndi chikhalidwe yaima pambuyo chiganizo cha unduna  ochepetsa ndi kupewa matenda chothetsa lamulo chifukwa silinathenso kuthandizo komanso kuteteza pa za umoyo.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23. 	Koma mchitidwe wosamutsa  anthu a ku Cuba ndi Nicaragua ukutsutsana ndi ndemanga zomwe atsogoleri  amapereka poyera pothetsa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka mphamvu za mliri pokonzekera pa 23 mwezi wa Meyi.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home. 	Boma la America lasamutsa anthu 1.8 million olowa mu dzikolo pansi pa mutu  42 kuchokera mu mwezi wa march mu chaka cha 2020, Kupitilira ufulu wofuna pokhala pansi pa lamulo la ku America ndi pangano lapadziko lonse. Potero, anthu osamukasamuka  sakukhudzidwa ndi lamulo losamuka lomwe limakamba za ufulu ofuna kutetezedwa ku kuzunzika kwawo.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect. 	Mu zolemba za ku khoti utsogoleriwo unati unayamba kukonza kwambiri mapepala a anthu achikulire a pakati pa dziko la America pansi pa malamulo a kusamuka patatha zolengeza za bungwe la CDC's pa ! Epulo. Koma oweruza milandu sabata yatha analamulira kuti sakanatha kumasula mutu 42 pamene unali ukugwira ntchitobe.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments. 	Oweluza milandu wa boma la America a Robert Summerhays anadzudzula maganizo a bungwe la CDS pamene anapereka maganizo ot ayesera kuti mutu 42 uzigwilabe ntchito mpakana tsiku la 23 mwezi wa Meyi. Kokamba mulanduwu kudzachitika pa 13 may.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials. 	A Marisa Limon, mkulu woyang'anila kulimbikitsa ndi kukonzekera ku Bungwe lotchedwa, Hope Border Institute , anati olimbikitsawa anayamba kudziwa za kusamutsidwa kwa anthu a ku Cuba ndi ku Nicaragua kuchokera kwa El Paso lolemba ndipo anatsimikiza mchitidwe watsopanowu ndi akuluakulu a boma la America.
Limon said the administration is "trying to get every last bit out of Title 42" before it expires. She called it "sobering" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes. 	A Limon anati  utsogoleri wawo ukuyesetsa kudziwa mapeto onse a mutu 42 usanasiye kugwira ntchito. Iwo anaufotokoza kuti ndi wanzeru koma pakuyenera kuti atsogoleri aziikilako khama kuti maiko ena a kumadzulo kwa dziko lapansi akhalenso ndi udindo wosunga anthu othawa kwawo.
	
	
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border 	Boma la Mexico lasamutsa misasa ya anthu osamukira mu dzikolo; anthu aku  Haiti aonekera pa malire a dziko.
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas. 	Akuluakulu a boma la Mexico lachiwiri amati asamutsa msasa wa  anthu olowa mu dzikolo omwe unatulukira ku ndime  mu mzinda wa malirewo wa  Reynosa,  asuntha pafupifupi anthu mazana awiri kuchoka pakati pa Boma la america ndi Haiti kupita ku malo  ena owasungilako  kuolokera ku malire ochokera ku McAllen Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum. 	Malo okhala anthu osamukila dzikolo makamaka ochokera ku dziko la Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras ndi ku Haiti kunachuluka anthu pamene akuluakulu a boma la America  anabweretsa lamulo la zaumoyo loletsa anthu osamukira mu dzikolo kupeza mwayi wopatsidwa chitetezo chifukwa cha mliri.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services. 	Bungwe loona zolowa ndi kutuluka kwa anthu mu dziko la Mexico lotchedwa ( Mexico's Immigration Institute linati  anthuwo anatengedwa lolemba pakati pa usiku kupita ku malo owasungilawo amene akuyenera kukhala a ukhondo komanso chakudya chabwino.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas 	Lolemba lomwelo anthu ochokera ku malire a dziko a ku Nuevo Laredo anafotokoza kuti anthu opitilira makumi khumi makamaka a dziko la Haiti anakhamikira mu mzindawo umene uli mbali yoyang'anana ndi malire a dzikolo kochokera ku Laredo, Texas
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there. 	Kukhamikilako kunayamba pamene boma la America linayamba ndondomeko yopereka chitetezo kwa anthu othawira mu dzikolo.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents. 	Mkulu wa mpingo wa katolika wa ku Nuevo, lolemba apati malo okhalako anthu osamukila mu dzikolo  ndi othinana pamene anthu ena akugona panja pa misanja.
Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel. 	A Bishopu Enrique Sanchez Martínez anati anthuwa anayamba kulowera ku Nuevo Laredo ku mapeto kwa mwezi wa Epulo, ngakhale mzindawo sudziwika kwambiri ndi anthu ochokera maiko ena, chifukwa unadzadzidwa ndi zigawenga za ku Northeast drug carte
"It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants," the bishop said. "But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups." 	‘Izi ndi zachilendo kwa ife chifukwa awa ndi malo omalizira amene iwo sangabwereko, chifukwa cha mkhalidwe wa  malire dziko lathu, mu mzinda wathu umene umatsutsana ndi anthu osamukila mu dzikoli” anatero mkulu wansembeyo. Koma chifukwa a Boma la America linatsekula khomo lopereka chitetezo ndi malo kwa anthu othawira mdzikolo, ambiri mwaiwo anabwera mwa unyinji.
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons. 	A Marvin Ajic, mkulu wa malo osungira anthu a ku Casa Nazareth anati pa 16 Epulo, akuluakulu a boma la Mexico anadziwitsa anthu a ku malo osungidwawo kuti boma a America liyamba  ndondomeko yothandiza anthu othawira dzikolo pa zifukwa zothandizila anthu.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date. 	Boma la America linali litayamba kulowetsa anthu mdzikolo makamaka akuluakulu a pakati pa dziko la America pokonzekera kuchotsa mutu 42, lamulo la nthawi ya mliri limene limakaniza anthu kusamukira mdziko la America kufuna chitetezo. Pa 23 Meyi, oweruza milandu wa ku Louisiana sabata yatha analamula kuti boma silingathetse lamulolo tsiku lane lisanakwane.
"The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone," Ajic said. 	Akuluakulu oona zolowa ndi kutuluka mdziko la Mexico anakonza zinthu ndi malo osungilako anthuwo,  ndondomeko yawo inali yotumiza  kwawo anthu omwe amadikilira kwa nthawi yaitali opanda kusechedwa makamaka aliyense, anatero a Ajic.
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians. 	Izi zinakoka mitima ya anthu ena ofuna kulowa mdzikolo kuonjezerapo achokera ku Haiti.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S. 	Mwezi wa september, phekesera ngati zomwezi zinachititsa anthu othawa nwawo okwana  15,000 a ku Haiti kupita ku malire a dzikolo a  ku Texas kumene anamangako misanja pansi pa mlatho. Akuluakulu a boma la America anayamba kubweza  kwawo gulu la anthu a ku Haiti pamene ena  mazana mazana analoledwa kukhala mu dziko la America lo.
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo. 	Ajic anachenjeza anthu ofuna kusamukira mu dzikolo kudzera ku malire a dziko la America poona zoopsa zake. Lolemba, oona za kulowa ndi kutuluka mdziko la Mexico anati chaka chino, achotsa matupi a anthu khumi ndi asanu ndi anayi kuchokera ku Rio Grande komwenso kumadziwika kuti Rio Bravo.
	
	
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens 	lamulo latsopano la ku America likupereka nthawi yoonjezera ziphaso zogwilira ntchito mu dzikomo kwa anthu amene ndi ochokera maiko ena payokha.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times. 	Ogwira ntchito yöpereka ziphaso ndi oona zolowa ndi kutuluka mdzikomp lachiwiri analengeza kuti aonjezera pawokha masiku 360 ololeza anthu osamukira mdzikolo kugwirabe ntchito  kamba ka kuchedwa kulongosola mapepala komwe kukuchitika.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November. It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months. It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement. 	Chidziwitso chatsopanochi  chaonjezera pa masiku 180  amene a bungwe USCIS analengeza mu mwezi wa Novembala. Izi zikuyembekezeka kupewetsa anthu osamukira mdzikolo okwana 260,000 kutaya ziphaso zawo zogwilira ntchito mdzikolo kwa miyezi 18 yomwe ikubwerayi. Izinso zipereka nthawi yokwanira ku nthambiyo kuti ilongosole ndandanda wa anthu omwe akudikilira kuthandizidwa, nthambiyo inatero.
"This temporary rule will provide those noncitizens otherwise eligible for the automatic extension an opportunity to maintain employment and provide critical support for their families while avoiding further disruption for U.S. employers," USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said in a statement. 	Mu kufotokoza kwawo bwana wa bungwe la  USCIS a Ur M. Haddou anati lamulo lakanthawi kochepali lipereka mwayi kwa anthu emene sali mnzika za  mdzikolo kuti akhalebe akugwira ntchito mdzikolo kuti azithandizabe mabanja awo pamene akupewa kusokoneza ogwira ntchito a boma la America
	
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S. 	Kuonjezera nthawi ku komwe kuyambe kugwira ntchito lachitatu, kukhazikitsa  kagwiridwe ntchito ka anthu  a boma la America komanso kuthandiza anthu a ku  America amene ndi ovomelezeka  kugwira ntchito mu dzikolo komanso ali pa ndandanda wodikilira kulembedwa ntchito.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork. In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls. 	USCIS ndi nthambi yomwe imayang’anira mapepala onse a anthu olowa ndi kutuluka mdzikomo. zaka zapitazo nthambiyi yakhala ikubwelera mmbuyo, mliri wa covid-19 ndi vuto la ndondomeko zachuma ndikomwe kunaonjezera kubwelera mmbuyoku.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization. 	Mwezi wa epulo a Jaddou anauza boma la America ku msonkhano wawo kuti a USCIS anali ndi milanduyodikila kuweruzidwa yokwana 8.5 million, kuonjezerapo ya anthu ofuna kupeza chiphaso chokhalira mdzikomo cha green card, ndi ena ofuna kutsimikiza kuti anabadwira mdzikomo.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times. 	Iwo anati kupitilira theka la milanduyi yodikira kuzengedwayi  inatenga nthawi yaitali  nthawi yomwe nthambiyi imagwira nthawi zonse.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension. 	Anthu othawa mavuto mmaiko awo , osamuka maiko akwawo ofuna kukhazikika mdziko la America ndi ena amene si mzika za dzikolo ndi amene akhudzidwa ndi ndondomeko yoonjezera nthawi yogwira ntchito mdzikoli.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021. 	Nthambiyi inafotokoza kuti inaonjezera nthawi kwa anthu othawa maiko akwawo kamba ka mavuto  kuchoka pa miyezi isanu ndi iwiri mu Chaka cha 2017 kufika pa miyezi khumi ndi umodzi mu Chaka cha 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing. 	Mu mwezi wa M alichi, a USCIS analengeza dongosolo lochepetsa kubwelera mmbuyo, kuonjezelaponso kakonzedwe kapamwamba ka  mapepala komwe anthu  ena atha kulipira mtengo wokwelerapo pofulumizitsa njira yokonza ziphaso zawo
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources. 	Malinga ndi bungwe la  USCIS, zambiri zomwe zinasinthidwa zinabwezeletsa njira  zingapo zomwe zinaperekedwa  utsogoleri wa a Trump usanachedwetse ndondomeko ya USCIS komanso matenda a covid-19 asanachedwetse zipangizo za nthambiyi.
"For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity. In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings," according to the USCIS statement. 	“Kwa zaka zambiri, bungwe la  USCIS lakhala ndi mavuto a zachuma ochuluka zomwe zimachedwetsa kumaliza ntchito zochuluka. Muliri wa covid-19 unakulitsanso mavuto omwe analipo kalewa mu Chaka cha 2020.  kuonjezera apo iwo sanathenso kulemba ntchito anthu ena, komanso chiopsezo chokakamizidwa kusiya ntchito kwa anthu chifukwa cha vuto la za chuma zomwe zinadzetsa kuchoka kwa anthu pa ntchito zawo. Mu Chaka cha 2021, bungwe la USCIS lisanabwelere mchimake, panali kuchuluka mwadzidzidzi kwa mapepala a anthu ofuna kulembedwa ntchito”, kuchokera ku ndemanga ya a USCIS.
The USCIS historically has been underfunded because most of the agency's funding comes from application fees that have stalled at $5 billion a year since 2019.

"The United States strongly encourages Ukrainians seeking refuge in the United States who do not have and are not eligible for a visa to seek entry via Uniting for Ukraine from Europe. This will be the safest and most efficient way to pursue temporary refuge in the United States," a DHS statement said.

Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-15 	Lipoti:  Dziko la Rwanda likuyenera kukhwepetsa malamulo mu chaka cha 2003 a zisankho za dzikolo, 2001-10-15
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide. A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility. 	 Dziko la Rwanda  lipangitsa zisankho za dzikolo koyamba patatha kuphedwa kwa anthu kwa chipulula komwe kunachitika mu Chaka cha 1994. Lipoti latsopano lati kuti dziko la Rwanda likuyenera kuchepetsa mphavu zolamulira anthu ndi cholinga choti zisankhozi zikhale zodalirika.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. 	Anthu anapepukidwa pamene chipani cha Patriotic Front chinatenga boma mu Chaka cha 1994, kuthetsa kupha kwa anthu mwaunyinji komwe kunapha ana ochepa okwana 800,000 a mtundu wa Tutsis ndi Hutus.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003. 	Boma lastopano la asilikali linalonjeza kubwezeletsa ufulu wa ndale mu dziko la Rwanda kudzera mu zisankho za chaka cha 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections. 	Ndondomeyi inayamba mwezi wa Malichi chaka chino ndi zisankho za mmaboma.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand. 	Katswiri wamkulu wa bungwe lotchedwa  International Crisis group; a Francois Grignon, bungwe lakafukufuku la ku Brussels , anati ndiwokhumudwa ndi mmene zisankho zinayendera maboma. Mr Grignon anati mavotedwewa analamuliridwa kwambiri ndipo panalibe anthu otsutsa boma amene analoledwa kuimila nawo maudindowo.
"There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities," he says. "If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all." 	“Panali kafukufuku komanso kukonzekera zisankhozo kumene sikunalole anthu ena omwe samaimila boma kupikisana nawo, makamaka oimila maudindo akuluakulu mu madera ang’onoang’ono.” Iwo anatero. “Ngati ufulu waaliyense ukutanthauza kuti kutsutsana pa ndale  kuchitika mpikisano wa zisankho usanachitike, mpaka kulepheretsa kuchitanso zisankho zenizeni, ndekuti palibe ufulu uliwonse.
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity. 	Mu lipoti latsopano lotchedwa Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, gulu lapadziko lonse loona za mavuto lapempha gulu la pa dziko lonse kuti likakamize boma la Rwanda kukhazikitsa ufulu wa ndale.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past. 	Lipotilo lapezanso kuti asilikali ndiomwe akulamulira  anthu komanso kunyoza boma, kudzera mu nyumba zofalitsa mawu kapena otsutsa boma. Boma la Rwanda latsutsa kuvomera maganizo  a anthu osiyanasiyana chifukwa izi zitha kukhala zoopsa ku dziko lomwe likufuna kukhazikika kutengera ndi kale lake loipa.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders. 	Mr Grignon anati kutsutsaku  kukumachitika mwachinsinsi kapena  kunja kwa malire a dziko la Rwanda.
"Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view," he says. "All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place," he says. 	“Anthu otsutsa boma amathawa dzikolo kapena kulowa nawo mmagulu oukila boma kunja kwa dzikolo kapena ku dziko la Congo komwe alibe mwayi wopereka maganizo ena”, iwo anatero. “Malamulo onse abwino amene boma lakhala likukhazikitsa- kuonjezerapo kulongosola zisankho, zisankho za maiko, za mtsogoleri komanso aphungu mu Chaka cha 2003- zidzasowa chilungamo chifukwa sizinakhazitsidwe pa malo ololela kupikisana kwachilungamo, iwo anatero.
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future. 	Mr. Grignon  anati ufulu womasuka utha kulimbikitsa  njira yobwelera mchimake ku dziko la Rwanda komanso kuojezera mphamvu zodzetsa tsogolo la mtendere  mdzikolo.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government. 	Iwo anati kulowelera kwa gulu lapadziko lonse mu ntchito yomanga yomwe ikuchitika, kupeleka phindu ku dziko la Rwanda.

Akuluakulu a Boma la France anamanga a Callixte Mbarushimana, mkulu wakale wa gulu la FDLR la mtundu wa Hutu amene anali oukila boma.

"It is good news that Callixte Mbarushimana has been (arrested) by the French judicial authority.

Karugarama said the Hague-based court sought the arrest of the former rebel leader who was believed to be hiding in France. 	A Karugarama anati khoti la dera la Hague ndilomwe linafuna kumanga mkulu woukira wakaleyu amene amakhulupilira kuti amabisala mu dziko la France.

UNICEF Pushes for Demobilizing Child Soliders Near Africa's Great Lakes - 2002-10-07 	Bungwe la UNICEF lalimbikitsa kwambiri kuletsa ana achisilikari oyandikila dera la  Great lakes ku Afilika- 2002-10-07
	
The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum. The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives. 	Nthambi yoona za ana ya United nations, UNICEF, likulimbikitsa kuti ana achichepere achisilikali achotsedwe ku dera la Great lakes ku Afilika, pamene mtendere ochuluka umabweretsa mphamvu. Nthambiyi inati pali chithandizo cha chuma chomwe chithandizire anawa kusiya usilikari ndi kukayambiranso moyo wawo.
UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units. "We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations. We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group. But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization," Mr. Fontaine said. 	Mkulu woona za chitetezo cha ana ku bungwe la UNICEF, a Manuel Fontaine, anati njira zobweretsa mtendere ku Uganda, Congo ndi Rwanda zikupangitsa kuthekera kowachotsa ana ochepera zaka 18 mu malo omenyera nkhondo. "Tikukakamira  kuti asilikali achichepere achotsedwe ngakhale mu nyengo za kusamvetsetsana. Sitikuyenera kudikira nthawi yomwe pali mtendere kuti anawa achotsedwe mu magulu ankhondo. koma mwachidziwikire ino ndi nthawi yoyenera pakadali pano. yowasiyitsa , anatero a Fontane. 
	
He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves. 	Iwo anati pakadali pano ana 1200 achisilikali ali ku Uganda kumenyana ndi gulu loukila la Lords Resistance. Ndipo anati kupitilira zaka 14 zapitazo gululi linagwira ana 10,000, anyamata okamenya nkhondo, atsikana okagona nawo mwaukapolo ndi mokakamiza.
According to UNICEF, The Democratic Republic of Congo still has some 10,000 children recruited to fight, while Rwanda has up to 2,000 children involved in combat. 	Kuchokera ku UNICEF, dziko la Congo lidakali ndi ana okwanira 10,000 omwe anatengedwa kukamenya nkhondo, pamene dziko la Rwanda lili ndi ana 2000 omenya nawonso nkhondo
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers. They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory. 	Bungwe la UNICEF linati ngakhale ana ena sakhudzidwa ndi kumenya nkhondo, amaonetsedwa zinthu zoopsa zambiri. Ena amagwiritsidwa ntchito ngati alonda, onyamula katundu wolemera kwambiri, otumidwa kapena a kazitape okatenga nkhani ku malo a adani awo.
Sometimes, boys, but mainly girls, are used as sex slaves. They are exposed to violence and HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The girls may become pregnant, making it harder for them to reintegrate into their communities. 	Nthawi zambiri atsikana amagwiritsidwa ntchito ya ukapolo pogona nawo. Iwo amaonetsedwa nkhanza komanso kupatsidwa matenda a HIV ndi matenda ena opatsilana pogonana. Atsikanawa amatha kutenga pakati zomwe zimakhala zovuta kwaiwo kubwelera kwawo.
UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money. He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units. Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives. That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care. 	 A Manuel Fontaine a bungwe la UNICEF anati kusiyitsa anawa usilikali kumatenga nthawi ndi ndalama. Iwo anati poyambilira anawa amayenera apezeke kaye kenako ndikuwachotsa mu magulu kapena maboma oukira omwe ali. Ndalama ndi zinthu zina zofunika tsitsi ndi tisku ndizofunika kuti ziwathandize kuyambilanso moyo wawo. monga kuwapezera sukulu yophunzilapo,ntchito za manja, komanso chisamaliro cha thanzi lawo.
"You do not want to stigmatize them and individualize them. They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited. So, you are trying to build services in those communities that are broad services, that would be made available to all those children," Mr. Fontaine said. 	"Simukuyenera kuwasala komanso kuwasiya pawokha. Iwowa akubwelera ku madera omwe kuli ana ena ambiri, amene ambiri mwaiwo akuvutika ndi zotsatira za nkhondo ngakhale sanatengedwe nawo.Ndiye chitukuko chomwe mukuyenera kuchitika mmaderamu chikuyenera kukhala chofikira aliyense, anatero a Fontane.
Mr. Fontaine says, as part of various peace packages in the Great Lakes region, the World Bank and other donors are providing $500 million to help demobilize children. He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough. He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again. 	A Fontaine anati ngati njira imodzi yobweretsera mtendere mu dera la Great lakes, banki yaikuklu dziko lonse lapansi ndi anthu ena othandiza apereka ndalama zokwana 500 million dollars zothandizira kuchotsa anawa.  Iwo anati mwatsoka mabungwe a maiko ena akuchedwa kuyendetsa ndondomekoyi mwachangu. iwo anati ndi chifukwa chake bungwe la UNICEF likufulumizitsa kumanga malowo ndi cholinga choti malo anawo abwelere kwawo ndikukayamba kukakhalanso moyo wabwinobwino.

Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes 	Anthu omenyera ufulu apempha chithandizo chothetsera mchitidwe wogwililira mu dziko la Congo.
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.  	A margot Wallstrom woimila wapadera wa bungwe la U.N ku nkhanza zogonana, ayamba ulendo watsopano wopita ku dziko la Congo, anthu awiri omenyera ufulu a dziko la America amalizitsa zokambirana kuti pakhale zotsatira pamene akuyesetsa kuthetsa mikangano yokhudza kugwililira mudziko la Congo.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace. 	A Justine Masika Bihamba anauza msonkhano ku Washington, D.C, ophunzira a sukulu ya ukachenjede ndi nzika zokhudzidwa kuti komwe amagwira ntchito iwo ku dera la North Kivu province, lidakalamuliridwabe ndi oukila boma amene amakhalira kugwililira azimayi pafupipafupi.

Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.  	A Bihamba  achita umodzi ndi bungwe lotchedwa  "mgwirizano wa azimayi pothetsa nkhanza zogonana.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work. When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.  	Alangizi a gululi aopsezedwa chifukwa cha ntchito yawo. A Bihamba ali ku ntchito tsiku lina, asilikali a ku Congo analowa mnyumba mwawo mopanda chilolezo  ndikugwililira mmodzi mwa ana awo.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.  	A Bihamba anafotokoza kuti chomwe chikufunika pazonse mu dziko la Congo ndi mtendere.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.  	Iwo anati akukhulupilira kuti milandu yokhudza mchitidwe wogwililirawu itha kutheratu kumenyana kukasiya.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.  	A  Donatella Rostagno omenyera ufula ochokera ku Europian network ya pakati pa Afilika, anawaperekeza a Bihamba pa ulendo wawo wa ku America.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.  	Iwo anati ali pambuyo pa ntchito imene akugwira woimira bungwe la UN yothetsa nkhanza ndi nkhanza zogonana.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.  	A Rostagno anati iwe akuona ngati gulu la dziko lonse sili kuchitapo ntchito yokwanira kuthetsa nkhondo ya dziko la Congo ngakhale kuli gulu la asilikali oobweretsa mtendere kudzikolo.
"The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict," said Rostagno. 	"Zotsatira za mchitidwewu ndizomwe ambiri akuona, kugwira ntchito ndi azimayi ozunzidwa, koma palibe chokwanira chomwe akuchita kuti aone zomwe zikuchititsa mchitidwe wogwililira komanso mikangano," anatero a Rostagno.
Deteriorating situation amid global concern 	Kuipiraipira kwa nyengo pakati pa kukhudzidwa padziko lonse.
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.  	Iwo akuopa kuti zomwe zikuchitika ku dziko la Congo zikunka niipira osati kukhalako bwino, ngakhale dziko lonse likuthandizapo, oukira, asilikali a mmadera ndi asilikali osagwira ntchito zawo adakapezekabe mmadera.
"A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us," said Rostagno.  	"Ambiri mwa anthu oukilawa ayamba akupanganso magulu ndi kukumananso, zomwe zikutidandaulitsa kwambiri mmadera," anatero a Rostagno.
"I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today.  	"Ife tinali ndi chiyembekezo ku dera lino miyezi isanu ndi umodzi yapitayo kusiyana ndi tsiku la lero.
"The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.  	"Bungwe la UN lapeza ma gulu ankhondo  atatu amene anagwililira mwauchifwamba anthu ochuluka miyezi iwiri yapitayo kwa sabata imodzi ku dera la Luvungi, dera lina la kumpoto kwa Kivu Province.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva. 	Amene akukhudzidwa ndi Mai Mai Cheka, a Democratic Liberation Forces a ku Rwanda, ndi  otsatira yemwe anasiya usilikali , Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.  	Omenyera ufulu a Bihamba ndi a Rostagno anapempha  kuti zisinthe komanso anapereka njira zoti zingathandize kusintha nyengoyi.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.  	A Rostagno anafotokoza kuti mabungwe amene siaboma amapeza  thandizo la ndalama zogwilira ntchito pa  nkhani ya nkhanza zogonana, pamene mabungwe aboma amaiwalidwa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.  	Iwo anati  makalata opempha thandizo lovutika  amakonderedwa ndi mabungwe akuluakulu okha.
"They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.  	"Atha kungopanga,  amatumiza, amalandira ndalama.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access," said Rostagno.Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.  	Vuto lake ndilakuti nthawi zambiri ndalamayo imagwiritsidwa kulipira mitengo yazinthu  yokhazikika ya bungwelo, malipirp a akatswiri obwera ku delaro ndi ku dzikolo, pamene mabungwe oti siaboma, amene amagwira ntchito mmadera ndi azimayi, ndi ana mmidzi, amene amafuna ndalama kuti akhale ndi moyo mmalo mogwira ntchito saloledwa," anatero a Rostagno. A Bihamba anati asilikari a ku Congo akuyenera kulipiridwa kudzera ku banki osati kupatsidwa ndi mabwana awo.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.  	   A Bihamba anati njira yomwe ilipoyi asilikali akumalandira malipiro osakwana zomwe zikupangitsa kuti aziba komanso kugwililira.                                                                                                                                                                                                              
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice. In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals. 	Iwo anaitanitsa khoti ladziko lonse kuti lithandize njira yosalanga anthu olakwa, komanso makhoti okhudza anthu ogwililidwa omwe akufuna chilungamo chioneke.

Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015 	Olondoloza  zachuma aneneratu kuti chuma cha dziko la Malawi chitha osayenda bwino mu chaka cha 2015.
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested. 	Olondoloza chuma mu dziko la Malawi afotokoza kuti dziko lino litha kupitilira kukumana ndi mavuto a zachuma pokhapokha anthu othandiza ataloweleleraponso, anthu othandizawa sanapereke mbali ya chithandizo cha ndalama yogwiritsira ntchito ku boma chokwanira gawo la 40% kamba ka mchitidwe wa katangale wotchedwa cashgate. Ndalama zopitilira 30 million dollars ndi zomwe zinabedwa kuboma. Anthu ambiri  kuphatikizapo ogwira ntchito m'boma anamangidwa.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy. 	Kuimitsidwa kwa chithandizo chochokera maiko ena kwakakamiza dziko la malawi kudutsitsa madongosolo a ndalama  a chaka cha 2014-2015 otchedwa Zero Aid national budget. A  Abel Mwanyungwe mmodzi ounguza komanso mphunzitsi wa ndondomeko za chuma ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Polytechnic College anati kutsika kwa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama  kwasokoneza ndondomeko ya chuma.
"This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time," said Mwanyungwe. 	"Chaka chino chakhala chovuta kwambiri pamene tikuchokera kuzotsatira za Cashgate zimene zaononga kayendetsedwe ka chuma. Malo antchito ambiri komanso anthu obweretsa katundu mdzikoli akhudzidwa monga tilibe mankhwala mzipatala, komanso malipiro a aphunzitsi sakumafika mu nthawi yake, anatero a mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay. 	A Manyungwe analumikizanso kutsika kwa ndalama ya Malawi ndi kubedwa kwa ndalama mosakadza komwe kunachitika, zomwe zachititsa zionetsero kuchokera kwa  anthu osiyanasiyana ogwira ntchito m'boma pomwe akufuna kukwezedwa malipiro awo. 
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money. 	Mwachitsanzo anthu othandizira ntchito ku khoti akhala akunyanyala ntchito kwa masabata asanu ndi imodzi pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 45% zomwe aboma akuti sangakwanitse kutero  chifukwa alibe ndalama.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return. 	Ogwira ntchito a ku bungwe lothana ndi ziphuphu ananyanyala ntchito pofuna kuti malipiro awo akwezedwe kufika pa 70%  koma a boma anawaopseza kuti salandira malipiro awo a mwezi wa Disembala ngati sabwelera kunchito.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances. 	A Manyungwe anati boma litha kupewa kunyanyala ntchito kwinanso mu chaka cha 2015 ngati lingayesetse  kubwezeretsa chikhulupiliro cha anthu othandiza boma pa kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama za dziko.
"My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation," said Mwanyungwe. 	Chomwe ndikuopa ndichakuti ngati athu otithandiza sangatikhulupilirenso, ndikukhalanso opanda chithandizo ku ndondomeko ya chuma chathu, boma litha kukakamizidwa kukabwerekanso ndalama mudziko mommuno zomwe zingadzetse mavuto monga kukwera kwa zinthu, kudzera mu ndalama yaapamwamba yoperekedwa pobweza ndalama. Iyi ndi nyengo yapakatikati, anatero a Manyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system. 	Mwa zina zomwe anthu othandizawa akufuna dziko lichite ndi kumanga anthu onse amene anakhudzidwa ndi kuba ndalamazo ndicholinga cholimbitsa njira ya  kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector." 	Mtsogoleri wa bungwe la Malawi Confederation of Chambers of commerce and Industry a Newton kambala, anati kuba ndalama komwe kunachitika mu chaka cha 2014 kunaipitsa nthambi ya anthu ochita malonda chifukwa cha ngongole zochuluka zomwe boma linali nazo kwa anthu a malondawa.
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse." 	Iwo anachenjeza kuti ngati zipitilire chonchi, chaka cha 2015 chidzaipa kuposera pano.
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal. 	Mtsogoleri wa dziko lino a Peter Mutharika pamene amalankhula ku  mtundu wa a  Malawi loweruka lapitali, anati boma lawo likuyesetsa kuchita mothekera kukonza mavuto amene anadza ndi kuba ndalama.
"My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible," said Mutharika. 	Boma langa lakhwimitsa malamulo ku nthambi ya zachuma oonetsetsa kuti kuba ndalama mosakadza kusadzachitikenso mu dziko la Malawi. Tayesetsa kupereka katundu wokwanira wogwilira ntchito mu mabungwe a malamulo,  othetsa katangale kuti agwire ntchito  moyenelera, amange onse akuganiziridwa, komanso kulanda katundu yense anabedwa ngati kuli kotheka," anatero a Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013. 	A Mutharika anatinso boma lawo libweretsa njira yatsopano ya kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka ndalama zaboma kamene kakulitse chuma cha dziko kufika pa 5.5% mu chaka  cha 2014 kuchokera pa 5.0 percent mu chaka cha 2013.
	
	
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing 	Dziko la Malawi liyamba kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo.
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga. 	Amalawi  ali ndi maganizo osiyanasiyana pamene boma likukonzekera kuyambitsa kuyeza matenda a edzi khomo ndi khomo kumayambiliro kwa chaka cha mawa. Omwe ali pa mbuyo pa maganizowa akuti njirayi ikufunika kwambiri chifukwa tsiku lilironse amalawi 100 amatenga matendawa ndipo anthu osachepera 138 amamwalira tsiku lilironse ndi matenda a Edzi. nduna ya zaumoyo a Jean Kalirani analengeza ndondomekoyi pa tsiku lokumbukira matenda a Edzi mu boma la Karonga.
"We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative," said Kalirani. 	Tizipita mmidzi kukatenga magazi kwa anthu pofuna kudziwa ngati ali ndi kachiromboko kapena ayi. Amene azipezeka ndi matendawo azipatsidwa chisamaliro choyenera. Ndipo amene alibe azipatsidwa malangizo a mmene angakhalire osatengabe matendawo, anatero a kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago. 	A kalirani anati ntchitoyi iyamba mkatikati mwa mwezi wa Malichi ndipo afikira munthu aliyense amene ali ndi kachilombo kapena ayi, kuphatikizapo anthu amene anatalikilana ndi zipatala zazing'ono zomwe zimayeza magazi komanso kupereka uphungu. Iwo anati ntchitoyi ikulingana ndi cholinga chothetsa kutenga kachilombo ka HIV pofikira chaka cha 2030. 10% ndi mlingo wa katengedwe ka matendawa mu dziko lino komwe katsika kuchokera zaka zitatu zapitazo.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy. 	Izi zitalengezedwa, zadzetsa mantha mwa amalawi ena ngati  a Steven Jailosi mphunzitsi wa sukulu ya pulaimale mu mzinda wa Blantyre amene akuona ngati  ntchitoyi idzaika zinsinsi za anthu poyera.
"I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them," said Jailosi. 	Ine ndikuona ngati njirayi siyabwino chifukwa ndizosemphana ndi moyo wathu wa Chinsinsi. Kuyezetsa magazi kumayenera kukhala kobisika. Palibe amene amayenera kudziwa zoti ndinapita kukayezetsa magazi pokhapokha nditapanga chisankho chomuuza, anatero a Jailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy. 	 A Ester Makonokaya,  mlembi mu mzinda wa Blantyre anena kuti ngakhale iwo ayezedwa kale akuona kuti kuyeza magazi khomo ndi khomo ndi kuononga zinsinsi za anthu.
"Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions," said Makonokaya. 	Boma likuyenera kutenga zipatala zoyendera mmidzi komwe anthu akakwanitse kuyezetsa pawokha kusiyana ndi kuyezedwa mmakomo mwawo, chifukwa anthu amene samayenera kudziwa zotsatira zawo atha kudziwa chifukwa munthu amene wayezedwa magazi khalidwe lake limasintha, anatero a Makonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed." 	A Macpherson Maulana, mtolankhani komanso wokonza ma pologalamu a zaumoyo  mu mzinda wa Blantyre anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti boma likuyenera kuphunzitsa anthu ubwino woyezetsa magatsi ndicholinga choti anthu akayezetse pawokha mosakakamizidwa.
"I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily," said Maulana. 	Ndikuopa kuti izi zitha kuyambitsa kumenyana. Ku dziko la Liberia pompano anthu amene anapita kukathandiza anthu owaganizira kuti anali ndi matenda a Ebola anaphedwa. Choncho anthuwa akuyenera kuwaphunzitsa kuti alimbikitsidwe kukayezetsa mwakufuna kwawo,  anatero a Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected. 	Mlangizi wa matenda a HIV a David Odali omwe ali ndi bungwe lawo logwira ntchito zokhudzana ndi matenda a Edzi lotchedwa Umunthu Foundation anatsimikiza kuti zinsinsi za anthu ndi zotetezedwa.
"Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. [Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately," said Odali. 	Zinsinsi za anthu zidzasungidwa, tikatengera mmene nyumba imakhalira, chinthu choyambilira ndi kulangiza anthu a nyumba yonse pamodzi. Kenako aliyense atha kuyezedwa pomwepo aliyense akuona koma popereka zotsatira za magazi mlangiziyo akuyenera kumuuza munthu aliyense payekha, anatero a Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status. 	A Odali anati zili kwa munthu yemwe wayezedwa kuulula zotsatira za magazi ake.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people. The organization says it worked well. 	Mu chaka cha 2006 a Bungwe lothandiza anthu la Charity Development Aid from people to people anayeza magazi khomo ndi khomo anthu okwanira 400,000 mu maboma a Blantyre ndi Thyolo ndipo anati zinayenda bwino.
	
	
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi 	Kusowa kwa  madzi kwabweretsa mantha kwa Malawi odzetsa matenda amene amayamba ndi madzi opanda ukhondo.
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water. But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising. 	A Malawi okhala mu mzinda wa malonda wa  Blantyre amadalira madzi a pa mpopi. Koma miyezi isanu yapitayi, mipopi yakhala youma zomwe zimakakamiza anthu kukatunga madzi ku zitsime ndi mitsinje komwe madzi ake siotetezedwa, izi zikuchitika pamene akukuakulu amu mzinda akupopa madzi kuchokera ku mgodi wawo. Njira yotengera matenda a madzi opanda ukhondo ikuchulukirabe. 
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water. 	Anthu a boma la Blantyre ndi malo ozungulira akhala masiku asanu opanda madzi ochokera pa mpopi.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas. 	Azimayi amene pachikhalidwe amagwira ntchito za mnyumba adandaula pa zomwe akukumanazo pamene akumakatunga madzi ku mitsinje yakutali kuchokera kwawo.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky. "We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. There are so many risks. You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us." 	A Rhoda Milanzi mzimayi wa ana atatu yemwe amakhala pakhomo, wauza wailesi ya VOA mmene maulendo odutsa mutchire amakhalira oopsa. "Timadzuka 2 koloko kapena 1 koloko mammawa kukatunga madzi. Pamakhala zoopsa zambiri.. Nthawi zina timakumana ndi afiti, njoka munjira, komanso afisi amatithamangitsa," iwo anatero.
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river. But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.  	A Milanzi anati pochepetsa ntchito yosenza madzi osamba kupita nawo kwawo, azimayi amasankha kusamba mu mtsinjewo. Koma anati amasokonezedwa ndi achinyamata omwe amabisala mu tchire lapafupi.
"These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked. This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.  	"Achinyamata amasiku anowa amabwera kubisala  ndikumatisuzumila tili amaliseche. Zimatichititsa manyazi kwambiri ndipo tinakadandaulako kwa amfumu.
They punished some of them, but you know they would sometimes climb trees just to look at older women like us taking a bath," she explains.   	Ena  mwa iwo analandira chilango , komabe nthawi zina amakwera mmitengo ndicholinga choonera azimayi akuluakulu ngati ife tikamasamba, iwo anafotokoza.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.  	Vuto la madzili lakhudza kagwiridwe ntchito ka zaumoyo
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.   	Masabata atatu apitawo akuluakulu a chipatala  cha Queens mu mzinda wa Blantyre anatsimikiza kuti aimitsa kuchita ma opaleshoni kamba ka kusowa kwa madzi.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved. 	Anthu omenyera ufulu wa zaumoyo achenjeza  anthu zokhudza matenda oyamba ndi madzi opanda ukhondo makamaka mmadera omwe muli anthu ochuluka ngati zinthu sizisintha.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.  Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters. 	Ogwira ntchito ku Bungwe loona za madzi la Blantyre waterboard ati vutoli likuchokera ku ntchito yoika makina atsopano opopera madzi ku Walkers Ferry  mothandizidwa ndi ndalama zochokera ku European Union. Mneneri wa Blantyre water board anati ntchitoyi ikuyenera kuchulutsa kapangidwe ka madzi kufika pa ma mita a madzi okwana 105,000 patsiku kuchokera pa 78,000 kwapano.
"January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be," Mateyu said. 	Ntchitoyi imalizika mwezi wa Januwale. Pakadali pano kuti makinawa ayambe kugwira ntchito bwinobwino tikuyenera kudikira mwezi wa Malichi (2015). Apa ndipamene tikuyembekeza kuti mlingo wa madzi uchuluka komanso madziwo azipezeka ambiri kusiyana ndi mmene ziliri pano,  iwo anafotokoza.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks.  The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests. 	Bungwe la Consumers Association of Malawi lomwe limayang'anira anthu ogula zinthu mmisika, lakhala likukonzekera m'bindikiro ku Waterboard pofikila madzi atayambanso kutuluka bwinobwino, koma ogwira ntchito ku Waterboard anawauza anthuwa kuti aime kaye, powalonjeza kuti iwo akhala akupereka madzi mmakomo mwa anthu kudzera mu ma tanki awo. A Bungweli apereka masabata awiri kwa a Waterboard kuti akwanilitse lonjezo lawo asanapitilire ndi zionetsero zawo.
	
	
Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists 	Mtsogoleri wa dziko la Malawi ali pa moto kamba kopereka ndalama kwa atolankhani.
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre. The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance. 	Mtsogoleri wa dziko la Malawi a Peter Mutharika ali pa moto popereka ndalama zokwa 125 dolazi kwa ogwira ntchito nyumba zofalitsa nkhani okwana makumi asanu ndi atatu pa mgoneri omwe anachititsa mu mzinda wa Blantyre mwezi watha. Wokonza nkhani wa wailesi ya  kanema ya TImes Television anati atolankhaniwo anauzidwa kuti muma envelopuwo  munali ma pulani a mtsogoleriyo okhudza nyumba zofalitsa nkhani zomwe zakhala zikuvutitsa kayendetsedwe cha chuma cha boma.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner. 	Mu tsamba lawo lomwe analemba Lamulungu mu nyuzi ya Sunday Times a Gretian Tukula anati iwo sakudziwa chifukwa chenicheni chomwe atolankhani anawapatsira ndalamayo ku mgonero wa bomawo.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene." 	A Tukula anati analingalira zokabweza ndalamayo koma anabweza chiganizo chawo posafuna kuchititsa mpungwepungwe.
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away. 	Koma mlembi wa nyuzipepala ya Weekend Nation  a George Kasakula anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti iwo anabweza ndalamayo nthawi yomweyo.
"I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me. But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace]," said Kasakula. 	Ine ndinaona kuti sikunali koyenera kulandira ndalamayo, choncho ndinaibweza. Ine ndimadziwa kuti ndikaitanidwa kogwira ntchito kwina ndi udindo wawo kundidyetsa, kundipatsa malo ogona komanso mayendedwe. Koma ndi mmene zinaliri, sindinaone chifukwa chopatsilidwa ndalama poti sindinagwiritse  ntchito ndalama iliyonse kupita ku Sanjika, anatero a Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president. 	Nkhaniyi yachititsa chidwi chachikulu kwa anthu pamene  wailesi yoima payokha ya Capital Radio inaulutsa nkhani yofunsa tanthauzo la ndalama zinagawidwazi kuchokera kwa mtsogoleri wadzikoyu.
"As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter," said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio. 	Ife a wailesi ya Capital Radio timagwira ntchito  mokomera dziko. Nkhaniyi ili pa masamba onse ofalitsa nkhani, komanso ife ofalitsa nkhani takhudzidwa nawo, choncho ndikoyenera kutsatira nkhaniyi moyenera, anatero a Steve Dakalira, mkulu wa nkhani ku wailesi ya Capital radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings. 	A Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa mphunzitsi wa zamalamulo; mu tsamba lawo ya nyuzipepala ya Nyasa Times anati zomwe mtsogoleri wa dziko lino a Mutharika  popereka ndalama kwa atolankhani ku msonkhano womwe anachititsa kukufanana ndi mchitidwe wa katangale. Iwo auza a Mutharika kuti atule pansi udindo wawo kapena akonzekere kuchotsedwa pa mpando wawo.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute. 	Magulu a anthu omwe siaboma anati a Mutharika sanaonetse khalidwe labwino pamene amayesera kuchita katangale ndi atolankhaniwo.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity. 	Pakadali pano atolankhani ena akupereka ndalamayo ku chithandizo.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage. 	A Brian Ligomeka mkulu wa okonza nkhani ku Times Group, auza kanema ya Times television kuti ogwira ntchito anayi apereka ndalamayo kumalo osungila ana amasiye.
"At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children," said Ligomeka. 	"Poyambilira tinali ndi maganizo obwenza ndalamayo kwa mtsogoleri wathu koma tinaganiza mwanzeru kugula zinthu zosiyanasiyana ngati Shuga, mchere, makope ndi kukapereka kwa ana ovutika," anatero a Ligomeka.
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly." 	Mu tsamba lomwe amalemba lamulungu lilironse a Ralph Tenthani amene amalemberanso nyumba yofalitsa nkhani yaikulu ya BBC, anapepesa mmalo mwa atolankhani ena pokhumudzwitsa anthu amene amakhulupilira atolankhani ndi mtima wonse.
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state. 	A Tenthani adapereka ndalamayo ku chithandizo ndipo anati  ngakhale atolankhaniwo anakachita bwino kukabwenza ndalamayo nthawi yomweyo, kutero kunakoneka ngati kusalemekeza mtsogoleri wadziko.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story. 	A Maclan kanyangwa mkulu wa chigawo cha atolankhani ndi maphunziro a zofalitsa nkhani ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya Polytechnic anati malamulo  a utolankhani amawaletsa kulandira ndalama pa nkhani iliyonse.
"Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. There was a possibility that something was going to be published. And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem," said Kanyangwa. 	"Mwachidziwikire msonkhanowu unali nkhani yaikulu yoyenera kudziwika kwa anthu. Panali kuthekera koti nkhaniyi ilembedwa mu masamba. Inakakhala kuti ndalamayi yasintha maganizo a atolankhani mu kaweluzidwe kawo ka nkhani, linakakhala vuto .' anatero  a Kanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money. 	A Kanyangwa anati akuona ngati atolankhani ambiri sanabweze ndalamayo chifukwa sanaganizire bwinobwino pamene alalandira.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful. But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event. 	Njira zonse zomwe tinayesa kulankhula ndi  mneneri wa mtsogoleri wa dziko a Fredrick Ndala sizinatheke. Koma akuluakulu ena a  boma anati ndalamayi siinali yakatangale koma inali yowabwezera ya mafuta a galimoto kwa anthu amene anabwera ku mwambowo.
	
	
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty 	Lipoti: Maiko osaukitsitsa atha kuthetsa unphwawi pozipangila zipangizo pawokha mu mafakitale.
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies. 	Lipoti latsopano la Bungwe la United Nations lalimbikitsa maiko osaukitsitsa kuti asunthe kapangidwe kawo ka zinthu kufika patali ndicholinga chosintha chuma cha maiko awo.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development. 	Mu lipoti la pa chaka lokhudza maiko osatukuka, a UNCTAD, ku msonkhano wa za ndalama ndi chitukuko anati maiko osaukawa akuyenera kudzimasula okha mu ngodya ya umphawi , yomwe ikuchedwetsa chitukuko ndi kusintha kwa chuma chawo.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015. 	Pa maiko 48 amene bungwe la UN limati ndi osatukuka, dziko limodzi lokha  la Laos ndilimene likupita kokwanitsa zinthu zisanu ndi ziwiri zomwe likufuna pa njira yotchedwa Millenium development goals mu pofika chaka cha 2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets. 	Maiko anayi okha mu Afilika, Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda ndi Uganda  ndi amene atha kukwanitsa zolinga zawo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030. 	Ntchito yomwe maikowa anapatsidwa itha kukanika  chifukwa cha mavuto akuluakulu amene maikowa angakumane nawo zaka zikubwerazi. A MDGs anaika malire kwa maiko osaukawa kuti achepetse umphawi ndi theka pofika chaka cha 2015. zomwe maikowa akufuna atafikira kuchokera pomwe a MDGs anasiyira zitha kuthetsa umphawi pofika chaka cha 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off. 	A Taffere Tesfachew a bungwe la UNCTAD lomwe limagwira ntchito ndi maiko a ku Afilika anati zidzatengera chozizwa kuti mabungwe a LDCs adzathe kuchita izi.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies. 	 Kuti maiko osatukukawa adzafikire pamenepa, akuyenera kusintha kagwiritsidwe ntchito ka chuma chawo.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services. 	Iwowa anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti izi zikutanthauza kuti kapangidwe ka zinthu komanso ulimi ukuyenera kusuntha kuchoka pa zokolora zochepa kufika ku zambiri, komanso anati akuyenera kupanga zinthu zobweretsa phindu lalikulu.
"Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing," he said. "Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better." 	"Maiko amene zinthu zawo zasintha ndi amene akupereka mwayi kwa anthu amene anasiya ulimi kuti akachite zinthu zina zoonjezera phindu, komwenso angachite maphunziro ake,  iwo anatero," "Maiko amene amagwiritsa ntchito mfundo izi polimbikitsa ntchito yopanga zinthu okha amachita bwino."
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment. 	A Tesfachew anati  zigawo zopanga katundu wochuluka malipiro ake amakhala ambiri komanso amabweretsa msika wa katunduyo. Iwo anati izi zimalimbikitsa  kuikako ndalama.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year. 	Zikuonetsa kuti a maiko a LDCs sakulephera kwambiri. Malipoti a ndalama a  bungwe la UNCTAD anaonetsa kusintha kwa maiko osaukawa pakati pa chaka cha 2002 ndi 2008 komwe anapitiliza mulingo wa 7 pelesenti omwe iwo amayenera kufikira. Ngahale papatatha vuto la ndalama la mu chaka cha 2008, bungwe la UNCTAD linaona kuti maiko osaukawa anachita bwino msanga kusiyana ndi maiko amene akutukuka ndi 5.7 pelesenti chaka chilichonse.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty. 	Olondoloza ndalama a bungwe la U.N anati  maiko osatukukawa tsogolo lawo silikuoneka kwenikweni mu nthawi yochepa kapena yapakatikati. Iwo anati  kuchulutsa mlingo wa zinthu zopangidwa ndi anthu ndi njira imodzi yothetsera kusatukuka komwe kudakawaika mu umphwawi.
	
	
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals 	UN: Maiko ambiri a ku Afilika alephera kufikira zolinga za chitukuko zotchedwa MDG za chaka cha 2015.
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday. 	Maiko ambiri amu Afilika safikira zolinga zawo za chitukuko kufikira chaka cha 2015 chifukwa chakusiyana komwe kulipo pakati pa ndalama ndi chitukuko cha anthu. Izi zinali chimodzi cha mathero a kukambilana mu lipoti lokhudza maiko osatukuka  la bungwe la U.N lomwe linapelekedwa Lachinayi.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation. 	A Junior Davis amene amayan'ganira nkhani zokhudza ndalama mu Afilika kuchokera ku bungwe lla U.N, anati maiko a ku Afilika sanakwanitse  kusintha makulidwe a chuma chawo kupita ku kachitidwe ka mphamvu kopindulitsa. 
"We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities," Davis said. "These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities." 	Tikuona  ngati izi zili choncho chifukwa maikowa salimbikira kumanga kapena kuchita malonda ndi zinthu zomwe zingawabweretsere  phindu lochuluka, anatero a Davis.  Izi ndi zinthu zomwe zingabweretse  chitukuko cha chuma chokhazikika. Mmene malamulo  a MDGs anakonzedwera, kwakukulu amanyalanyaza kufunika kosintha zinthu zowabweletsera phindu.
Slow progress 	Kupita patsogolo pang'onopang'ono.
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development. 	Maiko a mu Afilika Sali panjira yochepetsa umphawi ndi theka pofika chaka cha 2015, ndipo kupita pa tsogolo kwawo pochepetsa njala ndi kochedwa kwambiri. Umphawi umachepetsa chitukuko komanso uumapeputsa kachitidwe ka zinthu. Chitukuko cha zachuma chimayenera kupindula mu chitukuko cha anthu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education. 	Maiko a Ethiopia, Malawi ndi Rwanda ndi amene ali mu njira yokwanitsa njira za chitukukozi. Iwowa akupita patsogolo chifukwa adayika ndalama mu zitukuko zokhazikika monga, zomangamanga, zaumoyo ndi maphunziro.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said. 	Ndondomeko ya chitukuko ya chaka cha 2015 yokhudza maiko amene ulamuliro udakali nkhani yovuta, monga dziko la South Sudan ndi Democratic Republic of Congo, kwakukulu azidalirabe thandizo lochokera ku gulu la dziko lonse kuti  afikire chitukuko cha anthu ndi chuma, anatero a Davis. ndalama ndi chikhalidwe, anatero a Davis.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said. "Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way." 	Kusintha chitukuko cha mmidzi, zokolola za makampani, ulimi ndi malo a ntchito mu maiko amenewa, payenera kukhala ndondomeko ya kukula kokhazikika komanso ntchito zolemera," anatero a Davis. "Chifukwa tikuona kuti pali kuchuluka kwa ntchito komanso kalembedwe ka ntchito komwe kwa khazikika pa njira yachitukuko iliyonse yochepetsera umphawi mokhazikika.
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition. 	Dziko  limaikidwa pa ndandanda wa maiko osatukuka limatengera ndalama zabomalo, kusatetezeka kwa chuma komanso chitukuko cha anthu kudzera mu zaumoyo ndi zakudya.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa. 	Pa Maiko 43 osatukuka pa dziko lonse, 34 ali mu Afilika. Maiko amene asuntha pa mlingo wosatukuka ndi Botswana, Cape Verde ndi Samoa.
	
	
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services 	Kunyanyala ntchito ku ma ofesi oweruza milandu a ku Malawi kwaimitsa ntchito yawo.
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago. 	Kunyanyala ntchito kwa sabata imodzi kwa anthu othandizira ntchito ku nthambi yoweruza milandu ya ku Malawi kwaimitsa ntchito za ma khoti, izi zachititsa kuchulukana mu malo amene amasungilamo anthu a kuba ku polisi komanso kuyimitsa milandu ikuluikulu monga ya katangale wa boma. Ma Marshal a khoti, ma kalaliki ndi ma mesinjala akufuna malipiro awo atakwezedwa kufika pa 30 pelesenti monga mmene boma linawalonjezera zaka ziwiri zapitazo.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.  Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.   	Kuimba mozungulira malo a khotilo kwakhala chizolowezi cha anthu onyanyala ntchitowo kuchokera sabata yatha. A Linley Herbert, woyankhulira anthu onyanyala ntchitowa wauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kunyanyala ntchitoku ndi kamba ka kulephera kukwaniritsa lonjezo lomwe boma linapereka mu mgwirizano wawo chaka cha 2012.
"In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision," Hebert said.  	Mu mwezi wa Okotobala chaka chino, boma linakonzaso malipiro a anthu ogwira ntchito mb'oma, koma ife sitinaikidwe nawo mgululi," anatero a Herbert.
"Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].  	"Pamene chaka cha 2012 tinagwirizana  nawo kuti pamene akukonza malipiro a ogwira ntchito, azionjezeranso malipiro athu.
So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out."  Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.  	Patatha mgwirizano wathu mu chaka cha 2013 tikudabwa kuti ulendo uno sanatiikepo." akuluakulu aboma anati kulephera kukweza malipiro kwa ogwira ntchito mu ofesi yoweruza milandu ndichifukwa cha mavuto a zachuma, kuchokera ku kusiya kulandira chithandizo kwa dziko la Malawi kuchokera kwa othandiza.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.  Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.   	Kuimitsa kulandira thandizoku ndi chifukwa cha ndalama zoposa 30 miliyoni zomwe zinabedwa ndiogwira ntchito m'boma. Mneneri wa unduna wa za chuma a Nations Msowoya anauza wailesi ina kuti ndizovuta kuti dziko lifikire zofuna za ogwira ntchitowa.
"It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands," "Msowoya said. 	"Ndizovuta kulonjeza zomwe asungi chuma angachite. Koma titha kunena kuti ndimmene nyengo yachuma iliri ndi zopinga za bajeti, zikhala zovutirapo kuchita monga mmene iwo akufunira," anatero a Msowoya.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.  "Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.  	A Herbert anati athu onyanyala ntchitowo  sayambiranso  kugwira ntchito pokhapokha atalandira zofuna zawo. " Chibadwileni changa palibe nthawi yomwe a boma ananena kuti ali ndi ndalama.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted.  The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.   	Boma liri ndi njira zake zopezera ndalama ndipo lipeza njira zomwezo kutipatsa ife ndalama," ananenetsa a Herbert. Kunyanyala ntchitoku kukusokoneza kuzenga milandu pamene ntchito za khoti zaimitsidwa.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.   	Milandu yambiri kuphatikizapo wa nduna yakale za za chilungamo a Ralph Kasambara, amane akuyankha mlandu polumikizana ndi kuba ndalamaku inaimitsidwa sabata latha.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.  	Apolisi akudandaula kuchulukana kwa anthu mu ndende  pamene anthu owakaikira ndi milandu sakutengedwa ku khoti.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses."   Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.   	Mneneri wa polisi  a Rhoda Manjolo anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti kuti njira yokhayo yomwe alinayo ndi  kuwatulutsa kaye  anthu amene ali ndi zolakwa zazing'ono.

"There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours," noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu. "We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.  	"Pali anthu ena amene akuyenera kukaonekera ku khoti maola 48 asanathe," anatero oyimira milandu a George Kadzipatike amene amagwira ntchito pawokha ku mpoto kwa mzinda wa Mzuzu.

Pali anthu ena amene sakufuna kukhala limodzi ndi okondedwa awo, akufuna khoti litawasudzula, sitingakwanitse kupempha kudzera ku khoti."
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.  But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.   	Akuluakulu a boma anati akuchita zokambirana mu mzinda wa Lilongwe kuti alongosole nkhaniyi. Koma onyanyala ntchitoyi awuza wailesi ya VOA kuti iwo savomera kukwezedwa  malipiro ochepera 30%.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action. 	Kunyanyala ntchito ngati komweku kunatenga  miyezi itatu  mu chaka cha 2012 pamene oweruza milandu anachita nawo.

Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-24 	Chilala ku mmwera kwa Afilika chiipiraipira kusiyana ndi mmene zinanenedwela- 2002-07-24
	
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted. WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid. 	Mgwirizano wa dziko lonse wokhudza chakudya ( United Nations World Food Program) wati chilala ku mmwera  kwa Afilika chaipiraipira kusiyana ndi mmene amaganizira. Akuluakulu a bungwe la WFP achenjeza  kuti anthu okwana 13 million mmaiko a Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Swazilandi ndi Mozambique  ali pa chiopsezo ngati salandira thandizo la chakudya.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. "The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing," she said. "We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis." 	Akuluakulu a World Food program ati akufunika  ma tani 1 million a chakudya kuti achepetse njala ku mmwera kwa Afilika, koma iwo alibe chikhulupiliro kwenikweni kuti atha kuchipeza. Pempho lomwe anapempha ku gulu lapadziko lonse lapansi kumayambiliro kwa mwezi wa Julayi, akuluakulu a  WFP anapempha ndalama zopitilira 0.5 biliyoni zogulira chakudya. Koma pakadali pano iwo alandira gawo la 20 pelesenti la ndalamayo. Wotsogolera gulu la WFP ku mmwera kwa Afilika a Judith Lewis, anati vutoli likupita kuwasowetsa chiyembekezo. "Mwayi omwe unapezeka  othetsera  vuto lalikululi ukutsekedwa," iwo anatero. "Tikufuna chithandizo chochuluka tsopano. Tikufuna chakudya chochuluka kapena ndalama zoti tigulire katundu yemwe adakapezeka kummwera kwa Afilika kuti tichepetse vuto lalikululi.
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries. About half of these people are in Zimbabwe. The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise. 	Pakadali pano bungwe la WFP likuthandiza anthu amene ali pa chiopsezo okwana 6 miliyoni ku maiko omwe akhudzidwa kwambiri. Theka la anthuwa ndi ochokera ku dziko la Zimbabwe. Nthambiyi inati ali ndi chikhulupiliro kuti chiwerengero cha anthuwa chikula.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates. It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition. 	Bungwe loona zaumoyo dziko lonse lapansi la World Health Organisation lati maiko a  kummwera kwa Afilika  poonjezerapo kukhala ndi anthu ochuluka a matenda a Edzi padziko lonse, lilinso ndi chiwelengelo chochuluka cha anthu osoya zakudya  mthupi. iwo anati anthu 300,000 atha kufa ndi matenda osowa chakudyawa pa miyezi isanu ndi umodzi ikubwerayi.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. "We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said. "If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. " 	Mai Lewis anati anthu ayamba kale kufa. "anthu akumasamuka mmidzi mwawo, kupita ku malo omwe amvetsedwa kuti kuli chakudya. Vuto ndilakuti tilibe chakudya chokwanira choti tingawadyetse anthu omwe ali pa ndandandawa komanso omwe ali mmadera ena. Kodi pali kuthekera koti zitha kubweretsa chipwirikiti ? eya."
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October. But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries. 	A Judith Lewiis a bungwe la WFP anati nthawi ngati ino mu chaka chilichonse nthambiyi imakhala ikukonzekera mmene ingapezere chakudya cha maderawa nyengo yamvula isanayambe mu  mwezi wa Okotobala. Koma iwo anati poti bungwe la WFP likupeza kale mavuto kukwaniritsa  mmene amafunira, sangayambe kukonzekera ndondomeko ina yopereka zakudya mttsogolomu.

"When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts.  	"Pamene oweruza mlandu amawerenga, pomwe panandikhudza ndi pamene ansembe a Muhosha ndi ena amaweruzidwa chifukwa chogulitsa ziwalo za anthu.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.  	Mukapita ku malamulo a zochotsa ziwalo za matupi a anthu,  sizovuta kwambiri pa nkhani zolakwa ngati zimenezi.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case," Simbota said.   	Tikuyang'anira oweruza mlandu kuti ngati kuli kotheka nkhaniyi aione kufunikira kwake kuti pakhale chilango chachikulu," anatero a Simbota.

Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government. They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start. Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday. 	Akuluakulu a mgwirizano wa zipani akukakamiza mtsogoleri Emmerson Mnangagwa ndi chipani cholamula cha ZANU-PF kuti achitepo kanthu posinntha boma. Anakonsa zionetsero lolemba ku mzinda wachiwiri wa dzikolo ku Bulawayo, koma apolisi analetsa patatsala maola ochepa kuti zionetselozi ziyambe. Zionetsero zina zakonzedwa sabata yamawa, ku mzinda wa pakati wa Gweru lLachiwiri komanso kummwera chakummawa kwa mzinda wa Masvingo Lachitatu.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court. Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police. Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office. 	Apolisi anali ataletselatu zionetsero zina zomwe zimayenera kuchitika Lachisanu lapitali ku Harare, chiganizo chomwe analetsa ndi a khoti la Zimbabwe. Otsatira chipani cha MDC ochuluka sanalabadile za kuletsedwako zomwe zinachititsa chisokonezo pakati pa anthu ndi Apolisi. Makanema ndi zithunzi zinaonetsa Apolisiwo akumenya anthu ochita zionetselo zomwe zinabweretsa madandaulo kuchoka ku mabungwe oona za ufulu wa anthu, kuphatikizapo ofesi ya dziko lonse lapansi ya United Nations.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols. The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area. 	Apolisi ambiri osati anthu ochita zionetsero adawonekera mwamphamvu mmisewu ya ku Bulawayo Lolemba, iwo anali kuyendayenda mmisewumo atavala zishango za kumaso, atanyamula zikwapu, ndi mfuti. Atolankhani anati Apolisiwo anabwera ndi magalimoto awo ndi mizinga ya madzi yomwe anaisiya mtawunimo.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations. 	Wachinyamata wina yemwe anadzitchula dzina lake kuti ndi James mu dera la Bulawayo, anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti zokambirana pakati pa boma ndi atsogoleri otsutsa ndizofunika kwambiri kuposa zionetsero.
"Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. There's really nothing that we see coming out of it," James said. "But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running." 	"Kunena chilungamo, kuchita zionetsero titha kuvulala pomenyedwa ndi kuthamangitsidwa. Palibe chomwe ife tikuona kuti chitha kutulukapo," anatero James. "Koma anthuwa akuyenera kukhala pansi ndikuona chomwe angatichitire, makama ifeyo achinyamata. Takhudzidwa kwambiri ndipo tikukula ndikumangothamanga.
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity." 	Nduna yoona zakunja a Moyo anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti iwo akupanga njira zofunika zosinthira chuma zomwe akutsimikiza kuti ngakhale achinyamata adzawapezera ntchito kuti ndalama ndi anthu obweretsa ndalamazo asamavutike kubwera mu dziko lino lomwe ntchito zizipangidwa ndipo achinyamata adzakhala mbali ya chuma chi. 
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy: "We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums." 	A Moyo anati dziko la Zimbabwe liri pakati pa pologalamu ya zaka ziwiri yokhazikitsa dzikolo kuti abwezeretse chuma chawo chomwe chinawonongeka. "Tili ndi chaka chimodzi, ndipo tikuti tidzakala titatuluka mu nyengo yowawitsayi."
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption. Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine. With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April. 	 Kum'mwera kwa Afilika anthu pafupifupi 16 miliyoni akukumana ndi mavuto a zachuma ochuluka kuyambira chaka cha 2008, kuvutika ndi kukwera kwambiri kwa mitengo ya zinthu komanso katangale wa zakazaka.

Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who had predicted 3.1% growth for 2019, offered a sobering update to Zimbabwe's parliament in early August.

Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown 	Anthu osagwira ntchito m'boma, atsutsana ndi akuluakulu a chitetezo m'boma la Tanzania poletsa machitidwe a zinthu.
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation. 	Anthu a mu Afilika osagwira ntchito m'boma omwe akukumana nawo pa msonkhano ku Tanzania anafunsidwa komanso kuchenjezedwa mathero a sabatayi,mu zimene omenyera ufulu wa anthu amati ndi njira imodzi yoletsera ufulu wa malankhulidwe mu dera la East Africa.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam. 	Zambiri zikutulukirabe pa zomwe zinachitika kwa anthu makumi anayi osagwila ntchito m'boma amene anali pa mkangano ndi akuluakulu a chitetezo pa msonkhano waukulu wotukula maiko a kummwera kwa Africa  wotchedwa Southern African Development Community ku Dar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government. 	Koma akatswiri a za ufulu Lolemba anati gawo ili ndi  chizindikiro china chodandaulitsa pa kuchuluka kosowa chikhulupiliro ndi nkhanza kuchokera ku boma.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16. Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994. 	A Catherine Eden, woimila milandu ku bungwe la Tanzania Human Rights Coalition, anati zomwe zinachitikazo zinayambira pa kusamvetsetsana. Nthumwi khumi ndi zisanu zochokera ku dziko la South Africa, iwo anati, zinafuna kuchita chikumbutso patatha zaka zisanu ndi ziwiri pa anthu ambiri omwe anaphedwa ku mgodi wa ku Marikana pa 16 mwezi wa Ogasiti. Okumba migodi makumi atatu ndi anayi omwe ankachita zionetsero anaphedwa ndi apolisi, mu kuphedwa kochuluka chitheleni ulamuliro wa tsankho mu chaka cha 1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people. But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans. 	Nthumwi pa zochitika zina zinayimba nyimbo ya fuko la dziko la South  Africa, anakhala ndi mphindi ya chete ndipo anauza boma lawo kuti likuyenera kuteteza anthu awo. Koma chinthu china chomwe analemba pa pepala chinatsimikizila a polisi a chitetezo kuti nthumwizo zinali ndi zolinga zina zazikulu.
"They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people,'" she said. "... So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate. But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania." 	"Iwo analemba ma uthenga pa mapepala akuluakulu, amene pa zooneka zomwe zomwe anajambula anati, 'lekani kupha anthu athu', iwo anatero. Ndikuona ngati munali munthu wachitetezo cha boma mu msonkhanowo yemwe anaona mauthengawo ndikuwamasulira ngati kuti panali dongosolo lochita zionetsero. Koma mukaona bwinobwino palibe ubale wina uliwonse woonetsa kuti amafuna kuchita zionetsero chifukwa cha kuombera kwa a Marikana ku Tanzania.
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated. 	Sizikudziwika bwino ngati panali amene anamangidwa. Magulu ena a zaufulu anati koma anthu amaiko ena omwe anachita nawo zionetserozo anamangidwa koma sanafunsidwe kalikonse.
'Afraid, insecure' 	Amantha, osatetezeka'
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning. Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said. 	A Eden anati anaitaniidwa ndi akuluakulu pamene anapita ku polisi lachisanu kukakumana ndi oyan'ganila a muderalo ndipo iwo anasiidwa atawapatsa chenjezo. Kenako apolisi anapita kumalo ogona  nthumwizo kukayang'ana zida zomwe amayesa kuti zinali za chiopsezo. iwo sanapeze chilichonse, anatero.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel. 	A janet Zhou mkulu wa bungwe loona za mgwirizano wa ngongole ndi chitukuko lotchedwa Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, anali mmodzi wa anthu amene anafunsidwa mafunso ndi a chitetezo ku malo ogona wo.
"I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least," she told VOA, after returning home to Harare. "Because seven security details coming over after midnight and questioning me about a demonstration and placards that I wasn't going to be able to give them, was something else. I didn't understand it. It left me really terrified." 	"Ndinali ndi mantha, ndinali osatetezedwa, Ndinadzidzimutsidwa kungokambapo zochepa," iwo anauza wailesi ya VOA atabwelera kwao ku Harare. "patatha pakati pausiku achitetezo asanu ndi awiri anabwera kumadzandifunsa zokhudza zionetsero ndi mapepala olembedwa, zomwe sindikanatha kuwapatsa, zinali zinazake. Sindinazimvetsetse. Zinandisiya ndi mantha."
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday. She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply. 	Apolisi akuti anawauza iwo ndi nthumwi zina makumi anayi kuti akhale mmalo awo ogona tsiku lonse la loweruka. Iwo anawafunsa ngati anali atamangidwa koma sanawayankhe.
'Perfectly valid' 	"Zomveka bwino."
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal. But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either. 	A Oryem Nyeko ofufuza nkhani za ufulu wa athu a  ku Kampala, anazindikira kuti apolisi a ku Tanzania sanachitepo chilichonse chophwanya malamulo. Koma iwo anati sikuti izi zochita zolondola.
"I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do," he said. "However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country." 	"Ndikuganiza kuti ndichinthu choyenera kuti apolisi achite," iwo anatero. " Koma chophinja ndichoti zikudzetsa vuto lalikulu ku Tanzania pothetsa  malo ndi mwayi wa anthu osagwila ntchito m'boma pamene  akuyenera kumasuka kudzifotokoza. Iyi ndi mbali imodzi yobweretsa kupondeleza anthu mudziko.
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression. Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation." 	Magulu apadziko lonse monga gulu loteteza atolankhani lachenjezanso kuchuluka kwa kupondeleza. Pa msonkhano waukulu wa SADC gulu la oyang'anira linazindikila  madandaulo a kusokonekela kwa ufulu wa nyumba zofalitsa nkhani komanso kuukira atolankhani, kuimitsa  njira zofalitsa nkhani, kutseka intaneti ndi kuletsa kulembetsa.
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism. 	A CPJ anatchula mwapadera mtolankhani wa ku Tanzania a Azory Gwanda, amene anasowa kuchokera mu chaka cha 2017 ndi a Erick kabendera amene anamangidwa mwezi watha pozengedwa mlandu wokhudza ndalama zomwe bungwelo linati zikugwirizana ndi utolankhani wawo otsutsa.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30. 	A Kambendera adakali kundende. Lolemba, a Eden woimila milandu wawo, anati a khoti apanga chiganizo chosuntha tsiku lawo lokaonekera ku khoti kuti awapatse ozenga mlanduwo nthawi yofufuza. Izi ziwasungabe mu ndende kupitilira sabata imodzi mpaka pa 30 Ogasiti. 
'Worrying trend' 	"Kuda nkhawa kosefukila".
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian. 	A Anna Henga mkulu wa  bungwe la malamulo ndi ufulu wa anthu lotchedwa Legal and Human Rights Center, anati zomwe apolisi akuchita zikubweretsabe kudandaula ku Tanzania pansi pa mtsogoleri wawo a John Magufuli, pamene kutsutsana kukuchulukira.
"This means the continuation of a limited civic space. Because this has happened since 2016. There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space. And it is targeted to people like civil society organizations, the media, hindering the freedom of speech, the freedom of association." 	Izi zikutanthauza kuti zipitiliza kuchepetsa malo oti anthu angamasukilepo. Chifukwa izi zinachitika mu chaka cha 2016. Pali nkhani zambiri, pali chitukuko chosakhala bwino ku malo a anthu osagwira ntchito m'boma. Ndipo ndi cholunjika kwa anthu ngati mabungwe oti siaboma, ofalitsa nkhani, kupondeleza ufulu wa kayankhulidwe komanso ufulu wa mgwirizano.
	
	
Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo 	Ochita zionetsero ochepa anaonekera ku Bulawayo mu dziko la Zimbabwe
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration. 	Anthu ochepa anaonekera ku zionetsero zotsutsa boma ku Bulawayo mzinda wachiwiri waukulu ku Zimbabwe pamene apolisi ndi zida zawo anazungulira mmisewu ndi kukhoti komwe otsutsa boma makakamila kuti aloledwe kuchita zionetsero. 
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot. 	Malonda omwe amakhala pikiripikiri ku tawuni ya Bulawayo analephereka chifukwa cha kuchuluka kwa magalimoto a a polisi, mizinga ya madzi ndi apolisi ochuluka amene amayenda pansi.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions. 	A chipani chotsutsa a Movement for Democratic Change anaitanitsa zionetserozo ngati njira yowakakamiza a Emmerson Mnangagwa, mtsogoleri wa dzikolo kuti avomere  kusintha  boma pakati pa mavuto a zachuma ndi kusagwilizana mu ndale.
But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns. A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban. 	Koma apolisiwo analetsa zionetserozo kummwera kwa mzindawo kamba ka nkhani ya chitetezo. Oweruza milandu ku Bulawayo akumvetsera kutsutsa kwaa mbali yotsutsa boma pa zionetserozi.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court. Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest. 	Zionetserozi zinakonzedwa potsatira zionetsero zomwe zinachitika mu mzinda wa Harare lachisanu pamene anthu 700  anaguba ngakhale sanamvere kuletsedwa ndi apolisi komwe kunalengezedwa ku khoti lalikulu.

Despite the High Court ban on planned protests, members of the Movement for Democratic Change took to the streets and clashed with police. Some of the injured accused police of derailing protests, which they said were meant to persuade President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to breathe life into Zimbabwe's moribund economy. 	Ngakhale a khoti lalikulu analetsa zionetsero zomwe anakonzazo, otsatira chipani cha Movement for Democratic Change analowa mmisewu ndikukalimbana ndi apolisi, Ena mwa amene anavulala  anaimba mlandu apolisiwo posokoneza zionetserozo, zomwe anati zinali zokakamizira boma la  mtsogoleri wa dzikolo a Emmerson Mnangagwa kuti lidzetse moyo mu chuma chakufa cha dziko la Zimbabwe.

"They beat us up," she said of the police. "What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person. Where will we go and survive? Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?" 	"amatimenya," ananena apolisiwo. "Tachita chiyani? Gulu la chitetezoli limayenera kutetenza tonse osati munthu mmodzi.

He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators — even elderly ones and people not protesting. "Is this democracy?" he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos. 	Iwo anati apolisi amamenya mosasankha anthu opanga zionetserowo, ngakhale anthu achikulire ndi ena oti samachita nawo zionetsero. "Kodi umenewu ndi ufulu wa demokalase?" iye anafunsa, kuphatikizapo kuti zinali zionetsero za mtendere koma apolisi anachititsa chisokonezo.

Government response 	Yankho la Boma.
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa called the protests counterproductive, saying January's demonstrations against fuel price increases resulted in $20 million to $30 million in losses for businesses from looting and non-productive days. 	Nduna ya zofalitsa nkhani a Monica Mutsvangwa anafotokoza kuti zionetserozo  ndizosapindulitsa, anati zionetsero za mwezi wa Januwale zotsutsana ndi kukwera kwa mafuta, kunachititsa kuti ndalama za ma dola  zapakatikati pa 20 ndi 30 miliyoni  zitayike chifukwa cha  kuba komanso kusagwira ntchito kwa masiku.
"Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner," she said. "I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation." 	Boma lauza anthu onse opita patsogolo a boma la Zimbabwe kuti asalore kugwiritsidwa ntchito ndi mphamvu zosakhala bwino kuti dziko lawo lisakhazikike, ati izi zingopitiliza mavuto omwe dzikolo lukukumana nawo pamene dzikolo likuyesetsa kukonza kuti likhazikike, iwo anatero, nkanakonda anthu anakamvera mtsogoleri wathu powaitana kuti tikonze mavuto omwe tikukumana nawowa mwa umodzi ngati dziko.

UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe 	A bungwe la UN adzudzula boma la Zimbabwe pa mchitidwe wolanga anthu pa zionetsero zamtendere zomwe zinachitika.
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare. The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces. 	Ofesi ya ufulu wa anthu ya U.N yadzudzula mchitidwe wolanga anthu Lachisanu ku Zimbabwe pa chipolowe chomwe apolisi anachititsa pa zionetsero za mtendere mu mzinda wa Harare. Nthambiyi yayambitsa kufufuza nkhaniyi pogwiritsa ntchito mphamvu za asilikali a chitetezo.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors. 	Mneneri wa ufulu wa anthu ku bungwe la U.N a Rupert Colville anati pali njira zabwino zothana ndi mavuto omwe anthu akulira nawo pa nkhani ya chuma cha dziko kusiyana ndi kuzunza anthuwa pochita zionetsero za mtendere.
"We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe. While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans," Colville said. 	Ndife okhudzidwa kwambiri ndi mavuto a zachuma ndi chikhalidwe omwe akuchitikabe ku Zimbabwe. Povomeleza khama la boma, bungwe la dziko lonse ndi la U.N ku Zimbabwe pochepetsa mavutowa komanso kusintha ndondomeko, vuto la chuali likukhudza mosakhala bwino ufulu wa khalidwe ndi chuma wa anthu a ku Zimbabwe, A Colville anatero.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care. Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought. 	Mzika za dziko la Zimbabwe zikuvutika ndi kukwera  mitengo kwambiri kwa zinthu, monga zinthu ngati mafuta agalimoto, chakudya, mayendedwe komanso chisamaliro cha moyo zakwera mitengo. Poonjezela mavutowo mphepo yaikulu yotchedwa Cyclone Idai yomwe inaomba dziko la  Zimbabwe mwezi wa Malichi ndi chilala chachikulu.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid. 	A bungwe la United nations anati gawo limodzi mwa magawo atatu a anthu 16 miliyoni a dziko la zimbabwe akufunika chithandizo.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear. But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months. 	Chomwe chinachititsa kuvulazidwa ndi kumangidwa kwa anthu kuchokera Lachisanu sichikudziwika. Koma a Colville anauza wailesi ya VOA kuti ofesi yawo yalandira malipoti osakhala bwino ophwanya malamulo a ufulu wa anthu pa miyezi yapitayo.
"There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders. We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago," Colville said. "So, it is clearly a very tense situation." 	"Monga mmene ndinafotokozera pali malipoti  amene akubwera okhudza kutenga anthu mokakamiza, kumenyedwa  ndi zina zambiri kwa anthu omenyera ufulu. Sitinapeze mwayi wotsimikizira ndikuona bwinobwino kupatula zomwe zinachitika masiku apitawa," a Colville anatero. "Iyi ndi nyengo yovuta kwambiri."
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly. 	A Colville anati akuluakulu aboma ali ndi udindo woonetsetsa kuti ufulu wa kayankhulidwe wa anthu ndi kusonkhana mwa mtendere ukutetezedwa.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work. 	Bungwe la ufulu wa anthu la U.N lapempha boma kuti lionetsetse kuti anthu osagwira ntchito m'boma mu njira iliyonse azichita zinthu opanda mantha a ntchito yawo.
	
	
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs 	Ngakhale pali mafuta osungidwa, Africa wakhudzidwa ndi kukwera mtengo kwa mphamvu zochokera ku mafuta.
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil. 	Anthu a ku Afilika akupeza mavuto ndi kukwera kwa mafuta ndi mphamvu ya magetsi, anatero ounguza, ngakhalenso maiko a Nigeria ndi Angola amene amagulitsa  mafuta ku maiko ena.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe. 	Pamene opanga mafuta ochepa ena akupeza ndalama yochuluka, chiyambileni kuukila kwa dziko la Russia ku Ukraine pa 24 Febuluwale,  dzikoli likukanika kukonza mafutawa zomwe zikukakamiza maiko kulipira mitengo yokwera kuti abweretse  mafuta ndi zina kuchokera kmaiko a ku  Asia ndi ku Ulaya.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production. 	Dziko likupitilira kukhudzidwa ndi kukwera mtengo  kwa mafuta a chilengedwe amene amaagwiritsidwa ntchito mu feteleza wokulitsa mbewu za chakudya.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education. 	Ndi malipiro kukhala chimodzimodzi, kupitilira magawo awiri pa atatu a anthu a ku Afilika akumva kukakamizidwa ndi kukwera mitengo anatero a Franklin Cudjoe mtsogoleri wa malo otchedwa Imani Cennter for Policy and Education dziko la Ghana.
"The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products," Cudjoe told VOA. 	Gawo la dzikoli lakhudzidwa kwambiri chifukwa timadalira kwambiri  kugula mafuta ochokera ku maiko ena, monga maiko ambiri aku Afilika alibe mafuta opanga okha," a Cudjoe anauza wailesi ya VOA.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude. The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday. 	Mitengo inakwera pa msika wa dziko lonse pambuyo pa kuukilidwa kwa dziko la Ukraine komwe kunayambitsa kusintha kwa malamulo a dziko lonse motsutsana ndi dziko la Russia, limodzi mwa maiko otumiza mafuta ku maiko ena. Mwachidule mtengo unakwera kuposela pa 120 dolazi pa galoni iliyonse lachisanu asanagwirizane zotsitsa kufika pa 103 dolazi.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa. In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week. 	Kukwera mitengo kwamphamvu  ya magetsi, ndikomwe kukuchititsa kukwera mitengo ya zinthu ku Afilika. Mwachitsanzo ku Ghana kukwera mitengo ya zinthu kunali pa 15.7 pelesenti chaka ndi chaka kusiyana ndi 13.9 pelesenti mu Januwale, kuchokera ku  chiwelengero cha dzikolo.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight. At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday. The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22. 	Ku dziko la Zimbabwe mitengo ikukwera kwambiri. Sitolo ina yotchedwa TM ku Harare, kileti ya mazira 30 ndi ma dolazi okwana 6.70 lachiwiri, lachitatu anali ma dolazi okwana 7.81. Mtengo wa mkate unachoka pa ma dolazi okwana 1.49 kufika pa 1.84,  Nyama ya n''gombe inachoka pa ma dolazi okwana 3.35 kufika pa 5.22
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday. 	Mitengo ya mafuta inakweranso.  Ku Harare mtengo pa lita mtengo unakwera kuchoka pa ma dolazi okwana 1.41 kufika 1.69 kuchoka Lachiwiri kufika Lachitatu.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS. 	Kukwera kwa mitengo ya zakudya ndi komwe kunachititsa kukwera mitengo kwa ogula zinthu mu dziko la  Aigupto (Egypt), inakwera kufika pa  8.8 % mwezi wa Febuluwale. Kukwera kwachangu mu zaka zitatu, malinga ndi ziwerengero za nthambi ya CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty. 	A Cudjoe anati zinali zovuta kwa maboma  ndi madera ngati a African Union kuti apange njira zodzitetezera podzathandizira anthu ogula zinthu mu nyengo ya kusatsimikizika kwa chuma.
"Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food," said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now." 	Ngakhale kutamangidwa chitetezo  mu njira yopeleka chakudya," anatero a Cudjoe poonjezera, "Ndikulingalira dziko la Nigeria, linakakhala ndi njira yake bwezi likugulitsa chakudya  ku maiko ambiri motsika mtengo panopa."
"There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world." 	"Pakuyenera kukhala changu chodzimangira chitetezo, ndalama zoti zitha kutisunga-zotipewetsa kuwonongeka ku kusatsimikizidwa kwa  zinthu zochitika pa dzilo lonse.
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries. 	A Chibamba kanyama, oona zachuma mu mzinda wa Lusaka ku Zambia, anati kuchotsa misonkho ya mafuta chitha kukhala chinthu choyenera kuchita panopa ndi nyengoyi poteteza anthu ogula ndi mafakitale.
"African governments must find a way of responding," he said. 'It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society." 	"Maiko a dera la Afilika akuyenera kupeza  njira yolowelerapo," iwo anatero.  Ali ndi chisankho chotsitsa misonkho kuti atsitse mitengo yazinthu kapena kusiya mitengo yomweyo ndi kugwiritsa ntchito ndalama za boma kuti atsitse mitengo kwa anthu ofuna chithandizo.
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers. 	Koma a Kanyama anapereka maganizo oti zovuta za maiko zomwe zikuchitika pakati pa Russia ndi Ukraine amene ali maiko ogulitsa katundu ku Afilika, zitha kupereka mwayi ochuluka  kwa opanga zinthu zosiyanasiyana ku Afilika.
"Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities] like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine," Kanyama said. 	Maiko ogulitsa zinthu ngati South Africa, amene ali ndi machitidwe amakina amphamvu, atha kupeza mwayi wotumiza kunja zithu ngati  tirigu, ndi zina zomwe asiya mpata a maiko a Russia ndi Ukraine," anatero a Kanyama.
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome. 	A kanyama anatinso thandizo lochokera ku gulu lonse la dziko lapansi mwachitsanzo ngongole kwa maiko ena aku Afilika ndilolandiridwa.
He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – "is trying to offer some debt relief." 	 Iwo anazindikira magulu makumi awiri a maiko a mafakitale ochuluka, maiko ena a chuma chochuluka msanga, ndi  Mgwirizano wa maiko a ku Ulaya, "ukuyesa kupereka thandizo la ngongole."
"Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis," Kanyama added. 	Maiko ena ngati Zambia a kukonzanzo ndondomeko yawo ya ngongole ndi pologalamu ya IMF imene kwa ineyo ndi njira yokhayo yotulukira mavutowa," anatero a Kanyama.

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February 	Bungwe la WHO lati Katemera wa COVID ku africa anakwera ndi anthu 15 pa anthu 100 ena alionse(15%) mu mwezi wa February
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic. 	Bungwe la World Health Organisation lati katemera wa COVID 19 ku Africa anakwera ndi anthu 15 pa anthu 100 alionse (15%) pakati pa mwezi wa January ndi February
Zimbabwes government says it is launching a "national vaccination blitz" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year. The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases.  Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria. 	Boma la Zimbabwe likukhazikitsa ntchito yolimbikitsa katemera m'dziko lawo lonse "National vaccination blitz" yomwe cholinga chake n'cholimbikitsa omwe sanabayitse katemera m'dzikoli lomwe vuto lokana kubayitsa linali lalikulu chiyambireni ntchitoyi chaka chatha.

Dr. Matshidiso Moeti omwe ndi  regional director wa WHO ku Africa mu mawu ake anati kukwera kwa kubayitsa kwa katemera wa COVID-19 kunalimbikitsidwa makamaka chifukwa cha ntchito zofalitsa uthengawu mu mayiko omwe ali ndi chiwerengero cha anthu ambili kumbaphatikizirapo mayiko a Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya ndi Nigeria
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant. 	Dr. Thierno Balde, omwe ndi regional COVID-19 incident manager wa WHO ku Africa wati anthu a mu kontinentiyi akhalebe atcheru 
"We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible. We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally. The situation might change. So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination," Balde said. 	"Taona zomwe zikuchitika ku China, komanso kuopsa kokhala ndi machitidwe ena ofananizidwa ndi kachilomboka, mitundu ina ya kachilomboka yomwe ili ndi kuthekera kwakupezeka
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month. 	WHO inati pofuna kuthandizira kuvomerezedwa kwa kamtemera wa COVID 19, ilo komanso ma bungwe ena amathandizira kubayitsa kwa namtindi wa anthu mu mayiko osankhidwa osachepera 10 ndi cholinga chofikira anthu 100 miliyoni pakutha pa mwezi wa mawa
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind. 	Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu amene akugwilizira mpando wa nduna ya zofalitsa nkhani anatidziko lake silitsalira pa mbuyo
"Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date. The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so," Ndlovu said. 	"pokhadzana ndi ndondomeko ya kubaya katemera, pochokera pa 15 March 2022 kufikira tsiku la lero, anthu okwana 159, 628 analandira kubayitsa kwa chitatu kwa katemerayu. Ntchito yakubayitsa katemera mu dziko lonse wotchedwa 'National vaccination blitz' uyamba pa 21 March 2022 ndipo boma likulimbikitsa omwe sanabayitse kuti atengerepo mwayi pa ntchitoyi" anatero Ndlovu
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak. 	Mzika zambili za Zimbabwe zakana kulandira katemerayu pachifukwa chakuti iwo sakumuona bwino katemera yemwe anapatsidwa kwa iwo yemwe anapangidwa ku China, sinopharm ndi Sinova.

Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns. He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing. 	Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete omwe ndi wamkulu wa Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians wati izi zili choncho kamba ka kuchotsa kwa njira zocheptsera kafalikira kwa matendawa monga kutseka kwa zipata zolowera m'dzikolo. Iye wati, komabe,sikoyenera kuti anthu akhale ndi mantha koma kulimbikitsa kutsatira njira za WHO monga kuvala zotchinga kukwama ndi kukhala motalikilana.
"After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up. But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us. The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up. What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers. There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures," Chimbetete said. 	"chifukwa chakukhwefura njira zopwera, kukuyembekezedwa kuti chiwelengero cha odwala chikwera pang'ono. Koma ndikuganiza kuti sitingaphere mkota mwamsanga ngati pakali pano. Ndikuona kuti ndi mwayi wathu kuti tilimbitse njira zopewera komanso kutsindika kwa mzika zathu kuti COVID 19 tikanali naye.

Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance. It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity. 	Boma la Zimbabwe limafuna kupeleka katemera jwa anthu osachepera 10 million pakutha kwa chaka chatha, chiwerengero chomwe ena mati n'chovuta kuchikwanilitsa potengera kusowa kwa zipangizo zofunikira komanso kuzengereza.

Finland Crowned World's Happiest Nation for Fifth Year 	Finland ivekedwa kukhala dziko lokondwetsetsa kwa chaka cha chisanu pa dziko lonse la pansi
Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year running, in an annual U.N.-sponsored index that again ranked Afghanistan as the unhappiest, followed closely by Lebanon. 	Finland yatchulidwa kukhara dziko lokondwetsetsa paziko lonse lapansi kwa zaka zisanu zotsogozana, Mu nsonkhano wa pachaka othandizidwa ndi UN waonetsanso kuti Afghanistan ndi dziko losakondwetsetsa pa dziko lonse lapansi motsatirana  pafupifupi ndi dziko la Lebanon.
Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania recorded the biggest boosts in wellbeing. The largest falls in the World Happiness table, released on Friday, came in Lebanon, Venezuela and Afghanistan. 	Serbia, Bulgaria ndi Romania awonetsa kukhara maiko omwe apititsa patsogolo kwambiri pakakhalidwe kabwino ka anthu. Kutsika kwakukulu mu mndandanda wa kukondwera, zomwe zatulutsidwa Lachisanu, wachitika ku Lebanon, Venuzuela komanso Afghanistan.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe. 	Lebanon yomwe ikukumana ndimavuto akuonongeka kwa zachuma, yafika pachiwiri kwa omaliza mukaundula wa maiko 146, pamusi pake pali Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August.  U.N. agency UNICEF estimates one million children under five could die of hunger this winter if not aided. 	Afghanistan, dziko lomwe lazunzika ndi nkhondo lomwe lili kale pansi pa mndandanda, zaonekera kulowa pansi kwakukulu kwa kakhalidwe kabwino kapena thanzi la anthu awo kuchokela nthawi yomwe matalibani anatenganso ulamuliro kachikena mu August wapitayu. U.N. agency UNICEF anayelekezera kuti ana osapyora zaka zisanu okwana 1 miliyoni akanatha kufa ndi njala mnyengo yozizirayi akanapanda kuthandizidwa.
"This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims," co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data. 	Mumulingo umenewu ukuimilira kukumbutsa mmene mulungo unalili wa zipangizo komanso zomwe sizipangizo zomwe nkhondo inachita kwa okhudzidwa, co-author  Jan-Emmanuel De Neve  anatero. The World Happiness Report, pano muchaka chawo chachikhumi, ikutengera paziganizo za anthu pachimwemwe chawo, chimodzimodzi pazachuma komanso kakhalidwe kawo
It assigns a happiness score on a scale of zero to 10, based on an average of data over a three-year period. This latest edition was completed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 	Inapeleka mulingo wachisangalalo pamulingo wa ziro mpaka 10, kutengera pa mulingo wakaundula  wa nthawi yoposa zaka zitatu,zomwe zinalembedwa zatsopanozi zinamalizidwa  dziko la Russia ndi Ukrain asana ukilane.
Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch. The United States rose three places to 16th, one ahead of Britain, while France climbed to 20th, its highest ranking yet. 	Anthu aku Northen europe anapambananso kachikena  pamalo apa mwamba ndi Danes achiwiri pambuyo pa Finns, motsatirana ndi Icelandic, Swiss ndi Dutch.Dziko la United States anakwera  ndi malao atatau kufika pa 16th, patsogolo ndi  mulingo umodzi kwa Britain, pamene France  inakwera kufika pa 20th, mulingo waku waukulu pakali pano.
As well as a personal sense of wellbeing, based on Gallup polls in each country, the happiness score takes account of GDP, social support, personal freedom and levels of corruption. 	Kuphatikizapo kuti ngati munthu amene zinthu zake zilibwino, kutengera maganizo a anthu mu dziko lina lililonse,  kupambana kwa chisangalaro kumatengera  kuwelengera GDP, kuthandizilidwa ndi ma ubale, ufulu wa munthu  komanso mlingo wa katangale
This year the authors also used data from social media to compare people's emotions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. They found "strong increases in anxiety and sadness" in 18 countries but a fall in feelings of anger. 	Chaka chino, oyambitsawo anagwiritsiranso ntchito data pa tsamba la mchezo la intaneti kuti asiyanitse maimvaima a m'malingaliro mlili wa Covid usanafike komanso utafika. Iwo anapeza "kukula kwa nkhawa komanso kukhumudwa" mu mayiko 18 koma kutsika mu mkwiyo.
"The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing," report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote. 	"Phunziro la uthenga opezeka mu World Hapinness Report pakudutsa kwa zaka ndilakuti kuthandiza pa maubale, kupeleka kwa wina ndi mzake komanso kuona mtima mu mboma  n'kofunika pa kukhala bwino kwa munthu." olemba nawo uthenga wa mu ripoti Jeffrey Sachs analemba.
"World leaders should take heed." 	"Azitsogoleri adziko akuyenera amve"
The report raised some eyebrows when it first placed Finland at the top of its listings in 2018. 	Zotsatira  zinadzidzimutsa pomwe Finland inaikidwa pamwamba mu 2018 
Many of the Nordic country's 5.5 million people describe themselves as taciturn and prone to melancholy, and admit to eyeing public displays of joyfulness with suspicion.

Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer 	Bwalo la milandu ku Zimbabwe lalamula kufufuzanso mtolankhani wa NY Times .
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year. 	Bwalo la milandu ku dziko la Zimbabwe linakana pempho lakutuluka lachiwiri mu mlandu wa mtolankhaniwa New York Times.Mtolankhani wozilempha yekha Jeffrey Moyo akuimbidwa mlandu wokana moonekera lamulo bungwe loona za anthu olowa ndi otula la ku Zimbabwe pamene akuganiziridwa kuti anathandizira atolankhani a kunja kwa dzikoli kulowa dziko la kummawakwa Africa li chaka chatha.
Kathleen Mpofu — one of Moyo's lawyers — said the journalist will go on trial April 28. 	Kathleen Mpofu - m'modzi mwa oyimira mlandu wa  Moyo - wati mtolankhaniyu akaonekera ku khothi kukayankha mlandu pa 28 April.
"The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding," Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.  	"Oweluza mlandu, a magistrate,anakana pempho lawo. Kunali kovuta kuwateteza abambo Moyo kamba odandaura anabweretsa umboni wokwanira" Ampofu anaauza VOAkuchokeraku Bulawayo podzera mauthenga a inteneti a WhatsApp
"It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense." 	"Zikuonetsa kuti a magistrate anadalira umboni omwe odandaula anapeleka okhudzana ndi mapepala achilolezo abodza omwe mtolankhaniyu anali nawo komanso potengera kutanthauzira kwa umboniwu,  anapeza kuti kunali koyenera kuteteza odandaulidwayu.
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately. 	Oyimilira mlandu wa Moyo anakhulupilira kuti mlanduwu uthakutsekedwa, potsatira ndi pamene bwalo la milandu koyambilira kwa mwezi uno linamasura ogwira ntchito ku Media Commission ya ku Zimbabwe, Thabang Manhika, yemwe amaganizilidwa kuti anathandizira kupanga zilolezo za bodza kwa atolankhani awiri a Newyork Times omwe amakhala mu dziko la South Africa omwe analowa mu dziko la Zimbabwe ndipo anatumizidwa kwawo.

Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws. 	Boma la Zimbabwe lati Moyo  komanso Manhika onse anaphwanya lamulo la bungwe loona za anthu otuluka ndi olowa mdziko.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling. 	Mlembi wokhazikika wa unduna wa zofalitsa nkhani Ndabaningi Nick anaikirapo ndemanga pachigamulo cha la chiwiri.
"We just want to see that there's law and order. If somebody has committed a crime or is perceived, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system. That's our position," Mangwana said. 	"ife tikungofuna kuonetsetsa kuti pali lamulo ndi dongosolo.

"MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial. That is our position throughout till the end of the case. All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial," Moyo said. 	"MISA  Zimbabwe yatsindika za kufunika kwa kuyesa oganizilidwa mlandu mwa chilungamo. Uwo ndiye udindo wathu  njira yonse mpaka pothera mlanduwu. Chomwe tikunena ndichakutiiye, monga mzika ili onse, akuyenera kupatsidwa mwai wakuyesedwa mwa chilungamo,".

Zimbabwe Police Block Main Opposition Rallies   	Apolisi a dziko la Zimbabwe aletsa misokhani ya chipani chotsutsa chachikulu.
Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018. The police says the rally ban in Mavhunga, about 80 kilometers east of Harare, is meant to ensure peace and stability.

Police camped overnight Friday at a venue in Marondera, where the leader of Zimbabwes main opposition, the Citizens Coalition for Change, Nelson Chamisa, was supposed to address his supporters Saturday. The 44-year-old candidate later came to disperse the crowd waiting for him.

Chamisa said his party does not want to fight with people. He said the government denied permission to hold a rally, so the party asked for permission to come and tell about that. He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death. Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.

A Zimbabwe Court Dismisses Suspension of Striking Teachers 	Bwalo la milandu ku Zimbabwe lachotsa kuimitsidwa kwa ntchito kwa miyezi itatukwa amphunzitsi omwe amanyanyala ntchito za boma.
Zimbabwe's High Court has voided the government's three-month suspension of striking teachers, ruling the ministry of education overstepped its authority. The teachers went on strike last week over poor salaries just as schools were set to reopen after a long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts say children's education has been caught in the crossfire. 	Bwalo lalikulu la milandu la Zimbabwe lachotsa kuimitsidwa pa ntchito kwa miyezi itatu kwaaphunzitsi omwe amanyanyala ntchito ndi boma, kulamulira kuti unduna wa za maphunziro unadutsa malire a mphamvu zake.

Noble Chinhanu of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum represented the teachers in court. 	A Noble Chinhanu ochokera kubungwe loona za ufulu wa anthu la, Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum anaimilira aphunzitsiwa ku bwalo la milandu
"We managed to present our arguments before the court and the judge has given us an order to the effect that the press statement that was issued by the minister of primary and secondary education is illegal and unconstitutional," said Chinhanu. "We managed to prove that our client has a right not to be suspended in such a manner which was in violation of public service regulations of the nation." 	"Tinakwanitsa kupeleka mfundo zathu mu bwalo lamilandu ndipo oweruza milandu watipatsa lamulo lomwe lapangitsa uthenga womwe unapelekedwa ndi nduna ya zamaphunziro a pulayimale ndi sekondale unali wosavomerezekandi malamulo," anatero a Chinhanu.

"We are seeing a lot of agitation and politicization of this from the employees," said Nyikadzino. "They are not keen to listen to what the employer is saying. Their parties that are being affected as a result of this, so what has to be done is go to the tripartite negotiating forum and in the spirit find a consensus." 	"Tikuona kuti pachuluka kukhumudwa komanso kulowetsapo ndale pa izi kuchokera kwa ogwirantchito," anatero Nyikadzino. "Alibe chidwi kuti amvetsere zomwe owalemba ntchito akunena.

"There are some members who are unable to travel: those who are far distant schools. They are finding it difficult because of the resources," said Ndlovu. "And there are some who are saying while we are within the school environs, we still find it difficult to find food for subsistence. That is what is mitigating against 100 percent attendance. We hope that after pay day (next week Tuesday) things will get back to normal. But that does not mean that the teachers are happy with the remuneration that they are getting. They still want some more." 	"Pali ena omwe amakanika kuyenda: iwo omwe amachokera ku ma sukulu akutali. Iwo akuvutka chifukwa cha kusowa kwa zipangizozi," anatero Ndlovu.

"We have gone round in government and non-government schools, and we are quite impressed by the teaching and learning that is going on," Ndoro said. "Of course there are a few schools here and there which still face a bit of challenges."

The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying civil servants in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teacher wages to about $100 a month. The teachers want the $540 a month they were getting in 2018.

In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.  Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.

Zimbabwe Government Suspends Striking Teachers 	Boma la Zimbabwe laimitsa pa ntchito aphunzitsi omwe amapanga zionetsero 
Authorities in Zimbabwe have suspended striking teachers for three months without pay in a dispute that will see most schools remain closed. The teachers went on strike this week over their compensation.

Aphunzitsiwa anapanga zionetsero pa kuima kugwira ntchito chifukwa cha kufuna kubwezeretsedwa kwa malipiro awo.
Evelyn Ndlovu, Zimbabwes minister of primary and secondary education, said late Thursday that striking teacher have been suspended due to their reluctance to resume work despite the governments offer to give them a 20 percent salary hike and additional incentives. 	A Evelyn Ndlovu omwe ndi nduna ya za maphunziro a ku pulayimale ndi sekondale , madzulo a lachinayi anati kunyanyara kwa aphunzitsi kwaimitsidwa  kutengera kuzengeleza kwawo koyambiranso kugwira ntchito  posatengera kuti boma lawaonjezera malipiro awo omwe amalandira ndi 20 pa 100 aliyense.
"All officials within the ministry who absented themselves from duty since the opening of schools on 7th February, 2022 have been suspended without pay forthwith for a period of three-month. During this period, members are not to hinder or interfere with any investigations or evidence relating to the alleged misconduct," said Ndlovu. "Appropriate action will be taken against members who abrogate their duties and responsibilities." 	"Onse ogwira ntchito ku undunawu omwe sanabwere kuntchito kuyambira kutsekulilidwa kwa ma sukulu pa 7 February, 2022 ayimitsidwa kwa miyezi itatu ndipo sadzilandira ndalama.

"Zoyenera kuchita zichitika mustutsana ndi aliyense yemwe sagwira ntchito zawo ndi maudindo awo."
Zimbabwes schools were scheduled to reopen this week after a long break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But teachers refused to resume working, asking for a pay increase. They currently earn about $100 a month. 	Ma sukulu aku Zimbabwe amayenera kutsekulilidwanso sabata ino patatha nthawi yaitala chifukwa cha mlili wa COVID-19. K oma aphunzitsi anakana kuyambiranso ntchito, akupempha kuonjezeledwa malipiro. Pakali pano akulandira pafupifupi $100 pa mwezi.
The government Tuesday offered them a 20 percent pay increase and other incentives, such as free school fees for their children and loans for housing. But the teachers have rejected that offer as insufficient. 	Lachiwiri Boma laonjezera 20 pa 100 aliyense mu malipiro ndi zina zowalimbikitsa, monga maphunziro aulele kwa ana awo komanso ngongole za manyumba. Koma aphunzitsi akana zimenezi kuti ndizosakwanira.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, told VOA the suspended educators are making an urgent application to the High Court to declare their suspension illegal. 	Obert Masaraure, wapampando wa Almagamated Rural Teachers Union for Zimbabwe, anauza VOA kuti kuimitsa ophunzitsa kukupangitsa kupempha bwalo la milandu kwa changu kuti lillengeze kuti kuimitsidwa kwawo sikololedwa ndi lamulo.  
"Public service regulation clearly articulates clear guidelines on how people can be suspended. We are not in a banana republic where anyone can wake up and make pronouncements which are detached and divorced from the law," said Masaraure. "We note that the minister has withdrawn herself from the law, therefore cannot be able to speak legally on education (matters) because she has acted unconstitutionally by arbitrarily suspending teachers of Zimbabwe. We deem her suspended as she has acted outside the law." 	"Malamuloa a kagwilidwe ntchito ka m'boma akufotolkozamomveka bwino momwe anthu angayimitsilidwe pa ntchito.  Sitili mu dziko losakhazikika momwe aliyense amangodzuka ndikulengeza zinthu zosalumikizana komanso zosiyana ndi lamulo." anatero Masaraure.

Tikuwaimitsa iwo pa ntchito pakuti achita mosemphana ndi lamulo."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing their wages. 	Kusamvetsetsana pa nkhani a malipiliro kunayamba mbuyomu mu chaka cha 2018 pamene boma linasiya kulipira aphunzitsi mu ndalama ya ku nja ya Dollar(U.S dollar) kupita kupita ku ndalama ya ku zimbabwe ya dollar (dollar ya Zimbabwe).

Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa  	Asilikali ankhondo omwe si aboma  a zomanga manga akulimbikitsa machitachita a Russia ku Africa
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" — an entity with no known legal status. 	Zokhumba za ndale za Russiah zokhudzana ndi malo a Africa muzaka zapafupipa zalandila kuvomerezedwa ndi ogwira ntchito za usilikali omwe si aboma , omwe nthawi zambili amafotokozedwa ngati ndi gawo limodzi la "gulu la Wagner"- gulu lomwe kulodwa kwake nd lamulo  sikumadziwika
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020. 	Cha pompano, mayiko a kwa azungu  atsutsa kufika kwa asilikali ochokera ku Russia kufika ku likulu la dziko la Mali, Bamako, zoneneza zomwe zinakanidwa ndi a Junta omwe anasiya ulamuliro mu 2020
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency. 	Pamene ma ubale ndi dziko la France akuonongekerabe, olamulira usilikali atha kumayang'ana njira yokonzera pa kuchepa kwa magulu a khondo omwe akumenya nkhondo a Jihadi omwe atha chaka a ku Mali
"Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank. 	"Asilikali obwerawa kudzagwira ntchito ku Africa ndi chikhalidwe chokhazikika" kuyamikira mbali inakwa zaka makumi ntchito yogwiridwa ndi anthu a ku South Africa,Jason Blakazis wochokera soufan group ya ku Newyork think tank anatero
"The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk," he added. 	
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances. 	Palibe  Nkhani iliyonse yomwe ikupezeka poyera yokhudza kukura kwa gulu kapena zachuma.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique. 	Koma kuzungulira mu Africa, a Centre for Strategic and International Stadies (SCIS) ku Washington  apeza umboni kuchokera 2016 wa msilikari waku Rassia wa Fortune ku Sudan, ku mmwera kwa Sudan, ku Libya,ku Central Africa Repblic (CAR), Madagascar komanso Mozambique
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list. 	Botswana, Burundi, Chad, a Comoros, a Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe nawo ali mu ndandanda wa CSIS's.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP. 	Mu Africa  " muli chidwi cha kugwirizana kwa maboma ochuluka, kupahatikizapo China," Alexey Mukhin wa Moscow-based Centre for Political Information wauza AFP.
"Every state has the right to defend its business assets," he added. 	Boma lililonse lili ndi ufulu oteteza katundu wawo wa malonda, " anaonjezera motero.
'Hysteria' 	Chipwirikiti
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found. 	Woyendetsa weni weni kulibe, opanda kulembetsa  kampani, kubweza misokho kapena tchati cha bungwe chipezeke.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner. 	Pamene a EU amkafuna kulanga gulu mu 2020amkafuna Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin,  mtsogoleri olimba mtima  Vladimir Putin yemwe amakaikilidwa kuti ndiye akuyendetsa wagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow. 	Maganizo achilango anapitilira kukambidwa mu December chaka chatha pamene  Mercenaries anafika ku Mali pokaonekera kuzomwezo.- kukachotsa mtsotso wa chipwirikiti cha ku Comoros
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow. 	Akatsiwri a ku mayiko a azungu anena kuti ogwira ntchito a chi silikaliwa ali gawo limodzi la ogwirira ntchito dziko la Russia monga akauniuni wa nzeru komanso gulu la nkhondo omwe akupeleka kukana kwa Moscow
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee. 	Kutumizidwa kwawo ku mayiko a ku Africa ndi njira yothandizira Russia kupezanso malo amphamvu kuti izilamulira o,we anayitayika ndikugwa kwa mgwirizano wa Soviet, anatero wakafukufuku wa CSIS Catrina Doxsee
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit. 	Kupezeka kwa Mercenaries kwakula  koposaposa kwambiri kuyambira mu 2019 mu mkumano wa Russia-Africa.
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university. 	Dziko laMoscow lakhala lochitachita makamakamu malo omwe akhala odziwika kuti ndi dera lomwe dziko la France imatakataka ku mayiko omwe anatengedwa mbuyomu monga CAR, ndi Mali, anatero Djallil Lounnas, wochita kafukufuku ku sukulu ya ukachenjede ya ku Morroco yotchedwa  Al Akhawayn university.
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said. 	Pamene ogwira ntchito a chisilikali nthawi zina amasamala zogulitsa za nkhondo za Russia, chuma cholowa "kuchepa kwambili kutengera ndi  phindu lomwe amapezapo kuchokera ku miala ya mtengo yapatali yomwe amakumba komanso zachilengedwe," anatero Doxsee
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public. 	Izi zimapangitsa maiko osakhazikika ndi miyala ya mtengo wa patali kapena ogula akuluakulu adzala ndi hdrocarbon monga ku Syria komwe asilikali a kunja odzagwira ganyu anayamba kudziwika kwa anthu ambili 
No questions asked 	Palibe funso linafunsidwa
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners. 	Lounnas anati ubwino wina wa ogula ndi kusowekera kwa kusemphana pa ma ufulu a anthu ndi ufulu wa ndale wa democracy womwe utha kubwera ndi opanga nawo mgwilizano wa malonda ochokera ku maiko a ku madzulo kwa azungu.
"Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions," he added. 	"Dziko la Russia lili ndi zomwe ikufunapo. Ilo silimafunsa mafunsa mafunso," anaphatikizirapo
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves. 	Mauthenga okhudzana nd ziwawa komanso kuzunza omwe akuchitika akusonyeza kutu zomwezi zitha kuchitikanso ndi asilikali a ganyu omwewanso
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters. 	Ku dziko la CAR,bungwe la gwilizano wa mayiko la United Nations likufufuzabe kuphedwa mawa chiwembu kwa anthu ambili komwe kunachitika nthawi yomwe asilikali a boma komanso a Wagner amagwilira ntchito limodzi.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions." 	mmodzi wa gulu la nkhondo anauza AFP kuti anthu opitilira 50 anafa ena mochita kunyongedwa osaweruzidwa
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner. 	Lachinayi, bungwe la European Union linanena kuti siliamba kuphunzitsa asilikali ku CAR zomwe zinayimitsidwa pakati pa mwezi wa December mpaka pokhapokha asilikali a dzikolo atasiya kugwilira ntchito dziko la Wagner
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them. 	Pakanali pano, zotsatira za asilikali a ganyuwa sizimafikira chiyembekezo cha boma lomwe linawalemba ganyulo.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful. 	Ku dziko la Libya, asilikali ochokera Russia analephera kwambili mu  yoyesetsa kugonjetsa likulu la Tripoli pa ntchito ya chaka chonse ya Marshal Khalifa Haftar, yomwe kwakukulu siyinapambane.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors. 	Ndipo ku Mocambique, asilikali aku Russia anathawa mmaso mwa gulu la dziko la chisilamu la Jihadi, komwe ndi kulephera kwakukulu ndi olimbana nawo a kumwera kwa Africa
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said. 	Ngakhale pali kupeleweledwa pa lusola chiyankhulo komanso ukadaulo pa ntchito ndi terrain, dziko la Wagner "anasankhidwa chifukwa anali osafuna ndalama zambili pa onse'" anatero Doxsee
"They didn't have what it took to succeed," she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa. 	"Analibe zowayenereza kuti apambane," iye anaphatikizamotero, pozindikira kuti " anakhalapo ndi kulehera kangapo konse" mayiko osiyanasiyana mu Africa
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis. 	Kupambana kwathunthu kutha kusokoneza ntchito ya asilikili a ganyuwa, yomwe kupita patsogolo kwake kumadalira zisokonezo, mikangano komanso mavuto.
"If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed," Doxsee said. 	"Ngati dziko monga CAR litawalemba iwo ntchito yophunzitsa a silikali ena kuti awathandizire kumenya nkhondo, ndizofunikira kwa iwo kuti agwire ntchitoyo ndi kuimaliza bwino ngati akufuna kuti apitilize kupatsidwabe ncthito," anatero Doxsee
"If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed." 	" Ngati atagwira ntchito bwino kwambili ndikuthetsa kusamvetsetsana, pamenepo sangafunikirenso."

US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa 	Bungwe la US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews. 	Abusa a Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo- Anagwiritsa nchito luso lawo lokhazikika mudzika lawo ku Africa kutumikira mwa machawi ku mudzi ya Alabama-Zikutengera kuti kodi ndinthawi yatali bwanji yomwe angafikire mabanja okhazikika omwe amabwera kuzapephera mu kachisi mwake Lamulung.
Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee. "If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people," he said. 	Mpindi zisanu ndi ziwiri ndipamalo pokoma makamaka kwa azungu komanso kwa iwo akhristu opuma omwe amapita ku mkumano wa mapemphero achiyankhuro cha chizungu ku Immaculate Conception Catholic Church mu mzinda waung'ono wa Wedowee." ukapitilira pamenepo, umasiya kumvetsera za anthu, anatero.
For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. "The more you preach, the better for them," he said. 	mMapephero amuchiyankhuro cha spanish pakatha ora limodzi, Wansembe wachi Nigeria mmodzi mwa otuikira ochuruka aku Afrika ku US- amadziwa kuti atha kutalikitsa nthawi yake yakuphinzitsa ndi kanayi. " mochuluka momwe ukulalikira, zabwino kwa iwo," anatero.
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass. 	Pamene amachoka pa udindo waku america kupita pena, Abanulo anaphunzira kumanga utumiki wake mogwirizana ndichikalidwe chamudera lomwe akutumikira pamene akuthandiziranso mzimu wa dziko lake mapemphero achipulumutso.
"Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church," Abanulo said. "They love to sing, they love to dance. The liturgy can last for two hours. They don't worry about that." 	Anthu aku Nigeria sakhala ndichidwi akabwera ku tchalitchi, Aanatero Abunulo. "Amakonda kuimba, amakonda kuvina. Mapemphero atha kutha maora awiri. Iwo sadandaura za zimenezo."
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church. As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies. 	Pamene anali ndi zaka 18 ku U.S , Abunulo wakalapo pamaudindo oyang'anira zamapemphero komanso kugwira nchito za Ubusa mdziko monse. Ntchito zabwino zakhara  zikupititlira kumveka  ku  matchalichi a chikatolika ku America. Mbadwadwa zobadwira ku amerika komko amuna komanso akazi analowa ku umsembe ndi usisitreri. Zigawo za U.S komanso mabugwe a katolika anasitha kukhala olemba athu dziko lonse polemba anthu omwe amafuna.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica. Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served. 	Zigawo za Birminham, komwe Abunulo amatsogolera mipingo iwiri, Wakulitsa kayang'ana malo okhazikitsa mpingo ndikuchulukitsa malo ogwilira ntchito achipepembedzo ngati Nigeria ndi Cameroon, anatero Abishop Steven Raica aku Birminham.

"They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us," he said. 	"Akhala akutithandiza kwambiri kuti tikwanitse kulinga mulingo komanso ukulu wa unduna omwe tili nawo kwa ife", anatero 
Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region. There, the seminaries are "fairly full," said the Rev. Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church. 	Ku Africa ndi chigawo chimene tchaitchi cha chi katolika  chakula mwachangu kwambiri. Kumene malo aansembe ndiodzadza, anatero Rev Thomas Gaunnt, Wankulu otsogolera  Sukulu yaukachenjede ya Centre for Applied  Research in the Apostolate,  imene imapanga kafukufuku wa mpingo wa katolika.
Falling numbers 	Kutsika kwa ma nambala.
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals. 	Ndizosiyana ndiku U.S kumene mpingo  wa katolika wakumana ndimavuto pakulemba anthu omwe akulira mu mpingo mommo kutsalira  kutsika kwa kabweledwe ka anthu ku mpingo kwa zaka teni zapitazi komanso kuonongeka kwa mbiri yomwe inafala ya nchititdwe ogonana wa pa mpingo.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership. 	Azimayi achikatolika komanso azibambo okwatira ndiokanizidwabe ku umsembe; Mtsutso ochotsa chiletsochi ukanathetsa vuto lakusowa kwa amsembe omwe sanapeze chikoka ndi chikhulupiliro kwa atsogoleri akulu akulu.
"What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country," Gaunt said. "Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality." 	Zomwe tilinazo pano ndi nambala yochipa kwambiri  kuyambira 1970 kulowa umsembe komanso usisiteri mudziko, Gaunt anatero. Iwo amene analowa mu zaka za mma 50 komanso 60 panopa ndi ndiokalamba, ndipo ma numbara akutengera  kambiri ndianthu omwe akumwalira.
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center. This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor. 	Kuchokera  1970 kufika 2020 ma numbera a amsembe ku U.S anatsika ndi 60%, kuengera mu kaundura yemwe anachokera ku GeorgetownCenter. Izi zasiya mipingo yopitilira 3,500 yopanda M'busa wamkuru okhazikika.
Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama. His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line. After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish. 	Abunulo amayang'anira mipingo iwiri ku mudzi wa Alabama. Mkumano wake weniweni wa lamulungu umayamba ndi mapempero achiyankhuro cha chizungu ku mpingo wa Holy Family Catholic  ku Linett, Mtunda wautali pafupifupi 200 kilomita (125 mailosi) kuchokera ku Birmingham  mmbari mwa Alabama-Georgia State line. akatha pamenepo amayendetsedwa kwa ora limodzi kupita ku Wedowee, komwe amakapanga chikondwelero chimodzi cha mapemphero achizungu, ena mu chi Spanish.
"He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories," said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988. 	Anangoyamba kuimba nyimbo ndipo aphunzitsi ake ambiri,  anaphatikizira chinayamata chake, ndipo ndinali okondwa kumva nkhani zimenezi, anatero  Amber Moosman, Mphunzitsi wa mulingo oyambilira  amene anali opemphera opuma pa mpingo wa  Holy Family kuyambira mchaka cha 1988.
For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. "There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that. … It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict," she said. "It's a lot different now." 	Kwa Moosman, kalalikidwe ka  Abunulo kanali kosiyana kwambiri  ndi Amsembe , mmbuyomu anachitira umboni. Panlibepo chodzidzimutsa, amsembe anaimba zommwe sanaimbepo…zinali zabata,za mwambo komanso zadongosolo, anatero, pali zosiyana zambiri tsopano.
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate pastor in the diocese of Oakland, California, where his ministry focused on the fast-growing Nigerian Catholic community. Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama. 	Abunulo anakhazikitsidwa  ku Nigeria mu chaka cha 1990 ndipo anabwera ku U.S mu chaka cha 2003 atakhalitsa ku Chad. Udindo wawo oyamba ku U.S anali M'busa othandizira muchigawo cha Oakland, Califonia, komwe utumiki wawo umayang'ana zakukura kwachangu kwa katolika ku mizinda yaku Nigeria. kuchokera nthawi imeneyo wakhara oyang'anira zamapemphera akuchipatara komanso M'busa ku Nashville, Tennessee komanso oyanga'anira za mapemphero pa sukulu yaukachenjede ya Alabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center. 	
Culture shocks 	Chikhalidwe chodabwitsa.
When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, "Where is West Virginia?" 	Pamene Maria Sheri Rukwishuro anauzidwa kuti akutumizidwa kuchoka ku Sisters of the Infant Jesus order yaku Zimbabwe kupita ku West virginia kukagwira ntchito za Mulungu dziko  lina,  anafunsa mayiwake wapamwamba, " kodi West Virginia ili kuti?"
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns. 	Iye amkaopa, kudandaura pazinthu zosadziwika
"What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country," Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004. 	Ndikupita kwa anthu amtundu wanji?

Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and "rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank. … She thought I was dirty." Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming. She's now a U.S. citizen and says, "It feels like home." 	Rukwishuro akukumbukira bwino lomwe kuti pakuonetseredwa koyamba, ka mtsikana kanalowa namusisita zala zanga ndi zala zake Njira yonse, kenako anayang'ana zala zake  ndipo anamwetulira koma ndi mtima wanga unakhala pansi, … Amkaona ngati ndine osasamalika ndi nyasi, " kupatura zimenezo Rukwishuro anati anthu ambiri akhara akumulandira iye bwino kwambiri. Ndipo pano ndi Mbadwa yaku U.S anatero, "ndikumakhara ngati kwathu.
One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall. "I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world," she said. "Now I love it. I do my meditations to that." 	Chikhalidwe choyamba chomwe chinamudabwitsa iye koyamba chinali kugwa kwa mvura youndanda usiku onse.

For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation. She recalled thinking, "Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine." 	Kwa Mulongo Christiana Onyewuche waku Nigeria, Yemwe anali oyang'anira zamapemphero  ndikutsogolera papemphero kwa iwo otsala pang'ono kumwalira,zinali zoopsa.

Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve. To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations. 	Onyewuche anati Mipingo yaku Africa itha kukumana ndimavuto  olumikizana ndi  mbadwa zaku Ameriza zomwe zikutumikira. Pokonza chimenechi zigawo zambiri zapatsidwa maphuziro okonza kayankhulidwe.

Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes. 	Abunulo yemwe anapita ku Alabama mu 2020, analakhura kuti anali wokondwa ndi undindo wake watsopano, zomwe zimatanthauza kusithana udindo ofewa ngati oyanga'nira mapephero pa sukulu ya ukachenjede ku mipingo yakumidzi iwiri.

But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, "There are no rednecks here. All I see are Jesus necks."

Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending 	Kukonza tsogolo la ntchito za mamangidwe za dziko la China mu Africapatatha zaka 10 zakubwereka
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas. But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.

Many countries have been eager for the investment, but mounting levels of debt over the past five years are raising doubts about the long-term prospects for more expensive infrastructure projects.

China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down. Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. The research looks at loan commitments which get "disbursed to borrowers as projects are implemented." 	China ndiyodzipeleka kubwereka mayiko a mu Africa ndalama zokwana 153 billion pakati pa chaka cha 2000 ndi 2019 koma changu cha kubwereketsaku chitha kukhala chikuchedwerapo.

In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.

Kuchokera mu 2000, Zambia yabwezako 1.2 billion kwa obwereketsa a ku China
Uganda now owes China $200 million for its only international airport, fanning fears that China could seize it. Both countries have rejected speculation in African media outlets of a Chinese takeover. 	Dziko la Uganda tsopano lili ndi ngongole ya China yokwana 200 million yokhudzana ndi ncthito yomanga bwalo la ndege , yomwe ikukuzamantha  kuti dziko la China litha kulanda bwaloli.

Loan repayment measures  Neighboring Kenya had received a $4.5 billion loan to build a railway from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, and China indicates it will redo the terms after a committee of the African countrys parliament found that operating losses and debt to Chinese banks were straining taxpayers.

Some analysts have warned that opaque lending terms means China could eventually seize infrastructure should countries struggle to meet repayments 	Oyikira ndemanga enaachenjenjeza China kamba ka ndondomeko zobwereketsera zosaoneka bwinobwino zomwe zikutanthauza kuti China itha kulanda zomangidwazo pamene mayiko obwerekawa atalephera kukwanilitsa kubweza
U.S. and British officials say, "debt traps," where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time. Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire "significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera." 	Owira ntcito ku U.Skomanso ochokeraku Britain ati "misampha ya ngongole,"" pamene mayiko sangakwanitse kupeza ndalama zokwanira kubweza ngongole za dziko la China inaknzedwa kuti adzapeleke mwayi kwa Beijing kwaka nthawi.

"Not a single project in Africa has ever been "confiscated" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans. On the contrary, China firmly supports and is willing to continue our efforts to improve Africa's capacity for home-driven development," stated the Chinese Embassy in Uganda. 	Palibe olo ntchito olo imodzi ku Africa yomwe inalandidwapo ndi dziko la China chifukwa cholephera kubweza ngongole.

Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA. Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms. 	Mmalo molanda chumacho, Beijing mwachidziwikire iwonjezera nthawi yomalizirakubweza ngongole kapena kukonzansondondomeko za mabwezedwe monga banyira, anatero katswiri ozukuta nkhaniyi pouza VOA.Ndondomeko zimenezo ziletsa kulanda zomangidwazo ndipo mbali inayi zikonza mbili ya China ku Africa kome malonda ndikubwerekana kuli ndi mphamvu yayikulu motsutsana ndi ndalama ya kwa azungu.
China will probably "keep kicking the can down the road" until creditors find the means to settle the loans, Bulelani Jili, an African studies Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, told VOA. 	
To confiscate any assets, including minerals, would "confirm peoples initial biases of China as a neocolonial actor," Jili said, and risk upsetting diplomatic ties with "some of the few friends that China has on the global stage."

Chinese loan concerns 	Madando okhudzana ndi ngongole zopelekedwa ndi anthu a ku China
China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. It is trying to "equal the U.S." as a donor country, he said. 	Dziko la China limalimbikitsa kubwereketsa ndalama ku mayiko a mu Africa pofuna zopindulitsa zambili pa zobzyala komanso mbili ya bwino pa dziko lonse lapansi yothandiza mayiko osauka., anatero Edward Miguel,mphunzitsi wa Environmental Resources Economics pa university ya Califonia ku Berkeley.  Ikuyesera kufanana ndi U.S"  ngati diko lopereka, anatero
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes. 	Komabe, dziko la China  limasiyana ndimayiko ena obwereketsa ndiwothandiza makamaka chifukwa chakusowa kauniuni komanso kuika poyera zinthu zomwe zimabweretsa mafunso ku Africa komansokumayiko aazungu, Miguel anakhulupilira choncho.
Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as "no strings attached," which has been attractive for many countries.  But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. 	Kupatula ngongole zochokera kwa azungu, kapena mabungwe obwereketsa apadziko lonse lapansi  monga World Bank , zomwe zimafunika ntchito komanso kuteteza za chilengedwe  pa ntchito zopatsilidwa ndalama, chithandizo cha China ndi ngongole zopita ku Africa zinafotokozedwa ngati "zilibe cholowa kwa opeleka," zomwe zinakopa mayiko ambili.Koma mayiko a ku Africa makamaka omwe chuma chawo n'chovutika chifukwa cha COVID 19, amakumana ndi zovuta kubweza ngongole, anatero Hannah Ryder,Senior associate wa African Program at U.S think tank for strategic and international studies
"China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another," wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article. 	" Dziko la China ndi mayiko ena akukhala ovuta kumvetsetsa mukupanga malonda opindulira onse," analemba Deborah Brautigamwa ku Shool of advance International studiesku John Hopkins University ndi Havard Business School mu zolemb limodzi.
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted. 	Anthu okhala ku Dakar, Senegal, komwe bwalo la anthu 500 pa mkumano wa mgwirizano wa China ndi AFRICA (China-Africa cooperation meeting) unachitika mu November kuchokera pa 29 mpaka pa 30, akufuna zomangidwa zothandizidwa ndi ndalama zochokera kwa anthu a ku China koma popanda milingo ya ngongole ngati ya mma 1990, Ryder anazindikiraichi.
Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already "sobered down" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said. 	Obwereketsa ndalama aku China akuyembekezeredwa kubwereketsa ndalama zochepa kutsogolo kunokomanso osamalitsa polingalira kuti ndi tchito zanji ngongolezo zitathandizire, akatswiri atero. Ngongole zatsika kuchokera pamwamba mu 2014, Jili anatero
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018. 	Kudzipeleka pa ngongole ndi zinthu zina zomwe zinapangidwa ku mkumano wa Africa-China Cooperation kunafika pa $40 billion, kutsika ndi gawo limodzi pa magawo atatu poyelekezera ndi $60 billion yomwe inapangidwa pa mkumano ngati omwewu mu chaka cha 2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington. Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview. 	Obwereketsa ndalama atha kuyeza ngongole pa kulosera za nthawi yamtsogolo mlili wa COVID 19 ukadzapita pamene mayiko a ku Africa adzakhale ndi ndalama zambili, anatero Yun Sun, otsogoleranawo wa East Asia Programku Stimson Center ku Washington. China ndichakuonetsetsetsa kusasiyanitsa pa anthu a ku China pa ntchito zamtsogolomonga kuombola ngongole zakale, iye anatero mu kucheza kwake ndi a VOA.
"Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while," Sun said. 	"ichi ndi chiopsezo pa ndalechifukwa ngakahale kusinthanaku sikofanana, zikuoneka ngati ndi kusinthana, ndipo kuti China ikupindulapo pa mavuto a Africa, choncho sindikuganiza kuti izi zichitika pompano ndipo chilungamo chake ndi chakuti kuumbanso kwa ngongole iyi kukutenganso nthawi," Sun anatero
China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary. International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening "their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs in exchange for loans," wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies. 	China ikuyamba kulimba mtima mu nthawi yonseyi pakupanga maubale ndi mayiko a kunja ngakhale mayiko ambili a ku Africa akanai ndi nkhawa zokhudzana ndi vuto lakubwereza kwa ngongole mu zaka za ma 1980 ndi mma 1990 pamene mayiko anakanika kubweza ngongole, Yrdey akutero mu ndemanga yake  mu African Business Commentary.Mabungwe a mayiko angapo anazichotsa izi zakuti mphepo ya ngongole zosakwanitsika zomwe zili ndi zifukwa kuphatikizapo kutsegura chuma chawo ku malonda ndi mayiko ena ,..............., komanso kutsitsa mitengo kwambili posinthana ndi ngongole," Peter Fabrics analemba mu Institute for Security Studies.
Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking "what did we agree to do" and "how much do we owe" China. 	Kubwera mtsogolokufika pano, ndi ngongole zopelekedwa ndi dziko la China, mayiko a ku Africa nthawi zambili amathera kupempha, anatero Miguel, "Tinavomera kuti tidzatani" komanso "tili ndi ngongole yambili bwanji" ya China.
	
	
	
	
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers 	Dutch apeza  odwara nthenda yatsopana ya Variant atamaliza kupeza anthu 61 opezeka ndi COVID mkatikati mwa anthu kwera magalimoto amatora.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.

A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.

Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change 	Owona zanyengo ku zimbabwe akufana zithu zapamwamba kwambiri zokhudza kusintha kwa nyengo.
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change. Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out. 	Azanyengo akuzimbabwe aonetsa kukwiya kwa Mtsogoleli wadziko  Emmerson Mnangagwa pakuyankhura kwake  pamkumano wa COP26, pomwe anapempha boma lake kulimbana ndi kaduludwe kamitengo kosasamala ndikusintha kwa nyengo. Owona zanyengo anati boma lilipakalikiliki  opeleka malo kuma  kampani, kwambiri ma china, kwa opanga mphamvu zamagetsi kuchokera kumiyara, zomwe a COPE 26 amafuna kuzithetsa.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere. 	Lachiwiri ku Scotland, Mtsogoleli Emmerso Mnangagwa anayankhura pa nsonkhano wa maiko  wazakusintha kwa nyengo wa 2021,kudziwika ngati COP26, komwe anapepmpha maiko olemera kuti alipile chifukwa chowononga mpweya wamulengalenga pakuchotsa mpweya  mulengalenga.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions. 	Anati maiko ovutika ngati Zimbabwe  amalipira pazotsatirazi zakuonongeka kwa mpweyako.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change. 	Anapemphanso dziko lake kuti agwilizane polimbana nikusintha kwa nyengo.
"Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030. Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy," Mnangagwa said. 	Zimbabwe yaunikanso momwe dziko lawo lifunile kuthanizira,  njira lodzipeleka ndi 40%  pa malo aliwonse ochepetsera kuochotsedwa kwa mpweya mulengalenga kulunjika ku 2030. njira zapamwamba zakhazikitsidwa pakulunjika cholingachathu chachikulu  pakusintha kwa nyengo  ndikuzolowera komanso kukhazikitsa bata mu zigawo zathu zonse za zachuma, " anatero  Mnangagwa.
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use. 	Izi zimabwera panthawi yomwe owona zanyengo ku zimbabwe anapempha boma kuti Lerande chitupa chachilolezo chomwe chinapelekedwa posachedwapa ku kampani yama china  kuti azikumba miyara yantengo wapatari kuti azigwilitsa ntchito pa mpamvu zamagetsi.
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license. The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation. 	Bungwe la Center for Naturural Resource Governance nsi bungwe limodzi lomwe limatsutsana ndi chitupachi. Gululi limalimbikitsa mpamvu za chilengedwe, ndipo amaopa kuti kukumbidwa kwa miyarayi kudzapangitsa kuonongeka kwachilengedwe kwambiri.
Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on. 	Henry Nyapokoto wamkulu oyang'anira madongosolo a gululi,  anati ndemanga ya Mnangagwa  ikukamba zosiyana ndizomwe iyi waona zikuchitika.
"But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy. In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster. We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife," Nyapokoto said. 	Koma bomalakhala patsogolo kuyendetsa ndikulimbikitsa kukumba miyara paliponse pofuna kukwaniritsa chuma chakumiyara chokwana $12  billion. Koma  kunena zoona izi  sizingatheke Zimbabwe kupeza chuma chokwana $12 billion kudalira njiora zoipa zopangira katundu,  kagwilitsidwe kolakwika,zimenezi zisiya chilema chachikulu ku zachilengedwe kape  mbilri yakuonongeka kwa zachilengedwe. Tonse timadziwa kuti kukumba miyara yamtengo wapatali kumabwera ndikuononga kwa nkhalango yomwe imachotsa mpweya oipa  komanso malo akhara zinyama zakutchire., " anatero Nyapokoto.
Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation. 	Nyapokoto anaonjezera kuti Zimbabwe imatulutsa mafuta  komanso mpweya kuchipata chake chuku mpoto ndi Zambiya, Zochitika zina zomwe zikanapangitsa kuonongeka kwa chilengedwe.
"Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems. Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining. That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow," Nyapokoto said. 	Kupatura kukhudzika kwa mafuta  komanso mpweya  kwa kuonongeka kwa mpweya wa mulengalenga, pakhala voto loonekera pompano lolunjika mafutawa komanso kukumba mpweya  kumamidzi kapena ku zachilengedwe. Malo alambulidwa chifukwa cha kukumba miyara komanso kumanga zinthu zina zomwe zithandizile kukumba miyara. Izo ndizosemphana ndikukonza zachuma zomwe iwo amakamba ku Glasgow'" Anatero Nyapotoko.
He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually. 	Anati Zimbabwe ili mu ndandanda wa maiko 10 akuononga chilengedwe. Ndi pafupifupi 300,000 ekara ya nkhalango  zimaonongedwa pachaka.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy. 	Koma Byron Zamasiya wa bungwe la Zimbabwe Enviromental Law Association anati Mnangagwa  ananena zoona  mukulankhura kwaku ku COP26 zakulimbana ndikuononga chilengedwe komwe akupangitsa iwo ofuna Mphavu.
"So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe. The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming. What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation. We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields," Zamasiya said. 	Ndiye nkhani yolimbana ndi kuononga chilengedwe ndyofunikira kumaikamo pamene pakuyankhulidwa za malo achilengedweochotsa mpweya oipa mulengalenga ku zimbabwe. Mitengo imagwira ntchito yoyamwa mpweya ndipoimayamwa mpweya owonongeka, omwe ndioyambitsa kwambiri kuonongeka kwa mpweya wamulengalenga. Chomwe tingafune ngati dziko ndikupeza njira ina yopezera mpamvu, makamaka kumamidzi komwe amadalira mkhuni ndipo zimaonjezre gawo lalikulu ku kuononga chilengedwe. tikuyeneranso kulimbikitsa maulimi ang'ono ang'ono omwe amasiyanda ndi ulumi akulu akulu omwe amafuna mindi yaukulu ndikulambula maro ankhalando akulu kuti pakhale minda, Anatero Zamasiya.
The Environmental Management Agency in Zimbabwe has been fining people caught cutting or burning forests. But so far, that hasnt stopped the trees from coming down. 	Bungwe la Enviromental Management Agency ku Zimbabwe lakhala likulipilitsa chindapusa anthu omwe amagwidwa akudura komanso kuyatsa nkhalango.  Koma pakanali pano izi sizinaimitse kuduliwa kwa mitengo.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government has announced it is starting to vaccinate Zimbabwes teenagers over the age of 16 against COVID-19, which has claimed nearly 5,000 lives and infected 13,000 in the country.

He then announced the recommendation regarding those over the age of 16. 	Ndipo iye analengeza zoyenelera ktuengera iwo opyora zaka 16.
"Based on the available scientific data in line with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe guide, the specialist pediatricians have recommended a vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age group with the Sinovac COVID19 vaccine," said Murwira.

"The protocol of the younger age groups is still under consideration. The ministry wishes to advise the public that COVID19 vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age groups has been approved. The government of Zimbabwe through the Ministry of Health and Childcare is determined that Zimbabwe achieves herd immunity by end December 2021," he added.

Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, is hopeful the move would increase the number of people getting vaccinated and will push the country further to achieving head immunity. 	Dr, Norman Marata mkulu wa  Zimbabwe Association fro Doctor for Human Rights,  ali ndichiyembekezo kuti dongosolori lichilutsa numbala ya anthu omwe abayitse katemera ndipo zithandizira kuti dziko lipite patsogolo kukwanitsa cholinga chopeleka katemera kwa aliyense.
"This is a welcome move, but we just hope that the vaccine will continue to be voluntary and that these teenagers will not be mandated to get vaccines in schools and colleges. But people should just continue to voluntarily get the vaccines," he said. 	Iyi ndi njira yabwino,  koma tikukhulipilira kuti katemerayu apitilira kukhara waulele ndipo ana achisodzerawa sakakamizidwa kulandira katemera ku sukulu komanso ku sukulu zaukachenjede.

Itai Rusike, head of nonprofit Community Working Group on Health in Zimbabwe, commended the government for the announcement as it helps the country reach its target of vaccinating at least 10 million Zimbabweans — or 60% of the population — by the end of the year.

"This is important in order to prevent the teenagers from COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and even death, especially from the looming threat of the new delta variant. It is also important that the school health coordinators are equipped with the necessary COVID-19 vaccine literacy so that they can then assist in educating the students, the teachers and support staff on the importance of getting vaccinated. It is also important that the community leaders should play a critical role in being our COVID-19 champions and ambassadors so that they can encourage the parents and the children within their communities to embrace the vaccines," said Rusike.

Winding up an annual conference of the ruling ZANU-PF party Saturday in Bindura, 80 kilometers north of Zimbabwes capital, Mnangagwa said he was looking forward to attending the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Scotland, which begins Sunday.

"I wish to inform the conference that tomorrow morning (Sunday) I travel to Glasgow, United Kingdom, after over two decades have passed without Zimbabwe leadership going to United Kingdom.

Mnangagwa also said he was happy about a report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Alena Douhan after a two-week visit to Zimbabwe. The Belarus national urged the U.S. and other Western governments to lift sanctions they imposed on Zimbabwe nearly two decades ago and for alleged election-rigging and human rights abuses.

But in an audio statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Harare, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said sanctions on Zimbabwes leadership were not hurting ordinary citizens. 	Koma mau otepedwa omwe anatulutsidwa  ku nyumba youanganira mbadzwa zaku U.S ku Harare, Kazembe wa U.S ku United Nation Linda Thomas Greenfield anati chilango cha atsogoleri aku Zimbabwe   sichimapweteka  mbadwa zawamba.
"Our sanctions target individuals and institutions that are committing human rights violations. And we make every effort to ensure those sanctions do not impact the people. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a result of bad policies in Zimbabwe. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a consequence of their leadership. It is not a consequence of our sanctions, and we will always resist any criticism that says our sanctions are impacting people unfairly. We are criticized by the government [of Zimbabwe] for these actions because they know they are responsible for these actions. I regret that the special rapporteur decided to put this in [her] report," Thomas-Greenfield said.

The European Union imposed travel and financial sanctions on then-Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and his allies in 2002, in response to reports of election-rigging and human rights. The U.S. followed suit with sanctions in 2003. 	Bungwe la European Union  anaika mokakamiza ziletso za mayendedwe ndi chuma pa mtsogoleri wa dziko la Zimbabwe wa nthawi imeneyo, a Robert Mugabe ndi ogwirizana nawo mu chaka cha 2002 potsatana ndi kubeledwa kwa zisankho komanso ma ufulu wa obadwa nawo.

A court in Zimbabwe Friday ordered the release of about 40 veterans of the nations 1970s independence war, four days after they tried to petition President Emmerson Mnangagwa about their low monthly pension.

"Its not a crime to demonstrate in Zimbabwe, its not a crime to petition. Its actually provided for by the constitution," Saurombe said. "So in anything that has to be done, it has to be done in those ambits of the constitution or in those constitutional provisions. And our clients were following constitutional provisions, so to say they committed a crime it would rather be absurd." 	"Kupanga zionetsero ku Zimbabwe si mlandu, simlandu kupeleka madando. Makamakanso malamulo aakulu mdzikoamalora kutero," anatero Saurombe."Tsono pa chilichonse chomwe chingachitike zikuyenera kukhala mu malire oyikidwa ndi lamulo lalikululi(constitution) kapena zomwe zili zololedwa ndi lamuloli.

Addressing senior members of the ruling ZANU-PF party Friday in Bindura, about 80 kilometers north of Harare, President Mnangagwa said the war veterans had broken protocol. 	Powayankhura akuluakulu a chipani cholamura cha ZANU-PF lachisanu ku Bindura, pafupifupi ma kilomita 80 ku mpoto kwa Harare, Mtsogoleri wa dziko Mnangagwa anati nkhalakale za nkhondozi sanatsate dongososlo loyenera.
"Various initiatives have been implemented to improve the dignity, welfare and economic empowerment of veterans of the liberation struggle and dependence of the heroes," Mnangagwa said. "But I urge the war veterans to use procedures in the party, not outside the party.Their rich ideological grounding should galvanize the principle of patriotism in the hearts and minds of cadres and embolden them in their efforts to ensure that ZANU-PF remains the party of choice which wholeheartedly serves the people." 	Bntchito zosiyanasiyana zakhazikitsidwa pofuna kupititsa patsogolo ulemu, chisamaliro komanso kuchita bwino pa chuma cha a nkhalakalewa pa mavuto aku masulidwa komanso podalira kwa ngwazizi," Mnangagwa anatero.

At the court, one of the war veterans, who identified himself as Cde Tendai, said he was relieved his colleagues had been granted bail because some of them have chronic conditions. 	Ku bwalo la milandu,mmodzi mwa ankhalakalewa yemwe anazitchura Cde Tendai,anati iye mtima wake unatsika pansi atamva kuti amzake atulutsidwa pa belo chifukwa ena mwa iwo ali ndi matenda akabwerebwere
"We were concerned by their health," Tendai said. "We feared that some of them may have died because most war veterans are stressed by so many things. We were surprised by their arrests. We were not violent, we respect the rule of law and our government. The only issue was: we want to petition since we are getting very little money considering how life is difficult." 	"Timakhudzika chifukwa cha thanzi lawo," anatero Tendai. "Tinali ndimantha kuti ena athakumwalira poti ankhalekale ambili ali ndi ziphinjo zambili. Tinadabwandi kumangidwa kwawo . Sitinapange ziwawa zilizonse, tiamalemekeza lamulo komanso boma lathu.

Zimbabwe Government: No COVID-19 Shot, No Work, No Pay  	Boma la Zimbabwe: Osabayitsa katemera wa Covid, osagwira ntchito, osalandira ndalama
Union leaders have angrily reacted to the Zimbabwean governments announcement Sunday that workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be allowed at work and will not be paid. This is seen as part of efforts to deal with high vaccination hesitancy in the southern African nation. . 	Atsogolero a mgwirizano mokwiya ayankhapo pa zomwe boma la Zimbabwe linalengeza lamulungu kuti ogwira ntchito omwe sanabayitse katemera wa Covid 19 sadziloledwa kugwira ntchito ndipo sadzilipilidwa. Izi zikuonedwa ngati njira yopangitsa anthu ambili omwe akuzengereza kukabayitsa ku mmwera kwa Afrika kuti abayitse.
Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana, Zimbabwes secretary for information, over the weekend told government-controlled media that all civil servants who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be allowed to work come Monday. 	Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana amene ndi mlembi wa oulutsa nkhani, kumapeto kwasabataku anauza nyumba zoulutsa nkhani zoyendetsedwa ndi boma kuti onse ogwira htchito m'boma amene sanabayitse katenera wa COVID-19 sadziloledwa kugwira ntcito kuyambira lolemba.
"There is no extension to the deadline of 15 October, when civil servants are expected to all having been vaccinated, failure of which those who are not vaccinated would not be allowed to work. And further to that is the fact that those who are not vaccinated and those who are not working will not be paid because the thrust is that if you do not work, you dont get paid," he said. 	"Palibe kuonjezera masiku kuli konse kuchoka pa 15 October pamene ogwira ntchito m'boma onse akuyembekezereka kukhala atabayitsa katemera wa COVID -19, kulephera kutero kwa osabaitsa sadzaloledwa kugwira ntchito. Kaphatikizira pamenepo kuti omwe sanabayitse ndipo sakugwira ntchitosadzalandira ndalama chifukwa nkhani ndi yakuti ngati sunagwire ntchito usalipilidwe," iye anatero.
Schoolteachers, who constitute the largest proportion of Zimbabwes civil servants, say the Friday deadline the government set was unilateral. 	Aphunzitsi a masukulu omwe ndi gawo lalikulu la ogwira ntchito m'boma ku Zimbabwe, ati tsiku lomaliza la lachisanu lomwe boma linanena anapanga a boma okha osakhudza iwo
"Fundamentally, there was no agreement over the issue of vaccination," said Takavafira Zhou, president of Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe. "Our position as workers has always remained that we encourage our members to be vaccinated. But by no means should our encouragement be misconstrued for mandatory vaccination. Our position is very clear: vaccination must be voluntary. Not mandatory. We must invest in the efficacy of vaccination — explaining to members how vaccination would assist them in terms of boosting their immunity but that has not been done." 	Momwe zimakhalira, panalibepo mgwirizano okhudzana ndinkhani ya katemera," anatero Takavafira Zhou, mkulu wa bungwe la wa aphunzitsi la Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe."Mfundo yathu ngati ogwira ntchito nthawi zonse timalimbikitsa anthu athu kuti akabayitse. Koma pasapezeke njira iliyonse yomwe chilimbikitso chomwe timapelekachi chitengedwe molakwika kuti chikhale lamulo kwa liyense kuti akabayitse katemera. Ganizo lathu ndi lomveka bwino: kubayitsa kukhale chisankho cha munthu osati lamulo. Tigwilire ncthito kufunikira kwa katemera-kufotokozera anthu athu momwe katemera amawathandizira iwo pokulitsa chitetezo cha mthupi mwawo koma zimenezi sizinachitidwe."
Zimbabwes government says it has fully vaccinated 2,472,859 people since the program started in February. 	Boma la Zimbabwe lati labaya katenmera kwathunthu anthu okwanira 2,472,859 chiyambireni dongosololi linayambira mu February
Zhou said Zimbabweans were shunning vaccinations for several reasons that the government must first understand, from religious reasons to lack of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines to lack of trust in the imported Chinese SINOVAC and SINOPHARM vaccines. 	Zhou anati anthu aku Zimbabwe amathawa kubayitsa katemera pa zifukwa zambili zomwe boma likuyenera kumvetsetsa kaye kuchokera ku zifukwa za zipembedzo zokhudzana ndi kusowekera chidziwitso pa nkhani za katemera wa COVID-19 kufikira pa kusowa chikhulupiliro cha pa katemera wopangidwa ndi anthu a ku China wotchedwa SINOVAC ndi SINOPHARM
He said all civil servants must continue coming to work while unions were considering going to court over purported dismissals. 	Iye anati ogwira ntchito m'boma onse apitilize kupita ku ncthito pamene bungweli likuganizira zopita ku bwalo la milandu pa nkhani ya ganizo lofuna kuwachotsa ntchito
"The members will only stop going to work if there is a formal letter from the Public Service Commission dismissing them. But even with that formal letter, it will still be challenged because its legality must also be established. But as of now the teachers still remain at their stations, demotivated of course, shimmering in poverty and misery but they remain employees of the government," he said. 	Anthuwa asiya kupita ku ntchito ngati pali kalata yowachotsa ntchito yochokera ku ma ofesi a boma a Public Service Commission. Komabe ingakhake kalatayi itapelekedwa, idzafunsidwabe pakuti lamulo lomwe likutsatidwa lidzayenera lioneke.Koma pakanali pano, aphunzitsi apitilira kupita ku malo awo antchito, obwezedwa mbuyo ndithu, ovutitika mu umphawi  komanso zosautsa koabe akhalabe ogwilira ntchito boma," iye anatero.
Zimbabwe currently has 132,333 confirmed coronavirus infections and 4,657 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which tracks the global outbreak. Civil servants — especially teachers — have long complained about lack of adequate protective equipment in classrooms to curb the spread of COVID-19. Zimbabwes government, however, maintains it is providing enough resources in the fight against the pandemic. 	Pakali pano athu omwe anadziwika kuti anapezeka ndi kachirombo ka Corona ku Zimbabwe alipo okwanira 132,333 komanso anthu omwalira ndi akchiromboka okwira 4,657 kutengera zotsatira zopezedwandi a Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, omwe amautsata mliliwu.

Boma la Zimbabwe komabe likupitilizakunena kuti likupeleka ziangizo zokwanira polimbana ndi mliliwu.
	
	
	
	
New Zealand Cricket Team Cancels Pakistan Tour Over Security Concerns 	Gulu losewera masewera acricket yakanika kupita kukaona ku Pakistan kamba ka chitetezo
A New Zealand cricket team announced it was abandoning its tour of Pakistan, citing security concerns Friday, the day it was supposed to have its first match.   "Following an escalation in the New Zealand Government threat levels for Pakistan, and advice from NZC security advisers on the ground, it has been decided the BLACKCAPS will not continue with the tour," a press statement from the New Zealand cricket team said. 	Gulu losewera masewero a cricket la ku New Zealand lalengeza kutaya ulendo wokayendera Pakistan,potchura chfukwa cha mantha pa nkhani ya chitetezo la chisanu lapitali lomwe linali tsiku limene limayenera kukhala ndi masewero awo oyambilira, kutsatira kukura mulingo kwa chiopsezo kuboma la New  zealand ndi Pakistan, komanso uphungu ochokera  kwa mulangizi wa chitetezo wa NZC yemwe akuyanganira, kwapangidwa chiganizo kuti BLACKCAP  sapitilira ndi ulendo wawo. zinayankhulidwa kuchokera  ku gulu la masewero a clicket la New zealand anataero.
Pakistani officials reacted strongly, calling the decision "unilateral" and a conspiracy against Pakistans image.   "None of our various intelligence agencies had received any indication of a security threat," said Pakistans Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed.   He added that Pakistan had offered to hold the matches without spectators, but the offer was rejected.  Pakistani Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi said he was "appalled" at the decision.   "Sadly, global politics has won over the great game of cricket! There were no security threats! @jacindaardern," he said, tagging the New Zealand prime minister in his tweet. 	Akulu akuluaku Pakistan anayankha mokwiya ,  kunena chiganizocho, "ndichambali imodzi" komanso coononga chithunzi thunzi cha Pakistan. " Palibe aliyense wa gulu la zachitetezo athu omwe analandilapo chizindikiro chilichonse  choopsea chitetezo.,  Nduna Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed anatero.

" Mokwiya"  a global politics anawina pama sewero akulu a clicket! panalibepo chiopsezo pachitetezo! pa jacindaardem, " anatero pouza nduna yaku New zealand patamba lawo lamchezo la tweeter.
Prime Minister Imran Khan personally called Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to guarantee the teams safety, but she stood by her teams decision, according to Ahmed and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).   The PCB said it had arranged "fool proof security" for the visiting team and New Zealand security officials had been satisfied with their arrangements.   "[C]ricket lovers in Pakistan and around the world will be disappointed by this last-minute withdrawal," the board said.   The chief executive of the Black Caps, David White, said he could not ignore the advice he was receiving.   "I understand this will be a blow for the PCB, who have been wonderful hosts, but player safety is paramount, and we believe this is the only responsible option," he said.   The two sides were to play three one-day matches in Rawalpindi, known as the twin city of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, followed by a series of five limited over matches or T-20s in Pakistans second-largest city, Lahore. 	Nduna Imran Khan paiye yekha anaitana nduna Jcinda Ardern kutsimikizira za chitetezo cha magulu amasewero, koma iwo anakhalabe kuchiganizo cha gulu lawo lamasewero,kumbali ya Ahamed komanso Pakistani Cricket Board(PCB).

The chief executive of the PCB, Wasim Khan, told VOA the New Zealand team would head home Saturday on a chartered plane.   An English cricket team was scheduled to visit Pakistan in October, but Interior Minister Ahmed said that tour also was now in doubt.   "Ministry of Interior has informed me that the English team is also thinking along the same lines. On our part, we are ready to welcome them. There is no security threat in our country to either New Zealand or England," he said.   International cricket teams stopped visiting Pakistan after an attack on a Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009 in Lahore that wounded seven members of the team.   Pakistan went through several years of violence starting approximately in 2007 as extremist groups blaming Pakistan for siding with the United States in its war on terror started attacking both its security forces and civilians.   Pakistani officials claim up to 80,000 of their citizens died in these attacks, and the country suffered up to $150 billion worth of damage to its economy.   In 2016, Pakistani cricket authorities formed the Pakistan Super League, six cricket teams representing six cities. The teams included international players in an effort to revive international cricket in Pakistan. The first two seasons of the league were played outside Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.   The first international team to return to Pakistan was Zimbabwe in 2015.

Mkumanawu cholinga chake kunali  kupeza njira zomwe maboma amu Africa  angatahnirane ndimavuto amenewa pochepetsa kapena kupewa mkangano..
Africa generates about 3% percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the lowest of any continent. But its more vulnerable than any other region in the world, since Africans depend so heavily on their natural environment for food, water and medicine. 	Africa imapanga pafupifupi 3% ya malo omwe amachotsa mpweya oipa mulengalenga, ali pansi pa makomtineti onse, koma ndizosafunikira kwambiri kusiyana ndi zigawo zonse zapa dzikolapansi, pakuti Africa imadalira kwambiri pa zachilengedwa chawo pa zakudya, madzi komanso mankhwala.

"Our first obligation for us and for African countries must always be to ensure the well-being of our people through access to development services, including electricity, health care, education, safe jobs and a safe environment, including access to clean cooking fuels. We must prioritize solutions that align the development and climate agenda, and that is absolutely important," said Osinbajo.

Ghana environment minister Kwaku Afriyie explains how climate change has impacted agricultural lands in the country. 	Nduna yoona za nyengo ku Ghana Kwaku Afriyie anafotokoza momwe kusintha kwa nyengo kwa khudzira malo aulimi mdzikomo.
"The harsh and deteriorating climate conditions in northern Ghana undoubtedly energized region-growing food insecurity and seasonal north-to-south migration. And besides, increasing of floods and protracted drought lead to displacement of people. Statistics show that over the last few years, there has been a new internal displacement which has occurred in Ghana due to climate-induced disasters and even beyond our borders," he said. 	"Kuvuta ndikupitilira kwa kuvuta kwa nyengo yoononga ku mpoto kwa Ghana mosakaikitsa zionjezera kukula kwa kusowa chakudya ndipo zipangitsa anthu kuchoa ku mpoto kupita ku mwera.

"The challenge has not been that we havent developed yet these structures. The challenge has been we have not utilized them yet effectively, and that goes to issues of national sovereignty and the unwillingness of member states to have others, as it were, take an active interest and maybe recommend the things that need to be done in order to respond to a particular crisis. And if we recognize we are all in this together, then that certainly has to change," she said. 	"Sikuti vuto lakhala kuti sitinamange zinthu zimenezi.

So, we are very excited to see this happening and it can only show that we are definitely moving in the right direction," Koti said.

Clement Mukwasi, a spokesman for Shearwater, one of the tourism operators in Victoria Falls, sounded an optimistic tone.  "It is the industrys hope that towards the end of the pandemic – which we think we are in – there shall be some credit lines extended to the industry for the industry to recover. We applaud the government for taking our call to open the borders of Zambia and Botswana because Victoria Falls has reached its herd immunity. We are hoping that in addition to opening the borders, they are also going to set up a policy on how people should flow across all three countries," he said.  Mukwasi said those who are vaccinated should be allowed to move across the country without any problem, while those who are not vaccinated should produce results showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19.  Zimbabwe currently has 101,711 confirmed coronavirus infections and 3,280 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.   The government says the vaccination program will intensify after the arrival of more doses from China in the coming days.

UNHCR Voices Concern After Botswana Deports Zimbabwean Refugees 	UNHCR Voices yokhudzidwa dziko la Botswana litabweza anthu othawa kwawo a ku Zimbabwe
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says it is concerned after Botswana deported 57 Zimbabwean refugees who had lived in the host country since 2008. The refugees reportedly failed to register for voluntary repatriation, which led to their forced removal late last week.   The UNHCRs external relations officer, Kate Pond, says the refugees, irrespective of their status, have rights and could have been allowed to remain as permanent residents.  "UNHCR remains concerned that Zimbabweans who have been in Botswana for over a decade have been removed to Zimbabwe in less than voluntary circumstances. Irrespective of their status they still have certain rights, and UNHCR had aimed for alternative solutions, like those provided to Zimbabweans who have family links in Botswana and may be able to remain in the country as permanent residents," Pond said.  One of the deported refugees, speaking on condition of anonymity, says they were rounded up Thursday and told to board a bus which took them to Zimbabwes border.  "We left Botswana on empty stomachs. We were deported to the border and we didnt get any assistance. We wanted to remain in Botswana; thats why we did not register [for repatriation]. We have nothing, we dont know where to start. We had children going to school. It will be difficult without documents like passports and identity cards," the refugee said.  The deportees had been living at the Dukwi refugee camp. Botswanas government had warned that refugees who did not register would be deported.   Last month, Botswana sent back more than 200 other Zimbabweans who had registered for voluntary repatriation.  The repatriated refugees had initially refused to do so, citing fears of persecution in their homeland.  Most were opposition activists whose homes were burned down during a deadly presidential election campaign in 2008.  But one of the returnees, Bheki Weza, says they have surprisingly been well received in Zimbabwe despite their earlier safety concerns.  "We are very happy about the situation. As we speak, I am now home still trying to settle down and adjust to the difficult economic conditions here in Zimbabwe. But I am happy because there is still peace surrounding us. I have met with the chiefs and even met with people that we fought with before I left. So far so good," Weza said.  The UNHCR says it will continue to assist refugees who were repatriated. Each person received $520 and a food package. But the agency says there will be no such assistance for the deported refugees. 	Ofesi  ya U.N.

Zimbabwe's Food Insecurity Escalates During COVID-19 Lockdowns 	Kusowa kwa chakudya kwakula ku Zimbabwe nthawi yakutseka zipata chifukwa cha COVID 19
A new report from Zimbabwes government says hunger and food insecurity have increased during the coronavirus pandemic. The World Food Program says the problem is especially acute for unemployed residents of the cities.

"I used to get about $30 a week," he said. "It was not enough for my needs. But when the lockdown came, it got worse, until I started growing mushrooms. Its slowly improving my life, if the market prices improve, we will survive." 	"Ndimkapeza  $30 pa sabata," iye anatero. "Ndalamai siyinali yokwanira kuchotsa zofunika za pa moyo wanga.

He uses forage from his backyard corn and sorghum field to grow the mushrooms. He says he now gets about $5 a week from selling them and uses some for consumption with his wife and five dependents.

"Before the introduction of mushroom farming in this place, it was very tough for people in this community to survive because of the lockdowns and so forth. But when The Future of Hope [a nonprofit committed to skills empowerment] brought in mushroom growing, its changing because you can now buy something, able to go to shops and buy mielie meal [coarse flour], sugar and so forth. Even if I fall sick I can go to the hospital after selling mushrooms," he said.

South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor  	Zuma wa ku South Africa aimba mlandu oimirira boma
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday. 	Mtsogoleri wopuma wa dziko la South Africa akufuna  kuzenga mlandu ochotsa oimilira boma wamkulu pa kuyankha mlandu wa mgwilizano wa katangale wogula zida za nkhondo atalephera zopinga zamalamuro zomwe zinawalaka, bungwe lake linanena choncho la mulungu.
Last month the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) torpedoed Zuma's latest bid to have lead prosecutor Billy Downer taken off the case after accusing him of bias and leaking of confidential information to a journalist in contravention of the national prosecution act, among other complaints. 	Mwezi watha bwalo lalikulu la milandu la Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) linaononga cholinga cha Zuma chomwe amafuna kuchotsa otsogolera mlandu wa boma dzina lake Bill Downer pomuneneza kuti anali okondera komanso anatulutsa nkhani ya chinsinsi kumpatsa mtolankhani zomwe zili zotsutsana ndi lamulo la dziko kukhudzana ndi oimba mlandu, pamwamba pa zodandaura zina.
The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard. 	SCA inakana pempho lochotsalo kuti apemphe pa chifukwa chakuti palibe chiyembekezo chanzeru chakumbana komanso palibe chifukwa champhamvu chopaangitsa dandaulolo limveredwe
The spokesman of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi told a press briefing that Zuma's instructions to his legal team to institute private prosecution "will now be put into operation in the next few days." 	Oyankhula mmalo mwa Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi ananena pa mkumano woulutsa nkhani kuti langizo la Zuma kwa omuimilira mlandu ake kuti aimbe mlandu " tsopano lichitika mu masiku ochepa akudzawa,"
He also said Zuma's legal team has filed a reconsideration application to the president of the SCA, a petition to hear the appeal. 	Iye ananenanso kuti gulu loimilira mlandu Zuma lalembera kuganiziraponso pa dandaulo kwa mtsogoleri waSCA, dandaulo Lkuti atchere khutu ku pempho lawo.
Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s. 	Zuma amene anatulutsidwa ku chipani cholamulira boma cha African Congress mu 2018 patatha zaka pafupifupi makumi awiri(20) ali mtsogoleri wapezeka wosalakwa pa milandu ya katangale, kupanga ndalama zambili mosayenera komanso kupanga malonda osayenera komanso achinyengo mu mlandu womwe wakhala ukayenda kwa kanthawipanjhani ya kugura zida za nkhodndo mwa chinyengo mu zaka za m'ma 1990.
The deal case has dogged Zuma since he was sacked as deputy president of the country in 2005. He said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt. 	Mlanduwu unamkakamira Zuma pakuti anachotsedwa ngati wachiwiri kwa mtsogoleri wa dzikomu chaka cha 2005. Iye anati anakhudzidwa chifukwa chakulondana mu ndale
On Monday the long-delayed trail is set to get underway and Zuma will be present in court. 	Lolemba, mlandu womwe watenga nthawi kuti anthu aonekere ku bwalo la milandu wakonzeka kuti uyambikendipo Zuma akapezeka ku bwalo lamilanduko
Manyi said Zuma, who turns 80 on Tuesday, is applying for a postponement because "it is very clear that the conditions for a fair trail are non-existent." 	Mani anati Zuma amaene akukwanitsa zaka 80 zakubadwa lachiwilili, akulemba pempho losintha masiku kupita patsogolo chifukwa " zikuchita kuonekeratu kuti zinthu zopangitsa kumva mlandu mwachilungamo palibepo"
On Monday his team will also respond to the supplementary affidavit served by the National Prosecution Authority where they seek to introduce new evidence in the trial. 	Lolemba gulu lake ayankha kalata yolembedwa ndi malumbiro yomwe inalembedwa ndi bungwe la National Prosecution Authority pamene akufuna kupeza umboni watsopano pa kuyesedwa mu mlanduwu
"All His Excellency President Zuma really wants is his day in court, in a fair trial and certainly not in a forum which is being rigged by the State," Manyi said. 	"Chimene olemekezeka mtsogoleri Zuma akufunitsitsa ndilakukhala ndi tsiku lake ku bwalo lamilandu, kuyesedwa mwachilungamo komansomumkumano omwe sukutulutsidwa mosaloledwa ndi boma" Mani antero
	
	
South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts 	South Africa ilibe mbali pa nkhani yomwe Russia akuika pa chiopsezo ma ubale apa dziko lonse la pansi: ozukuta
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation. 	goleri wa dziko la South Africa a Cyril Ramaphosa lolemba anaonetsa kusatenga mbali kwake pamene Russia yalowa ndi aslikali, kuitanitsa kuyankhurana osati kutsutsa
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor. Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world. 	Odzudzula anena motsutsana ndi boma polephera kuthamndizira dziko la Ukraine  motsutsana ndi dziko loyandikana nalo. Ozukuta nkhani ati dziko la South Africa likulora mbili ya maubale ndale ndichuma mogwirizna ndi dziko la Moscow kuika pa chiopsezo ma ubalendi dziko lonse la pansi.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 	Njira imene Ramaphosa akufuna itachitika pokonza kusamvana kwa pakati pa Russia ndi Ukraine ndi kukambilana osati kugwilitsa ntchito zida kapena kusokonezana pa chuma
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces. 	Ganizo losatekeseka lomwe Ramaphosa watenga lakana pempho lomwe gawo loyang'anira za maubale ndi maiko a kunja la dzikolo la International realtions department kuti Russia ichotse agulu la nkhondo lake.
Leaza Jernberg is a Johannesburg-based independent researcher and consultant on diplomacy. 	Leaza Jernberg amakhala ku Johannesburg ndipo amapanga kafukufuku moziimira paekha okhudzana ndi ma ubale a kunja kwa dziko.
"The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable. And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like," Jernberg said. "So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government." 	"Gawo laInternational Relations and Cooperation lomwe limaona ma ubala a mayiko a kunja kwa South Africa, zomwe anaganiza poyambilira zinali kuti 'iziz ndizosayenera. Ndipo is mu njira ina zinabwezedwa ndi mawu a mtsogoleri wa dzikolo amene ndikuganiza ali ndi ganizo la mgwilizano ndi Russia ndi momwe izi zikuonekera," Jernberg anatero. "Choncho mkati mwa South Africa momwe, mbali ya dzikoli ndilotsutsidwa, ngakhale mu boma momwemo."
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters. 	Ubale wa South Africa ndi Russia ikuchokera mu zaka za ma 1960 pamene mgwirizano wa Soviet Union unapeleka thandizo kwa anthu amene amamenyera ufulu kutsutsana ndi kusalana chifukwa cha mtundu
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia. 	Mu zaka zotsatira, a ndale kuphatikizipa a chipani cholamulira cha the African National Congress, anakhalabe mu ubale ndi Russia.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin. 	Ichi ndi chifukwa chake akatswiri ozukuta nkhani anati sizodabwitsa kuti maziko mwe anaikidwa ndi mtsogoleri wa kale Jacob Zuma ayankhula mogwirizana  ndi mtsogoleri wa Russia Vladimir Putin 
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town. 	university of Capetown
"He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma," Calland said. "It was a corrupt relationship. It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts. And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa. But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken." 	Ie (Putin)
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts. 	Mmalo mwake, Calland anati, ogwirira ntchito dziko la South Africa akungotsatira mlingo oyikidwa ndi dzikolo pa nkhani ya mikangano ya kunja.
"I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment," Calland said. "Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak. And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue." 	"Ndimadziwa bwino komaanso ndili pafupi ndi anthu oona za ma ubale ndi maiko a kunja, ndipo anakhazikika mu chikhalidwe chimenechi chosagwirizana ndi maiko ena,"anatero Calland. "kukambilana mu ndale ndilo dina lawo lina ponena mu njira ina.Ndipo ndikuganiza kuti pa ichi, amafuna kupitilira kusatenga mbali ndi cholinga  cholimbikitsa kukambilana.
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 	"Chifukwa china chopangitsa dzikoli kusaonetsa mbali mumkatikati mwa mgwirizano wa chuma wotchedwa BRICS, momwe muli mayiko a Brazil, Russia, India, China ndi South Africa.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China. 	Katswiri anati dziko la South Africa litha kukhala kuti likufuna kusunga ubale wa malonda ndi mayiko a Russiandi China
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive. 	Koma katswiri pa ma ubale a mayiko a kinja Jeneberg anati ganizo ili ndilobwezeretsa mmbuyo kupindura kapena losapinduitsa.
"In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse," Jernberg said. "When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest." 	"Kotero tikutenga mbali yolakwika," Jenberg anatero. "Mukayang'ana EU , mgwilizano wa mayiko a ku Europe ngati chimodzi, mgwilizano wa South Africa ndi EU ndi waukulu koposa. Ndiye ngati mutafuna kukamba za chuma,muzikamba izi mokhudzana ndi mayiko amu United States komanso mayiko aku Europe ndi umene ungabweretse phindu lambili la chuma."
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future. 	Kaya cholinga ndi chani, ilo yasiya mbali ya mayiko a ku madzulo omwe ali mbali ya Eukrane atankhumudwa, ndipo anamandwa achenjeza patha kukhala zotsatira kwa South Africa mutsogolomu

"These kinds of things down the road, become problematic," Gouws said. "If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community." 	" Zinthu ngati izi patsogolo zimabweretsa mavuto,"Gouws anatero.

While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.

Interpol Issues Red Notices for Gupta Brothers Wanted in South Africa 	Interpol yapeleka uthenga pa dziko lonse kuti anyamata a banja la a Gupta akufunika ku South Africa
South Africa said this week the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has requested countries seek out and arrest Rajesh and Atul Gupta, two brothers and businessmen who allegedly bribed top officials, including former president Jacob Zuma, to gain lucrative government contracts.

South African anti-corruption activists have accused the Guptas of "state capture," a term meant to describe the brothers' strong influence over former president Zuma and members of his Cabinet — influence that allegedly extended to contracts, policy and personnel choices. 	Anthu omenyerera kutha kwa zinyengo ku South Africa anena a kwa Gupta wa kuti 'analinjata boma' mawu ogwilitsidwa ogwiritsidwa ntchito pofuna kutanthauza kuti anyamatawa anali ndi mphamvu yaikulu pa tsogoleri wa dziko opuma a Jacob Zuma komanso nduna zake - machitachita omwe anasefukira ku migwirizano ya malonda, lamulo komanso zisankho za umunthu pa yekha
While there are many allegations against the Guptas, the red notices — requests to member nations to arrest — were issued for a case involving a relatively small $1.5 million pertaining to procurement fraud. 	kugula makuba zazing'ono zokwana $1.5 million
South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority requested the red notices last year, but Rajesh and Atul Guptas' lawyers objected. The application had to be reviewed by Interpol to make sure, among other things, that there was no political bias. 	Bungwe loyimba anthu ,ilandu mu dziko la South africa la National Prosecuting Authority linapempha ma uthenga a dziko lonsewa chaka chatha koma oimilira milandu wa Rajesh ndi Atu Gupta anatsutsa. Kupemphaku kumayenera kuunikidwa ndi Interpol kuti ionetsetse pa mwamba pa zinthu zinthu zina kuti panalibe kukondera (chifukwa cha ndale) kwina kuli konse.
Interpol's ambassador for the Turn Back Crime Campaign, Andy Mashaile, said South Africa also took time to secure an extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, as it's believed the brothers are in Dubai. 	Kazembe wa Interpol kwa 'the Turn Back Crime Campaign' Andy Mashaile anatidziko la South Africa linatenga nthawi kuti lisunge mgwirizano ndi dziko la united Arab Emirates pakuti azichimwenewa ali ku Dubai.
"You can then go to Interpol Dubai and say: 'Interpol Dubai, we know this is the place where the guys are living, this is the street name and the street number, this is how they look, these are their images. Please help us get these people in your detention center or in your cell, in jail until we are able to fetch them from Dubai,'" Mashaile said. 	" mutha tsono kupita ku Interpol a ku Dubai ndikukanena kuti: 'Interpol Dubai, tikudziwa kuno ndi kumene anayamatawa akukhala ndipo nsewu wake dzina lake ndi ili komanso numbala ya nsewuwo ndi iyi, umu ndi momwe amaonekera, izi ndizo zithunzi zawo. Chonde tithandizeni tiwatenge anthu awa kosungirako anthu kapena ku ma selo anu, mu ndende mpaka titawatenga kuchokera ku Dubai," Mashaile anatero
Interpol has 194 member countries and, while red notices do not compel them to execute arrests, the notices do help in tracking the whereabouts of suspects or fugitives. Their photographs are posted on all local law enforcement systems. 	Interpol ili ndi mayiko 194 omwe imagwirako ntchito ndipo pamene uthenga wa dziko lonse sumawakakamiza kumanga anthu, ma uthengawa amathandiza namlondora  odziwa komwe anthu oganizilidwawo or othawawo. Zithunzi zawo zimaikidwa mu ndondomeko yothandizira kusunga lamulo.
Political analyst Sanusha Naidu of the Institute for Global Dialogue said the red notices could help the 2024 reelection campaign of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, because it shows he is taking action against corruption. 	Katswiri wa za ndale Sanusha Naidu waku Global Dialogue anati ma uthenga a dziko lonse akanathandizira kukopa anthu pa kuponyanso voti kusankha mtsogoleri wa dziko la mu chaka cha 2024 , CyrilRamaphosa chifukwa zikuonetsa kuti akuchitapo kanthu potsutsana ndi katangale
"But I think what it also suggests is that at an international level, you know, getting the international community and, in particular, Interpol to also take a stance and align with the position that Ramaphosa has," Naidu said. "So, I think in terms of him moving forward and trying to say to the South African public, I'm doing what I have to do. I'm working around this, I'm moving the needle on this." 	" Koma ndikuganiza kuti zomwe izi zikuonetsera ndi zakuti pa dziko lonse lapansi, mukudziwa inu, kupangitsa bungwe la dziko lonse la pansi makamaka la Interpol kuti litengepo gawo ndikulumikizana ndi ganizo lomwe Ramaphosa ali nalo," Naidu anatero. "Choncho ndikuganiza kuti iye popita patsogolo komanso poyesera kuwauza anthu a ku South Africa kuti ndikuchita zomwe ndikuenera kuchita. Ndikuzikoza izi, ndikulondoloza pa izi."
However, Naidu said she's not sure it's enough to redeem the African National Congress, which has steadily been losing support at the polls because of rampant corruption and failure to deliver basic services. 	Komabe, Naidu anati alibe kutsinmikiza mtima kuti n'zokwanira kupulumutsa chipani cha African National Congress, chomwe chakhala pang'ono ndi pang'ono chikutaya awatsatira ku zisankhochifukwa cha ziphuphu zosatha  komanso kulephera kukwanilitsa zinthu zofunikira
"I think if you want to talk about what ordinary South Africans want, they want to see the judicial system take its natural course," she said. "But the question also is all the money that's been taken from the country, how does that come back? Because if you think about it, that's where part of the challenge lies." 	"Ndikuganiza kuti ukafuna kukamba zofuna za mzika ya wamba ya dziko la South Africa,akufuna za malamulo ndi chilungamo chiyende momwe hcimayenerera," anatero iye. "Koma funso linanso ndi la kuti kodi ndalama zonse zobebdwa mudzikoli zimabwerera bwanji? Chifukwa mukaziganizira, pamenepo ndipamene pali povuta."
News of the red notices broke a day before the release of the third report from the Inquiry into State Capture. It called for the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate Zuma. The former president refused to appear before the inquiry and was jailed for 15 months after defying a court order to do so. However, he was let out on medical parole soon after. 	Nkahni yokhudza uthenga opita dziko lonse la pansi inafika tsiku lomwe mawa lake kunatuluka uthenga wina pa kufufuza kwa kugwidwa kwa dziko. Izi zinaitanira pa National Prosecution Authority kuti amufufuze Zuma.

"Now people want to see consequences and accountability," she said. "People are losing trust in government and in democracy, so we don't want to go to a point beyond no return.

"The key question is political interference," she said. "How do you create a body that is so independent? How do you fund such a body? Which is very difficult. I think these are the struggles that a lot of the anti-corruption, that is faced globally — is how do you maintain independence? And who do they answer to?"
