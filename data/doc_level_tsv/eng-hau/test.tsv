Echo of Moscow in Yaroslavl, a local affiliate of Echo of Moscow, Russia’s oldest independent radio network, cancelled an interview with LGBT activists after receiving homophobic threats, the station’s editor Lyudmila Shabuyeva said in a Facebook post:	Gidan rediyon Eecho of Moscow a Yyaroslaɓi, wani yanki na Echo of Moscow, wanda shi ne mafi tsufan gidan rediyo mai zaman kansa a Rasha, ya soke ganawa da masu rajin kare haƙƙin 'yan luwaɗi bayan ya sami wata barazana, editan gidan rediyon, Lyudmila Shabuyeɓa ne ya bayyana hakan a shafinsa na Fesbuk:

According to independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, the show featuring Yaroslavl’s LGBT activists was scheduled to air in the early morning of Wednesday, January 23.

The same activists had recently picketed the town’s main square to protest against the persecution of gay people in Russia, notably in the republic of Chechnya.

The station invited them to be interviewed about the protest and their experience of being openly gay in provincial Russia.	Gidan rediyon ya gayyace su domin a gana da su game da zanga-zangar da kuma irin ƙwarewarsu wajen iya nuna cewa su masu auren jinsi ne a fili a cikin lardin Rasha.
Shabuyeva’s initial announcement of the show attracted a torrent of homophobic abuse in the comments, including some from local officials, but that didn’t put her off, she told Novaya Gazeta.

However, late in the night before the show, Shabuyeva says, a stranger called her on the phone from an unidentified number and told her that if she were to proceed with the scheduled programming, her guests would be met outside the studio with baseball bats.	Amma duk da haka, a cikin dare kafin fara shirin, Shabuyeɓa ya ce, wani wanda ba ta sani ba ya kira ta a waya da wata ɓoyayyiyar lamba kuma ya gaya mata cewa idan har ta cigaba da wannan shirin da aka shirya, to baƙinta za su gamu da gamonsu in sun fito daga sitidiyon.
She could also face problems, the anonymous caller threatened.	Ita ma za ta iya fuskantar matsala, mai kiran da ba a san ko waye ba ya yi baraza.
Fearing for her guests’ safety, Shabuyeva cancelled the show and replaced it with another programming.	Saboda tsoron da take na lafiyar baƙinta, sai Shabuyeɓa ta soke taron kuma ta maye gurbinsa da wani shirin.
The picket on Yaroslavl’s main square was part of a national campaign #saveLGBTinRussia aimed at raising awareness about the brutal persecution of gay people in the republic of Chechnya.

For the first time in Brazil's history, there is an indigenous woman in the National Congress	A karon fari a tarihin Barazil, akwai mace 'yar asalin ƙasa a majalisar ƙasa.

And in October 2018 Joenia earned yet another distinction, becoming the first indigenous woman elected to the National Congress.	Kuma a Oktoban 2018, Joenia ta ƙara samun wani tagomashin, ta zama mace 'yar asalin yankin ta farko da aka zaɓa a majalisar ƙasa.

Crossroads	Tsallaka titi
Joênia made history in 2008 when she argued a case brought by five indigenous groups to have their land officially demarcated as an Indigenous Territory, a type of tenure that confers indigenous peoples inalienable rights over their traditional homelands.	Joenia ta kafa tarihi a 2008 a lokacin da ta ƙalubalanci wata rigima da wasu ƙungiyoyin 'yan ƙasa biyar suka kawo, domin a shata musu ƙasarsu a hukumanci a matsayin ƙasarsu, irin ƙudurin da yake ba wa 'yan ƙasa babbar dama a kan garuruwansu na asali.
The court ruled in favor of the indigenous groups, who now are permanent possessors of the largest Indigenous Territory in Brazil — the lands of Raposa Terra do Sol, located in the state of Roraima.	Kotun ta yanke hukuncin da ya goyi bayan 'yan ƙasa, waɗanda a yanzu su ne mamallaka na dindindin na mafi yawan yankunan Barazil - yankunan Raposa Terra do Sol, waɗanda suke a jihar Roraima.
Meanwhile, Jair Bolsonaro, still a congressman at that time, insulted an indigenous activist who had attended a public hearing at the Chamber of Deputies about the Raposa Terra do Sol demarcation.	Haka kuma, Jair Bolsonaro, wanda yake a matsayin ɗan majalisa a wannan lokaci, ya zagi wani ɗan gwagwarmaya ɗan ƙasa wanda ya zo wajen sauraren ra'ayoyin jama'a na ƙungiyar mataimakan shugabanni game da shata iyakar Raposa Terra do Sol.
"You should go outside and eat grass to keep with your origins," Bolsonaro said on the occasion.	"Sai ku je waje ku ci ciyawa don ku cigaba da riƙe asalinku," Bolsonaro ya faɗa a yayin taron.
Shortly after his electoral victory in 2018, Bolsonaro brought up Raposa Terra do Sol again as an example of an indigenous territory whose economic potential should be exploited.

Ten years ago, with red painting on her face, in the tradition of her ethnicity, Joenia mixed Portuguese and her native language to remind the Justices that around three million US dollars circulated within those lands every year without that counting towards the Brazil's economy.

While she prepared to take her congressional seat as an opponent of Bolsonaro’s government, she told reporters at Folha de São Paulo, a national newspaper:	Duk da cewa ta shirya karɓar kujerarta ta majalisa a matsayin mai adawa da gwamanatin Bolsonaro, ta gayawa 'yan jarida a Folha de Sao Paulo, a jaridar ƙasa:

Hitting the ground running	Farawa
Brazil's Congress took office in February 2019 and Joênia began her term as the leader of her party, Rede Sustentabilidade (or Sustainability Network in Portuguese), in the Chamber of Deputies, the federal legislature's lower house.

Following the dam disaster in Brumadinho, a tragedy that killed over 160 people and destroyed all life at the Paraopeba River, Joenia presented her first bill proposal, which renders environmental crimes that seriously affect ecosystems, human health, and lives, "heinous crimes", a type of offense that incurs in more severe penalties.

A day before taking office, the congresswoman told Folha de Boa Vista, a local newspaper from her home state, that the bill addresses private corporations’ carelessness with the environment:	Kwana ɗaya kafin fara aiki, 'yar majalisar ta gaya wa Folha de Boa ɓista, wata jarida a jiharta, ƙudurin ya yi magana ne game da sakaci da muhalli na ma'aikatu masu zaman kansu:

Six students were detained on Tuesday, March 12, in Kirundo province in northeast Burundi for scribbling on pictures of President Pierre Nkurunziza in five textbooks.	An kama ɗalibai shida ranar Talata, 12 ga Maris a lardin Kirundo a arewa masu gabashin Burundi a kan laifin yin zane a kan hoton shugaba Pierre Nkurunziza a littattafan karatu biyar.
The students were accused of "insulting the head of state."	An zargi ɗaliban da "shugaban ƙasa."
The National Federation of Associations Engaged in Children's Welfare in Burundi (FENADEB) reported that another student, 13, had been immediately released because he was a minor under the age of 15.

Iwacu newspaper reported that families affected were deeply distressed.	Jaridar Iwacu ta bayar da rahoton cewa iyalan da abin da ya shafa suna cikin tsananin damuwa.
Scribbling [on the president’s picture] is a punishable offense under the Burundian law, according to a Reuters report.	Yin zane [a kan hoton shugaban ƙasa] laifi ne da yake da hukunci a ƙarƙashin dokar Burundi, kamar yadda rahoton Reuters ya nuna.
However, the age of the offenders may serve as a “mitigating circumstance” in these students’ trial.	Sai dai shekarun masu laifin za su iya zama "dalilin sassauci" a shari'ar waɗannan ɗaliban.
As a teacher anonymously noted, the textbooks had not been checked for several years and are often shared by students, so it is difficult to know who marked them.	Kamar yadda wani malami ya faɗa a asirce, ba a duba littattafan karatun ba tsawon shekaru kuma ana yaɗa su ga ɗalibai, don haka akwai wahala a gane wanda ya yi musu alama.
A similar episode occurred in 2016, following the controversy over the president’s third term, where high school students scribbled on textbook pictures of Nkurunziza.

A Maris ɗin bara, an sanya wa Nkurunziza sunan "baban jagora na gabaɗaya" daga jam'iyyarsa, Hukumar ƙasa ta Kula da Dakarun Dimukuraɗiyya domin kare Dimukuraɗiyya (CNDD-FDD).
Evariste Ndayishimiye, CNDD-FDD’s secretary general explained why that title was conferred on Nkurunziza:	Babban sakataren CNDD-FDD, Eɓariste Ndayishimiye, ya yi bayanin dalilin da ya sa aka ba wa Nkurunziza wannan laƙabin:
He is our leader, therefore in our party, no one is comparable to him.	Shi ne shugabanmu, don haka a jam'iyyarmu ba kwatankwacinsa.
He is our parent, he is the one who advises us.	Shi ne iyayenmu, shi ne wanda yake ba mu shawara.
That is why I ask all our members to respect that because a home without the man (its head) can be overlooked by anybody.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sa na nemi dukkanin mambobinmu su mutunta haka domin gida idan ba maigida (shugabansa) kowa ma zai iya wulaƙanta shi.
For us, we have the best.	A wajenmu, muna da nagari.
While the CNDD-FDD downplayed the title, Nkurunziza’s reinforced status as the "eternal supreme guide" has made it difficult for anyone to disagree with his choices, including his move to change the two-term limit enshrined in the country’s constitution.	A lokacin da CNDD-FDD ta raina laƙabi, Nkurunziza ya ƙara ƙarfafa matsayin cewa "babban jagora na gabaɗaya" ya sanya da wahala wani ya iya ƙin amincewa da zaɓuɓɓukansa, wanda ya haɗa da yunƙurinsa na sauya tsarin zango biyu wanda yake rubuce a kundin tsarin mulkin ƙasar.
This reflects a centralization of power in the ruling party around Nkurunziza and supporters, and of the party’s control of state institutions.	Wannan ya nuna yadda aka mayar da iko a cikin jam'iyyar zuwa ga Nkurunziza da masu goyon baya, da yadda jam'iyyar take riƙe da manufofin ƙasa.
Scribblers in solidarity	Masu rubutu a goyon baya
Netizens have taken to scribbling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in protest through two hashtags: #Nkurunziza and #Burundi:	Masu mu'amala da intanet sun koma yin zane-zane a kan hotunan Shugban Nkurunziza don nuna ƙin amincewa ta hanyar hashtag guda biyu: #Nkurunziza da #Burundi:
Crackdown on criticism	Murƙushe suka
Burundi's government has become increasingly sensitive to criticism since 2015, after a failed coup, clashes with rebel groups, criticisms of rights abuses, sanctions, economic hardships and a refugee crisis.	Gwamnatin Burundi ta ƙara zama mai kula da suka tun 2015, bayan juyin mulkin da bai yi nasara ba dafaɗace-faɗace da 'yan tawaye da sukar danne haƙƙin al'umma da matsanancin halin tattalin arziƙi da kuma matsalolin 'yan gudun hijira.
Nkurunziza’s third term bid was opposed by the European Union, and the United Nations, who demanded a restoration of stability before elections.	ƙungiyar haɗakar ƙasashen Turai sun ƙalubalanci yunƙurin zango na uku na Nkurunziza, inda suka nemi dawo da zaman lafiya kafin yin zaɓuɓɓuka.
Faced with these challenges, a siege mentality hardened, and authorities clamped down more harshly on perceived threats.	A lokacin da suke fuskantar waɗannan matsalolin, sai yanayin danne al'umma ya ƙara ta'azzara, kuma mahukunta suka ƙara tsananta farautar duk wani abu da suke gani a matsayin barazana.
The Human Rights Watch May 2018 special report discovered that Burundian state security forces, intelligence services, and members of the ruling party’s youth league, the Imbonerakure, carried out brutal, targeted attacks on opponents or suspected opponents, human rights activists, and journalists.	Rahoto na musamman na Human Right Watch na Mayun 2018 ya binciko cewa jami'an tsaron Burundi da jami'an asiri da mambobin jam'iyya mai ci ɓangaren matasa, Imbonerakure, sun kai munanan hare-hare a kan 'yan adawa ko waɗanda ake zargin 'yan adawa ne da masu rajin kare haƙƙin al'umma da 'yan jaridu.

This has led to a refugee crisis that has seen Burundians fleeing particularly to Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda.	Wannan ya jawo matsalar 'yan gudun hijira wanda ya jawo mutanen Burundi suka dinga guduwa zuwa Tanzaniya da Rwanda da Republic of Congo (DRC) da kuma Uganda.
While thousands have returned, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded over 347,000 total Burundian refugees in February 2019 UNHCR asserts:	Duk da cewa da yawa sun dawo, babban kwamishin 'yan gudun hijira na Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya ya samar da ƙididdigar sama da mutanen Burundi 'yan gudun hijira 347,000 a Fabarairun 2019 UNHCR ya nuna:

Earlier this month, Burundi closed the United Nations human rights office after 23 years, saying it was no longer needed.	A farkon wannna watan, Burundi ta rufe ofishin kare haƙƙin al'umma na Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya bayan shekaru 23, inda suka bayyana ba a buƙatarsa.
The government was incensed with former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who described Nkurunziza’s Burundi as one of the "most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times" in February 2018.	Gwamnatin ta kufula da tsohon babban kwamishinan Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya na haƙƙin al'umma, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, wanda ya bayyana Burundi a ƙarƙashin Nkurunziza a matsayin "mafi girman mayanka ta mutane a wannan lokacin" a Fabarairun 2018.

For example, rights activist Germain Rukiki who documented acts of torture committed by Nkurunziza’s regime was sentenced to 32 years in jail in 2018 for participation in an insurrectional movement, undermining state security and rebellion.	A misali, an yake wa ɗan gwagwarmaya Germain Rukiki wanda ya taskace ayyukan azabtarwar da gwamnatin Nkurunziza ta yi, shekaru 32 a kurkuku a 2018 don ya shiga wani gangami na tunzurawa da cin dunduniyar ƙasa da tsaro da kuma tawaye.

The "scribbling affair" is also indicative of the government’s increasingly conservative, moralizing approach, including mandatory marriages for cohabiting non-married couples in 2017, clampdowns on prostitution and begging.

Reyder wrote on her Facebook page about the incident. She says she was listening in on the call between Channel One’s producer and BlaBlaCar’s PR officer and recorded the exchange between them:	Reyder ta rubuta a shafinta na Fesbuk game da faruwar lamarin.

When Reyder’s PR officer Sergey told the editor that there weren’t any male experts in the company, she says, the latter promised to come back later after consulting with their producer.

The young woman reporter will be interviewing male experts, while the young man will be interviewing women.	Matashiyar mai rahoton za ta gana da wani ƙwararre, shi kuma matashin zai gana da mata.
Because the woman reporter’s goal is to save on car rides, she will be speaking to a representative of a carpooling service (yes, because of the show’s structure, not gender inequality, that has to be a man.)

China's campaign against Christmas makes celebrating a difficult choice for citizens	Kamfen ɗin ƙasar Sin wajen ƙin Kirsimeti ya jawo yin bikin ya yi wahala ga 'yan ƙasa
Written on the classroom boards: "Act and reject Western festival" and "Promote traditional culture, reject Western festival".	A rubuce a kan allunan ajujuwa: "Yi aiki kuma a guji Bukukuwan Yamma" kuma "A fifita al'adun gargajiya, a yi watsi da Bukukuwan Yamma".
Images from Weibo.	Hoto daga Weibo.
Christmas is approaching but instead of feeling joyful, many in mainland China have expressed frustration over China's ideological campaign against Christmas as a Western festival.	Kirsimeti tana ƙaratowa amma a maimakon murna, da yawa a cikin ƙasar Sin suna nuna damuwa da kamfen ɗin da ƙasar take yi na ƙyamar Kirsimeti a matsayin bikin Yammacin duniya.
In 2017, the Communist Party of China's central committee and state council issued an official document entitled "Suggestions on the implementation of projects to promote and develop traditional Chinese culture excellence".	A 2017, babban kwamitin Jam'iyyar 'Yan Gurguzu ta Sin da majalisar ƙasa sun fitar da wasu bayanai na gwamnati da aka yi wa take da "shawarwari wajen tabbatar da shirye-shirye da bunƙasa kyawawan al'adun gargajiya na ƙasar Sin".
They outlined a cultural revival project that lists Chinese festivals like the Lunar New Year and the Lantern Festival, among others, as cultural conventions worthy of celebration.	Sun jero wani shiri na bunƙasa al'adu wanda ya jero bukuwan ƙasar Sin kamar bikin shekara da bikin Lantern, da wasu, a matsayin wasu bukukuwan al'ada da ya kamata a dinga yi.
To implement this policy, Chinese authorities have launched a series of ideological campaigns to crack down on non-Chinese celebrations.	Domin tabbatar da wannan ƙuduri, mahukunta ƙasar Sin sun fito da wasu dabaru da hanyoyin daƙile bukukuwan da ba na ƙasar ba.
This year, just before Christmas, authorities in some cities such as Langfang, in Hebei province, have demanded shops to remove Christmas decorations on the streets and in window displays.	A wannan shekarar, kafin Kirsimeti da kaɗan, mahukunta a was garuruwan kamar Llangfng, a lardin Hebei, sun nemi kantuna da su cire kwalliyar Kirsimeti daga kan tituna da kuma nuna a kan tagogi.
Anti-Western festival commentaries have flooded Chinese social media, making Christmas celebrations a difficult choice for some who feel they must keep their joy a secret.	Kalaman ƙin bukukuwan Yammacin duniya sun cika dandulan sadarwa na ƙasar Sin, wanda hakan ya sanya yin bikin Kirsimeti ya zama wani zaɓi mai wahala ga wasu da suke jin dole su yi farin cikinsu a sirrance.

The headlines on the feed are	Kanun bayanan da ke kan labarin su ne
1. Western festival is approaching.	1. Bikin Yammacin duniya yana tahowa.
To celebrate or not, that’s the question.	A yi murna ko kar a yi, wannan ita ce tambayar.
2. I am Chinese and I don’t celebrate Western festivals.	2. Ni Basine ne kuma ba na murnar bukukuwan Yammacin duniya.
3. Say no to the celebration of Western festivals on the school campus.	3. Ku kuji murnar bukukuwan Yammacin duniya a cikin makaranta.
4. The party-state has banned Western festivals.	4. ƙasa ta haramta bukukuwan Yammacin duniya.
The celebration of festivals is now a political issue.	Murnar bukukuwa yanzu ya zama siyasa.
In addition to Christmas, the list of Western festivals also includes Valentine’s Day, Easter and Halloween, among others.	ƙari a kan Kirsimeti, jerin bukukuwan Yammacin sun haɗa da ranar Masoya da Ista da Halowin, da sauransu.
A majority of the commentaries define Western festivals as "cultural invasion" or "national humiliation".	Da yawa daga cikin kalaman sun bayyana bukukuwan Yammacin duniya a matsayin "mamayar al'adu" ko "cin mutuncin ƙasa".
For example, a widely circulated one said:	Misali, wani wanda aka yaɗa da yawa ya ce:
Translation Original Quote	Fassara Abin da aka faɗa na ainihi
If people of a nation are too enthusiastic in celebrating other nations’ festivals, it indicates that the country is suffered from extremely serious cultural invasion.	Idan mutanen wata ƙasa suna ta hanƙoron murnar bukukuwan wasu ƙasashe, wannan yana nuna lallai ƙasar tana fama da babban mamayar al'adu.
If party members and government officials are not aware of this, it means that they are not politically sensitive and have lost their progressiveness.	Idan 'yan jam'iyya da mahukuntan gwamnati ba su san da wannan ba, ya nuna ba su da wayewar siyasa kuma sun rasa halinsu na son cigaba.
The commentary references the history of the Eight-Nation Alliance, a coalition formed in response to the Boxer Rebellion in China between 1899 and 1901 when Chinese peasants rose up against foreign, colonial, Christian rule and culture.	Kalaman sun yi nuni ga wani tarihi na Haɗakar ƙasashe Takwas, wani ƙawance da aka yi domin yaƙar Tawayen Boɗer a ƙasar Sin, a tsakanin 1899 da 1901, a lokacin da talakawan manoman ƙasar Sin suka taso don ƙalubalantar al'adu da mulkin Kiristoci baƙi 'yan mulkin mallaka.
It further argues that the birthday of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China, should be treated as China’s Christmas:	Sun kuma tabbatar da cewa ranar haihuwar Mao Zedong, wanda ya samar da ƙasar Sin, ita ya kamata ta zama Kirsimetin ƙasar Sin.
Translation Original Quote	Fassara Abin da aka faɗa na ainihi
The first Chairman of the Republic of China Mao Zedong had saved people from misery.	Shugaban farko na ƙasar Sin, Mao Zedong ya tseratar da mutane daga bala'i.
We should make his birthday Chinese Christmas.	Ya kamata mu mayar da ranar haihuwarsa Kirsimetin ƙasar Sin.
Act and reject Western festivals.	A yi aiki a yi watsi da bukukuwan Yammacin Duniya.
But many on Weibo found these arguments illogical.	Amma wasu da yawa a Weibo sun ga waɗannan bayanai a matsayin marasa kan gado.
One commentator said:	Wani mai mayar da martani ya ce:
Translation Original Quote	Fassara Abin da aka faɗa na ainihi
When Westerners celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, Chinese people are so proud and see the phenomena as the revival of Chinese traditional culture...

When Chinese people celebrate Western festivals, what's the point of labeling them as culture invasion?	Idan mutanen ƙasar Sin suka yi murnar bukukuwan Turawa, me ye hikimar laƙaba musu sunan mamayar al'adu?
Young people celebrate Western festivals for fun and joy.	Matasa suna murnar bukukuwan Turawa ne saboda raha da jin daɗi.
The festivals can boost consumption, what’s wrong with that?	Bukukuwan za su inganta alaƙa, me ye matsalar hakan?
Some people try to draw connection between celebrating Christmas and the national humiliation that happened 160 years ago.	Wasu mutane suna so su alaƙanta tsakanin murnar Kirsimeti da wani rashin mutuncin da ya shafi ƙasa shekaru 160 da suka shuɗe.
For what?	Saboda me?
Social pressure, self-censorship	Matsin al'umma, yi wa kai bin diddigi
The flood of anti-Christmas comments on social media has generated pressure for some social media users to self-censor.	Kwararowar kalaman ƙin Kirsimeti a dandulan sadarwa ya jawo matsi ga wasu masu amfani da dandulan su duba yanayinsu.
A Weibo user expressed frustration:	Wani mai amfani da Weibo ya nuna damuwarsa:

In my friend circle, anti-Western festival camps and anti-anti Western festival camps are debating.	A cikin abokaina, gungun masu ƙin bukukuwan Turawa da gungun masu son bukukuwan Turawa suna muhawara.
Whether one likes to celebrate or not is none of others’ business, why do people just have to force others to agree with their view?	Ko da mutum yana son ya yi murnar ko a'a ba abin da ya dami wani ba, me ya sa ku mutane kuke son ku tursasawa wasu su amince da ra'ayinku?

School notice against the celebration of Western festivals on campus.	Sanarwar makaranta don ƙyamar bukukuwan Turawa a makaranta.
Pressure goes beyond social media platforms, extending to institutions such as schools and corporations.	Matsin ya wuce dandalin sadarwa, ya kai har zuwa cibiyoyi kamar makarantu da ma'aikatu.
Some Weibo users have shared school notices that were distributed to students.	Wasu masu amfani da Weibo sun yaɗa sanarwar makarantu da aka rarrabawa ɗalibai.
One of the notices (right) refers to the "Suggestions" mandate and urges teachers and students to resist Western style celebrations.	Wani daga cikin sanarwar (dama) ya nuna "Shawarwari" suna umarni da neman malamai da ɗalibai su ƙyamaci murnar bukukuwan Yammacin duniya.
It also demands students to spread anti-Western messages to friends and family members on Wechat and other mobile messaging applications.	Sun kuma nemi ɗalibai da su yaɗa saƙonnin ƙyamar Yammacin duniya zuwa ga abokai da iyalai a Wechat da sauran manhajojin tura saƙonni.
One mother was surprised to find her child rejecting her offer of a Christmas gift. She wrote on Weibo:	Wata uwa ta yi mamaki da ta ga ɗanta ya ƙi karɓar kyautar Kirsimeti. Ta rubuta a Weibo:

Mother: Baby, what do you want for Christmas gift?	Uwa: ɗana, me kake so a matsayin kyautar Kirsimeti?
Child: I will not celebrate Western festivals Christmas is not a Chinese people’s festival.	ɗa: Ba zan yi murnar bukuwan Turawa ba, Kirsimeti ba bikin mutanen ƙasar Sin ba ne.
OK, you are definitely an obedient baby of the Party and the People.	Ya yi, lallai kai ɗa ne mai biyayya ga ƙasa da al'umma.
However, high school and college students were more critical.	Amma ɗalibai manyan makarantu sun fi nuna adawa.
One student questioned school policy on Weibo:	Wani ɗalibi ya ƙalubalanci dokar makarata a Weibo:
Translation Original Quote	Fassara Abin da aka faɗa na ainihi
The school has banned Christmas decorations on campus and forbidden students to exchange gifts so as to campaign against Western festivals.	Makaranta ta hana kwalliyar Kirsimeti a makaranta kuma sun haramta wa ɗalibai musayar kyaututtuka domin yin kamfen ɗin ƙyamar bukukuwan yammacin duniy.
Are all these measures to enhance and promote Chinese culture or a sign of losing confidence on one’s own culture?	Duk waɗannan dabaru ne na haɓaka al'adun ƙasar Sin ko kuma alamu ne na rashin tabbaci a kan al'adun mutum?
Some have chosen to celebrate the festival in secret. A Weibo user said:	Wasu sun zaɓi su yi murnar bukukuwan a asirce. Wani mai amfani da Weibo y faɗa:

At the recent Forum of Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFA) held in Accra, Ghana, a group of panelists from various African countries all said they feared African governments were interested in controlling digital space to keep citizens in check.

Many countries have statutes and laws which guarantee the right to free expression.	ƙasashe da yawa suna da dokoki da ƙudurori da suka bayar da damar 'yan faɗin albarkacin baki.
In Nigeria, for example, the Freedom of Information Act grants citizens the right to demand information from any government agency.	Misali, a Najeriya, Dokar 'Yancin Bayanai ta ba wa 'yan ƙasa damar su nemi bayanai daga kowace ma'aikatar gwamnati.
Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution provides for freedom of the press and Section 39 maintains that "every person shall be entitled to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference..."	Sashe na 22 na kundin tsarin mulkin 1999 ya bayar da damar 'yancin 'yan jarida kuma Sashe na 39 ya bayyana cewa "kowane mutum yana da haƙƙin 'yancin magana, wanda ya haɗa da 'yancin samo ko karɓar ko yaɗa wasu dabaru da bayanai ba tare da katsalandan ba..."
Yet, Nigeria has issued other laws that authorities use to deny these aforementioned rights.	Amma duk da haka, Najeriya ta fitar da wasu dokokin waɗanda mahukunta suke amfani da su domin hana waɗannan damarmakin da aka zayyana.
Section 24 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act criminalises "anyone who spreads messages he knows to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent."

Making laws with ambiguous and subjective terms like "inconvenience" or "insult" calls for concern.	Yin dokoki da wasu irin lafuza masu sarƙaƙiya ko kuma iya ɗaukar wasu ma'anoni kamar "rashin sukuni" ko "zagi" suna buƙatar a duba.

From Tanzania’s prohibition on spreading "false, deceptive, misleading or inaccurate" information online to Uganda’s tax on social media that is intended to curb "gossip", the noise made on digital platforms scares oppressive regimes. In some cases, it may even lead to them to rescind their actions.

100 days for Alaa: Family of Egyptian activist counts the days until his release from prison	Kwanaki 100 n Alaa: Iyalin wani ɗan gwagwarmayar Masar da suke ƙidaya kwanaki har zuwa sakinsa daga kurkuku.

After spending five years in prison, the Egyptian blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah is scheduled to be released from prison on March 17, 2019.	Bayan ya shafe shekaru biyar a kurkuku, an tsara za a saki marubucin intanet na Masar kuma ɗan gwagwarmaya, Abd El Fattah daga kurkuku a ranar 17 ga Maris, 2019.
On December 8, his family launched a campaign — "100 days for Alaa" — to ensure his prison term ends on time.	A 8 ga Disamba, iyalinsa sun fara wani gangami - "kwanaki 100 na Alaa" - domin tabbatar da cewa kwanakinsa na kurkuku sun ƙare a kan lokaci.
The March release date does not mark the end of Alaa's time served, but rather a transition to the final phase of his sentence.	Kwanan watan sakinsa na Maris bai nuna ƙarshen lokacin zaman Alaa ba, maimakon haka, sai ya zama sauyi ne zuwa zagayen ƙarshe na hukuncin da aka yanke masa.
After his release, Alaa will be made to spend every night in his local police station for an additional five years.	Bayan an sake shi, za a sanya Alaa ya riƙa kwana a kullum a ofishin 'yan sanda har na tsawon ƙarin shekaru biyar.
He will be under police surveillance throughout this period.	Zai kasance a ƙarƙashin kulawar 'yan sanda a duk tsawon wannan lokacin.
Alaa was arrested and taken from his family’s home in November 2013.	An kama Alaa kuma aka ɗauke shi daga gidansu a Nuwambar 2013.
More than one year later, in February 2015, he was finally tried and sentenced to five years in prison for "organising" a protest under a 2013 protest law that prohibits unauthorised demonstrations.	Sama da shekara ɗaya bayan hakan, a Fabarairun 2015, a ƙarshe sai aka yi masa hukunci aka ɗaure shi tsawon shekaru biyar a kurkuku a dalilin ya "haɗa" zanga-zanga a ƙarƙashin wata dokar zanga-zanga ta 2013 wadda ta hana zanga-zangar da ba a bayar da dama ba.
While he did take part in a protest against military trials for civilians on 26 November 2013, Alaa had no role in organising it.	Duk da cewa ya shiga cikin zanga-zanga domin nuna ƙin goyon bayan yi wa fararen hula hukunci daga sojoji ranar 26 ga Nuwamban 2013, Alaa ba shi da hannu a haɗa ta.
His sentence was confirmed by Egypt’s Court of Cassation in November 2017.	Kotun hukunta masu laifuka ta Masar ta tabbatar da hukuncin nasa a Nuwamban 2017.
Omar Robert Hamilton, a cousin of Alaa, outlined the goals of the campaign on Twitter:	Omar Robert Hamilton, ɗan'uwan Alaa, ya zayyano burin gangamin a Tuwita:
To re-focus local and international attention on his case to ensure that Alaa is actually released on March 17th.	Domin a ƙara dawo da hankali 'yan ƙasa da duniya a kan lamarinsa domin tabbatar da cewa an saki Alaa a 17 ga Maris.
To enter the concept of المراقبة (‘surveillance’ or ‘parole’) into the public consciousness.	Domin shigar da tsarin ('kulawa') zuwa cikin tunanin mutane.
After release, Alaa is still sentenced to spend every night in his local police station for "five years".	Bayan saki, an ƙara yi wa Alaa hukuncin kwana a kowane dare a ofishin 'yan sanda har tsawon "shekaru biyar".
We need to lay the groundwork for pressure against this.	Muna buƙatar sanya ɗan-ba na tursasawa don ƙin hakan.
Alaa has been jailed or investigated under every Egyptian head of state who has served during his lifetime.	An ta ɗaure Alaa ko kuma bincikarsa a ƙarƙashin dukkanin shugabannin Masar da suka yi mulki a zamanin rayuwarsa.
In 2006, he was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest.	A 2006, an kama shi saboda ya shiga wata zanga-zangar zaman lafiya.
In 2011, he spent two months in prison, missing the birth of his first child, Khaled.	a 2011, ya shafe watanni biyu a kurkuku, bai ga haihuwar ɗansa na fari ba, Khaled.
In 2013, he was arrested and detained for 115 days without trial.	A 2013, an kama shi an garƙame tsawon kwanaki 115 ba tare da yanke hukunci ba.
Alaa has long worked on technology and political activism projects with his wife, Manal Hassan.	Alaa ya daɗe yana aiki a kan ayyukan fasaha da gwagwarmayar siyasa tare da matarsa, Manal Hassan.
He comes from a family of prominent human rights advocates, including human rights lawyer Ahmed Seif El Islam, Alaa's father, who was jailed multiple times under the regime of Hosni Mubarak.	Ya fito daga gidan mashahuran 'yan rajin kare haƙƙin al'umma, waɗanda suka haɗa da lauya ɗan rajin kare haƙƙin al'umma Ahmed Seif El Islam, wanda shi ne mahaifin Alaa, wanda aka ɗaure shi a lokuta da yawa a ƙarƙashin mulkin Hosni Mubarak.
Abd El Fattah’s sisters, Mona and Sanaa Seif, are also human rights defenders who have long campaigned against the military trials of civilians in the country.	Yan'uwan Adb Eel Fattah, Mona da Sanaa Seif, su ma 'yan gwagwarmayar kare haƙƙin al'umma ne waɗanda suka daɗe suna kamfe don nuna ƙin yadda sojoji suke yi wa fararen hula hukunci a ƙasar.
In 2016, Sanaa served a six-month jail sentence for insulting a public official.	A 2016, Sanaa ta shafe zaman kurkuku na watanni shida saboda ta zagi wani jami'in al'umma.
Alaa's ordeal is similar to many other Egyptians who are behind bars because of their activism.	Masifar da Alaa ya shiga, irin ɗaya ce da ta da yawa daga cikin 'yan Masar waɗanda suke a ɗaure saboda gwagwarmaya.

Those arrested on politically-motivated charges in Egypt are often subjected to enforced disappearances, torture, prolonged pre-trial detention and solitary confinement.

In a letter to the attendees of RightsCon, a digital rights conference held in Toronto in May 2018, Alaa urged supporters to ”fix [their] own democracies”.

Not only is where you live, work, vote, pay tax and organize the place where you have more influence, but a setback for human rights in a place where democracy has deep roots is certain to be used as an excuse for even worse violations in societies where rights are more fragile.

However, Transgender persons have a different story to tell when it comes to their rights and life; they have faced torture, rape, been burnt alive, beheaded and even shot dead, yet the state did not help them despite the passing of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act by the Government in March 2018.

These have been difficult days.	Waɗannan sun zama kwanaki ne masu wahala.

Violence against women is real, it really is.	Gallazawa mata abu ne na zahiri, tabbas akwai shi.

And it is a problem that supposes relations between one or another couple — it is a structural problem.	
There is a structure that dictates and relegates women to roles of subordination which turns them into potential targets of violence of all kinds and at all levels.	Akwai tsarin da yake nuna mayar da mata baya zuwa taka rawar mabiya wanda hakan yake mayar da su abun duk wata irin gallazawa a kowane mataki.
This structure of masculine supremacy which hangs over us and which many deny the existence of — and that is not invisible — does this: it mutilates and destroys the lives of women and KILLS!

Though their movement has not gained much traction, Angolan rapper Gil Slows Allen Russel even said:	Duk da cewa gangamin nasu bai samu karɓuwa ba sosai, mawaƙin Angola, Gil Slows Allen Russel ya ce:

In 2014, several indigenous communities in the Mekong started recording their stories and legends with the help of a group of researchers who are exploring how these narratives can help exposing the destructive impact of large-scale projects in the region.

In partnership with Mekong Watch, a Japan-based group advocating sustainable development in the region, several community elders in the Mekong began recording some of their stories and legends in 2014 that revolve around nature.

People’s stories should be regarded, recognized, and respected as Mekong’s commons, especially these days when they are losing their place in local communities to more modern media, and are not passed on to next generations.

For Mekong Watch and the threatened communities in the region, preserving these stories is integral in the campaign to resist projects that would displace thousands of people living in the Mekong:	Game da Mekong Watch da kuma al'ummomin da suke fuskantar barazana a ɓangaren, adana waɗannan labaran yana daga cikin hanyoyin wayar da kai domin ƙin shirye-shiryen da za su tarwatsa dubunnan mutanen da ke zaune a Mekong:

Serbian social networks were set ablaze after opera singer and local superstar Nataša Tasić Knežević, who is of Roma origin, accused a supermarket in the city of Novi Sad of racial profiling on a live broadcast on Facebook.

In the video, broadcast on December 29 right after the incident, Ms. Tasić Knežević explained that as she exited the Maxi supermarket store along with several other shoppers, the anti-theft sensor beeped.

In the video, Ms Knežević says the store manager apologized to her after she complained about the maltreatment, but that she was still hurt by the mob's harassment.	A bidiyon, Ms Knezeɓic tana cewa manajan kantin ya ba ta haƙuri bayan ta yi ƙorafin rashin mutuncin, amma kuma har yanzu tana jin ciwon yadda taron mutane suka ci zarafinta.
She says one older man shouted that they "should pack that garbage out", meaning that employees should throw her out of the store, supposedly for her being Roma.

On December 31, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Gender Equality Coordination Body, Zorana Mihajlović, also decried the behavior of Maxi store employees as “scandalous and for condemnation.

Private grouses have a funny way of becoming public feuds — especially in the music industry.	Yan ƙananan matsalolin gida suna da ban mamaki wajen zama manyan matsaloli - musamman a wajen masana'antun kiɗa.
From high-profile beefs like the ones between Kanye West and Taylor Swift and Jamaica's Mavado and Vybz Kartel, to the more local but equally infamous 2004 fight between Trinidadian soca stars Destra and Denise Belfon, celebrity quarrels often end up bringing attention to the artists and drawing new audiences to their music.

Trinidad and Tobago's annual Carnival celebrations take place this year on March 4 and 5, and the lead up is peak time for soca music.	Za a yi bikin shagalin Trinidad da Tobago na shekara za a 4 da 5 ga Maris, kuma babban abin da za a yi shi ne kiɗan soca.
Popular soca performers like Montano and George are booked for Carnival events months in advance.	An tanadi shahararrun masu wasan soca kamar Montano da George domin shagalin tun watannin baya.
They're releasing new music in a bid to win the coveted Road March title, which offers a substantial monetary prize to the artist whose song plays the most during Carnival.

Soca music lovers first noticed tension between the two musicians when George released his first song of 2019, "Road March Bacchanal 2".	Masoya kiɗan soca da farkon sun fara gano matsala a tsakanin mawaƙan biyu a lokacin da George ya saki waƙarsa ta farko a 2019, "Road March Bacchanal 2".
The song's lyrics makes it clear that George holds a grudge after losing the 2018 Road March battle to Montano.	Baitukan waƙar sun nuna kai tsaye cewa George yana da wata matsala bayan ya rasa gasar Road March a 2018 a hannun Montano.
His composition, "Savannah", was a strong contender, but Montano had teamed up with soca veteran Superblue to release "Soca Kingdom", which copped the coveted 2018 Road March title.	Aikinsa na "Saɓannah" yana cikin muhimman 'yan takara, amma Montano ya haɗa kai da tsofaffin ƙwararrun soca na Superblue domin sakin "Duniya Soca", wadda ta wawure babban kyautar 2018 ta Road March.
"Soca Kingdom" was played 336 times, and "Savannah" 140.	An ji waƙar "Duniyar Soca" sau 336, ita kuma "Saɓannah" 140.
Bringing his personal disappointment into the public domain, George's lyrics accused the "soca mafia" — ostensibly a group of deejays and radio station owners — of conspiring to play "Soca Kingdom" at the all judging points.	Kawo rashin jin daɗinsa zuwa gaban jama'a, baitukan waƙar George sun zargi "soca mafia" - a bayyana haɗakar wasu masu gabatar da shirye-shirye da masu gidajen rediyo - da haɗa baki don a sa "Soca Kingdom" a duk lokacin da ake alƙalanci.
He sings:	Ya yi waƙa:
On the stage was a next set of drama, the DJs and them playing "Savannah"	A kan dandalin akwai wani wasan kwaikwayo, masu gabatar da shirye-shirye suna jin "Saɓannah"
But when the mafia come, they switching from "Savannah" to ‘Kingdom’	Amma a lokacin da 'yan ƙungiyar suka so, sai aka sauya daga "Saɓannah" zuwa "Kingdom"
They join forces to win the big fight... this year you have to team up with Jesus Christ	Sun haɗa kai domin su ci nasarar babban faɗan… wannan shekarar sai dai kuka haɗa kai da Yesu
In another version of the song, George accuses Montano of "bad talking" him, and belittles the honorary doctorate Montano recently received from the University of Trinidad and Tobago for his contribution to soca music.	A wani salon waƙar, George ya zargi Montano da "gulmar" sa kuma ya raina digirin girmamawa da Montane ya karɓa a baya-bayan nan daga jami'ar Trinidad da Tobago domin gudummawarsa ga kiɗan soca.
Soon after George’s song was released, Montano responded with "Dr. Mashup", in which he directly addressed allegations of rigging the Road March contest:	Jim kaɗan bayan sakin waƙar George, sai Montano ya mayar da martani da "Dr. Mashup", wadda a cikinta kai tsaya ya mayar da martani game da zargin maguɗi gasar Road March:
That was not the end of it: at a new Carnival party, "Hydrate", on January 13, both artists performed. George included his new verse and Montano supposedly had the last word:	Wannan ba shi ne ƙarshe abin ba: a wajen wani sabon shagalin biki, "Hydrate", a 13 ga Janairu, duk 'yan wasan biyu sun yi wasa. George ya shigar da sabon baitinsa kuma Montano ne yake da maganar ƙarshe:
After their performances, Montano’s manager, Anthony Chow Lin On, posted a photo to Instagram in which he comically holds the two apart:	Bayan wasan nasu, manajan Montano, Anthony Chow Lin On, ya sanya wani hoto a Instagiram wanda a cikinsa ya raba tsakanin biyun a wayance:
The post left fans to wonder if the feud was real or simply a publicity stunt:	Rubutun ya bar masoya suna mamakin ko dai rigimar ta gaske ce ko kuma kawai wasa da hankali:
Stunt or not, many social media users following the feud have pointed out that this type of lyrical sparring (known as a "sound clash") is not new; in fact, it is intricately woven into the origins of calypso music, and its modern-day hybrid, soca.	Ko wasa ko a'a, da yawa daga cikin masu amfani da dandulan sadarwa sun nuna cewa irin wannan nau'in faɗan na baitoci (wanda aka sani da "faɗan baka") ba sabo ba ne; a taƙaice ma dai, yana nan ɗamfare da asalin kiɗan calypso, kuma abu ne na zamani a kiɗan soca.
In a recent interview, George himself addressed the fact that he was just "documenting the history" as he "always does", following the path of legendary calypsonians who did the same.	A wata ganawar baya-bayan nan, shi kansa George ya yi bayanin cewa kawai shi ne yana "adana tarihi" ne kamar yadda ya saba "a koyaushe" yana biyo hanyar shahararrun mawaƙan calypso waɗanda suka yi irin hakan.
While calypso music is well known for its social and political commentary, an early form of the music involved verbal dueling similar to the war of words taking place between George and Montano.	A yayin da aka san kiɗan calypso saboda sharhin lamarun zamantakewa da na siyasa, nau'in waƙoƙin na farko ya ƙunshi sa'insa mai kamar yaƙin kalmomi wanda yake faruwa tsakanin George da Montano.
Calypso tents, where calypsonians perform during the Carnival season, were hugely popular for their "extempo wars", live contests in which singers would improvise lyrics on the spot mocking each other, or on a specific theme.	Yan rukunin Calypso, a inda mawaƙan Calypso suka yi wasa a lokacin bikin, sun fi shahara saboda "zafin yaƙin" su, wanda ake yi kai tsaye a inda mawaƙi zai ƙirƙiri baituka yana suna yi tsokanar juna, ko kuma a kan wani jigo na musamman.
The banter between the performers is locally referred to as "picong".	Irin wannan 'yar tsamar da ake yi a tsakanin 'yan wasan ana kiran sa "picong".
Such performances are typically interactive, with audiences echoing one of several refrains, the most common of which is "Santimanitay!", a derivative of the French phrase “sans humanité”, or “without pity”.	Irin waɗannan wasannan galibi sukan ƙunshi kowa, a wani lokacin 'yan kallo suna shigo da kalamansu da yawa, wanda aka fi faɗa shi ne "Santimanitay!" kalmar da aka samo daga Faransancin "sans humanite", ko "ba tare da tausayawa ba".
But audiences have rarely witnessed a back-and-forth like this in recorded soca music.	Amma masu kallo da wahala suke ganin irin wanan kwan-gaba-kwan-baya irin wannan a kiɗa socar da aka naɗa.
And real or not, the George/Montano feud has listeners as engaged as any extempo wars audience, both at Carnival events and online.	Gaske ko a'a, faɗan George/Montano yana da masu sauraro kamar duk wani irin wannan faɗan, a wurin bikin da kuma a intanet.
George and Montano will, very likely, both in the running for the 2019 Road March title and at the very least, the added drama makes for good entertainment and more music.	George da Montano za su, zai iya faruwa, dukkansu a wajen gasar 2019 ta matsayin Road March, sannan ɗan abin da ya faru ya ƙara armashi da ƙarin waƙoƙi.
Soca lovers could ask for nothing more.	Masoyan kiɗan soca ba za su tambayi wani abu ƙari ba.

The Spiny Babbler, found only in Nepal, has fascinated ornithologists and bird lovers from around the world. Don Messerschmidt writes about ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley’s account of the bird in his book Search for the Spiny Babbler:	Tsuntsun Spiny Babbler da ake samu a Nepal kawai, yana ba wa masu nazarin tsuntsuya da masu son tsuntsusaya sha'awa a duk faɗin duniya.

It was a species that had defied scientists for years, since 1843 or 1844.	Wani nau'i da ya gagari masu kimiyya tsawon shekaru, tun 1843 ko 1844.
At that time Brian Hodgson’s Nepali collectors working for him in the unknown vastnesses of Nepal had secured several specimens, he writes.	A wannan lokacin Brian Hodgson na masu kwasowa a Nepali sun yi masa aiki a wannan filin da ba a sani ba na Nepal sun sami nau'ika da yawa, ya rubuta.
The Spiny Babbler had remained a mystery ever since, one of the five species of Indian birds, which, along with the Mountain Quail, had apparently vanished from the face of the earth.

The bird is threatened by the clearance of scrub for agriculture and expansion of urban areas.	Barazanar share dazuka domin noma da kuma faɗaɗa gari ne suke damun tsuntsun.
Outside protected areas, it is sometimes threatened by hunting, and the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley have seen a decline in Spiny Babbler numbers.

The recent public feud between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari — both retired military dictators — has a great impact on next month's elections.

In a rare open letter to Buhari, Obasanjo has accused him of plans to rig the 2019 elections. He wrote:	A wata wasiƙa wadda ba a saba gani ba zuwa ga Buhari, Obasanjo ya zarge shi da shirin yin maguɗin zaɓe a zaɓuɓɓukan 2019. Ya rubuta:

Obasanjo insisted that Buhari would not deliver "free, fair, credible and peaceful elections" and warned that what "is happening under Buhari’s watch can be likened to what we witnessed under Gen.

The five political parties at the time endorsed Abacha as their sole presidential candidate.	Jam'iyyun siyasa biyar na lokacin duk sai suka tabbatar da Abacha a matsayin ɗan takararsu na shugabancin ƙasa.
Now deceased, Abacha became infamous for his repression of human rights and corruption.	A yanzu ya rasu, Abacha ya yi ƙaurin suna wajen take haƙƙin ɗan'adam da kuma cin hanci.
Obasanjo alleged that Buhari was towing the "same path" as Abacha "in mad desperation".	Obasanjo ya yi zargin cewa Buhari ma yana tafiya ne a kan "hanya ɗaya" kamar Abacha "a muguwar zaƙuwa".
Shehu Garba, the media assistant to President Buhari, dismissed Obasanjo's letter:	Shehu Garba, mai taimakawa shugaba Buhari, ya yi watsi da wasiƙar Obasanjo:
The elections starting in February will be free and fair as promised the nation and the international community by President Buhari.	Zaɓuɓɓukan da za su fara a Fabarairu za su zama cike da adalci kamar yadda shugaba Buhari ya yi ƙasa da duniya alƙawari.
Obasanjo, the letter writer?	Obasanjo, marubucin wasiƙa?
Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state (1976-1979) and later Nigeria’s democratically elected president (1999-2007), has consistently criticized successive governments in Nigeria.	Olusegun Obasanjo, tsohon shugaban ƙasar soja na Najeriya (1976-1979) daga baya kuma zaɓaɓɓen shugaban ƙasa a mulkin dimukuraɗiyya (1999-2007) ya saba sukar dukkanin gwamnatoci a Najeriya.
Last year, Obasanjo had advised Buhari not to seek re-election as president but to "consider a deserved rest at this point in time and at this age".	A shekarar bara, Obasanjo ya ba wa Buhari shawarar kar ya nemi ƙarin zango a matsayin shugaban ƙasa, sai dai ya "ya duba yiwuwar hutawa a wannan lokaci da kuma waɗannan shekaru".
This advice caused ripples in Nigeria because Obasanjo was a strong supporter of the Buhari’s candidacy during the 2015 presidential elections.	Shawarar ta yamutsa hazo a Najeriya saboda Obasanjo babban mai goyon bayan takarar Buhari ne a lokutan zaɓuɓɓukan shugaban ƙasa na 2015.
Prior, Obasanjo had scolded Goodluck Jonathan in a public letter written in 2013, Obasanjo accused Jonathan of driving the country to the precipice and allowing deceit, corruption and mutual distrust to tear at the fabric of the nation.	Kafin haka, Obasanjo ya caccaki Goodluck Jonathan a wata buɗaɗɗiyar wasiƙa a 2013, Obasanjo ya zargi Jonathan da jan ƙasar zuwa mawuyacin hali kuma ya bar yaudara da cin hanci da rashin aminci sun fatattaka rigar ƙasar.
Ironically, Obasanjo had also supported Jonathan's election in 2011. And in 2007, he promoted the election of Jonathan Goodluck's predecessor, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.	Abin mamaki, Obasanjo kuma ya goyi bayan takarar Jonathan a 2011. Kuma a 2007, ya goyi bayan zaɓen wanda Jonathan Goodluck ya gaba, Umaru Musa 'Yar'aduwa.
However, Obasanjo went against Yar’Adua when the latter became sick and did not hand properly hand over power to Jonathan, his then deputy.	Amma daga baya sai Obasanjo ya juya wa 'Yar'aduwa baya a lokacin da ya kamu da rashin lafiya kuma bai mayar da mulki yadda ya kamata zuwa Jonathan ba, wanda yake mataimakinsa a lokacin.

Retired generals never rest in Nigeria	Tsofaffin janar-janar ba sa hutawa a Najeriya
Nigeria’s political landscape is held by retired generals or their cronies. Obasanjo, for instance, has been instrumental in the emergence of Nigerian presidents from 2007 to 2015.	ɓangaren siyasar Najeriya yana riƙe a hannun tsofaffin janar-janar ko yaransu. Misali, Obasanjo, yana da hannu a samuwar shugabannin ƙasar Najeriya daga 2007 zuwa 2015.
However, unlike civilians – Yar’Adua and Jonathan – who he promoted and also criticized, Buhari is somewhat different.	Amma ba kamar fararen hula - 'Yar'aduwa da Jonathan - ba, waɗanda ya ɗaga kuma ya soka, Buhari shi daban yake.
Although Obasanjo supported Buhari’s election in 2015, he cannot fully take the praise alone.	Duk da cewa Obasanjo ya goyi bayan takarar Buhari a 2015, amma ba zai ɗauki yabo shi kaɗai ba.
This is because Buhari’s ascendance to power was made possible by his allegiance with Bola Tinubu’s defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).	Wannan kuwa domin hawan mulkin Buhari ya samu ne a sakamakon haɗin kai da rusasshiyar jam'iyyar Bola Tinubu ta (ACN).
Buhari’s Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) later merged with ACN, in February 2013, to form the All Progressive Congress (APC) .	Jam'iyyar Buhari ta CPC daga baya ta yi maja da ACN, a Fabarairun 2013, domin samar da APC.
In addition, Buhari a former military head of state (1983-1985) is a member of the ‘club’ of retired generals who have dominated Nigeria’s political space.	Daɗin-daɗawa, Buhari, tsohon shugaban mulkin soji (1983-1985) mamba ne na ƙungiyar tsofaffin janar-janar masu ritaya waɗanda suka mamaye siyasar Najeriya.
Therefore, as harsh as Obasanjo’s reprimand might sound, a lot depends on the dynamics of the power block to which they both belong.	Saboda duk yadda ƙiyayyar Obasanjo za ta yi zafi, abubuwa da yawa sun dogara ne da ƙarfin ikon wuraren da kowannensu ya fito.
Obasanjo is not alone, however, in his criticism of Buhari.	Haka kuma Obasanjo ba shi kaɗai ba ne a wurin sukar Buhari.
Theophilus Danjuma, a retired general, had in March last year accused "the Nigerian armed forces of aiding the ongoing killings in Nigeria".	Wani janar mai ritaya, Theophilus ɗanjuma, a Maris ɗin shekarar bara ya zargi "sojojin Najeriya da taimakawa kashe-kashen da ake yi a yau a Najeriya".
Danjuma, a former chief of army staff and later minister of defense, chastised the military for taking sides in the pastoral/farmer crisis in the country, but especially in his home state of Taraba.	ɗanjuma, wanda tsohon shugaban sojojin ƙasa ne, daga baya kuma ya zama ministan tsaro, ya zargi sojojin da nuna wariya a rikicin makiyaya da manoma a ƙasar, amma musamman a jiharsa ta asali ta Taraba.
Similarly, Danjuma recently raised an alarm about plans to use “the police and soldiers” to manipulate the 2019 elections.	Haka kuma, a baya-bayan nan ɗanjuma ya fallasa ƙorafin cewa akwai shirin yi amfani da "'yan sanda da sojoji" domin a juya zaɓuɓɓukan 2019.
Similarly, in February last year, former military head of state Ibrahim Babangida publicly advised President Buhari not to stand for re-election, arguing that 21st century Nigeria needs to tap younger generations.	Haka kuma, a Fabarairun shekarar da ta shuɗe, tsohon shugaban soja, Ibrahim Babangida a fili ya ba wa shugaba Buhari shawarar kar ya ƙara tsayawa takara, yana mai nuna cewa ƙarni na 21 yana buƙatar a koma ga matasa.
He believes that there "comes a time in the life of a nation when personal ambition should not override national interest".	Ya nuna cewa akwai "wani lokaci a tarihin ƙasa a lokacin da buƙatar ƙashin kai bai kamata ta take buƙatar ƙasa ba".
But it may be a while before Nigeria gets a civilian president who has no links or backing from the retired generals "club".	Amma za a ɗauki lokaci kafin Najeriya ta sami shugaban farar hula wanda ba shi da alaƙa ko goyon bayan "ƙungiyar" janar-janar masu ritaya ba.
	
With tensions rising ahead of 2019 presidential elections, Nigerians fear internet shutdown	Wannan yana nuna ba mu da wani abu da za mu da shi don kasancewarta.
Fears of an internet shutdown in Nigeria looms as tensions continue to rise ahead of 2019 presidential elections.	Ga masu nazari, ba wani sabon abu game da sabon ƙudurin.
Fear has spread across Nigeria that the government may switch off the internet during the presidential elections in February 2019.	A lokacin da tashin hankalin yake ƙaruwa a gabanin zaɓuɓɓukan shugaban ƙasa na 2019, 'yan Najeriya suna jin tsoron rufe intanet.
What started as mere speculation has morphed into intense worry as election day approaches. Yomi Kamez of Quartz Africa explains:	Tsoron rufe intanet a Najeriya yana ƙara saɗaɗowa a lokacin da ake ƙara samun ƙaruwar fargaba a gabanin zaɓuɓɓukan shugaban ƙasa na 2019.
You can tell fears of an internet shutdown are running high in a country when citizens are looking into methods of staying online in case of a blockage.	Tsoro ya yaɗu a tsakanin al'ummar Najeriya cewa gwamnati za ta iya rufe intanet a lokutan zaɓuɓɓukan shugaban ƙasa a Fabarairun 2019.
This past weekend, Quartz Africa’s guide to staying online during internet or social media blockages was our most read story, driven entirely by traffic from Nigeria.	Abin da ya fara a matsayin hasashe ya rikiɗe zuwa babbar damuwa a daidai lokaicn da ranar zaɓe take ƙara matsowa. Yomi Kamez na ƙuartz Africa ya bayyana:
Scores of people shared concerns on social media at the possibility Nigeria might follow other African countries [like Sudan, Zimbabwe] that have taken to blocking social media or shut down the internet altogether under the guise of security concerns.	Za ka iya cewa tsoron rufe intanet yana ƙara gudana a cikin ƙasar a lokacin da 'yan ƙasa suke kallon dabarun zama a kan intanet ko da za a toshe.
Recent events related to social media, hate speech, an unjust judiciary firing and replacement, and the breaking down of trust in the media have all contributed to the growing collective concern.	Wannan ƙarshen makon da ya wuce, hanyoyin zama a kan intanet na ƙuartz Africa a lokutan da za a toshe intanet ko soshiyal midiya shi ne labarinmu da aka fi karantaw, wanda ya samu rubdugun jama'a daga Najeriya.

On January 25, 2019, Nigerians were shocked by President Muhammadu Buhari’s unilateral suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria Justice Walter Onnoghen, and the immediate appointment and swearing in of Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, as the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN).	Wasu abubuwan da suka faru a baya-bayan da suke da alaƙa da soshiyal midiya da maganganun ƙage da kuma kora da sauya ɓangaren shari'a a cikin rashin adalci da kuma rushewar gaskiya a kafafen yaɗa labarai duk sun bayar da gudummawa wajen ƙara damuwar kowa.
Onnoghen had been charged with financial negligence and fraud.	Karya ƙarfin kotuna da tsarin doka
However, many critics say these charges were a ploy to gag the judiciary ahead of the elections and intimidate other arms of government.	A ranar 25 ga Janairun 2019, 'yan Najeriya sun kaɗu da dakatarwar da shugaban Buhari shi kaɗai, ya yi babban joji na Najeriya, mai shari'a Walter Onnoghen, da naɗa gami da rantsar mai shari'a Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad cikin sauri, a matsayin baban jojin ƙasa na riƙo.
The suspension of Onnoghen contradicts the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the removal of judicial officers.	An zargi Onnoghen da halin sakaci da kuɗaɗe da kuma zamba.
The Third Schedule, Part 1 of the 1999 Constitution states that only the National Judicial Council (NJC) has the power to recommend removals from office. Part IV of the Constitution further reiterates this law.	Amma da yawa daga cikin masu suka sun kalli waɗannan tuhume-tuhumen a matsayin wata dabara ta rufe bakin ɓangaren shari'a kafin zaɓuɓɓukan da kuma tsorata ɓangaren gwamnati.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari did not apply these principles.	Dakatar da Onnoghen ya saɓa wa kundin tsarin mulkin 1999 na Tarayyar Najeriya na cire ma'aikatan shari'a.
He usurped the powers of the NJC which is constitutionally mandated to recommend such removals from the judiciary or Senate (upper house of parliament) which must then ratify such decisions.	Kaso na Uku, ɓangare na 1 na kundin tsarin 1999 ya bayyana cewa Majalisar Shari'a ta ƙasa ce kaɗai take da ikon bayar da shawarar cirewa daga ofis. ɓangare na Iɓ na kundin tsarin mulki ya ƙara bayyana wannan dokar.
The president's action was both tyrannical and lawless.	Shugaban Najeriya Muhammadu Buhari bai yi amfani da waɗannan dokokin ba.
An editorial in Punch newspaper described Buhari's action as dictatorial and capable of precipitating a constitutional crisis:	Ya ƙwace ikon Majalisar Shari'a ta ƙasa wadda ita kundin tsarin mulki ya ba wa damar bayar da shawarar irin wannan cirewar daga ɓangaren shari'a ko majalisar dattijai (babbar majalisar ƙasa) wadda za ta sanya wa irin waɗannan matakan hannu.
Buhari’s action is vile, perfidious and indefensible.	Aikin shugaban kama-karya ne da ƙetare doka.
It is an action only fit for jackboot regimes, where the constitution could easily be suspended...	Wani labarin gidan jaridar Punch ya bayyana abin da Buhari ya yi a matsayin kama-karya kuma zai iya jawo hargitsin kundin tsarin mulki:
Needless to say, the president’s singular and misguided action has the tendency to plunge the country into an unnecessary constitutional crisis and, perhaps, derail 20 unbroken years of democratic governance.	Abin da Buhari ya yi rashin imani ne, shirme ne wanda ba za a iya kare shi ba.
This is not unlike other despotic and undemocratic acts that the government has been associated with in the past, even if it might be considered more audacious, far-reaching and probably unexpected.	Abu ne da ya dace da mulkin sokwayen sojoji kawai, wurin da za a iya dakatar da kundin tsarin mulki cikin sauƙi…
The governments of the United States and the United Kingdom also condemned the attack on the judiciary.	Ba sai an faɗa ba, wannan aikin da shugaban ƙasa ya yi shi kaɗai wanda yake ba daidai ba zai iya jefa ƙasar ƙasar cikin rikicin kundin tsarin mulki kuma, wataƙila, zai iya kautar da shekaru 20 a jere na mulkin dimukuraɗiyya.
On Twitter, netizens echoed the message.	Wannan ya yi kama da kama-karya ko kuma abubuwan da suka kauce wa tsarin dimukuraɗiyya waɗanda ake alaƙanta gwamnati da su a baya, ko da za ɗauke su a matsayin rashin kan gado, kuma waɗanda ba a yi zato ba.
Tackling hate speech is the new ‘national security’ mantra	Gwamnatocin Amurka da na Birtaniya ma sun yi allawadai da wannan harin da aka kai wa ɓangaren shari'a.
Another sign of a possible internet shut down is the government’s tendency to control free speech online on the basis of concerns for national security.	A Tuwita, ma'abota intanet sun ƙara yayata saƙon.
Recently, the government directed security agencies to "tackle the propagation of hate speech, especially through social media".	Tunkarar maganganun ɓatanci wani sabon take ne na tsaron ƙasa
This, according to reports by the Cable, will be achieved by monitoring social media accounts of "prominent Nigerians".	Wata alamar da ke nuna yiwuwar rufe intanet shi ne yunƙurin gwamnati na lura da 'yancin magana a intanet da sunan damuwa da halin tsaron ƙasa.
In July last year, Nigerian Minister of Information Lai Mohammed described the growing level of fake news and hate speech in the country as a threat to national security.	A baya-bayan nan, gwamnati ta yi umarni ga jami'an tsaro da su "tunkari yaɗa maganganun ɓatanci, musamman a soshiyal midiya".
A year earlier, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State, described fake news and hate speech as the "biggest threat" to national security.	Wannan, kamar yadda rahotannin Cable suka nuna, za a iya cim musu ne ta hanyar sanya ido a kan shafukan soshiyal midiya na "wasu fitattun 'yan Najeriya".
However, it is ironic that both Lai and El-Rufai are now concerned about fake news and hate speech as a national security threat.	A Yulin shekarar da ta shuɗe, ministan yaɗa labarai na Najeriya, Lai Mohammed, ya bayyana ƙaruwar labaran ƙarya da maganganun ɓatanci a ƙasar a matsayin barazana ga tsaron ƙasa.
As opposition politicians, they both made unsubstantiated accusations to the former government.	Shekara ɗaya kafin haka, Nasir El-Rufa'I, gwamnan jihar Kaduna, ya bayyana labaran ƙarya da maganganun ɓatanci a matsayin "mafi girman barazana" ga tsaron ƙasa.
For instance, Nassir El-Rufai, current governor of Kaduna State alleged in 2014 — without evidence — that he was “number 7 on [President Jonathan Goodluck’s] sniper’s list”.	Amma, abu ne mai ban mamaki cewa da Lai da El-Rufa'i sun damu yanzu da labaran ƙarya da maganganun ɓatanci a matsayin barazana ga tsaron ƙasa.
El-Rufai also claimed that Goodluck, then president, was a sponsor of the Boko Haram militant group. Similar claims were made by Lai Mohammed, who was then the National Publicity Secretary of APC.	A matsayin 'yan siyasar adawa, dukkaninsu sun yi maganganun da ba su da tabbas ga gwamnatin da ta shuɗe.
As opposition politicians, these officials have in fact been proven to be purveyors of fake news and hate speech, using social media to devastating effects.	Misali, Nasir El-Rufa'i, gwamnan jihar Kaduna mai ci a yanzu ya yi zargi a 2014 - ba tare da hujja ba - cewa shi ne "na 7 a jerin sunayen waɗanda [shugaban ƙasa Jonathan Goodluck] zai sa a harbe.
But their actions were never considered a threat to national security; they were neither arrested nor was the internet shut down for this reason.	El-Rufa'i kuma ya yi zargin cewa Goodluck, shugaban wancan lokaci, shi ne yake ɗaukar nauyin ƙungiyar 'yan ta'addan Boko Haram. Lai Mohammed, ya yi irin waɗannan zarge-zargen, wanda shi ne sakataren yaɗa labarai na jam'iyyar APC a lokacin.

Movements like the 2012 #OccupyNigeria and the 2014 #BringBackOurGirls gained global acclaim due to social media usage in Nigeria.	Amma ba a taɓa ɗaukar abin da suka yi a matsayin barazana ga tsaron ƙasa ba; ba a kama su ba kuma ba a rufe intanet ba don wannan dalilin.
In 2015, social media played an important role in Nigeria's elections when Twitter became a bitter and divisive battleground during campaign season and was used to propagate hate speech and disinformation.	Soshiyal midiya da zaɓuɓɓuka a Najeriya
This year, it has already played a major role as the medium of choice for political participation by Nigeria’s energetic youth population.	Gangami irin na 2012 na #OccupyNigeria (mamaye Najeriya) da na 2014 na #BringBackOurGirls (ADawoManaDa'Yanmatanmu) sun sami karɓuwa a duniya saboda amfani da soshiyal midiya a Najeriya.
Netizens have used social media to call attention to despotic government actions like the sacking of the CJN, that otherwise would have gone unnoticed by the general public.	A 2015, intanet ta taka muhimmiyar rawa a zaɓuɓɓukan Najeriya a lokacin da Tuwita ta zama wani zazzafan fagen fma a lokutan kamfen kuma an yi amfani da ita domin yayata maganganun ɓatanci da kuma maganganun ƙarya.

Whether or not the internet holds steady during elections, there is strong reason to believe that political speech online and on the street will be a target of government scrutiny.

When revelers take to the streets each year for Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, they do so with a soundtrack.	Wani ɗan wasa a gasar, "ya yi tsalle" ga kiɗan soca a kan dandali a dandalin ƙueen's Park Saɓannah, a wurin gasar, ran Talata, 2009.
Their playlist is always an energetic mix of that year's hottest soca music hits, but the Road March — the song that is played the most at specified judging points along the parade route — is a title that comes with both a valuable prize package and the prestige of being part of a proud history.	Hoto daga Georgia Popplewell, an samu izinin amfani da shi.
Claims in the last decade or so of the competition being rigged — ostensibly by a group of powerful radio station owners, DJs and music industry executives known as the "soca mafia" — have not eroded the belief that the Road March represents the voice of the people.	Zaɓin waƙarsu a koyaushe shi ne wani zazzafan haɗin kiɗan soca, amma Road March - waƙar da aka fi ji a lokacin yake hukuncin gasar - wani suna ne da ya zo tare da wani ƙunshin kyauta mai muhimmanci da alfaharin kasancewa wani ɓangare na wannan tarihi.
Soca star Machel Montano, who has won the coveted Road March title a whopping nine times thus far, describes it as "the song that make[s] the people feel the most vibes and come out of themselves" — and which artist wouldn't want to lay claim to that?	A wajen mafiya yawan masu wasan soca, son cin gasar Road March abu ne d a zahiri suke da matuƙar muradinsa.
But don't be fooled into thinking that the road to the Road March is solely based on creative merit.	Zarge-zargen da ake yi a wajejen shekaru goma da suka wuce ko wani abu makamancin haka cewa ana maguɗi a gasar - a fili ƙarara daga wasu manyan masu gidajen redio da manyan Dije-dije da masu faɗa a ji a harkar kiɗan soca waɗanda aka fi sani da "soca mafi" - bai hana amincewa da cewa gasar Road March tana wakiltar sautin al'umma.
A Road March song must have certain key ingredients to even be in the running:	Fitaccen jarumin Soca, Machel Montano, wanda ya ci wannan babban gasar ta Road March har sau tara zuwa yanzu, ya bayyana ta da cewa "waƙa ce da take sanya mutane su ji nishaɗi har su fito don kansu" - kuma wane mawaƙi ne ba zai so ya ce tasa ba ce?
1. A danceable, yet powerful melody that makes people want to “break away” on stage, with lyrics that capture the feelings of joyful release and abandon that Carnival represents.	Amma kar a raina ka har ka yi tunanin cewa hanyar samun gasar Road March kawai an gina ta ne a kan cancanta.
2. A refrain that the audience can echo, in the call and response tradition of the calinda, from which calypso — and its modern-day hybrid, soca — originated.	Waƙar gasar Road March dole ta ƙunshi wasu muhimman abubuwa domin ta shiga cikin jerin:
3. A well-timed release.	1. Wani zazzafan kiɗa mai sa rawa wanda zai sa mutane su ji kamar "su ruga" a kan dandamali, da baituka waɗanda za su dace da nishaɗi waɗanda baje-kolin yake wakilta.
If a song peaks too early in the season and doesn't have staying power, competing tunes can usurp its position.	Amshin da 'yan kallo za su karɓa, a hanyar amsawa da martani ga "calinda", daga inda waƙar "calypso" - da sabon tsarinta na zamani, na soca - suka samo asali.
Conversely, if a great tune is released too late, masqueraders may not have enough time to get familiar with it during pre-Carnival events.	3. Saki a kan lokacin da ya dace.
Sometimes, the Road March contest has a clear favourite that never gets challenged; at others, the competition is so stiff that it's simply too close to call.	Idan waƙa ta yi tashe a wani lokaci amma kuma ba ta da ƙarfin daɗewa, wasu waƙoƙin masu gasa da ita za su iya ƙwace gurbinta.
In no particular order, here are some the songs that we think are the biggest contenders for Trinidad and Tobago Carnival's 2019 Road March...	Haka kuma, in aka yi jinkirin sakin wata kyakkyawar waƙa, masu zuzutawa ba za su sami damar sanin ta ba, a lokacin bukukuwan kafin baje-kolin.
1. "Savannah Grass" by Kes	A wasu lokutan gasar Road March tana da wani wanda ta fi so wanda ba a ƙalubalantarsa; ga wasu kuma, gasar tana da tsauri sosai wanda da wahala a sha.
The Queen's Park Savannah, an oasis of green space in the middle of Trinidad's capital, is the hub of the country's Carnival celebrations and home to the festival's main stage.	Ba wani tartibin jeri ba, a nan ga wasu waƙoƙi da muke tunanin su ne 'yan takara mafiya girma a baje-kolin Trinidad da Tobago na 2019 na Road March…
This song perfectly captures the significance of the space, and the memories it has helped create for masqueraders through the years.	1. "Waƙar Saɓannah Grass" daga Kes
There is a reverence about the tune: as if the Savannah is the sun at the centre of the Carnival universe and everything else just has the privilege of revolving around it.	Waƙar The ƙueen's Park Saɓannah, wani dausayin koren wuri a tsakiyar babban birnin Trinidad, shi ne babban wurin casun baje-kolin ƙasar kuma gidan babban dandalin gasar.
"Savannah Grass" is an invitation to experience this magical world.	Wannan waƙar ta kawo muhimmancin wannan wurin daidai, da kuma tunanin da ta yi taimakon samarwa ga masu son gasar a cikin shekaru.
Oxymoronically, the loose steadiness of the percussion is a nod to both the regimented dedication of Carnival lovers and their easygoing way of enjoying themselves.	Akwai wani girma game da waƙar: kamar ita Saɓannah ita ce ranar da take a tsakiyar wurin baje-kolin, kuma kowane abu kawai yana kai kawo ne a kewayenta.
The tune is both melodious and energetic, with a pace that makes it a good song for "chipping" (the light shuffle step with which masqueraders walk/dance down the road).	Waƙar "Saɓannah Grass" wata gayyata ce domin fuskantar wannan duniyar mai ban mamaki.
By its clever incorporation of archival Carnival footage, the official video further elevates the genius of the song by showing how it seamlessly spans generations and builds on the foundation blocks of calypso to produce a fresh soca offering.	A hanyar rashin daidaito, yanayin yadda kiɗan yake yakan ba wa masu baje-kolin da masoya hanya mai sauƙi da za su ji daɗinsu.
Even if it does not win Road March (though it has a very good chance!), "Savannah Grass" will go down in the annals of soca music as one of the timeless tunes that stir the emotions of Carnival lovers everywhere.	Kiɗan yana da daɗi da armashi, da 'yar tazara da take ƙara masa daɗi (wurin wucewar da aka haska wanda yake sa 'yan wasan sun wuce/yi rawa a kan titin).
2. "Rag Storm" by Super Blue, featuring 3 Canal	Yanayin bidiyon bikin gasar ta hanyar yadda aka yi shi, yakan ƙasa yadda abin yake tsallakawa daga ƙarni zuwa ƙarni wanda yake samar da sabuwar hanyar yin waƙar soca.
An interesting idiosyncrasy of "playing mas'" and dancing to soca music is that somehow, people's hands go up in the air, usually with whatever they are holding at the moment, from drinks to facecloths.	Ko da ba ta samu nasarar cin gasar Road March ba (duk da cewa tana da dama!), waƙar "Saɓannah Grass" za ta kasance a tarihin kiɗan soɗa a matsayin ɗaya daga cikin kaɗe-kaɗe waɗanda suke sa shauƙin masoya a ko'ina.
Colloquially called "rags", these come in handy for soaking up the sweat while "jumping up". The practice was not lost on Super Blue, who wrote a song called "Get Something and Wave", that won the 1991 Road March.	2. "Rag Storm" daga Super Blue, wadda ta nuna Canal 3.
He echoed the concept a few years later with "Bacchanal Time", in which he commanded masqueraders to "start to wave" as the brass section played the familiar "F-jam" or "tantana" melody in the background.	Wata ɗabi'a ta musamman ta "playing mas" da rawa ta waƙar soca shi ne, hannuwan mutane suna sama, kusan koyaushe da ko ma me suke riƙe a lokacin, daga abubuwan sha zuwa abubuwan rufe fuska.
Super Blue had come up with a formula for the type of song that worked on the road: he won again in 1995 with his ode to cricketer Brian Lara, in which he directed his audience to "raise yuh bat and party".	A wani harshen ana kiransu "tsummokara" waɗannan suna amfani a lokacin goge gumi a lokacin "tsalle sama". Ba a rasa wannan abin ba a "Super Blue, wanda ya rubuta wata waƙa da ake kira "Get Something and Waɓe", wadda a ci gasar Road March na 1991.
"Rag Storm" has many of those same elements — the lavway-type call-and-response, with a wild aerobic pace that encourages frenzied rag-waving.	Ya amsa manufar a 'yan shekaru da "Bacchanal Time", a cikin wadda ya ba wa masu wasa umarnin su "fara motsawa" a lokacin da ɓangaren kiɗan ya yi daidai da kiɗan "F-jam" ko "tantana" daga ƙasa-ƙasa.
It's a great song for the stage as masqueraders break loose and “play themselves”, and may very well prove to be one to beat in this year's Road March race.

If there's one song that's aggressively going after the Road March title this year, it's this big tune that has several winning ingredients:	Waƙa ce mai muhimmanci sosai ga dandalin a daidai lokacin da 'yan kallon suke cashewar kuma suna "yin waƙar da kansu", kuma za su zama waɗanda za su yi nasara a gasar wannan shekarar ta Road March.
a driving "power soca" beat, strong lyrics that capture the essence of the unity of the festival, and a clever hook that appeals to the tribal facet of Carnival — going everywhere with your crew, or as Trinbagonians say, your "famalay" (not to be confused with "family"):	3. "Famalay" daga Machel Montano da Bunji Grlin da kuma Skinny Fabulous
Well, let me tell you one time, famalay is famalay and that different from bloodline	In har akwai wata waƙa tilo da ta fito da ƙarfinta don neman cinye gasar wannan shekarar ta Road March, to wannan waƙar ce da take da abubuwa d yawa na yin nasara:

Famalay doh ever ‘fraid to have your back at all time...	To, bari in gaya ma a karo ɗaya, "famalay" ita ce "famalay" da kuma wannan bambancin tun asali
Without giving instructions (with the exception of one verse in which Skinny sings "show me yuh hand" and "come follow me"), the song achieves an almost militaristic sense of purpose.	Wasu sun ce jini ne amma su ba sa son su ga hasken rana
Its sweet soca hook, peppered with the occasional dancehall-inspired lyrical improvisation, has been driving crowds wild at Carnival fetes.	Famalay kar ka ji tsoron samun bayanka a kowane lokaci…
Though there was some discussion as to whether or not "Famalay" would even qualify for the Road March contest because Skinny hails from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the rules say that once "the majority of the lead vocal performance" is "undertaken and carried out by nationals of Trinidad and Tobago", the song can be a contender — and this one definitely is.	Ba tare da bayar da dokoki ba (ba tare da baiti ɗaya ba a inda Skinny ya yi waƙa "nuna min hannunka" da "zo biyo ni"), waƙar ta yi nasarar samun wani ƙarfi na musamman.
This is not to say that it's a three-song race. With just about three weeks to go before Carnival, there other tunes — including two wicked ones by female artists Destra Garcia and Patrice Roberts — that may just give our picks a run for their money, and with soca performers still dropping new tracks, the battle for Road March 2019 is still being fought.	ƙarfin yadda waƙar soca take kamu, wanda hakan yake haɗe da yadda 'yan kallo masu rawa suke ƙara mata armashi, yakan sa taron mutanen su ji shauƙi a wajen gasar.

The population density in downtown Kowloon peninsula is about 44,000 people per square kilometer, and about 20,000 people live in Yau Ma Tei.	A ƙasa ga wani yankin bidiyo na taiye-tafiyen na 2017 a Youtube:
Many apartments are sub-divided into smaller units. People live so closely together, but at the same time, they are quite isolated.	Sun yi kusa, amma a keɓance
Quite a number of the cases featured on the tour involve elderly people.	Cunkushewar al'ummar da ke cikin garin Kowloon ya kai adadin mutane 44,000 a murabba'in kilomita, da kuma kusan mutane 20,000 da suke zaune a Yau Ma Tei.

It is difficult to imagine that no one had taken notice of the somewhat desperate living conditions of two elderly people.	Daga baya aka bayyana cewa shi mijin shi ne mai kula da matar, wadda take fama da cutar mantuwa.
According to the 2016 population census, there were about 1.16 million people aged 65 and over in Hong Kong—about 15.9 per cent of the total population.	Mijin ya faɗi a ɗakin kwanciya ya mutu, ita kuma matar a hankali yunwa ta kashe ta a kan gado.
About 150 thousand of those people lived alone.	Abu ne mai wahala a yi tunanin ba wanda ya kula da irin wannan yanayin zama mai buƙatar kulawa na waɗannan tsofaffin mutane biyu.
The average monthly income of retired elderly people in 2016—including pension and family and government support—was HK$5,780 (US$720).

In another case, a dead baby with its umbilical cord intact was found in a bag in Yau Ma Tei subway station by a cleaning lady.	A dalilin haka, ta bar makaranta ta koma harkar hoto domin samun na kanta.
Upon investigation, the police found out that the mother was a foreign domestic helper who became pregnant and was afraid that her employers would dismiss her. The woman was arrested and jailed.

A doctor who was part of a team of medical workers who took the tour said this of one case:	Yawancin masu kula da rangadin ɗaliban kwaleji ne.

The three-storied "Jahaj Bari" had beautiful motifs on the railings.	Ginin na "Jahaj Bari" mai hawa uku, yana da wata kwalliya mai kyau a jikin relarsa.
The long verandah had designed roofs.	Doguwar barandar tana da rufi mai kwalliya.

So, the building needed to be saved.	Don haka, ginin yana buƙatar a kare shi.
Dhaka was established as the capital of Bengal in 1610, more than four centuries ago.	An kafa Dhaka a matsayin babban birnin Bengal a 1610, sama da ƙarni huɗu da suka shuɗe.
During the years of Mughal rule and British colonial rule, many buildings were built that form part of the history and heritage of the city.	A lokacin shekarun mulkin Mughal da mulkin mallaka na Birtaniya, an gina gine-gine da yawa waɗanda suka zama su ne gine-gine na tarihin birnin.

Nigeria's social media bill will obliterate online freedom of expression	ƙudurin dokar dandulan sadarwa na Najeriya zai hana 'yancin faɗar albarkacin baki a yanar gizo.
The draconian bill will legalize internet shutdowns in Nigeria	Wanna ƙudurin na kama-karya zai bayar da damar kashe harkar intanet a Najeriya.
Senator Mohammed Sani Musa is the sponsor of the social media bill. Screenshot from Channel Television You Tube video.	Sanata Mohammed Sani Musa ne ya ɗauki nauyin ƙudurin dokar dandulan sadarwa. Hoton waya daga Talabijin ɗin Channel da bidiyon Youtube.
On November 20, the Protection from Internet Falsehoods and Manipulation of other Related Matters Bill 2019, known as the "social media bill", sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, sailed through a second reading.	A 20 ga Nuwamba, kudirin kariya game da ƙarya da sauya bayanai da sauran abubuwa masu a alaƙa da wannan a intanet na 2019, wanda aka sani da "kudirin soshiya mediya" wanda sanata Mohammed Sani Musa ya kai, ya wuce karatu na biyu.
The social media bill aims to curb online falsehoods and mis- and disinformation.	ƙudirin na soshiyal mediya yana da burin hana ƙarya da cakuɗa bayanai a intanet.
However, the real intent is not regulation, but rather, the annihilation of online freedom of expression, criminalization of government criticism and legalization of internet shutdowns in Nigeria.	Amma a zahirin gaskiya manufar zahiri ba wai a gyara ba ne, kawai ana so a toshe dukkanin wani 'yan magana ne a kan intanet, wanda zai mayar da masu sukar gwamnati zuwa masu laifi kuma ya bayar da damar toshe kafafen intanet a Najeriya.
A similar bill was beaten dead in its track in 2016.	An taɓa jefar da irin wannan ƙudirin a kan hanyarsa a 2016.
Any form of government criticism is a crime	Duk wani nau'in suka ga gwamnati laifi ne
This bill aims to "[prevent] the transmission of false statements or declaration of facts in Nigeria", according to Section 1a.	ƙudirin yana nufi ya"[hana] isar da bayanan ƙarya ko tabbatar da gaskiya a Najeriya", kamar yadda Sashe na 1a ya bayyana.
Section 3a to b(i) of the social media bill states that:	Sashen 3a zuwa b(i) na dokar sociyal midiya ya bayyana cewa:
A person must not do any act in or outside Nigeria in order to transmit in Nigeria a statement knowing or having reasons to believe that it is a false statements of fact; and the transmission of the statement in Nigeria is likely to be, prejudicial to the security of Nigeria or any part of Nigeria.	
The nebulous "national security" excuse is used to justify the trumping of free expression.	An yi amfani da hanzarin shiririta na "tsaron ƙasa" ne domin a samu hanyar da za a daƙile 'yancin bayyana ra'ayi.
But it does not stop there, the Nigerian government is always right and cannot be criticized.	Amma abin bai tsaya a nan ba, gwamnatin Najeriya a koyaushe daidai take yi, kuma don haka ba za a soke ta ba.
According to Section 3b(vi), any statement that diminishes “public confidence in the performance of any duty or function of, in the exercise of any power of the government” is prohibited.	Kamar yadda sashe na 3b(ɓi) ya bayyana, duk wani bayani da zai tauye ƙimar "goyon bayan jama'a game da kowane irin aiki a wajen tabbatar da kowane irin iko na gwamnati" haramtacce ne.
According to Section 3b(v), this applies to any statement that: "incites feelings of enmity, hatred, directed at persons or ill-will between different groups of persons".	Kamar yadda sashe na 3b(ɓi) ya bayyana, duk wani bayani da: "ya jawo jin ƙiyayya ko tsana da aka yi wa wani ko mugun nufi a tsakanin rukunonin al'umma mabambanta".
This is dangerous because it leaves regulators open to contradictory interpretations that could be abused by political actors.	Wannan na da haɗari saboda ya ba wa dokokin ma'anoni mabambamta da 'yan siyasa ka iya amfani da su ta hanyar da ba ta dace ba.
Who defines and approves what incites feelings of hatred?	To waye ya ba da ma'ana ya kuma yarda meye yake janyo tsana?
It means that seeking transparency or even daring to hold a politician accountable could be declared hateful.	Hakan na nufin cewa za a iya fassara neman bayyana gaskiya daga ɗan siyasa ko kuma buƙatar yin aiki a fili a matsayin tsanarsa.
The punishment upon conviction for any provisions of the bill is a fine that ranges between 200,000 and 10 million naira [about $556 to $28,000 United States dollars], imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or both.	Hukuncin duk wanda aka kama da laifin saɓawa dokar shi ne tara ta adadin kuɗi tsakanin naira 200,000 zuwa naira miliyan 10 [kimanin $556 zuwa $28,000 na dalar Amurka] ko kuma ɗauri na aƙalla shekaru uku ko kuma duka biyun.
Police licensed to shut down the internet	An ba wa 'yan sanda umarnin da su rufe kafar sadarwa ta yanar gizon.
The social media bill also grants the government unlimited power to switch off the internet, through the "Access Blocking Order" as contained in Section 12, number 3:	ƙudurin dokar kula da kafafen sada zumunta ya ba wa gwamnati cikakken ikon rufe kafar ta yanar gizo ta hanyar amfani da doka mai suna "Dokar Toshe Sadarwa" da ke ƙunshe a sashe na 12, lamba ta 3.
The Law Enforcement Department may direct the NCC [Nigerian Communications Commission – the regulatory agency for the telecommunication industry] to order the internet access service provider to take reasonable steps to disable access by end-users in Nigeria.	Sashen da ke kula da tabbatar da doka ka'iya ba da umarni ga Hukumar NCC [Hukumar Kula da Harkokin Sadrwa ta ƙasa - wacce duk kamfanonin sadarwa ke ƙarƙashinta] a kan ta umarci kamfanonin sadarwar su shirya tsaf don toshewa 'yan Nijeriya hanyoyin sadarwa.
Internet service providers must comply with this blocking order or risk upon conviction a fine within the range of 5 to 10 million naira [$14,000-28,000 USD].	Dole ne kamfanonin sadarwar su bi wannan doka ta toshe hanyoyin sadarwa ko kuma su fuskanci hukuncin tarar kuɗi daga naira miliyan 5 zuwa naira miliyan 10 [wato $14,000 zuwa $28,000 na dalar Amurka].
In addition, the bill under consideration indemnifies the internet service providers from any "civil or criminal liability" incurred from a lawsuit brought against them for "complying to any access blocking order", according to section 12, number 5.	Bayan haka, sashe na 12, lamba ta 5 ya bayyana cewa ƙudurin ya wanke kamfanonin sadarwa daga duk wata ƙara da za a iya kai su game da "karya dokar mu'amala ko kuma kuma aikata laifi" sakamakon "bin dokar toshe hanyoyin sadarwa" da suka yi.
The human rights violations get murkier because the law grants the police a legal license to command an access-blocking order at whim.	Akwai rashin tabbas game da zancen keta haƙƙin ɗan adam saboda doka ta ba wa 'yan sanda lasisin damar toshe hanyoyin sadarwa a duk lokacin da su ka ga dama.
Section 15a states that only the "initiative" of the police in face of "overwhelming sufficing evidence" is needed to cancel an internet shutdown in the country.	Sashe na 15a ya bayyana cewa "yunƙurin" 'yan sanda kaɗai ake buƙata tare da "cikakkiyar hujja" don a soke ƙoƙarin rufe kafar yanar gizo a ƙasar.
Consequently, "no appeal may be made to the High Court" [Section 13(2)] by any party to revoke such a ban without first applying to the police to revoke an existing blocking order.	Saboda haka, "babu wanda zai iya ɗaukaka ƙara a babbar kotu" [sashe na 13(2)]don a janye sokewar ba tare da ya fara neman 'yan sanda da su janye dokar toshe hanyoyin sadarwar ba.
The implications of this are obvious — no one can resort to the courts for redress in the face of this violation while the blocking order persists.	Abin da zai faru sakamakon haka a bayyane yake - babu wanda zai iya tafiya kotu don neman haƙƙi sakamakon wannan karya doka ta ɗan adam a lokacin da aka toshe hanyoyin sadarwar.
The lawmakers behind the social media bill	Yan majalisa da ke goyon bayan dokar kafafen sada zumunta
Three lawmakers seem to be the arrowhead of the bill in the Senate, the upper house of Nigeria’s parliament: Mohammed Sani Musa (the sponsor of the bill), Abba Moro and Elisha Abbo.	"Yan majalisa guda uku waɗanda su ne ƙashin bayan ƙudurin dokar a babbar majalisar tarayya ta ƙasa sun haɗa da: Mohammed Sani Musa (wanda ya ƙirƙiri ƙudurin) da Abba Moro da Elisha Abbo
Mohammed Sani Musa’s company, Activate Technologies Limited, supplied the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) machine used for the 2019 general elections, while he was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for Niger East Senatorial district, according to the investigate outlet, Premium Times.

Ishaku Elisha Abbo of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is a senator representing the Adamawa North Senatorial District in Adamawa State, in northeast Nigerian.

In July 2019, in the presence of a police officer, Abbo assaulted a female staff member in an adult sex toy store in Abuja.	A watan Yuli na shekarar 2019 a gaban wani jami'in hukumar 'yan sanda, Abbo ya ci zarafin wata ma'aikaciya da ke aiki a shagon sayar da abubuwan bunƙasa saduwa a garin Abuja.
After a video of the assault went viral on social media, Abbo offered a public apology.	Bayan da bidiyon cin zarafin ya karaɗe kafafen sada zumunta ne, Abbo ya ba da haƙuri.

On March 15, 2014, Moro, as minister of interior, was responsible for the Nigerian Immigration Recruitment tragedy in which about 6 million Nigerian youths who applied for 4,000 vacant positions in Nigerian Immigration Service were forced to assemble in various recruitment locations in the country.

Using the hashtag #SayNoToSocialMediaBill, Nigerian netizens took to Twitter to express their collective indignation:	Ta hanyar amfani da hashtag #Cene ban yarda da ƙudurin dokar taƙaita amfani da kafafen sada zumunta ba!, 'yan Nijeriya masu bibiyar yanar gizo sun bayyana jin haushinsu a kafar sada zumunta ta tuwita.

The Tanzanian government attempted to repeal this decision, claiming that girls mature earlier and marriage is a form of protection for pregnant young women, and should, therefore, be allowed to marry earlier than 18.

But on October 23, 2019, the Tanzanian government lost its appeal and the high court ruling remains: The marriage age for both males and females is 18, reinforcing the ban on child marriage in Tanzania.

The fight to end child marriage in Tanzania	Yunƙurin kawo ƙarshen auren wuri a Tanzaniya.
In 2016, Gyumi challenged the constitutionality of the Law of Marriage Act, 2002 (LMA) that allowed females under the age of 18 to get married.	A shekarar 2016, Gyumi ta ƙalubalanci dokar kundin tsarin mulki ta Law of Marriage Act. 2002 (LMA) wacce ta ba da damar yin aure ga mata 'yan ƙasa da shekaru 18.
According to Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS), 36 percent of women aged 25-49 get married before their 18th birthday compared to only 5 percent for men the same age.	Wani bayani da Hukumar da ke Binciken Alƙaluman Kiwon Lafiya ta ƙasar Tanzaniya ta fitar ya bayyana cewa kaso 36 cikin ɗari na mata 'yan shekara 25 zuwa 29 an yi musu aure ne kafin su cika shekaru 18, amma in an kwatanta da maza to kaso 5 cikin ɗari ne kawai masu irn wannan shekarun suke aure kafin su cika shekaru sha 18.
The LMA allowed girls as young as 14 to get married with consent from a court and age 15 with the consent of the parents whereas 18 years was the minimum age for a male.	LMA ta bar yara mata 'yan shekara 14 su yi aure bisa ga amincewar kotu, ko a shekara 15 bia ga amincewar iyaye, amma maza kuwa shekara 18 ce mafi ƙaranci da za su iya yin aure.
Through her attorneys, Gyumi argued that the LMA provisions were discriminatory for giving preferential treatment to males in the matter of eligible marriage age.	Ta hanyar lauyoyinta, Gyumi ta yi iƙirararin cewa akwai nuna wariya a cikin dokokin LMA waɗanda suka fifita maza a kan mata a ɓangaren shekarun da kowanne zai iya yin aure.
They further argued that the provisions infringed the right to equality and they were too vague and too susceptible to arbitrary interpretation to deny female children their right to education.	Sun kuma yi iƙirarin cewa dokokin sun danne haƙƙin daidaito ga mata, sannan kuma dokokin ba a fayyace su sosai ba ta yadda akwai yiwuwar a yi musu mummunar fassara kawai don a hana yara mata haƙƙinsu na neman ilimi.
Gyumi petitioned the High Court to find the provisions of LMA null and void.	Gyumi ta ɗaukaka ƙara inda ta nemi Babbar Kotu da ta yi watsi da dokokin LMA.
The High Court never declared the provisions in the LMA null and void.	Babbar Kotun ba ta yi watsi da dokokin na LMA ba.
But they found the provisions unconstitutional and gave the government one year to correct the anomalies in the LMA provisions.	Amma sun yarda cewa dokokin sun saɓawa kundin tsarin mulki, sannan suka ba wa gwamnatin tsawon shekara guda don ta gyara kure-kuran da saɓani da ke cikin dokokin na LMA.

Grounds for appeal	Dalilan ɗaukaka ƙara
In four months of court proceedings, the government sought to appeal the 2016 ruling that required the revision of the provisions LMA that allowed girls to be married at the age of 15.	A tsawon watanni da aka shafe ana sauraron ƙarar, gwamnati ta roƙi kotu da yi watsi da dokar shekarar 2016 da ta buƙaci a yi bitar dokokin na LMA da suka ba da damar aurar da yara mata a shekara 15.
The appellant, represented by principal state attorneys, Mark Mulwambo and Alesia Mbuya, provided biological differences and customary and Islamic laws as grounds for the appeal.

Ms. Mbuya argued that biological differences put boys and girls in "different categories" and that therefore, the law treats them differently.	Ms Mbuya ta bayyana cewa bambamce-bambamce na halitta ya sanya yara maza da mata a "mabambamtan ajujuwa" don haka ya kamata doka ta kallesu da bambamci.
She argued that because girls matured earlier, the law took that into consideration. She argued that marriage could protect unmarried girls who get pregnant at an early age.	Ta yi bayanin cewa kasancewar yara mata suna riga maza balaga shi ya sa doka ta yi la'akari da hakan. Ta kuma ce aure ne zai iya ba da kariya ga yaran da suke samun juna biyu da wuri.
Further, she argued the court erred by “equating the age of the child and the age of marriage,” meaning that the court should consider male and female children differently when it comes to marriageable age.

The court’s ruling is a step toward eliminating harmful practices and ending all forms of discrimination against girls in Tanzania.	Wannan hukunci na kotu wani mataki ne na kawo ƙarshen aiyuka da suke cutarwa da kuma nuna wariya ga yara mata a Tanzaniya.
According to the United Nations, in order to achieve gender equality by 2030, governments need to change discriminatory laws and adopt legislation that proactively advances equality.

American rapper Kanye West brought his "Sunday Service" pop-up concert to Kingston, Jamaica, at the start of its National Heroes Day holiday weekend (October 19-21, 2019).	Mawaƙi ɗan ƙasar Amurka Kanye West ya kai "Wasansa na Lahadi" garin Kingston da ke Jamaika a lokacin da aka fara bikin ƙarshen sati na Ranar Jarumai ta ƙasa. (Oktoba 19-21, 2019).
This was the first time the rapper had taken his huge gospel choir outside the United States, reportedly at the request of a Jamaican member of his staff.	Wannan ne karo na farko da mawaƙin ya tafi tare da rukunin 'yan amshinsa masu waƙar addini zuwa wajen ƙasar Amurka, wai a bisa buƙatar wani daga cikin ma'aikatansa ɗan ƙasar ta Jamaika.
However, the event was besieged with criticism from the outset, culminating with West's unapproved use of Jamaican emblems on merchandise being sold on his website.	Duk da haka, mutane sun yi ta kushe taron tun daga farko, wanda hakan ya sa West ya yi amfani da kayayyaki masu alamar ƙasar Jamaikan ba bisa ƙa'ida ba waɗanda aka sayar da su a shafinsa na yanar gizo.
With just two days’ notice, the free concert took place at Emancipation Park in Kingston, the capital city — a location that jarred some commentators because of controversial comments West had made about slavery during a media interview in May 2018.	A cikin kwanaki biyu da sanarwa, mawaƙin ya yi wasan a Emancipation Park da ke babban birnin Kingston - zaɓin wannan waje ya fusata masu sharhi.
The park was opened in 2002 in honour of the "full freedom" of 300,000 slaves in Jamaica on August 1, 1838.	Wannan waje an buɗe shi ne a shekarar 2002 don girmama samun "cikakken 'yanci" ga bayi guda 300,000 a ƙasar Jamaika a ranar I ga watan Agusta, 1838.
That may have been the first bone of contention around the concert, but it was not the last.	Wataƙila wannan ce taƙaddama ta farko game da wasan, amma ba ita ce ta ƙarshe ba.
Even as Culture Minister Olivia "Babsy" Grange responded to early criticism by saying the country was benefitting from the concert, one music promoter felt the show, which was livestreamed on the Sunday Service website, "upstaged" other cultural activities over Heroes Day weekend.	Duk da cewa Ministan Al'adu Oliɓia "Babsy" Grange ta ba da amsa ga masu kushen da cewa ƙasar ta amfanu da wasan, amma wani mai ra'ayin waƙe-waƙe ya bayyana cewa, wasan wanda aka haska kai tsaye a shafin yanar gizo na aiyukan ranar Lahadi, ya "shafe" sauran abubuwan al'adu da aka gabatar a bikin ƙarshen satin na Ranar Jarumai.
In addition, Kingston residents, who suffered unusually heavy traffic flows throughout the week, predicted chaos and confusion during the evening rush hour.	Bugu da ƙari, mazauna garin Kingston, waɗanda suka sha wahalar jerin gwanon motoci a cikin satin, sun yi hasashen cewa za a sami hargitsi da ruɗani a yammacin ranar wasan.
Nevertheless, the concert went smoothly, several thousand Jamaicans enjoyed the show and Jamaican media companies earned online kudos for their flawless production:	Duk da haka, an gabatar da wasan ba tare da wata matsala ba, kuma dubunnan mutanen ƙasar Jamaika sun ji daɗin wasan, sannan kuma gidajen jaridun Jamaika sun samu yabo a kafafen yanar gizo sakamakon yadda suka haska wasan ba tare da wata tangarɗa ba.
I have done a fair amount of online searches for information to corroborate the claim without luck but have come across their online release of merchandise bearing these landmark symbols, which coincided with the concert...	Na yi bincike sosai a yanar gizo don neman bayanai da suka dace da wannan iƙirarin amma ban yi nasara ba, amma na ci karo da kayayyaki masu zauke da alamun waɗanda aka tallata a shafukan yanar gizo, kuma hakan ya yi daidai da gabatar da wasan...
Jamaica’s reality is that successive political administrations have never fully appreciated the economic value of the brand "Jamaica" nor the symbols that [represent] that brand including its flag and its coat of arms.	Zancen gaskiya shi ne shugabannin siyasa a Jamaika ba su gano muhimmancin ƙimar haɓaka tattalin arziƙi ta hanyar tallata "Jamaika" ko kuma tallata wasu alamu da ke "wakiltar" ƙasar kamar tuta da tambarin ƙasar.

That Jamaica was blindsided by the release of clothing bearing the island’s important symbols is a classic case of guerilla marketing.	Kasancewar jama'ar Jamaika sun gigita da yadda aka saki kayyakin sawan masu ɗauke da alamun ƙasar shi yake tabbatar da irin salon kasuwancin mamaki.
Having a concert to promote the line at the historic Emancipation Park provides tacit assent of not only the line of garments by the government and people of Jamaica, but also of the use of the country’s national symbols in their creation.	Gabatar da wasan don inganta shi a Emancipation Park mai ɗumbin tarihi shi yake nuna amincewar gwamnati da mutanen Jamaika na yin amfani da alamomin ƙasar a kan tufafin da kayayyakin.
I have noticed that there is now hurried pushback by the Ministry of Culture as well as from the Mayor of Kingston. Both should realize that this isn’t a bottle that will be easy to re-cork.	Na gano cewa akwai tirjiya daga ɓangaren Hukumar Al'adu da kuma Magajin Garin Kingston. Dukkansu ya kamata su fahimci cewa wannan wani abu ne da ba zai canju ba.
I hope that the government has good lawyers.	Ina fatan gwamnati tana da lauyoyi ƙwararru.
Indeed, lawyers may still have quite a bit of work to do to untangle the confusion surrounding the use of Jamaica's national symbols.	Tabbas akwai aiki a gaban lauyoyi wajen kau da ruɗani game da amfani da alamomin ƙasar ta Jamaika.

Thousands of visitors to the historic city of Stone Town, Zanzibar, have followed the sound of music to the Dhow Countries Music Academy (DCMA), a music school that promotes and preserves the islands’ musical traditions of the Swahili Coast along the Indian Ocean.

"Witch-hunting is not new in Jharkhand", says Prem Chand, the Founding Chairman of the Free Legal Aid Committee (FLAC) in Jharkhand, in a telephonic interview.	"Farautar mayu ba sabon abu bane a Jharkhand" a cewar Prem Chand, shugaban da ya kafa Free Legal Aid Committee (FLAC) a Jharkhand, a wata ganawa ta wayar tarho.
FLAC has been instrumental in bringing about legislation against witch-hunting in Jharkhand.	FLAC ta taka rawar gani wajen tabbatar da hukunci ga masu farautar mayu a Jharkhand.
The organisation first began working in this area in 1991 when a woman was accused by her neighbour of causing a boy’s death.	ƙungiyar ta fara aiki a wannan waje a shekarar 1991 lokacin da wata mata maƙocinta ya zarge ta da kisan wani yaro.
An irate mob attacked her and killed her husband and son.	Fusatattun cincirindon mutane sun kai mata hari suka kashe maigidanta da ɗanta.
She sustained injuries.	Ta samu raunuka.
When Prem Chand and his colleagues visited the offenders in the prison, they were met with defiance:	Lokacin da Prem Chand da abokan aikinsa suka ziyarci masu laifin a gidan yari sun gamu da tirjiya:
They told us that they stood by their accusation.	Sun gaya mana sun amince da zargin da ake musu.
They also shared a belief that when the blood of a woman branded as a witch falls on the ground, she loses her so-called powers of sorcery.	Sun kuma yarda cewa yayin da jinin matar da ake zargi da tsafi ya zuba a ƙasa, to ta rasa ikin tsafinta.
Prem Chand says that it affects specific sectors of the population:	Prem Chand ya ce abin ya shafi wani sashe ne na al'umma.
Usually, it is the women from the weaker sections of the society and economically backward regions that are targeted.	Yawanci mata marasa gata a cikin al'umma a wurare marasa ƙarfin tattalin arziƙi abin ya fi shafa.
The victims are mostly Adivasis, Harijans and Dalits.	Yawanci abin ya fi shafar 'yan ƙabilar Adiɓasi da Harijan da Dalit.
It is an assault on the dignity of women and a violation of constitutional rights for a dignified life for every human being.	Wannan keta haddin mata ne da kuma saɓawa dokar kundin tsarin mulki da ta ba wa ɗan adam damar rayuwa a mutunce.
The Social and Political Realities	Haƙiƙanin zamantakewa da siyasa
Activists say that deeply rooted superstitions prevalent in the hinterlands are a major cause behind the practice.	Masu kare hƙƙin ɗan adam sun ce yarda da camfie-camfe da ya yi tsamari a cikin ƙasa shi ne dalilin maita.
A lack of education, poor health facilities and economic backwardness mark the regions where these practices are prevalent.	Rashin ilimi da rashin kayayyakin kula da kiwon lafiya da koma bayan tattalin arziƙi su ne alamun yankunan da ke fama da matsalar.
The cases so far show that often a rumor started by someone is enough to get the ball rolling.	Matsalolin sun nuna cewa yawanci abin ya kan fara ne daga jita-jita.
Despite the laws enacted by various Indian states which declare witch-hunting to be illegal, participants in these cases see it as a form of self-defense.	Duk da kasancewar jihohi da dama a Indiya sun kafa dokar da ta haramta farautar mayu, masu farautar su na ganin yin haka kariyar kai da kai ce.
It is also used as an excuse for grabbing resources owned by women, exacting revenge or even exploiting women for sex.	Kuma ana amfani da ita a kwashe kayayyakin matan ko a yi ramuwa ko kuma ma a haike musu da jima'i.
According to Prem Chand:	A cewar prem Chand:
The premise is that once you brand a woman as a witch, you can subject her to any treatment.	Wato dai da zarar ka zargi mace da laifin maita, to za ka iya yanke mata duk hukuncin da ka ga dama.
However, it is important to note that the practice is used as a justification for exploitation and is not a cause behind it per se.	Duk da haka, yana da muhimmanci a gane cewa ana amfani da wannan abu a matsayin hujjar tatse matan, ba wai shi ne dalili kaɗai ba.
Ironically, the panchayat often provides tacit approval for branding a person a witch even if does not pass ruling on the punishment to be meted out.	Abin ban haushi, Panchayat ta kan amince mutum maye ne ko da kuwa ba ta yanke hukunci a kan sa ba.
In addition to the elected panchayat, there are self-styled caste panchayats with no legal mandate whatsoever that operate in certain parts of the country.	Baya ga zaɓaɓɓun Panchayat, akwai Panchayats da suke naɗa kansu da kansu su yi aiki a wasu ɓangarori na ƙasar ba tare da amincewar doka ba ko kaɗan.
These bodies pass verdicts and mete out punishments and remain largely unchallenged.	Waɗannan hukumomi su kan yanke kuma su zartar da hukunci kuma yawanci ba mai tanka musu.
An incident in Ajmer district of Rajasthan in 2017 reported involvement of caste panchayat leading to the death of a 40-year-old woman.	Wani abu da ya faru a unguwar Ajmer a Rajasthan a shekarar 2017 ya bayyana sa hannun caste panchayats a wajen mutuwar wata mata mai shekaru 40.
Legally, the courts can take action against such verdicts in case of both elected panchayats and caste panchayats.	A dokance, kotuna na iya ɗaukar mataki a game da hukunce-hukuncen da zaɓaɓɓun panchayats da caste panchayats suka yanke.
However, the victims seldom get the opportunity to reach a court of law before they become targets of mobs.	Duk da haka, mutanen ba sa samun damar zuwa kotu kafin cincirindon jama'a ya far musu.

According to Debjani’s statements, she was accused of being the cause of several deaths in Cherekali village located 180 km from Guwahati, the capital of the eastern state in India.

She was accused of practicing witchcraft in 1995.	An zarge ta da maita a shekarar 1995.
Since then, she has transformed into an activist crusading against the victimization of women in the name of witch-hunting with the help of NGOs working to end the practice.

Chutni expresses how the lack of resources often makes it a struggle to fight against the practice.	Chutni ta bayyana yadda rashin kayan aiki ke kawo cikas wajen yaƙi da wannan al'ada.

The activists who were interviewed for this story expressed a paucity of political will and intellectual engagement to provide the momentum required for the campaign against the heinous practice to succeed.

According to Prem Chand:	A cewar prem Chand:

Tobago's coral reefs are an integral part of both the island's marine ecosystem and its economy.	Shimfiɗaɗɗun murjanin da ke ƙarƙashin ruwa a Tobago wani ɓangare ne mai muhimmanci ga tsarin rayuwar dabbobin ruwa da kuma tattalin arziƙin ƙasar.
Home to numerous species of marine life (and a main source of fish for local fishermen), they also protect the coastline from wave erosion and the effects of tropical storms.	Gida ga mafi yawan dabbobin da ke rayuwa a cikin ruwa (kuma hanyar samun kifi ga masunta na gida), suna ba da kariya ga gaɓar teku daga zaizayewa da kuma kariya ga tasirin guguwar kurmi.
Popular spots like Buccoo Reef are also popular tourist attractions.	Sanannun waurare kamar Buccoo Reef su na jan hankalin baƙi 'yan yawon shaƙatawa.
But after a press release issued by the country's Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) on August 22, 2019, in which it warned that — based on findings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch — Tobago's coral reefs have been placed on a watch for "Bleaching Alert Level One", all eyes are on the island.	Amma bayan fda Hukumar Kula da Koguna ta fitar da bayani ga manema labarai ranar 22 ga Agusta, 2019 a inda ta yi gargaɗi cewa - sakamakon bincike da Hukumar Gudanar da Sararin Samaniya da Teku da ke Kula da Shimfiɗar Murjani - shimfiɗar murjabin ta tsibirin Tobago ya shiga "Matakin Farko na Koɗewa", hankali ya karkata a kan tsibirin.
There is a distinct possibility that the bleaching could advance to Level Two within a matter of weeks, which would threatens not only the existence of the reefs themselves, but also the island's marine life and people.	Akwai matuƙar yiwuwar cewa koɗewar za ta tsallaka mataki na biyu a cikin 'yan makonni, hakan zai zama barazana ba wai kawai ga cigaba da zaman shimfiɗar ba har ga dabbobin cikin ruwa da kuma al'ummar ƙasar.
What exactly is bleaching?	Wai menene koɗewa?
Corals coexist with and become home to symbiotic algae, helping it store nutrients and remove waste.	Murjani na rayuwa ne tare da gansakuka da suke taimakon juna wajen ajiye abinci da kuma fitar da shara.
In return, the algae gives the coral the energy it needs to grow, but drastic changes in water temperature can threaten this cooperative relationship.	hi kuma gansakuka yana ba wa murjani ƙarfin da ya ke buƙata ya girma, amma sauyin yanayi kan iya barazana ga wannan dangartakar haɗin kai.
When water becomes too hot (or too cold) the corals expel the algae — and with it, its main source of food.	Yayin da ruwa ya yi zafi sosai (ko sanyi sosai), murjani zai zubar da gansakuka - wanda hakan na nufin ya zubar da hanyar samun abincinsa.
Eventually, the coral starves to death; the most noticeable outward sign of this phenomenon is that the coral loses its colour, going from shades of brown and green to a crisp, brittle, bone white.	A ƙarshe gansakuka zai mutu da yunwa; babbar alamar wannan shi ne gansakuka ya rasa launinsa, ya canja daga ruwan ƙasa-ƙasa da kore zuwa farin ƙashi mai gautsi.
Bleaching Level Alert One means that the corals are extremely likely to start the bleaching process.	Matakin Farko na Koɗewa na nufin akwai matuƙar yiwuwar miurjani ya fara koɗewa.
The IMA therefore suggests that both biologists and citizens should keep an eye out for signs of bleaching over the next 9-12 weeks.	Saboda haka ukumar IMA ta shawarci masana halittu da sauran 'ayn ƙasar su zuba ido don ganin wasu alamun koɗau a cikin makonni 9-12.
Level Two bleaching would be an indication of widespread coral bleaching and coral mortality.	Alamar mataki na biyu na koɗewa ita ce gaggawar koɗewar murjanin da kuma mutuwarsa.
What causes it?	Me ke janyo hakan?
According to local coral reef ecologist Anjani Ganase, the main contributors to coral bleaching in Tobago are the warmer water temperatures — a result of climate change.	A cewar wani masanin halittar murjani Anjani Ganase, babban abinda ke kawo koɗewar murjani a tsibirin Tobago shi ne ɗumamaar yanayin cikin ruwa - a sakamakon sauyin yanayi.
Via email, Ganase explained that the ocean absorbs much of the heat in the atmosphere, which in turn causes the water — especially shallower bodies of water, like the Caribbean Sea — to heat up.	T cikin saƙon email, Ganase ya yi bayani cewa teku tana zuƙar yawancin zafin da yake a sararin sama, wanda hakan ke sa ruwa - musamman ma ruwa maras zurfi kamar na Tekun Yankin Karibiya - ya yi zafi.
In fact, NOAA's 12-week outlook extends well past Tobago to the reefs of the Lesser Antilles.	A gaskiya, makonni 12 da NOAA ta bayar a duba har ya zarce Tobago zuwa shimfiɗar da ke Lesser Antilles.
Other reefs around the region, most notably in parts of the Greater Antilles and Cuba, have already been placed on a Level Two Bleaching Alert:	Ragowar shimfiɗar murjanin da ke yankin, musamman ma na Greater Antilles da na cuba, har sun shiga matakin koɗewa na biyu.
What are its effects?	Menene sakamakon abin?
Coral bleaching is a huge threat.	Koɗewar murjani babban abin tsoro ne.
Because reefs provide fishes with a habitat that allows them to have access to shelter, food and most importantly, shelter for their young until they are ready to survive in the wider ocean, the proposition of losing them will impact the ability of fish species to survive.	Saboda shimfiɗar murjanin na samarwa kifaye gida da za su zauna su rayu su samu abinci su kuma raini 'ya'yansu har zuwa lokacin da za su iya rayuwa a ko'ina a cikin teku, don haka yin asarar murjanin zai shafi rayuwar kifaye.
It will also negatively affect the livelihoods of local fishermen.	Hakan kuma zai shafi rayuwar masunta na cikin gida.
Tobago relies very heavily on its local tourism industry; its reefs reportedly attract around 40 per cent of the island's tourists.	Tobago ta dogara sosai ga sashen yawan shaƙatawa, kallon shimfiɗar murjaninta shi ke jan hankalin ksao 40 cikin ɗari na 'yan yawon shaƙatawa da ke zuwa tsibirin.
Should coral bleaching continue, there will be fewer thriving reefs for people to explore and quite likely, a reduction in tourism dollars, which affects a range of hospitality-related industries: hotels, restaurants, transport services and tour companies.	Idan koɗewar murjanin ta cigaba, to za a samu ƙarancin murjanin da mutane za su kalla kuma hakan zai iya jawo raguwar adadin kuɗaɗen da ake samu daga 'yan yawon shaƙatawa, kuma hakan zai shafi kamfanoni kamar otel-otel da gidajen cin abinci da harkokin sufuri da na yawon buɗe ido.
The great irony is that, as tropical storms intensify as a result of the climate crisis, reefs are needed more than ever to absorb the force of waves and create a buffer between the ocean and the shore — but the reefs are compromised by global heating.	Babban abin haushin ma shi ne, a yayin da guguwar kurmi ta tsananta sakamakon sauyin yanayi, yanzu ne lokacin da aka fi buƙatar shimfiɗar murjanin don su zuƙe ƙarfin igiyar ruwa kuma su shiga tsakanin teku da bakin gaɓa - amma ga shi nan shimfiɗar murjanin na lalacewa sakamakon ɗumamar yanayi.
Studies show that coral reefs protect around 90 per cent of Tobago's shoreline from wave-induced erosion.	Bincike ya nuna cewa shimfiɗar murjani na ba da kariya daga zaizayar ƙasa sakamakon guguwa ga kaso 90 cikin ɗari na gaɓar tekun Tobago.
In a feature address at the International Year of the Reef at the University of the West Indies in 2018, Professor John Agard said that this function will only become more important as storm intensities increase and sea levels rise.	A wani bayani da ya gabatar a taron shimfiɗar murjani na ƙasa da ƙasa a Jami'ar West Indies a shekarar 2018, Farfesa John Agard ta ce za a fahimci muhimmanci wannan aiki na murjani ne yayin da guguwa ta cigaba da tsananta sannan kuma matakin ruwan teku ya ƙaru.
What can we do to stop it?	Me za mu iya yi don mu dakatar da hakan?
Ganase says the lack of proper management that has allowed overfishing and pollution to go unchecked has made Tobago's coral bleaching worse.	Ganase ya ce rashin cikakkiyar kulawa da kuma ƙyale kamun kifi da gurɓatar yanayi ba tare da bincikensu ba shi ya janyo taɓarɓarewar koɗewar murjanin a Tobago.
If this continues, she explains, active management and protection will be critical for full recovery and growth:	Ta yi bayanin cewa idan aka cigaba da hakan, bayar da kulawa da kariya za su zama abubuwa masu muhimmanci wajen farfaɗowa da cigaba.
Ideally, coral reefs should be closed to the public and placed into an intensive recovery programme to ensure healthy fish communities and water quality that will support coral growth and recruitment.	Kamata yayi a rufe shimfiɗar murjanin daga jama'a sannan a saka su a wani shirin farfaɗo da su don tabbatar da lafiyar kifaye da amincin ruwa da zai taimaka wajen bunƙasar murjani.
She added:	Ta ƙara da cewa:
Individual actions to reduce our carbon footprintare are always warranted but we also need citizens to demand more action from our governments to provide the infrastructure, resources and education for climate conservation and adaptation.	Ana buƙatar aiyukan mutane don rage gawayi amma muna buƙatar 'yan ƙasa su nemi gwamnati ta ɗauki matakin samar da kayan more rayuwa, kayan aiki da kuma ilimin kiyaye albarkar yanayi da daidaita shi.

There is a pressing need for regional island governments to demand an international effort in tackling the climate crisis.	Akwai matuƙar buƙatar gwamnatin yankin tsibirin ta nemi taimakon ƙasa da ƙasa don magance matsalolin yanayi.
On September 11, 2019, Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley addressed this issue at the United Nations’ Geneva headquarters, urging larger nations to do better in fighting climate change.	A ranar 11 ga Satumba na shekarar 2019 ne Firaministan ƙasar Barbados Mia Mottley ta yi wannan maganar a hedkwatar Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya da ke Geneɓa, yana mai zaburar da manyan ƙasashe da su ƙara himma wajen yaƙi da sauyin yanayi.

Ganase agrees about the urgency of the matter.	Ganese ta yarda da gaggawar da ake da ita a kan haka.
Any and all forms of aid in tackling climate change and coral bleaching, she said, especially on political levels, "requires effort":	Ta ce duk wani irin tallafi don yaƙi da sauyin yanayi da koɗewar murjani musamman a mataki na siyasa yana "buƙatar yunƙuri".
It's not going to be easy as seen internationally, but there is really no alternative.	Ba abu ne mai sauƙi be kamar yadda ƙasashen duniya suke zato, amma fa babu wani zaɓi.

At the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regional aviation forum in Accra in June, Ghana's Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia lamented the fact that “a business person from Freetown [Sierra Leone], for example, should travel for nearly two days to go to Banjul (often through a third country) for a journey which a straight-line flight would have taken only one hour.”	A taron ƙungiyar Sufurin Jirgin Sama ta ƙasa da ƙasa a watan Yuni a garin Accra, Mataimakin Shugaban ƙasar Gana, Dr, Mahamudu Bawumia, ya nuna baƙin cikin yadda "ɗan kasuwa daga garin Free Town [Saliyo] sai ya yi tafiyar kwana biyu zuwa garin Banjul (wani sa'in ma sai ya biya ta wata ƙasar) duk saboda ya isa gurin da jirgi duda ɗaya zai iya kai shi a awa guda".

While dominant narratives in the media perpetuate Africa as a continent of mass migration driven by poverty or violent conflict, however, Marie-Laurence Flahaux and Hein De Haas, scholars from University of Oxford and University of Amsterdam, respectively, take issue with this stereotype.

Their research shows that migration from the continent is multi-layered and driven by global "processes of development and social transformation" that have increased the "capabilities and aspirations" of Africans’ to migrate — similar to migrants from other parts of the world.

These stereotypical narratives, however, often inform visa policy:	Waɗannan ra'ayoyi da ake da su game da 'yan Afirka, duk da haka, su na taka rawa a tsarin ba da biza:
Most countries’ authorities assume that all Africans who travel will not return to their home countries, leaving African visa applicants to bear the burden of proof.

Meanwhile, African nations can take action to improve mobility across the continent.	A hakan dai, ƙasashen Afirka kan iya ɗaukar matakin inganta harkar zirga-zirga a cikin nahiyar.
A common African passport is one step — but it's not enough. The Single African Air Transport market (SAATM), and the Continental Free Trade Agreement, both launched last year, have laid the foundation for some of these shifts, but widespread implementation is still a long way off.

During the 2015 elections, for instance, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim).

False and misleading information, promoted as gospel truth, was amplified by supporters of the two major parties in Nigeria: the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the People's Democratic Party (PDP).

Based on ethnographic participant observation conducted between October 28, 2018, and May 29, 2019, ethnic hate was employed as a tool for disinformation and propaganda by both sides of the political divide on Twitter Nigeria during the 2019 presidential elections.	Wani shiri mai taken 'kula daga mai halarta na ƙabilu' da aka gabatar tsakanin 28 ga watan Oktoba na shekarar 2018 da 29 ga watan Mayu na shekarar 2019 ya nuna cewa jam'iyyun biyu sun yi amfani da shafukan tuwita na Nijeriya wajen amfani da tsanar ƙabilanci don yaɗa labaran ƙarya da farfaganda a lokacin zaɓukan shugaban ƙasa na shekarar 2019.

In terms of ethnically-charged disinformation, some APC supporters accused Obi of being a bigot for purportedly deporting northerners while he was governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria.

Tweets went viral that claimed that Yoruba people were burning shops of Igbo traders in Lagos. Both stories were false and will be explored further in Part II of this essay.

Figure 1: Misinformed propaganda tweet by Festus Keyamo	Zane na 1: Saƙon tuwita mai ɗauke da farfaganda ta ƙarya daga shafin Festus Keyamo
Figure 2: The true location of the image that Keyamo shared.	Zane na 2: Ainihin gaskiyar hoton wajen da Keyamo ya yaɗa.
In another example, a photograph was used to misconstrue facts. On October 28, 2018, Festus Keyamo, then-media director of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, tweeted an image (Figure 1) of a tree growing between an apparently abandoned Nigerian rail track:	A wani misalin dabam, an yi amfani da wani hoto don jirkita gaskiya. A ranar 28 ga watan Oktoba na shekarar 2018, Festus Keyamo, wanda a lokacin shi ne daraktan kafofin yaɗa labarai na ƙungiyar Yaƙin Neman Zaɓen Buhari, ya yi amfani da shafin tuwita ya wallafa hoton (Zane na 1) wata bishiya da ta fito a tsakaninlayin dogo da aka daina amfani da shi a Nijeriya.
This is how trees grew in-between rail tracks between 1999 and 2015...	Wannan shi ne yadda bishiyoyi ke fitowa su girma a tsakanin layin dogo a shekarun 1999 zuwa 2015…
Now, this is the 'Completion Era' as the tracks are beginning to roar back to life.” The PDP government was in power between 1999 and 2015.	Wannan 'Lokacin Kammalawa ne' saboda yanzu layin dogo ya farfaɗo". Jam'iyyar PDP ta riƙe madafun iko tsakanin shekarun 1999 da 2015.
However, a Nigerian Twitter user later traced back the image to an original Arabic-language tweet (Figure 2) posted earlier that same month.	Duk da haka, wani ɗan Nijeriya mai amfani da shafin tuwita ya gano cewa asalin hoton an wallafa shi ne a wani saƙon tuwita na harshen Larabci (Zane na 2) a farkon wannan watan dai.
According to the tweet, the photo is from Lebanon.	Saƙon tuwitan ya nuna cewa an ɗauki hoton ne a ƙasar Lebanon.
Keyamo's intention may have been to show that the Buhari government had surpassed previous administrations on the revamping of the morbid rail lines in the country.	Wataƙila niyyar Keyamo ya nuan cewa gwamnatin Buhari ta zarce wacce ta gabata wajen farfaɗo da layin dogo a ƙasar.
However, the use of an image from a different country made the so-called "gains" questionable.	Duk da haka, yin amfani da hoton da aka ɗauka a wata ƙasar dabam ya sanya ayar tambaya a kan wannan "riba".
Figure 3: Ethnic hate speech	Zane na 3: Kalaman tsana da ƙabilanci
Figure 4: El-Rufai later apologized for the “insensitive” tweet shown in Figure 3.	Zane na 4: Daga baya El-Rufai ya ba da haƙuri sakamakon saƙon tuwita 'na rashin hankali" da aka nuna a Zane na 3.
Online ethnic hate speech was also pronounced before, during and after the elections.	An furta kalaman tsana da ƙabilanci kafin zaɓen da lokacin zaɓen da kuma bayan zaɓen.
In an ethnic slurred tweet (Figure 3) Bashir El-Rufai, son of the Kaduna State Governor, inferred that the Nigerian Civil War was ignited by the Igbo vengeance.	A wani saƙon tuwita mai ƙunshe da zagin ƙabilanci (Zane na 3), Bashir El-Rufai, ɗa ga gwamnan jihar Kaduna ya ɗauka cewa Inyamirai ne su ka kunna wutar yaƙin basasar Nijeriya don su yi ramuwa.
Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a bitter civil war with the secessionist state of Biafra inhabited mostly by the Igbo in the southeastern part of the country.	Tsakanin shekarun 1967 da 1970, Nijeriya ta yi yaƙin basasa da masu ƙoƙarin ɓallewa daga ƙasar wato jam'ar ƙabilar Inyamirai 'yan yankin Biafra da ke kudu maso gabas na ƙasar.
Hence, according to Bashir El-Rufai, the result of the 2019 elections which was won by his party, the APC, should also be taken as a sweet "revenge" from the Hausa, Fulani.	Saboda haka, Bashir El-Rufai sai ya ce sakamakon zaɓen shekarar 2019 wanda jam'iyyarsa ta APC ta samu nasara tamkar daddaɗar "ramuwa" daga ƙabilar Hausawa da Fulani.
He later apologized, after a backlash, for his previous "insensitive" tweet as shown in Figure 4.	Daga baya ya ba da haƙuri, bayan da aka yi masa ca, a dangane saƙonsa na "rashin tunani" na baya kamar yadda Zane na 4 ya nuna.
He also deleted the earlier tweet (Figure 3).	Kuma ya goge saƙon tuwita na farko (Zane na 3).
Ethnic-motivated false information on social media during the elections falls into two categories: disinformation and propaganda.	Bayanan ƙarya da ake wallafawa a shafukan sada zumunta waɗanda ƙabilanci ke jawowa a lokutan zaɓe sun kasu gida biyu: labaran ƙarya da farfaganda.
Miroslav Tudjman and Nives Mikelic, communication scholars at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, define disinformation as "intentionally deputed mistaken information with the purpose to mislead the user".	Miroslaɓ Tudjman da Niɓes Mikelic, malaman ilimin sadarwa a Jami'ar Zagreb da ke ƙasar Kuroshiya, sun bayyana ma'anar labarin ƙarya a matsayin "wani bayani da aka canja da gangan da niyyar a ɓatar da mai amfani da bayanin".
Hence, the intention to pass across inaccurate, distorted and false evidence as true, distinguishes dis-information from misinformation.	Saboda haka, niyyar bayar da shaida ta ƙarya da aka ƙarawa gishiri a matsayin gaskiya shi ya bambamta labarin ƙarya da labarin da ba daidai ba.
Tudjman and Mikelic assert that propaganda is much more than disinformation or misinformation.	Tudjman da Mikelic sun tabbatar da cewa farfaganda ta fi kama da labarin ƙarya fiye da labarin da ba daidai ba.
This is because propaganda "aims to manipulate the attitudes of the user" through an "accidental or intentional handling with information in [the] communication process".	Wannan haka yake saboda a farfaganda akwai "niyyar mallake ɗabi'ar mai amfani da bayani" ta hanyar "juya bayanai da gangan ko ba da gangan ba a cikin hanyar sadarwa".
Thus, propaganda weaponizes biased or inaccurate information for political interests and consequently manipulates perception.	Saboda haka, farfaganda kan yi amfani da bayanin da ba daidai ba na son zuciya a matsayin makamin kare ra'ayin siyasa da mallakar tunani.
Justifiable fears emerged surrounding 2019 elections because online disinformation and propaganda incites electoral violence but also poses "a threat to reconciliation after the elections".	An samu fargaba ta gaske a lokacin zaɓukan 2019 saboda labaran ƙarya da farfaganda a shafukan yanar gizo sun hura hutar rikice-rikicen zaɓe hakan ya sanya "barazanar ga sulhu bayan zaɓe".

On December 26, 2019, BBC Swahili released a video featuring Francisco Ouma, an elder from Busia, western Kenya, who received a message from God to carve a cave.

The message came in the form of a map that he received through his dreams.	Saƙon ya zo ne a taswira da ya karɓa a mafarkinsa.
Since February 1967, Ouma has followed the divine map delivered in his dream.	Tun watan Fabrairun shekarar 1967, Ouma ya bi wannan taswirar ta ubangiji da aka ba shi a mafarki.
Today, his cave has 24 rooms and counting.	A yau, wannan kogon yana da ɗakuna 24 da ƙari.

Throughout history, many have questioned the veracity of divine intervention through dreams, even casting doubt on one's mental health and stability.	A gaba ɗayan tarihi, mutane da yawa sun ƙalubalanci gaskiya magana da ubangiji ta mafarki, har ma da kokwanton lafiyar hankalin mutum.
But prophets from Islam, Judaism and Christianity have all testified to messages from God sent through dreams for millennia.	Amma a tsahon shekaru dubunnai, annabawan addinin Musulunci da addinin Yahudanci da addinin Kiristanci duk sun tabbatar da karɓar saƙinni daga Ubangiji da yake turo usu ta mafarki.
"God brought me something like a map", Ouma told BBC Swahili.	"Ubangiji ya ba ni wani abu mai kama da taswira", Ouma ya faɗawa BBC Swahili.
Then, when I was digging, this map is what I followed.	Sannan na yi amfani da wannan taswira a lokacin da nake haƙa.
It wasn't just that when I was digging, better to keep digging, no.	Ba wai kawai yayin da nake yin haƙar, gara in cigaba da haƙar, a'a.
Using just a plow and his own two hands, Ouma faced trial and error as he hit on stones that prevented him from digging.	Ouma ya gwada dukan duwatsun da suka hana shi yin haƙa ta hanyar amfani da diga da kuma hannayesa guda biyu.
He finally found the right spot to manifest God's cave map in his mind.	Daga ƙarshe ya gano wurin ta hanyar bayyanar tasawirar kogon Ubangiji a zuciyarsa.
In one room, there's a stone with writing on it with the words of Jesus.	A wani ɗakin akwai dutsen da yake da rubutun kalmomin Yesu.
Jesus Christ was the one who brought me this news, Ouma said, and then he explained it to me as it was with Moses.	Ouma ya ce, Yesu ne ya kawo min wannan labarin sannan kuma ya yi min bayani kamar yadda abun yake a wurin Musa.
Ouma believes he is bringing back another covenant with God to the world.	Ouma ya yi imanin cewa, zai sake dawo da yarjejiniya da Ubangiji zuwa duniya.
The second stage is coming.	Mataki na biyu yana zuwa.
This is the first stage of the covenant.	Wannan shi ne matakin farko na yarjejeniyar.
The second is coming.	Na biyu yana zuwa.
I can't say for sure what it is now because if I announce it, I may be cheating humanity.	Ba zan iya faɗar tabbas me ye ba a yanzu domin idan na sanar, zai iya zama zaluntar al'umma.
Therefore, I will wait for the report to be given at last, Ouma told BBC Swahili.	Don haka, zan saurari rahoton da za a bayar a ƙarshe, Ouma ya gaya wa BBC Swahili.
The BBC Swahili video has been viewed nearly 50,000 times with over 100 comments and counting.	Kusan sau 50,000 aka kalli bidiyon BBC na Suwahili, inda fiye da mutane 100 ne suka yi tsokaci, yayin da wasu ma suke ci gaba da yi.
While some have raised questions about the mental stability of those who claim to receive messages from God through dreams, including a professor quoted in the video, many comments supported people of faith who tune into messages shared through dreams.

For me, people like these, usually I believe them a lot, much more than those who fill us [up] from continuous contributions of words of hope from houses of worship, 52 years a person just digs — if he didn't have his mind, wouldn't his community or the government not recognize this?

Ethiopia's underground wedding chapels	Wuraren bikin Misira na ƙarƙashin ƙasa.
In southern Ethiopia, a similar testimony exists from an elder named Mohammed Yiso Banatah, who said back in 2012 that he was visited by Allah 33 years ago in a series of ten dreams.	A kudancin Misira ma an samu makamanciyar wannan maganar daga wurin wani dattijo mai suna Muhammad Yiso Banatah, wanda a shekarar 2012 ya ce ya ga Allah a mafarkai goma mabambanta a shekaru 33 da suka shuɗe.
Through the dreams, he received explicit instructions from Allah to ultimately create underground wedding chapel caves.	A mafarkin Allah Ya ba shi umarnin ya samar da kogunan gudanar da bukukuwa a ƙarƙashin ƙasa
Known as Dunbar Caves, these elaborate chapels exist on Banatah's roadside property halfway between Hawassa and Shashamene.	An fi sanin su da Dunbar Caɓes, waɗanda wurare ne da suke daf da kadarar Bonatan ta gefen titi kusa da tsakanin Hawassa da Shashamene
Banatah said it was in his third dream that the blueprint for these chapel caves was burned into his consciousness.	Bonatah ya ce a mafarki na uku ne ya fahimci taswirar waɗannan wurare.
You can read my full narrative account of Banatah's dream sequence and what prompted him to start digging what would become his life's work here:	Za ka iya karanta cikakken bayanina game da mafarkan Banatah da kuma abin da ya sa shi ya fara haƙa abin da ya zama ayyukansa na rayuwa kamar haka:
In his final dream, the tenth one in a series back in 1979, a man appeared in his dream who took Mohammed to a small tree on his property and pointed to its roots.	A mafarkinsa na goma a shekarar 1979, ya ga wani mutum wanda kai Mohammad zuwa wata ƙaramar bishiya a kusa da kadararsa, sannan sai ya yi nuni zuwa jijiyar bishiyar.
The man showed him exactly where to start digging and told him that his life would depend on it.	Mutumin ya nuna masa ainihin wurin da zai fara haƙan, sannan ya gaya masa cewa rayuwarsa za ta dogara a kansa.
At midnight, he saw visions of gold.	Ya yi mafarkin gwal tsakar dare.
Surroundings up close appeared far away and objects farthest away were pulled up close to him.	Abubuwan da suke kewaye da shi da suke kusa, sun yi nesa da shi, abubuwan kuma da suke nesa da shi, sun yi kusa.
He was told where, when, and how to begin digging.	Sai aka gaya masa inda zai fara haƙan da lokacin da kuma yadda zai yi haƙan.
The next day, when he woke up, he began to dig into the earth with his bare hands.	Washe-gari sai ya tashi ya fara haƙa ƙasa da hannayensa.
These sunlight-flooded caves have been somewhat of a tourist attraction where people stop, pay a modest fee, and tour the quiet stillness at least four meters underground.

The architectural genius of these spaces reveals the finery and steadiness of Mohammed’s hand – he’s spent careful hours carving, smoothing, cutting, digging, and designing an intricate series of archways, cosy nooks and hidden rooms within rooms, some that have been furnished with soft mattresses and simple earth-slab shelves, while others are stark and cool with tiny, rounded windows flooding through with secret rays of sunlight appearing out of nowhere.	ƙwararren maƙerin na wannan wurin ya bayyana kyau da tsayuwar hannun Mohammed - ya ɗau awoyi na nutsuwa yana sassaƙawa da lailayewa da ƙwaƙulewa da kuma tsara dukkanin wasu hanyoyi da wasu kwane-kwane da wasu ɓoyayyun ɗakuna a cikin ɗakuna, wasu waɗanda aka yi musu kwalliya da lausasan katifu da wasu kantoci, wasu kuma an cika su ga wasu tagogi kewayayyu wani haske yana fitowa daga wani waje.

The other reason is religion.	Kiristocin Najeriya suna ƙaunar Trumph.

Cheta Nwanze, Head of Research at SBM Intelligence told Global Voices:	Cheta Nwanze, Shugaban Sashen Bincike na 'SBM Intelligence' ya gaya wa 'Global ɓoicee cewa:
I'd like to see exactly WHERE in Nigeria this survey was conducted.	Ina so in ga ainihin wurin da aka gudanar da bincike a kan son Trump a Nijeriya.
I'm willing to bet that it was largely in southern Nigeria, which explains the love of Trump.	Zan saka kuɗi a kan cewa, a kudancin Nijeriya aka fi son Trumph.
A lot of his base are evangelical Christians, from whom many Nigerians draw their inspiration.	Nijeriya da take da kimanin mutane miliyon 200, tana da manyan addinai guda biyu: Kiristanci da Musulunci.
Nigeria, with an estimated population of 200 million people, has two major religions: Christianity and Islam.	Musulmai na da kaso 50 yayin da Kiristoci su suke da kaso 48 na adadin mutanen Nijeriya.
Muslims and Christians make up 50 percent and 48 percent of the Nigerian population respectively.	Hanyar da aka bi wajen tattara ƙuri'ar baya-bayan nan ta nuna cewa, an gudanar da binciken a cikin mutane.
The methodology of the recent poll states that the study was conducted in Nigerian "local government areas stratified by geopolitical region".

However, Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states in northwestern Nigeria were excluded from the study due to security concerns.	Sai dai , an cire Jihar Adamawa da Borno da kuma Yobe a Arewa-maso Yamma daga cikin binciken saboda dalilin tsaro
Nigeria has 774 local government areas, the grassroots arm of executive governance structure in the country.	Nijeriya tana da ƙananan hukumomi 774, waɗanda su ne mafiya ƙanƙanta a tsarin gudanarwa a ƙasar.

Nwanze's position that Christians in southern Nigeria must have formed the core of the sample size for the Pew Research results are not unfounded.	Matsayar Nwanze cewa, dole Kiristoci a Kudancin Nijeriya su zama babban samfuri a sakamakon binciken Pew ba gaskiya ba ne.
The survey also showed that Nigerian Christians also "have a more favorable opinion of the US (69 percent) than do Muslims (54 percent)".	Binciken kuma ya nuna cewa, Kiristocin Nijeriya sun fi tunani mai kyau a kan Amurka (kaso 69) fiye da Musulmai (kaso 54).
After the killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, by the United States, Nigeria's police chief issued a national security alert to forestall any disturbances by “domestic interests.”	Bayan Amurka ta kashe babban Janar Sojin Iran ƙasem Soleimani, babban jami'in 'yan sandan Nijeriya ya bayar da bayanan sirri domin hana aukuwar hatsaniya.

Trump has been described as “one of the most controversial world leaders in modern times."	A bayyana Trump a matsayin 'wanda ya fi kowa wuyar sha'ani a tsakanin shugabannin duniya na yanzu'.
Yet, he is clearly adored by many in Nigeria.	Duk da haka, mutane da dama suna girmama shi a Nijeriya

In Nigeria, social media has a history of enabling ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during elections.	A Nijeriya, dandalin sadar ya yi ƙaurin suna wajen yaɗa labaran ƙarya na ƙabilanci da kuma farfaganda a lokacin zaɓe.
During the 2015 elections, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim).

A 2019 study by Dani Madrid-Morales, University of Huston and Herman Wasserman, University of Cape Town concluded that "mis- and disinformation campaigns have been used to influence political agendas" in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.

The high exposure to disinformation in social media especially during electoral campaigns, leads to a "distrust" among social media users "because that's where they find 'fake news' most often", Madrid-Morales asserted.

Ethnically charged disinformation	Labaran nuna ƙabilanci
Peter Obi, the running mate of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, was a victim of ethnocentric disinformation during the last elections.	Yaɗa labaran ƙarya ya shafi Peter Obi, mataimakin ɗan takarar shugaban ƙasa a tutar Jam'iyyar PDP, Atiku Abubakar a zaɓen da ya gabata.
Obi was the former governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria.	Obi tsohon gwamnan Jihar Anambra ne da ke Kudu-Maso-Gabashin Nijeriya.
A Twitter account supporting the Buhari-Osinbajo campaign, Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement, shared a tweet (Figure 1) which accused Obi of "deporting" northerners from Anambra State as governor.	Shafin Tiwitana ƙungiyar da take goyon bayan takarar Buhari da Osinbanjo mai suna 'Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Moɓement' ta haɗa wasu bayanai, inda ta zargi Obi da tiso ƙeyar 'yan Arewa da suke zaune a Jihar Anambra lokacin da yake gwamna.

This charge was amplified by Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State and member of the ruling APC, who tweeted (Figure 2) that Obi was "a tribal bigot".	Gwmamnan Jihar Kaduna Nasir El -Rufa'i na Jam'iyyar APC ya ƙara yayata zargin, inda ya yaɗa a shafinsa na Tiwita cewa, "Obi yana da ƙabilanci".
This, according to El-Rufai, made Obi unfit to be a vice president of Nigeria.	Saboda haka, El-Rufa'i yana ganin bai kamata Obi ya zama Mataimakin Shugaban ƙasa ba.

What really happened?	Mene ne ya faru?
In July 2013, 67 Nigerians, mostly from the Igbo ethnic group, "were deported all the way from Lagos and dumped at almost the same spot at the popular Upper Iweka area" in Onitsha, Anambra State, reported the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper.	Jaridar Nigerian ɓenguard ta watan Yulin Shekarar 2013 ta rawai cewa, an tiso ƙeyar 'yan Najeriya 67 daga Lagos, waɗanda mafi akasarinsu 'yan ƙabilar Igbo, inda aka sauke su fitaccen wurin nan mai suna Iweka.
Obi, who was then the governor of Anambra State, described this action by his Lagos State colleague, Tunde Fashola, as "illegal, unconstitutional, and a blatant violation of the human rights of the deportees".	Obi wanda shi ne GwamnaN Anambra a lokacin, ya bayyana abin da takwaransa na Jihar Lagos, Tunde Fashola da 'saɓa wa kundin tsarin mulki, sannan kuma keta 'yancin waɗanda aka tiso ƙeyarsu ne'.
Following the public fury that this action generated, Premium Times reported that Obi was also guilty of the same action:	Bayan nuna ɓacin ran al'umma da ya biyo lamarin, Jaridar 'Premium Times' ta rawaito cewa, shi ma Obi yana da laifi:
In 2011, he repatriated child beggars back to Ebonyi and Akwa Ibom states, both in southern Nigeria.	A shekarar 2011, ya mayar da yara mabarata zuwa Jihar Ebonyi da Akwa Ibon wato jihohinsu na asali duk a Kudancin Nijeriya.
Figure 3: Screenshot of a tweet by Jubril A. Gawat	Hoto na 3: Hoton waya na shafin Tiwitar Jubrin A. Gawat.
While Obi did indeed deport beggars back to states in Southern Nigeria, he did not deport northerners and the accusation tweeted (Figure 1) by the Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement Twitter account was inaccurate.	Duk da cewa Obi ya mayar da yara mabarata zuwa jihohinsu na asali a Kudancin Nijeriya, to amma bai tiso ƙeyar 'yan Arewa ba, inda zargin da 'Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Moɓement' ta yi masa a shafinta na Tiwita (hoto na 1) ba gaskiya ba ne.
Rather it was APC's Tunde Fashola, who in December 2014, "deported 70 northerners, found publicly begging" back to Kano State, according to the online investigative newspaper Sahara Reporters.	Sai dai, a wani bincike da Jaridar 'Sahara Reporter' ta intanet a Disambar shekarar 2014 ta gano cewa, Tunde Fashola na Jam'iyyar APC ya tiso ƙeyar 'yan Arewa su 70 da aka kama su suna bara a gari zuwa Kano.
However, this ethnically motivated disinformation was employed by APC supporters on Twitter to discredit their opponent.	sai dai kuma, magoya bayan Jam'iyyar APC ne suka yi amfani da dandalin Tiwita wajen yaɗa labaran ƙarya na ƙabilanci domin su yi wa 'yan adawarsu yarfen siyasa.
For instance, Jubril A. Gawat recently appointed as Lagos State's senior special assistant on new media tweeted that (Figure 3) a vote for opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar "is a vote for Igbo".	Misali, Jibrin A. Gawat da aka naɗa a baya-bayan nan a matsayin mataimaki na musamman ga Gwamnan Jihar Lagos a kan kafafen watsa labarai ya rubuta a shafinsa na Tiwita (hoto na 3) cewa, zaɓar Atiku Abubakar na jam'iyyar adawa ''tamkar zaɓar ɗan ƙabilar Igbo ne''.
Nigeria is a country where ethnic identities run deep.	Nijeriya ƙasa ce da ƙabilar da mutum ya fito take da muhimmanci.
These divisions are usually exploited during elections by politicians because of the obvious need to pitch their opponents into opposing camps of "we" versus "them".	Ana amfani da waɗannan bambance-bambance ne a lokacin zaɓe domin nuwa wa 'yan adawa bambancin ''mu da su''.
Hence, the allegations that Obi deported northerners was meant to re-ignite the ethnic animosities between the Igbo and Hausa, Fulani that led to the Nigerian Civil War.	Don haka, manufar zargin da aka yi wa Obi na tiso ƙeyar 'yan Arewa ita ce ƙara rura wutar ƙabilanci tsakanin Igbo da Hausawa da kuma Fulani, wanda shi ya yi sanadiyyar Yaƙin Basasar Nijeriya.
The aim of these disinformation campaigns was to paint Obi as a Biafran ethnic irredentist.	Babbar manufar yaɗa labaran ƙarya yayin kamfe ita ce yi wa Obi yarfe da ɗan Biafra,
Located in southeastern Nigeria, the breakaway Republic of Biafra, which lasted for three years through a bitter civil war between 1967 to 1970, is largely populated by the Igbo.	An cire Jamhuriyar Biafra daga Kudancin Nijeriya, inda aka yi matsanancin Yaƙin Basasa a tsakkanin shekarar 1967 zuwa 1970, wanda 'yan ƙabilar Igbo suka fi yawa a ciki.
Thus, Figure 3 proclamation that "a vote for Atiku is a vote for Igbo..." was aimed to revive the ghost of the acrimonious ethnic hatred that pitched Hausa against Igbo.	Don haka, hoto na 3 mai iƙirarin cewa, ''tamkar zaɓar ɗan ƙabilar Igbo ne'' an yi shi ne da manufar ƙara ƙiyayya tsakanin Hausawa da Igbo.
In 2019 elections, this meant that Atiku is a supporter of the Igbo who had once tried to break away from Nigeria.	Zaɓen shekarar 2019 ya nuna cewa Atiku yana gowan bayan ƙabilar Igbo da suka taɓa yunƙurin ɓallewa daga Nijeriya.
Statements in Figures 1-3 convey strong emotions capable of reopening pent up memories, which in most cases have still not received closure, from both sides of the divide.	Kalaman da suke a hoto na 1-3 na ƙunshe da jin haushin juna wanda ka iya fama raunikan kowane ɓangare.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) maintains that disinformation like this targets the "vulnerability or partisan potential of recipients" by turning them into "amplifiers and multipliers".	Hukumar Raya Ilimi da Al'adu da Kimiyya Ta Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya ta nuna cewa, labaran ƙarya irin wannan na ƙara rura wuta a tsakanin masu sauraronsu.
Ethnically-charged electoral campaigns not only exploit deeply rooted prejudices but also morph recipients into disseminators of false information.	Kalaman ƙabilanci a yayin kamfen ba wai yanke hukunci yake sawa masu sauraro su yi ba, su ma suna yaɗa labaran ƙaryar.

Similarly, ethnocentrism was also used by PDP supporters on Twitter to drive votes against the APC in Lagos State.	Har ila yau, magoya bayan Jam'iyyar PDP sun yi amfani da ƙabilanci a dandalin Tiwita domin kada a zaɓi APC a Lagos.

Political propaganda	Farfagandar siyasa
On February 13, Twitter user Souljah tweeted (Figure 6) that Ballard Partners, a PR firm based in Washington DC, which was allegedly hired as a publicist for the Abubakar presidential campaign, had conducted a poll which predicted a loss for the opposition PDP presidential candidate.	A ranar 13 ga watan Fabrairu, wani mai amfani da Tiwita mai suna Souljah (hoto na 6) ya zayyana cewa, kamfanin yaɗa labarai na Ballard Partners da ke birnin Washigton da aka yi haya domin yaɗa labaran kamfen ɗin Abubakar na takarar shugaban ƙasa, ya gudanar da ƙuri'ar nuna ra'ayi, inda sakamakon ya yi hasashen rashin nasarar ɗan takarar shugaban ƙasa na Jam'iyyar PDP.
The result of the survey was conveyed in a letter signed by Brian Ballard, head of Ballard Partners, on February 5, and addressed to Olusola Saraki, the Director-General of Abubakar's campaign.

However, by the evening of February 13, Ballard Partners refuted the said survey (Figure 7) which they described as "fraudulent" and maintained that they had not "conducted any survey research on behalf of the People’s Democratic Party of Nigeria".	binciken (hoto na 7) da suka bayyana a matsayin ''na bogi'', sannan kuma sun ƙara da cewa ba su ''gudanar da binciken ba a madadin Jam'iyyar PDP ta Nijeriya''.

On December 4, 2018, Lauretta Onochie, presidential aide to Buhari [then incumbent presidential candidate] tweeted (Figure 8) a picture with food and 500 naira notes that was purportedly shared with the crowd that attended Abubakar's presidential rally in Sokoto in northwest Nigeria, the previous day.

Onochie's allegations were completely false. In fact, the picture she shared "was taken in February 2017" at an event unrelated to "electioneering", Chuba Ugwu pointed out in a reply to her tweet.

Onochie appears to be a specialist in disseminating falsehoods. The International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), an online news portal, analysed over 1,000 images shared on Twitter by Onochie between August 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019. The analysis revealed that "in at least 12 cases" Onochie "had used inaccurate pictures".	Onocchie ta zama ƙwararriya wajen yaɗa labaran ƙarya.

This is not surprising considering that both APC and PDP engaged an army of online warriors to either "neutralize adverse" social media reports or “fend off” attacks during the campaign periods.

This year's elections were a repeat of 2015, where both APC and PDP engaged in "disinformation, misinformation, propaganda" campaigns on social media that were "carefully designed to hoodwink the unsuspecting electorate", asserts Eshemokha Austin Maho, a Nigerian media scholar.

In 2013, cultural and creative industries (CCI) generated $2,250 billion United States dollars worth of revenue and 29.5 million jobs worldwide [but] only 3 percent of these jobs came from Africa and the Middle East, according to a 2013 study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) called “Cultural time.”	Bisa wani bincike da Hukumar Raya Ilimi da Al'adu da Kimiyya Ta Majalisar ɗinkin Duniya a shekar 2013 mai suna ''Cultural time'' ya nuna cewa, a shekarar 2013, masana'antar fasaha da al'adu ta samar da Dalar Amurka biliyon 2,250 na ƙuɗin shiga da kuma ayyukan yi kimanin miliyon 29.5 a duniya bakiɗaya, amma kaso 3 na waɗannan ayyuka ne kawai suka samu daga Afirka da Gasar Ta Tsakiya.

A ranar 16 ga watan Junairun shekarar 2020 aka tattara fasahohin Afirka daga ɓangaren waƙa da zane da ɗinki da adabi da ɗab'i da wasan kwaikwayo domin baje kolin fasahohin Afirka a yayin ƙarshen makon Kasuwar Hannun Jari ta al'adun Afirka a Kigali na ƙasar Ruwanda.
It advertises itself as the "first continental event dedicated to promoting exchange within the creative and cultural industry in Africa", with over 2,000 participants from 68 countries.

On the second day of the event in Kigali, professor Benedict Oramah, president of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) announced a $500 million USD fund "to support the production and trade of African cultural and creative products" over the next two years, New Times Rwanda reported.

Omarah told guests at the event that the funds, which would build on what the bank was already doing, would be accessible as lines of credit to banks, direct financing to operators and as guarantees.	Omarah ya gawa baƙi a wurin taron cewa, asusun zai ɗora ne daga inda bakin ya tsaya, inda za a riƙa baya wa bankuna bashi da ɗaukar nauyin masu sana'ar da kuma kasancewa garanto.
He said that while Africa had a deep pool of talent, it lacked the infrastructure and capacity to commercialize its creative talent and reap the vast fortunes lying in wait, according to Afreximbank.	Ya ce, duk da cewa Afirka tana da fasahohi masu yawa, amma ba ta da hanyoyoyin da za ta mayar da fasahohin kasuwanci domin amfanar baiwar take da su, kamar yadda Bankin Shige da Fice na Afirka ya rawaito.
He continued:	Ya ci gaba da cewa:
Because of underinvestment in the creative and cultural industries, Africa is largely absent in the global market of ideas, values and aesthetics as conveyed through music, theater, literature, film and television.	Saboda ƙarancin hannun jari a masana'antar fasaha da al'dau, wannan ya sa ba a maganar Afirka a kasuwar fasaha da hikima ta hanyar waƙa da sinima da wasan kwaikwayo da talabijin.

He commended Egypt’s "astronomical growth in creative exports over the last decade".	Ya yaba wa ci-gaban da Masar ta samu wajen fitar fasahohin sararin samaniya a shekaru goma da suka wuce.
In December 2019, Afreximbank was honored at the International Fashion Awards (IFA) in Cairo for its role in supporting Africa's creative industry.

Omarah also commended Nigeria's Nollywood industry.	Haka kuma, Omarah ya yaba wa masu finafinan Turanci na Nijeriya.
On Twitter, artists who were attendance showed their appreciation for the gathering held at Intare conference center in Kigali:	A dandalin Tiwata kuwa, masu fasahar da suka halatta sun nuna godiyarsu bisa shirya taron a cibiyar 'Intare conference center' da ke Kigali.
Speaking at the 2018 CAX Weekend in Cairo, Nigerian artist D'Banj told bankers and investors:	Da yake magana a wajen taro ƙarshen mako na CAɗ a Cairo, mawaƙin Nijeriya wato D'Banj ya gaya wa ma'aikatan banki da masu saka hannun jari cewa:

"Even though the new media is taking over the world with the way we do things, radio is still the most viable option for many people to get information, it remains the most powerful tool for journalists to reach people in the farthest and remote areas..." said Bishop George Bako, during his opening remarks at the World Radio Day Symposium.

FRCN — popularly known as Radio Nigeria — is the foremost broadcast radio station in Nigeria, that serves a teeming population of listeners in the Lagos metropolis on three different stations, namely: Radio One 103.5 FM, Metro 97.7 FM and the multiple award-winning Bond 92.9 FM.

Radio remains the greatest means of news dissemination in Nigeria. FM (frequency modulation) is most common, followed closely by AM (amplitude modulation), according to Media Landscape of the European Journalism Centre — and online radio has also become quite popular.

Radio broadcasting in Nigeria started in 1933 with the British colonial government’s Radio Diffusion Service (RDS), whereby loudspeakers were installed in dedicated public places for people to listen to the British Broadcasting Corporation’s foreign radio service broadcasts.

By 1950, the Radio Diffusion Service took on a new name — the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) — and later, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), with broadcast stations in the different regions of the country. NBC later metamorphosed into the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) in 1978.

In the wake of the International Year of Indigenous Languages in 2019 and the International Decade of Indigenous Languages 2022-2032, many Africans have started to take a wide range of actions to advance African languages.

Writing the Yorùbá language in the borrowed Latin script may soon become a thing of the past as one Yorùbá man, Chief Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn, based in Benin, West Africa, has invented a writing system to encode the Yorùbá language.	Na ba da daɗewa ba rubuta harshen Yaruba ta amfani da haruffan Latin zai zama tarihi, domin kuwa wani babban mutum mai suna Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn da ke zaune a Benin, Afirka ta Yamma ya ƙirƙiri hanyar rubuta harshen Yoruba.
The newly invented Yorùbá alphabet is making waves in the hopes that it could replace Latin script used for over 100 years.	Sababbun haruffan Yoruba da aka ƙirƙiro yana samun ƙarɓuwa, inda ake fatan za su maye gurbin na harshen Latin da aka shafe fiye da shekaru 100 ana amfani da su.
The distinct alphabet came to him through divine inspiration in his dreams, according to Chief Ògúntósìn in a Whatsapp interview with Global Voices.	A wata hira da aka yi da Global ɓoices ta yi da Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn ta Wasof ya bayyana cewa an yi masa ilhamar waɗannan haruffan a cikin mafarki.
He now travels across Yorùbáland — spanning Benin to Nigeria — to promote his "talking alphabet" as sent to him by his ancestors.	A yanzu yana zaga ƙasar Yarbawa domin haruffansa na magana su samu karɓuwa, waɗanda kakanninsa suka aiko masa.
Chief Ògúntósìn believes that this alphabet was used by Odùduwà, the father of the Yorùbá people, in ancient times — but was lost.	Mai girama Ògúntósìn ya yi imanin cewa, Odùduwà wanda shi ne asalin Yarbawa ma ya yi amfani da su a da, amma suka ɓace.

In 1843, Reverend Samuel Àjàyí Crowther of the Christian Missionary Society developed the Yorùbá orthography by adopting Latin script with diacritics — or accent marks.	A shekarar 1843, Rabaren Samuel Àjàyí Crowther na ƙungiyar Christian Missionary Society ya samar da ƙa'idojin rubutun Yoruba ta hanyar amfani da rubutun Latin, inda ake amfani da alamar karin sauti.
Ever since, thousands of books have been published in Yorùbá using Latin script instead of Ajami, an Arabic script used before 1843 to write in West African Indigenous languages such as Yorùbá and Hausa.

Instilling this new writing system follows a history of ancient writing systems in Africa, like Egyptian hieroglyphics, the Adrinka collection of the Akan tribe of Ghana, Ethiopian Ge'ez, the Nsibidi ideographic script of West Central Africa which date back to 5000 BC, as well as Vai alphabet scripts are of African origin.

Global Voices Yorùbá Lingua Manager Ọmọ Yoòbá interviewed Chief Ògúntósìn, via WhatsApp voice note messaging, to learn more about how he discovered this new alphabet.

Chief Ògúntósìn, now 43, explained that after the demise of his father in 1997, he had to care for his siblings as the oldest son and could not further his education after completing secondary school.

However, as a Yorùbá chief, he focused his cultural work on uniting the seven grandchildren of Odùduwa, serving as a mediator.	Sai dai, a matsayinsa na basarake a ƙasar Yarbawa, ya mayar da hankali a kan ayyukansa na al'ada domin haɗa kan jikokin Odùduwa a matsayin mai shiga tsakani.
As his cultural integration work progressed, however, he wanted to achieve more.	A yayin da ayyukansa suka ci gaba, kodayake ya so ya fi haka.

After appealing the decision on their detention, the date for their court hearing was set for November 18, To their surprise, they were summoned on November 11, to appear before judges for questioning — but without lawyers.

President Pierre Nkurunziza said during a press conference on December 26 that he wanted a fair trial but he could only intervene as a last resort, even though he could use his power to grant a presidential pardon.

Sentencing	Yanke hukunci
On January 30, in Bubanza, the four journalists were sentenced to two and a half years in prison and a fine of a million francs each ($521 United States dollars) under article 16 of the Penal Code, while the driver was acquitted.	A 30 ga Janairu, a Bubanza, an yanke wa 'yan jaridar huɗu hukuncin shekaru biyu da rabi a kurkuku da tarar franc miliyan kowannensu ($521 dalar Amurka) a ƙarƙashin sashe na 16 na pinalkod, amma an wanke direban nasu.
The prosecution could not prove any actual link or contact with the rebels, so the charge was changed to "impossible attempt at the complicity in undermining state security", that is — that they intended to threaten state security but it was not possible.	Hukuncin bai tabbatar da wani haƙiƙanin alaƙa ko mu'amala da 'yan tawayen ba, don haka sai aka sauya cajin zuwa "yunƙurin da bai yiwu ba na cin dunduniyar tsaron ƙasa", shi ne - sun yi ƙoƙarin su yi wa tsaron ƙasa barazana amma ba zai yiwu ba.

Iwasu sun nuna cewa masu rahoton sun je wajen ne bayan mahukunta sun yi bayani a fili game da lamarin, kuma an tantance su, kuma ba wani hana zuwa wajen da aka yi.
The key element used as evidence against the journalists was a WhatsApp message sent by one of the reporters to a friend, which said they were going to "help the rebels".

They argued it was clearly a dry joke — the government has often conflated critics, political opponents, and armed groups to justify generalized crackdowns. But the text was taken literally as evidence against them.

A history of violence against journalists	Tarihin cin zarafin 'yan jarida
After controversial 2015 elections — in which Nkurunziza returned for a third term that many argued as unconstitutional — there was a failed putsch. The media environment quickly deteriorated.

Two online social media movements in Nigeria lend powerful insights into the experiences of advocacy and gender: The #BringBackOurGirls movement, led by Dr. Oby Ezekwesili; and #ArewaMeToo, led by Fakhriyyah Hashim, both experienced gendered political hatred that greatly affected the integrity of their messages.

#BringBackOurGirls (#BBOG) movement	Gangamin #BringBackOurGirls (#BBOG)
Six years ago, on April 15, 2014, about 200 school girls between the ages of 15 and 18, were forcefully abducted by Boko Haram, an Islamist terrorist group, from Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok near Maiduguri, in northeast Nigeria.

The BBC reported that in April 2014, the #BringBackOurGirls trended on Twitter with over 3.3 million tweets, 27 percent of the tweets came from Nigeria, 26 percent from the United States and 11 percent from the United Kingdom.

Dr. Obiageli (Oby) Ezekwesili, a former vice president of the World Bank, and one-time minister of education in Nigeria, started tweeting about the Chibok girls the day they were kidnapped.

She was motivated to take action due to a previous attack on schoolboys at the Federal Government College of Buni Yadi in Yobe State, northeastern Nigeria on February 25, 2014.

However, it was not until April 23, when, as a guest at a UNESCO event in Port Harcourt, in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, did her cry for the release of the schoolgirls grab national and international attention:	Amma, har sai 23 ga Afrilu, a lokacin da, a matsayin baƙuwa a wani taron UNESCO a Fatakwal, a yankin da yake NaijaDelta mai arziƙin man fetur, koke-kokenta na a saki waɗannan 'yan matan makarantar ya sami karɓuwa a ƙasa da ma duniya:
And on May 7, 2014, former American first lady Michelle Obama posted an image of herself on Twitter holding a sign with the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

She also released a video a few days later from the White House — making it a global sensation.	Ta kuma saki wani bidiyo 'yan kwanaki kaɗan daga baya daga Fadar Gwamnatin Amurka - wanda ya mayar da lamarin damuwar duniya.
It would take two years before the Nigerian army rescued one girl, in May 2016.	Sai da aka ɗauki shekaru biyu kafin sojojin Najeriya su ceto yarinya ɗaya, a Mayu 2016.
By October 2016, 21 girls were reunited with their families. And by May 2017, Boko Haram militants released 82 girls from captivity.	Zuwa Oktoba 2016, an sake haɗa 'yan mata 21 da iyalansu. Kuma zuwa Mayu 2017, mayaƙan Boko Haram suka saki 'yan mata 82 daga kamu.
However, about 112 girls remain missing and 13 are presumed dead, according to a 2018 report.	Amma kusan 'yan mata 112 har yanzu ba a gan su ba kuma ana jin 13 sun mutu, kamar yadda wani rahoto ya nuna a 2018.
Ezekwesili co-founded the #BBOG movement that mobilized a global protest for the release of the Chibok girls.	Ezekwesili tana daga waɗanda suka fara gangamin #BBOG wanda ya haɗa zanga-zanga ta duniya domin a saki 'yan matan Chibok.
The movement later transformed into a formidable social movement organisation that has withstood the harsh Nigerian civic space.	Wannan gangamin daga baya ya zama wani gagarumin gangamin kawo sauyi a cikin al'umma wanda ya jure dukkanin wasu wahalhalun mutanen Najeriya.
But the success of this movement occurred at great personal cost to Ezekwesili.	Amma nasarar wannan gangami ya samu ne ta hanyar wasu abubuwa da ita Ezekwesili ta kashe.
The kidnapping of the Chibok girls occurred on the threshold of the 2015 presidential election, and Ezekwesili's online advocacy was viewed through the prism of partisan politics by some.	Sace 'yan mata Chibok ya zo ne ana kusa da zaɓen shugaban ƙasa na 2015, don haka wasu sun kalli ƙoƙarin Ezekwesili a intanet a matsayin wata siyasar jam'iyya.
Her personal integrity was not only questioned but shredded.	Ba tababar gaskiya kawai aka yi ba, an ma yi watsi da mutuncinta.
Some alleged that her #BBOG was merely a front to gain political capital.	Wasu sun yi zargin cewa yunƙurinta na #BBOG wata hanya ce kawai ta neman jarin siyasa.
Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, accused Ezekwesili of being used by the then-opposition party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), to "undermine" the government of President Jonathan, thereby paving the way for APC’s "rise to power".

Supporters of former President Jonathan and the Peoples’ Democratic Party spread "all manners of falsehoods" online against Ezekwesili in 2014: "I was actually being insulted, maligned..." said Ezekwesili in a live Twitter video broadcast on April 14, to mark the sixth anniversary of the abduction.	Masu goyon bayan tsohon shugaban ƙasa Jonathan da PDP sun yaɗa "duk wata irin ƙarya" a intanet a kan Ezekwesili a 2014: "A haƙiƙanin gaskiya an zage ni an ci mutuncina…" Ezekwesili ta bayyana a wani saƙon Tuwita na kai tsaye ran 14 ga Afrilu, domin nuna cikar shekaru shida da sacewar.
Ezekwesili was falsely accused of being bitter for not gaining a ministerial appointment under Jonathan.	An zargi Ezekwesili a kan ƙarya da cewa tana adawa ne don ba ta sami muƙamin minista ba a ƙarƙashin Jonathan.
According to her, some of her online attackers thought “that the reason we kept on with the advocacy of Chibok girls was that I wanted to be made a minister.”	Kamar yadda ta bayyana, wasu daga cikin masu yi mata barazana a intanet suna zaton "cewa dalilin tsayawarmu a kan wannan gwagwarmayar ta 'yan matan Chibok shi ne ina so a naɗa ni minista."

Ezekwesili said in the live Twitter video broadcast.	Ezekwesili ta bayyana a wani bidiyon Tuwita na kai tsaye.
She became a 2018 presidential contender, but later withdrew from the race.	Ta zama 'yar takarar shugabancin ƙasa a 2018, amma daga baya ta janye daga takarar.
Live on Twitter, Ezekwesili recalled her grief: It was a very sad thing for me to bear the thought that children who went to school were so killed and brutally murdered to the point where parents could not recognise their children.

A ranar 3 ga Fabarairu, wata matashiyar mata mai suna Khadijah Adamua ta sami ƙarfin guiwar yin rubutu a Tuwita game da cin zarafin da ta sha daga tsohon saurayinta.
Adamua, who lives in Kano state in northwest Nigeria, had previously blogged about her horrific experiences.	Adamua, wadda take zaune a jihar Kano a arewa maso yammacin Najeriya, ta taɓa yin rubutu a kan munanan matsalolin da ta fuskanta.
Fellow Nigerian Fakhriyyah Hashim tweeted her support for Adamua with the hashtag #ArewaMeToo:	Wata 'yar Najeriya Fakhriyya Hashim ta yi rubutu a Tuwita domin nuna goyon baya ga Adamua da hashtag na #ArewaMeToo:
#ArewaMeToo became northern Nigeria’s version of the global #MeToo movement. (Arewa is the Hausa word for “North”) — igniting a storm of online discussion on rape and other forms of gender-based violence.	#ArewaMeToo ya zama kwafin arewacin Najeriya na gangamin #MeToo na duniya. (Arewa kalmar Hausa ce ta "Arewa") - wanda ya jawo cecekucen tattaunawa a intanet game da fyaɗe da sauran abubuwan cin zarafin mata.
Violence against women is rampant throughout Nigeria. However, Relief Web asserts that between November 2014 and January 2015, northeastern Nigeria, especially Borno State, recorded the most violence against women.	Cin zarafin da ake yi wa mata yana da yawa a duk faɗin Najeriya. Amma shafin Relief Web ya bayyana cewa tsakanin Nuwamban 2014 da Janairun 2015 arewa maso gabashin Najeriya, musamman Jihar Borno, sun fi kowa fuskantar cin zarafin mata.
In the Muslim-majority north, discussions about these taboo topics are difficult, often forcing victims into silence.	A yankin da Muslmi suka fi yawa na Arewa, yin bayani game da waɗannan abubuwan yana da wahala, sau da yawa hakan yakan jawo wanda abin ya shafa ya yi shiru.
The online rage of #ArewaMeToo propelled the NorthNormal offline protests in Bauchi, Kano, Niger.	Damuwar da aka nuna a intanet ta #ArewaMeToo ta jawo zanga-zangar haƙiƙa a garin Bauchi da Kano da Naija.
Sixteen days of NorthNormal protests occurred in November last year across eight northern Nigerian states and Abuja.	Kwanaki sha shida na zanga-zangar NorthNormal sun faru a Nuwamban shekarar bara a jihohi takwas na Najeriya da Abuja.
They were largely positive and state legislators "were receptive of young indigenes” for taking “the baton to push for the VAPP", Hashim said.	Da yawansu sun sami karɓuwa kuma 'yan majalisun jihohi "sun karɓi matasan 'yan ƙasa" don yunƙurin "ɗaukar gabaran tursasa ɓAPP", Hashim ta bayyana.
However, in Sokoto State, "government played a role in harassing and arresting NorthNormal campaigners", Hashim said.	Amma, a Jihar Sakkwato, "gwamnati ta taka rawa wajen cin tsorata da kama masu gangamin NorthNormal", Hashim ta bayyana.
The police manhandled a local leader of the movement.	Yan sanda sun sassama shugaban gangamin.
Thereafter, protests were banned by the Sultan of Sokoto, head of Nigerian Muslims.	Daga nan, Sultan ɗin Sakkwato, shugaban Musulmin Najeriya, ya soke duk wata zanga-zanga.
According to Hashim, NorthNormal grew out of the #ArewaMeToo hashtag, and has two objectives: advocating for “the domestication of the Violence against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP),” and championing the conversation on “various forms of gender-based violence and rape culture across northern Nigeria.”	Kamar yadda Hashim ta bayyana, NorthNormal ya samo asali ne daga hashtag ɗin #ArewaMeToo, kuma yana da burika biyu: yunƙurin samar da "tabbatuwar Dokar hana cin zarafin mutane (ɓAPP)," da kuma ingiza tattaunawa game da "nau'ika daban-daban na cin zarafin mata da al'adar fyaɗe a dukkanin arewacin Najeriya."
The Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 was signed into law on May 23, 2015.	An amince da ƙudurin dokar cin zarafin mutane na 2015 a ranar 23 ga Mayun 2015.
Under the VAPP Act — an improvement on the provisions of Nigeria’s penal code — acts of violence against women are punishable offences.	A ƙarƙashin dokar ɓAPP - wanda yake cigaba ne game da abin da penalkod na Najeriya yake da shi - cin zarafin mata laifuka ne da za a yi hukunci a kansu.
This includes rape, spousal battery, forceful home ejections, forced financial dependence or economic abuse, harmful widowhood practices, female circumcision or genital mutilation, and/or child abandonment.	Wannan ya haɗar da fyaɗe da dukan abokin zama da kora daga gida ta ƙarfi da tursasa dogaro na kuɗi ko matsalolin rashin ɗaukar nauyi da cutar da bazawara da kaciyar mata da rashin kula da 'ya'ya.
In Nigeria, rape is punishable with life imprisonment. A minor can face up to 14 years in prison.	A Najeriya, ana yin hukuncin fyaɗe da ɗaurin rai da rai. ƙarami kuma zai iya fuskantar shekaru 14 a kurkuku.
In cases of gang rape, offenders are jointly liable to 20 years imprisonment without the option of a fine.	A matsalolin fyaɗe na mutane da yawa, masu laifin za su shafe shekaru 20 a gidan yari dukkaninsu ba tare da zaɓin tara ba.
However, Section 47 of the VAPP Act stipulates that this legislation applies only in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. NorthNormal and other organisations have been campaigning for all 36 state legislative assemblies to domesticate this act.	Amma sashi na 47 na dokar ɓAPP ya bayyana cewa wannan dokar ta shafi Abuja ne kawai, babban birnin Najeriya. NorthNormal da sauran ƙungiyoyi sun ta yin kira ga majalisun jihohi na jihohi 36 da su karɓi wannan dokar.
Backlash against advocates	Bita da ƙulli ga masu gwagwarmaya
One year after sparking the #ArewaMeToo movement, Hashim told Global Voices that although their advocacy exposed the "rot within society", it also took its toll.	Shekara ɗaya bayan fara gangamin #ArewaMeToo, Hashim ta sanar da Global ɓoices cewa duk da cewa yunƙurinsu ya fito da "matsalar da ke cikin al'umma", to amma fa akwai wata a ƙasa.
Hashim experienced major online harassment when her group confronted "an alleged serial abuser of minors" who works at the finance ministry as part of their online advocacy.	Hashim ta fuskanci babbar matsalar barazana a intanet a lokacin ga ƙungiyarta suka ƙalubalanci wani "babban mai cin zarafin yara" wanda yake aiki a ma'aikatar kuɗi a wani ɓangare na gwagwarmayarsu ta intanet.
She told Global Voices:	Ta gaya wa Global ɓoices:
We launched a campaign against him [the serial abuser], demanding that he be sacked by the minister; some people did not like that so they orchestrated an online targeted harassment campaign to delegitimise ArewaMeToo.	Mun kafa gangami domin ƙalubalantarsa [babban mai cin zarafin], muna neman ministan ya kore shi daga aiki; wasu mutane ba sa son haka, don haka sai suka ƙulla wani bi-ta-da-ƙulli a intanet domin su wulaƙantar da ArewaMeToo.
According to Hashim, harassers attempted to delegitimise ArewaMeToo by associating ArewaMeToo with LGBTQ [lesbians, gay, bisexual transgender and queer people] and their strategy worked as online harassment gained momentum, Hashim said.	Kamar yadda Hashim ta bayyana, masu cin zarafin sun so su wulaƙanta ArewaMeToo ta hanyar alaƙanta ArewaMeToo da LGBTƙ ['yan maɗigo da masu luwaɗi] kuma dabarar su ta yi domin abin nasu ya samu karɓuwa a intanet, Hashim ta bayyana.
In Nigeria, gay marriage is illegal and under Sharia and penal legal codes, sodomy and lesbianism are punishable in some states.	A Najeriya, auren jinsi haramun ne kuma a ƙarƙashin Sharia da Pinalkod ana hukunta masu luwaɗi da 'yan maɗigo a wasu jihohin.
By associating Haashim's movement with LGBTQ rights, online trolls distorted their message and framed #ArewaToo and NorthNormal as illegitimate.	Alaƙanta yunƙurin Hashim da ƙungiyar luwaɗi, masu yarfe na intanet sun juya musu saƙonsu aka sa musu #ArewaToo da kuma ArewaLafiya a matsayin haramtattu.
However, Global Voices was not able to independently verify tweets that pinned Hashim's movement to LGBTQ rights.	Amma, Global ɓoices ba ta iya tabbatar da labaran Tuwita da suka alaƙanta yunƙurin Hashim da haƙƙin ƙungiyar 'yan luwaɗi ba.
Still, Hashim posts messages of hope on Twitter:	Har yanzu, Hashim yana rubuta saƙonnin fata a Tuwita:
Fakhriyyah Hashim, co-founder of #ArewaToo and NorthNormal (Image used with her permission).	Fakhriyya Hashim, ɗaya daga cikin waɗanda suka samar da #ArewaToo da ArewaLafiya (An yi amfani da hoto da izininta).
She said all these experiences helped her grow a "really thick skin":	Ta ce duk waɗannan abubuwan sun sa ta ƙara samun damar "ɗauke kai":
In my experience of being loud on political Twitter for good governance, I’ve grown a really thick skin, but even that didn't prepare me for the amount of backlash we got through ArewaMeToo and NorthNormal.	A masaniyata game da ɓaɓatu a siyasar Tuwita game da shugabanci nagari, na fara ɗauke kaina daga duk wata barazana, amma ko wannan bai sa na iya ɗaukar matsalolin da muka shiga ba a ArewaMeToo da NorthNormal.
Though I mustered all of that and did not retreat to any cave, I did begin feeling demoralised about Northern Nigeria’s governanace and response to sexual violence...	Duk da cewa na iya shanye duk wancan kuma ban gudu ba, na fara jin gazawa game da shugabancin Arewacin Najeriya da martani game da cin zarafin mata…
After every episode of attacks, we did gather more strength and energy to push back because the backlash made us see how society enforced the culture of silence and if we allowed our lips to be sealed then that would be the real tragedy.	Bayan kowane zagayen zage-zage, sai mu ƙara ƙwarin guiwa da ƙarfin ƙara kutsawa domin duk wata matsala takan sa mu ga yadda al'umma suke tursasa al'adar yin shiru kuma idan muka bari aka rufe mana bakinmu to wannan ne zai zama babbar masifa.
Sadly, Hashim and Ezekwesili still struggle with the excruciating "lack of empathy" that characterises discourse about gender-based violence on- and offline.

According to Hashim, this "deliberate maligning of a cause that only seeks better for victims of sexual violence" is incredibly difficult to grasp.	Kamar yadda Hashim ta bayyana, wannan "suka da gangan ga yunƙurin da yake neman yadda za a inganta rayuwar waɗanda abin ya shafa" abu ne mai matuƙar wahalar ganewa.

In Assad-controlled Syria, the official narrative is ‘no COVID-19 cases’	A Siriyan da Assad yake juyawa, a hukumance bayanin shi ne 'ba matsalolin Kwabid-19'
After nine years of a deadly civil war, the health system in Syria is barely functional.	Bayan shekaru tara na mummunan yaƙin basasa, harkar lafiya a Siriya ba ta aiki sosai.
In territories controlled by President Bashar al-Assad, authorities deny the presence of COVID-19.	A yankunan da Shugaba Bashar al-Asad yake da iko, mahukunta sun ƙi amincewa da samuwar cutar Kwabid-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the country has confirmed 439 cases and 21 deaths as of July 15.	Kamar yadda jami'ar John Hopkins ta nuna, ƙasar ta tabbatar da mutum 439 da suka kamu da cutar da mutuwar mutum 21 har zuwa 15 ga Yuli.
But narratives on the ground reveal the ways in which the state has denied and repressed the realities of COVID-19.	Amma maganganu na haƙiƙa suna nuna hanyoyin da gwamnati ta bi ta ƙi amincewa kuma ta murƙushe gaskiyar Kwabid-19.
Walid Abdullah, 23, says the state has even gone so far as to suggest terminating the lives of suspected COVID-19 patients.	Walid Abdullahi, ɗan shekaru 23, ya bayyana cewa gwamnati har ta kai munzali tunanin ta ƙarar da rayuwar marasa lafiyan cutar Kwabid-19.
Global Voices is using a pseudonym upon request to protect his identity.	Global ɓoices suna amfani da wani sunan saye domin su kare kar a gane shi.
Speaking to Global Voices by phone, Abdullah explained that on May 13, he called Daraa National Hospital, in southern Syria, to inform them about a suspected case of coronavirus.	A yayin da yake magana da Global ɓoices ta waya, Abdullah ya bayyana ran 13 ga Mayu cewa, ya kira Asibitin ƙasa na Daraa, a kudancin Siriya, domin ya bayyana musu wani wanda ake zargin ya kamu da Kwaronabairas.
When he asked what steps should be taken, the government hospital employee who answered the phone said: "Shoot him — we have no cure for him", according to Abdullah.	A lokacin da ya tambayi waɗanne matakai za a ɗauka, ma'aikacin asibitin gwamnatin wanda ya amsa wayar ya ce: "Ka harbe shi - ba mu da magani domin sa", kamar yadda Abdullah ya bayyana.
He quickly ended the call.	Nan da nan ya katse kiran.
Obviously, the idea of shooting a suspected COVID-19 patient was out of the question.	Alal haƙiƙa, tunanin a kashe mara lafiyar da ake ganin ya kamu da Kwabid-19 wani hauka ne kawai.
"Death by COVID-19 is more honorable than to set foot in any public hospital", Abdullah told Global Voices.	"Mutuwa da Kwabid-19 ya fi mutunci sama da mutum ya sa ƙafa a duk wani asibitin gwamnati", Abdullah ya gaya wa Global ɓoices.
This harrowing testimony is corroborated by other sources.	Wasu ɓangarorin suna gasgata waɗannan bayanan baƙin cikin.
In a March 10 report published in The Voice of the Capital, an independent Syrian newspaper, medical personnel from the Syrian Ministry of Health claimed that "deliberate termination operations are taking place at the al-Mujtahid government hospital in the capital, Damascus, for those who are believed to be carrying the virus, through giving them additional doses of the drug [anesthetic]".	A wani rahoton da aka buga a The ɓoice of the Capital ranar 10 ga Maris, wata jaridar Siriya mai zaman kanta, ma'aikatan lafiya daga Ma'aikatar Lafiya ta Siriya sun yi zargin cewa "da gangan ana ta ƙarar da rayuwar waɗanda ake jin suna ɗauke da bairas ɗin a asibitin gwamnati na al-Mujtahid a babban birni, Damascus, ta hanyar ba su ƙarin wasu ƙwayoyi [magungunan hana jin raɗaɗi]".
This claim also appeared on social media:	Wannan zargin ma ya fito a dandalin sadarwa:
Another person from al-Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus was also quoted in the same article confirming this claim:	An kuma jiyo wani mutum daga asibitin al-Mouwasat a Damascus a wannan rubutun yana tabbatar da wannan zargin:
"These terminations are conducted in complete secrecy and are carried out by doctors dedicated to following up on cases of suspected virus infection".	"Ana ƙarar da rayuwar mutanen ne a tsananin sirri kuma wasu likitoci ne da aka sa su su dinga bibiyar waɗanda suka faru waɗanda suka kamu da bairas ɗin".
The Assad regime's desperate approach to dealing with COVID-19 parallels callous strategies used in Assad’s war, which left 586,100 people dead, nearly 100,000 detained and forcibly disappeared, and 5.6 million refugees around the world.	Mummunan yunƙurin gwamnatin Assad wajen tunkarar Kwabid-19 sun yi daidai da munanan dabarun da Assad ya yi amfani da su a wajen yaƙi, wanda ya jawo hasarar rayukan mutane 586,100, aka kama kusan 100,000 aka ɓatar da su, da 'yan gudun hijira miliyan 5.6 a duk faɗin duniya.
Virus outbreak and regime survival	ɓarkewar bairas ɗin da rayuwar gwamnati
The Assad regime owes its survival to its key allies, including Iran. With few allies in the region, Iran has leaned on Syria as well.	Gwamnatin Assad ta ta'allaƙa rayuwarta a kan muhimman abokanta, waɗanda suka haɗa da Iran. Iran wadda take da abokai 'yan kaɗan a yankin, ita ma ta jingina da Siriya.
In February, Iran became one of the world's most COVID-19 affected countries and is a likely source of infection in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, where Iranian troops have had physical contact through military cooperation.	A watan Fabarairu, Iran ta zama ɗaya daga cikin ƙasashen duniya da suka fi kamuwa da Kwabid-19 kuma wataƙila ta zama dalilin yaɗuwar cutar a Lebanon da Iran da kuma Siriya wuraren da sojojin Iran suka haɗu saboda alaƙar aikin soji.
Additionally, Iranian pilgrims and religious tourists, continued to visit Damascus-based shrines up until the first week of March, as reported by Zaki Mehchy, co-author of a March study published by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).	ƙari a kan haka, mahajjatan Iran da wasu masu yawon buɗe idanu na addini, sun ci gaba da kai ziyara zuwa wuraran ibada a Damaskus har kusan satin farko na Maris, kamar yadda Zaki Mehchy ya rawaito, wanda da shi aka yi binciken Maris wanda makarantar koyar da tattalin arziƙi da kimiyyar siyasa ta Landan (LSE) ta buga.
However, the Assad regime has pursued a policy of misinformation, prevarication and denial in terms of the number of COVID-19 casualties.	Haka kuma gwamnatin Assad ta yi amfani da dabarar bayanan ƙarya, ja-in-ja da nuna bijirewa a abin da ya shafi adadin waɗanda suka kamu da Kwabid-19.
In a March 13 interview with the official Syrian News Channel, Minister of Health Nizar Al-Yaziji insisted on denying the existence of any COVID-19 cases in Syria, saying:	A wata ganawar 13 ga Maris da wata kafar labarai ta gwamnatin Siriya, ministan lafiya Nizar Al-Yaziji ya dage a kan kore samuwar waɗanda suka kamu da cutar a Siriya, yana cewa:
"Thank God that the Syrian Arab Army has cleansed the Syrian soil from many germs:"	"Godiya ga Allah cewa Sojojin Larabawa na Siriya sun wanke ƙasar daga cututtuka da yawa:"
The Syrian Ministry of Health did not announce its first case of COVID-19 until March 22, causing resentment and anger among Syrians who noted that the Assad regime lied and pursued a policy of denial.	Ma'aikatar lafiya ta Siriya ba ta sanar da samuwar matsalarta ta Kwabid-19 na farko ba har sai 22 ga Maris, wanda hakan ya jawo tsana da fushi a cikin mutanen Siriya waɗanda suke ganin gwamnatin Assad ta yi ƙarya kuma ta shigo da wani salon ƙin gaskiya.
In an article published on an independent Syria 24 news site in response to Yaziji’s claims, one citizen poignantly asked, "didn’t you say in your statement that all germs have been eliminated?"	An wani rubutu da aka buga a Syria 24 wata kafar yaɗa labarai mai zaman kanta a matsayin martanin maganar Yaziji, wani ɗan ƙasa cikin baƙin ciki ya tambaya, "ba ka faɗa a cikin bayananka cewa an kakkaɓe duk cututtuka ba?"
However, the regime has continued to report implausibly low numbers.	Amma duk da haka gwamnatin ta ci gaba da kawo rahoton adadi kaɗan.
In a statement dated April 1, the Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces called on the international community to put pressure on the regime to disclose verified data regarding COVID-19 cases.	A wani bayani da yake da kwanan watan 1 ga Aprilu, haɗakar ƙungiyar 'yan adawa da rajin kawo sauyi na Siriya sun yi kira ga hukumomin duniya da su tilasta gwamnati don ta bayar da tabbataccen bayani game da waɗanda suka kamu da Kwabid-19.
Stressing the assumed existence of a large number of casualties, the coalition wrote:	Suna tabbatar samuwar waɗanda abin ya rutsa da su, haɗakar sun rubuta:
A broken health care system	Lalataccen tsarin lafiya
Recognizing the pandemic is embarrassing for the Assad regime because it forces authorities to admit that the health system is non-existent.	Yarda da annobar wani abin kunyatarwa ne ga gwamnatin Assad domin hakan ya tilasta gwamnati su amince da cewa ba wani tsarin lafiya.
According to the LSE study, the maximum number of COVID-19 infections that can be treated in the Syrian health sector is estimated to be only 6,500 in a nation of 17.5 million inhabitants.

Perhaps the biggest challenge many Syrians face is the accumulation of disasters: war, a pandemic, and famine.	wataƙila babbar matsalar da mutanen Siriya suke fuskanta shi ne taruwar musibu, ga yaƙi, ga annoba ga kuma fari.

As the economic situation deteriorates, 28-year-old Ali al-Ahmed (also a pseudonym upon request to protect his identity) from Daraa city told Global Voices in a phone interview that "the situation is bad, regardless of how much you work, even if you make 10,000 SYP a day [between $1 and $5 USD] it will not be enough".
