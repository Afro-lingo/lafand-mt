In Tanzania, Hope Rises for a Better Journalism Climate	ETanzania, Ithemba liyakhula malunga nesimo esingcono sobuntatheli.
Tanzanias president has called for a review of the East African countrys media laws and regulations, saying she wants to ensure measures "to protect journalists and open more space for freedom of expression and the media."	Umongameli waseTanzania ucele ukuba kuqwalaselwe imithetho nemigaqo yemithombo yeendaba yamazwe aseMpuma Afrika, esithi ufuna ukuqinisekisa amanyathelo "okukhusela iintatheli kunye nokuvula indawo enkulu yokuthetha ngokukhululekileyo kunye neendaba."
Samia Suluhu Hassan delivered her remarks on Tuesday, World Press Freedom Day, at a gathering of journalists, government officials and others in Arusha, in northern Tanzania, according to The East African newspaper.	USamia Suluhu Hassan wenze intetho yakhe ngoLwesibini, iWorld Press Freedom Day, kwindibano yeentatheli, amagosa karhulumente kunye nabanye eArusha, kumantla eTanzania, ngokutsho kwephephandaba iThe East African.
Maxence Melo Mubyazi, an award-winning journalist in Tanzania, said he takes this as an encouraging sign after "lots of arrests, lots of attacks on the press" in recent years.	UMaxence Melo Mubyazi, intatheli ephumelele ibhaso eTanzania, uthe ukuthatha oku njengophawu olukhuthazayo emva “kokubanjwa okuninzi, uhlaselo oluninzi kumaphephandaba” kule minyaka idlulileyo.
"We welcome this kind of political will from the president to review the current draconian laws in the country," said the founding editor of the online discussion platform Jamii Forums, who has himself endured arrests and jail time.	“Siyalwamkela olu hlobo lwentando yezopolitiko evela kumongameli yokuphonononga imithetho engqongqo kweli lizwe,” utshilo umhleli weqonga leengxoxo kwi-Intanethi, iJamii Forums, naye onyamezele ukubanjwa nokuvalelwa entolongweni.
He told VOA Wednesday he hoped this would ensure "that at least we have frameworks in place and we dont go by the presidential decree.	Uxelele iVOA ngolwesiThathu ukuba unethemba lokuba oku kuya kuqinisekisa ukuba "ubuncinci sinesikhokelo esikhoyo kwaye asihambi ngommiselo kamongameli.
Melo was alluding to Hassans predecessor, John Magufuli, president from 2015 until his death in March 2021 at age 61.	UMelo wayebhekisa kumanduleli kaHassan, uJohn Magufuli, umongameli ukusukela ngo-2015 de wasweleka ngoMatshi ka-2021 eneminyaka engama-61.
During Magafulis tenure, journalists were often arrested for critical coverage of government and political dissent was discouraged.	Ngexesha likaMagafulis, iintatheli zazihlala zibanjwa ngenxa yokubhala ingxelo egxekayo ngorhulumente kwaye ukuchasana kwezopolitiko kwakungavumelekanga.
Tanzanias ranking in Reporters Without Borders annual press freedom index plummeted from 71st to 124th over five years beginning in 2016.	Inqanaba leTanzania kwiiReporters Without Borders ngonyaka lihle ukusuka ku-71 ukuya kwi-124 kwiminyaka emihlanu ukususela ngo-2016.
Reporters Without Borders noted in its latest report that Magufuli "had become increasingly authoritarian and hostile" toward media and that Hassans rise to power has "brought initial hopeful signs that have yet to come to fruition."	IReporters Without Borders iphawule kwingxelo yayo yamva nje yokuba u-Magufuli "uye wanda ngamandla kwaye enobutshaba" kumajelo eendaba kwaye nokuba u-Hassan anyukele emandleni "kuzise imiqondiso yokuqala yethemba engekafezeki."
	
In February, Hassans administration lifted bans on four media outlets: Mseto, Mawio, Mwanahalisi and Tanzania Daima.	NgoFebruwari, ulawulo lukaHassan lususe ukuvalwa kwemithombo yeendaba ezine: iMseto, iMawio, iMwanahalisi kunye neTanzania Daima.
They  had been shuttered for offenses related to their coverage of alleged corruption, according to Amnesty International.	Babevalelwe ngenxa yezityholo zorhwaphilizo, ngokutsho kweAmnesty International.
And Hassan has instructed the Ministry of Information, Communication and Information Technology to work with media stakeholders and others on reviewing laws and possibly loosening restrictions.	Kwaye u-Hassan uye wayala uMphathiswa wezoLwazi, uNxibelelwano kunye neTeknoloji yoLwazi ukuba asebenze nabachaphazelekayo beendaba kunye nabanye ngokuphonononga imithetho kwaye mhlawumbi ikhulule izithintelo.
Melo is among those being asked to weigh in on what he calls "draconian" measures such as the 2015 Cybercrimes Act and 2016 Media Services Act.	UMelo uphakathi kwabo bacelwe ukuba baphonononge amanyathelo awabiza ngokuba “yidraconian” afana nomthetho i-Cybercrimes Act ka-2015 kunye noMthetho weeNkonzo zeMedia ka-2016.
Ive been part of the team that has been reviewing the laws, said Melo, who had previously felt their bite.	“Ndibe yinxalenye yeqela ebeliphonononga imithetho,” utshilo uMelo owayekhe wakuva ngaphambili ukulunywa yilemithetho.
He was convicted in April 2020 of obstructing police investigations, and paid a fine of 3 million Tanzanian shillings, or $1,300, rather than face a year behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.	Wafunyaniswa enetyala ngo-Epreli ka-2020 ngokuthintela uphando lwamapolisa, kwaye wahlawula imali ezizigidi ezi-3 zeerandi zaseTanzania, okanye i-1,300 yeedola, kunokuba ajongane nonyaka entolongweni, ngokutsho kweKomiti yokukhusela iintatheli.
CPJ, which honored Melo with its 2019 International Press Freedom Award, noted that the "charge stemmed from Melos alleged refusal to disclose the identities of whistleblowers on the Jamii Forums platform.	I-CPJ, ewonge uMelo ngembasa ye-International Press Freedom Award ka-2019, iphawule ukuba “isityholo sibangelwe kukwala kukaMelos ukubhengeza izazisi zabo babetha ikhwelo kwiqonga le-Jamii Forums.
Melo told VOA that Jamii Forums, founded as a for-profit business, now is a nongovernmental organization.	UMelo uxelele iVOA ukuba iJamii Forums, eyasekwa njengeshishini elenza inzuzo, ngoku ingumbutho ongekho phantsi korhulumente.
We are focusing on good governance, accountability and democracy, he said.	“Sigxile kulawulo olululo, uxanduva nedemokhrasi,” utshilo.
Since Hassan took office, Melo said, "people on the cyberspace can now at least criticize the government or critically analyze whatever kind of statement that comes from any political figure.	Ukusukela oko uHassan ethathe isikhundla, uMelo uthe, "abantu abakwi-cyberpace ngoku banokugxeka urhulumente okanye bahlalutye ngokugxekayo naluphi na uhlobo lwengxelo evela kuye nawuphi na umntu wezopolitiko.
At the moment, journalists are now writing stories that could not be written in the past six years."	Okwangoku, iintatheli ngoku zibhala amabali ebengakwazi ukubhalwa kule minyaka mithandathu idlulileyo.
When it comes to news media, "indeed, the environment is slowly opening up," agreed Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher.	Xa kuziwa kumajelo eendaba, “eneneni, okusingqongileyo kuvuleka kancinci,” wavuma uRoland Ebole, umphandi weAmnesty International.
Based in Nairobi, he monitors Tanzania and Uganda.	Uzinze eNairobi, ubeka iliso eTanzania naseUganda.
Amnesty praised Tanzanias lifting of the newspaper ban in February but also said the government "must do more to guarantee media freedom going forward."	U-Amnesty uncome abantu baseTanzania ngokususa ukuvalwa kwephephandaba ngoFebruwari kodwa wathi urhulumente "kufuneka enze okungakumbi ukuqinisekisa inkululeko yeendaba ukuya phambili."
A free press, Ebole told VOA, "would mean Tanzanians looking into the future with most hope in terms of expressing themselves and getting information – and information that would benefit them in all aspects of their lives, whether its economic, social and cultural."	Umshicileli wamahhala, u-Ebole uxelele i-VOA, "kuya kuthetha ukuba amaTanzania ajonge kwixesha elizayo ngethemba elikhulu malunga nokuzibonakalisa kunye nokufumana ulwazi - kunye nolwazi oluya kubazuzisa kuzo zonke iinkalo zobomi babo, nokuba yeyoqoqosho, intlalontle kunye nenkcubeko."
We are somehow optimistic, Melo said of journalists and rights activists. But, he cautioned, "the laws are still there, really draconian laws.	“Ngandlela ithile sinethemba,” utshilo uMelo ngeentatheli nabalwela amalungelo. Kodwa, ulumkise ngelithi, “imithetho isekhona, imithetho engqongqo ngokwenene.
If they are not amended, they can be used by anyone who is against us."	Ukuba azilungiswanga, zinokusetyenziswa nguye nabani na ochasene nathi.
Separately, a Tanzanian government spokesman told VOA that measures could be loosened – to a point.	Ngokwahlukileyo, isithethi sikarhulumente waseTanzania sixelele iVOA ukuba amanyathelo anokukhululwa - kwinqanaba.
You cannot have a profession without rules to govern, like a tire moving without any control, spokesman Greyson Msigwa said in a recent interview.	“Awunakuba nomsebenzi ongenamithetho olawulayo, njengetayara elihamba ngaphandle kokulilawula,” utshilo uGreyson Msigwa kudliwano-ndlebe lwakutsha nje.
We must reach a place that we all agree that we need to protect the interests of media and the people as well.	“Kufuneka sifikelele kwindawo apho sonke sivumelana ukuba kufuneka sikhusele umdla wamajelo eendaba nabantu ngokunjalo.
	
Extremist Rebels Launch Deadly Attack in Northeast Nigeria	Abavukeli abaneembono ezibaxiweyo baqalisa uhlaselo olubulalayo kuMntla-mpuma weNigeria.
Islamic extremist rebels have killed at least seven people in an attack in northeast Borno state in Nigeria, witnesses told The Associated Press on Wednesday.	Abavukeli abangamaSilamsi abaneengcwangu babulale abantu abasixhenxe ubuncinci kuhlaselo olukumantla mpuma weBorno eNigeria, amangqina axelele I-Associated Press ngoLwesithathu.
The rebels attacked Kautukari village in the Chibok area of Borno on Tuesday evening, said residents.	Abavukeli bahlasele ilali yaseKautukari kwingingqi yaseChibok eBorno ngorhatya lwangoLwesibini, batsho abahlali.
The attack happened at the same time that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was in the state to meet with survivors of jihadi violence.	Olu hlaselo lwenzeka ngaxesha linye apho unobhala-jikelele we-UN u-Antonio Guterres wayekurhulumente ezokudibana nabasinde kubundlobongela be-jihadi.
The Chibok area is 115 kilometers (71 miles) away from Maiduguri, the state capital, where Guterres met with former militants being reintegrated into society and thousands of people displaced by the insurgency.	Indawo yaseChibok ikwiikhilomitha ezili-115 (iimiles ezingama -71) ukusuka eMaiduguri, ikomkhulu likarhulumente, apho uGuterres wadibana khona nababesakuba ngabavukeli baphinda badityaniswa kuluntu kunye namawakawaka abantu abagxothwayo ngenxa yovukelo.
They came in large number with superior firepower (and) took over the community, said Hassan Chibok, a community leader.	“Beze ngobuninzi babo benamandla omlilo aphezulu (kwaye) baluthatha uluntu,” utshilo uHassan Chibok, inkokeli yabahlali.
Troops from a nearby military base were deployed to repel the attack but "the damage had been done," Chibok said, adding that "casualties are up to 10."	Amajoni asuka kwisikhululo somkhosi esikufutshane aye abekwa ukuba athintele uhlaselo kodwa "umonakalo wenziwe," utshilo uChibok, esongeza ukuba "amaxhoba afikelela kwi-10."
Another resident Yana Galang said at least seven people were killed in the latest violence before the Nigerian military intervened.	Omnye umhlali u-Yana Galang uthe abantu abasixhenxe babulewe kubundlobongela bamva nje ngaphambi kokuba kungenelele umkhosi waseNigeria.
Nigerian police did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of the attack.	Amapolisa aseNigeria awazange aphendule ngokukhawuleza kwisicelo sokuqinisekisa ngohlaselo.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with 206 million people, continues to grapple with a 10-year-old insurgency in the northeast by Islamic extremist rebels of Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State West Africa Province.	INigeria, ilizwe laseAfrika elinabantu abaninzi abazizigidi ezingama-206, liyaqhubeka nokulwa novukelo oluneminyaka eyi-10 kumntla-mpuma ngabavukeli benkolo yamaSilamsi beBoko Haram kunye nehlumelo layo, i-Islamic State West Africa Province.
The extremists are fighting to establish Shariah law and to stop Western education.	Ababantu baneembono ezibaxiweyo balwela ukuseka umthetho weShariah nokuyekisa imfundo yaseNtshona.
More than 35,000 people have died and millions have been displaced by the extremist violence, according to the U.N. Development Program.	Bangaphezu kwama-35,000 abantu abaye bafa kwaye izigidi ziye zashiya amakhaya ngenxa yogonyamelo olugqithiseleyo, ngokutsho kweNkqubo yoPhuhliso ye-UN.
Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said earlier this week that the war against the extremists is "approaching its conclusion," citing continued military airstrikes and the mass defection of thousands of the fighters, some of whom analysts say are laying down their arms because of infighting within the jihadi group.	Umongameli waseNigeria u-Muhammadu Buhari uthe ekuqaleni kwale veki ukuba imfazwe echasene nee-extremes "isondela esiphelweni," ecaphula uhlaselo lwasemkhosini oluqhubekayo kunye nokuvukela kwamawakawaka abahlalutyi, abathi abanye abahlalutyi babeka phantsi izixhobo zabo ngenxa yokulwa ngaphakathi. iqela lejihadi.
The violence, however, continues in border communities and areas closer to the Lake Chad region, the stronghold of the Islamic State-linked group, ISWAP.	Ubundlobongela, nangona kunjalo, buyaqhubeka kwiindawo ezihlala kwimida kunye neendawo ezikufutshane nommandla weLake Chad, inqaba yeqela le-Islamic State-linked, i-ISWAP.
Things are getting worse in Kautukari village in Chibok and adjourning areas closer to the forest, said community leader Chibok, saying the extremists' presence near the forest is a contributing factor.	“Izinto ziya zibambi kakhulu” kwilali yaseKautukari eChibok nakwindawo ezimiyo kufutshane nehlathi, itshilo inkokeli yabahlali uChibok, isithi ubukho babaxhwila kufutshane nehlathi bungunobangela.
	
Reporting Under Attack in South Sudan, Sudan.	Ukunika ingxelo phantsi kohlaselo eSouth Sudan, eSudan.
Journalists in both Sudan and South Sudan say threats, intimidation and arbitrary arrests are part of everyday life, limiting their ability to inform the public.	Iintatheli zaseSudan naseSouth Sudan zithi izoyikiso kunye nokubanjwa ngokungekho mthethweni yinxalenye yobomi bemihla ngemihla, okubangela kunciphe amandla abo okwazisa uluntu.
South Sudan ranks 128th and Sudan ranks 151st out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders annual World Press Freedom Index, released Tuesday to coincide with the United Nations annual recognition of World Press Freedom Day.

Irene Ayaa of the Association for Media Development in South Sudan says government censorship in her country is widespread.	U-Irene Ayaa woMbutho woPhuhliso lweMedia eSouth Sudan uthi ukujongwa kukarhulumente kwilizwe lakhe kuxhaphakile.
Last month, we registered four articles removed from newspapers, she said.	“Kwinyanga ephelileyo, sibhalise amanqaku amane asuswe kumaphephandaba,” utshilo.
Between January and March alone, security personnel removed dozens of articles from the Juba Monitor, Anna Namiriano, editor-in-chief of an English-language daily, told South Sudan in Focus.

They removed stories and we left the space blank. 	“Bawasuse amabali saza sashiya indawo ingenanto.
They say why we are not listening to them, so on 17th of March, they suspended the newspaper."	Batsho ukuba kutheni singabamameli, ngoko nge-17 kaMatshi, balinqumamisa eli phephandaba.
In February, a handful of journalists were briefly detained for covering a press conference by opposition lawmakers in parliament.	NgoFebruwari, iqaqobana leentatheli liye labanjwa ngokufutshane ngenxa yokuthetha ngenkomfa yabezomthetho abaphikisayo epalamente.

We dont have freedom of the press in the country, Namiriano said.	“Asinayo inkululeko yeendaba kweli lizwe,” utshilo uNamiriano.
The solution is let us do our work as media houses. We have the code of conduct, we have the media law to guide us, and removal of stories is really very bad.	“Isisombululo kukuba masenze umsebenzi wethu njengamaziko eendaba.

I say, 'according to the law,' because there is nothing absolute in this world," Makuei told South Sudan in Focus.	Ndithi, 'ngokomthetho,' kuba akukho nto iqinisekileyo kweli hlabathi, "uMakuei uxelele iSouth Sudan kuFocus.
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights refutes that assertion.	IKomishoni YeZizwe Ezimanyeneyo Yamalungelo Abantu iyakukhaba oko.
In a report issued last October, it said the government is harassing activists, journalists and their families, limiting their activities and targeting their work and finances.	Kwingxelo ekhutshwe ngo-Okthobha odlulileyo, yathi urhulumente uhlukumeza abagqugquzeli, intatheli kunye neentsapho zabo, ukunciphisa imisebenzi yabo kunye nokujolisa umsebenzi wabo kunye nemali.
South Sudan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, according to the commission.	ISouth Sudan yenye yezona ndawo ziyingozi kwihlabathi ukuba yintatheli, ngokwekhomishini.

We have seen some of the local radio stations shut down over very trivial matters, Renz said. "And we also are aware that journalists of radio and television and even social media are self-censored" and wary of local and national governments actions "to penalize journalists who say things the government would prefer that they not say."	“Sizibonile ezinye izikhululo zikanomathotholo zalapha ekhaya zivaliwe ngenxa yezinto ezingenamsebenzi,” utshilo uRenz.

UShoggi Abdulazeem, intatheli ephandayo eSudan, uthe wafumana isoyikiso sokufa ngoNovemba kwaye walumkiswa ukuba angathethi namajelo eendaba ehlabathi.

They surrounded my car," Abdulazeem said.	“Bayirhangqa imoto yam,” utshilo u-Abdulazeem.
He told South Sudan in Focus he was blindfolded and moved around "for more than two hours" and was ordered "not to criticize the military again."	Uxelele iSouth Sudan kuFocus ukuba wayevalwe amehlo kwaye ejikeleziswa "isithuba esingaphezu kweeyure ezimbini" kwaye wayalelwa ukuba "angaphinde agxeke umkhosi."
Covering pro-democracy protests in Sudan continues to be a dangerous endeavor, Abdulazeem said.	Ukugubungela uqhanqalazo lwe-pro-demokhrasi eSudan isengumzamo onobungozi, utshilo u-Abdulazeem.
Many newspapers, TV channels and radio stations received directives not to host or conduct interviews with some named individuals who criticize military leaders, Abdulazeem said.	Amaphephandaba amaninzi, izitishi zikamabona kude kunye nezikhululo zikanomathotholo zifumene imiyalelo yokuba mazingabamba okanye aqhube udliwano-ndlebe nabantu abathile abagxeka iinkokeli zomkhosi, utshilo u-Abdulazeem.

"They are targeting freedom of speech with so much excessive force, Assamani said.	“Bajonge inkululeko yokuthetha ngamandla agqithisileyo,” utshilo u-Assamani.
"The majority of our journalists now are fearful and their lives are in danger. 	“Uninzi lweentatheli zethu ngoku ziyoyika kwaye ubomi bazo busesichengeni.
Most of them remain anonymous due to the danger of the situation."	Uninzi lwabo luhlala lungaziwa ngenxa yobungozi bale meko. "

A letter from the Information Ministry to the director of Al Jazeera television in Sudan attributed the closing to an "unprofessional approach" and media content that "harmed the countrys higher interests and national security."

The African Union, the Somali government and the embassy of the United States in Mogadishu have all strongly condemned the al-Shabab attack.	IManyano yeAfrika, urhulumente waseSomalia kunye nonozakuzaku waseMelika eMogadishu bonke balugxeke kabukhali uhlaselo lwe-al-Shabab.

South Africa Urges Africa’s First COVID-19 Vaccine Plant to Keep Its Doors Open	UMzantsi Afrika Ubongoza iZiko lokuqala lase-Afrika lokugonya i-COVID-19 ukuba ligcine iingcango zaso zivulekile
South African health officials are urging COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Aspen to keep its plant in the Eastern Cape province open.	Amagosa ezempilo eMzantsi Afrika abongoza umenzi wesitofu sokugonya i-COVID-19 i-Aspen ukuba igcine isityalo sayo sivulekile kwiphondo leMpuma Koloni.
This follows a Reuters article quoting Aspens senior director saying they may have to shut down as there have been no orders for their rebranded COVID vaccine.	Oku kulandela inqaku leReuters licaphula umlawuli omkhulu wakwa-Aspens esithi kungafuneka bavale njengoko kungakhange kubekho zi-odolo zesitofu sabo sogonyo se-COVID.
A South African-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Aspen struck a deal with American company Johnson & Johnson in March to package, price, sell and distribute its vaccine in Africa.	Inkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika ephantsi kwenkampani enkulu samayeza i-Aspen yenze isivumelwano nenkampani yaseMelika iJohnson & Johnson ngoMatshi yokupakisha, ixabiso, ukuthengisa kunye nokusasaza isitofu sayo sokugonya e-Afrika.
This vaccine was rebranded as Aspenovax.	Esi sitofu sathiywa ngokutsha njenge-Aspenovax.
The move was hailed by many as there had been much concern about Africas reliance on imported vaccines which were often costly and at times in short supply.	Eli nyathelo liye lanconywa ngabaninzi njengoko bekukho inkxalabo enkulu malunga nokuxhomekeka kweAfrika kumayeza ogonyo asuka kumazwe angaphandle ebesoloko eneendleko kwaye ngamanye amaxesha enqongophele.
But there have been no orders for Aspenovax.	Kodwa akukhange kubekho ziodolo ze-Aspenovax.
South Africas National Health Department Spokesperson Foster Mohale said the lack of orders is due to low vaccination rates not only at home, but globally.	Isithethi seSebe lezeMpilo kuzwelonke eMzantsi Afrika uFoster Mohale uthe ukunqongophala kwee-odolo kungenxa yamazinga aphantsi okugonya kungekuphela nje ekhaya, kodwa kwihlabathi jikelele.
Vaccine hesitancy is one of the factors which contribute to these low vaccination rates or demand for more vaccines which also affect the production. 	“Ukuthandabuza kugonyo yenye yezinto ezinegalelo kula mazinga aphantsi ogonyo okanye imfuno yogonyo engaphezulu echaphazela imveliso.
Because obviously we understand that they are in a business, they cant keep on producing vaccines when they know that the demand for vaccines is very low.	Kuba ngokucacileyo siyaqonda ukuba abakwishishini, abakwazi ukuqhubeka bevelisa izitofu zokugonya xa besazi ukuba imfuno yogonyo iphantsi kakhulu.
So, we understand the situation where they are, and we sympathize with them," he said.	Ke, siyayiqonda imeko abakuyo, kwaye siyavelana nabo,” utshilo.
Mohale said for now, South Africa has enough vaccines.	UMohale uthe okwangoku, uMzantsi Afrika unezitofu ezaneleyo.
He adds that in March, 100,000 vaccines expired.	Wongeza ngelithi ngoMatshi, amayeza ogonyo ayi-100,000 aphelelwe lixesha.
And more are due to expire in June and July.	Kwaye ngaphezulu kulindeleke ukuba ziphelelwe ngoJuni nangoJulayi.
However, he said that Aspens vaccine plant is important because no one knows what the future holds.	Nangona kunjalo, uthe isityalo sokugonya i-Aspens sibalulekile kuba akukho mntu waziyo ukuba ikamva lisiphathele ntoni.
We will try to engage them not to rush their decision precisely because we anticipate especially our scientists, our epidemiologists, we anticipate that the fifth wave might hit the country, South Africa, during the winter season which is a few weeks away from now. 	Siza kuzama ukuthetha nabo ukuba bangasingxameli isigqibo sabo ngokuchanekileyo kuba silindele izazinzulu zethu, iingcali zethu zezifo, ukuba iliza lesihlanu lingabetha ilizwe loMzantsi Afrika ngexesha lasebusika elisele kwiiveki ezimbalwa ukusuka ngoku.
As you can see the number of daily COVID-19 patients has been rising for the past seven days," he said.	Njengoko ubona inani lezigulana ze-COVID-19 zemihla ngemihla zinyuka kwezi ntsuku zisixhenxe zidlulileyo,”utshilo.
Professor Petro Terblanche, who is the managing director of South African company, Afrigen, which in a continent-first made an mRNA COVID vaccine using Modernas data — said the situation at Aspen is a tragedy for the industry.	Unjingalwazi uPetro Terblanche, ongumlawuli wenkampani yaseMzantsi Afrika, i-Afrigen, ethe kwilizwekazi lokuqala yenza isitofu sokugonya i-mRNA COVID isebenzisa Idatha yeModernas - uthe imeko yase-Aspen yintlekele kwishishini.
This is just indicating again how important it is that this continent looks at policy reform. 	“Oku kubonisa kwakhona indlela ekubaluleke ngayo ukuba eli lizwekazi lijonge uhlengahlengiso lomgaqo-nkqubo.
This is about how are we going to make sure that we give preferential procurement to local companies.	Oku kumalunga nendlela esiza kuqinisekisa ngayo ukuba sinikezela ngokukhethekileyo kwiinkampani zasekhaya.
How are we going to make sure that we create a marketplace and eco-system that will absorb local capacity?	Siza kuqinisekisa njani ukuba sivelisa indawo yokuthengisa kunye ne-nkqubo yendalo eya kuthatha umthamo wasekhaya?
Otherwise, we will not have capacity locally in a sustainable manner and were going to get the next pandemic and we will be unprepared, and we will not have health security," said Terblanche.	Ngaphandle koko, asiyi kuba nomthamo wasekhaya ngendlela ezinzileyo kwaye siyakufumana ubhubhane olandelayo sibe singalungiselelanga, kwaye asiyi kuba nokhuseleko lwezempilo, ”utshilo uTerblanche.
She believes money should also be put into educating people on the importance of vaccines.	Ukholelwa ukuba imali kufuneka ifakwe ekufundiseni abantu ngokubaluleka kwezitofu zokugonya.
We need to ensure that we also put effort into advocacy for vaccination. 	“Kufuneka siqinisekise ukuba sikwabeka iinzame zokuxhasa ugonyo.
Because we now have 17% of the continent that is vaccinated.	Kaloku ngoku sine-17% yelizwekazi eligonyiweyo.
We need to get them to at least 40% to ensure that we fully arrest this pandemic," she said.	Kufuneka sibenze bafikelele kwi-40% ubuncinci ukuqinisekisa ukuba siwubamba ngokupheleleyo lo bhubhani, utshilo.
Mohale was unable to say when the Health Department would be meeting with Aspens executives.	UMohale akakwazanga ukuchaza ukuba iSebe lezeMpilo lizakuhlangana nini nabaphathi baseAspens.
	
Disinformation, Censorship, Trigger Global Retreat of Press Freedom.	I-Disinformation, i-Censorship, i-Trigger i-Global Retreat ye-Press Freedom.
Led by the Kremlin's example, a global rise in disinformation and propaganda is having a disastrous effect on independent news around the world, a new report finds.	Ikhokelwa ngumzekelo we-Kremlin, ukunyuka kolwazi olungelulo kunye ne-propaganda ehlabathini kunempembelelo embi kwiindaba ezizimeleyo kwihlabathi jikelele, ngokwengxelo yeendaba.
In its 2022 World Press Freedom Index released Tuesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has contributed vastly to the spread of fake news and propaganda.	Kwi-World Press Freedom Index ka-2022 ekhutshwe ngoLwesibini, iiNtatheli ezisekwe eParis ngaphandle kwemida (RSF) zathi ukuhlasela kweRussia eUkraine kube negalelo elikhulu ekusasazeni iindaba zobuxoki kunye nobuxoki.
The journalism watchdog group said its findings are worrying, as they show deep divisions among media within countries and between countries at the international level.	Iqela elijonga ubuntatheli lithe iziphumo zalo ziyaxhalabisa, njengoko zibonisa iyantlukwano enzulu phakathi kwamajelo eendaba kumazwe naphakathi kwamazwe akwinqanaba lehlabathi.
In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new, said Clayton	Ngo-2022, ayinakuphikiswa into yokuba ukuchasana kwemithombo yeendaba kunye nesiphithiphithi solwazi siphembelela iyantlukwano ekuhlaleni ngeendlela ezintsha,” utshilo uClayton.
Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA.	Weimers, usekela-mlawuli we-RSF e-United States, uxelele i-VOA.
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.	Uthe ukuxhaphaka kweendaba zamaqela kwihlabathi jikelele kufike ngeendleko zobuntatheli obuyinyani.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism.	Ingxelo yonyaka yeli qela ibala amazwe ali-180 ngokusekelwe kwimekobume yobuntatheli obuzimeleyo.
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.	Kulo nyaka, nangona kunjalo, iRSF ithe isebenzise indlela entsha edibanisa iimeko zelizwe ngalinye kwezopolitiko, ezomthetho, ezoqoqosho, ezentlalo kunye nokhuseleko.
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom.	Ngoku, isalathiso sichaza irekhodi lamazwe angama-28 "njengenkululeko embi kakhulu yeendaba.
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.	Elo qela libandakanya i-China, ethumela ugcino-mthetho ngaphaya kwemida yalo ngelixa ikhulisa inkohliso ye-Kremlin malunga nemfazwe etshabalalisayo yaseRussia ngokuchasene neUkraine.
	
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war."	Ukusukela ekuhlaseleni kwayo i-Ukraine nge-24 kaFebruwari, iRussia ifune ulawulo olupheleleyo malunga neendaba, ipasisa umthetho omtsha othwala iminyaka eli-15 entolongweni ngokuxela "iindaba zobuxoki" ngomkhosi, kwaye iyakwalela ukubiza kongquzulwano lwayo ne Ukraine ukuba "yimfazwe."
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.	Oko kunyanzelise uninzi lweendaba eziseleyo ezizimeleyo, kubandakanya iphephandaba elidumileyo leNovaya Gazeta, unomathotholo we-Ekho Moskvy kunye ne-Dozhd TV, ukuba bavale okanye bahambe ngaphandle kweRussia ukuze baqhubeke nokusebenza.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.	Ukungabikho kwamazwi azimeleyo, iingcali zithi, urhulumente waseRussia ukwazile ukusasaza usasazo ngepropaganda ethoba ubunzulu bemfazwe kwaye isasaze izizathu zobuxoki malunga nohlaselo lweKremlin.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.	Ingcinezelelo yamajelo eendaba yiRassia ime kwi-155 kumazwe angama-180 afakwe kwi-RSF index, apho enye ikhululekile kwaye i-180 ngeyona ingakhululekanga.
It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia, Clayton said.	Kukhuselekile ukuthetha ngoku ukuba amajelo eendaba akhululekileyo yinto yakudala eRussia, utshilo uClayton.
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.	Kuyo yonke iminyaka engama-22 kaMongameli waseRussia uVladimir Putin elawula, iMoscow ibijolise kwiintatheli kunye nakumaphephandaba azimeleyo, utshilo.
But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia, Clayton said.	Kodwa ukusukela oko kwahlaselwa iUkraine, kubonakala ngathi uPutin uwagqibile amajelo eendaba azimeleyo kwaphela eRussia, utshilo uClayton.
At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine.	Okwangoku, akunakwenzeka ukunika ingxelo echanekileyo ngemfazwe yaseUkraine.
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.	I-China ibeke indawo ye-175 kwingxelo entsha. Kwaye ngoku iphantsi kwempembelelo yeBeijing, iHong Kong iphinde yabhalisa ukwehla okumangalisayo, ikwindawo ye-148 kwi-180 kulandela uhlaselo olude lokubanjwa kunye nokuvala iindawo zeendaba zedemokhrasi.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention.	Ifayile yelizwe le-RSF e-China ithi ngoyena mgcini-mabanjwa omkhulu weendaba emhlabeni, kunye ne-120 eluvalelweni.
The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive."	Ulawulo lusebenzisa ukunyanzeliswa, ukuxhatshazwa, ukugrogrisa kunye nokucupha ukugcina iintatheli ezizimeleyo kunye nezangaphandle ukuba zinike ingxelo kwimiba ethathwa njenge miba "ebucayi."
President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime, RSF's country file states.	Umongameli u-Xi Jinping, osegunyeni ukususela ngo-2013, ubuyisele inkcubeko yeendaba efanelekile kwixesha le-Maoist, apho ukufikelela ngokukhululekileyo kulwazi kuye kwaba lulwaphulo-mthetho kunye nokubonelela ngolwazi lulwaphulo-mthetho olukhulu ngakumbi, ngokokutsho kwefayile yelizwe ye-RSF.
Rising authoritarianism.	Ukunyuka kokulawula ngegunya
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.	INorth Korea iselelona lizwe libi kakhulu ngokomgangatho liku-180. Kwenye indawo kummandla waseAsia-Pasifiki, izidubedube zezobupolitika, ungquzulwano nokwanda kolawulo-ngegunya olungqongqo kuye kwayitshayela yonke iminyaka yenkqubela.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile.	Ubhukuqo-mbuso lwaseMyanmar lwango-2021 luphawule iminyaka eli-10 yokubuyela umva kumalungelo eendaba, iintatheli zibanjiwe, iilayisensi zemithombo yeendaba zarhoxiswa, kunye neendaba ezininzi ezibuyela elubhacweni.
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.	Phantsi komkhosi womkhosi, iMyanmar, ekwindawo ye-176, yenye yezona ntolongo zinkulu zehlabathi zeentatheli.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.	E-Afghanistan, abavukeli beTaliban bathembisa ngokuyigcina inkululeko yeendaba xa bathatha ulawulo ngo-Agasti ka-2021.
Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence."	Endaweni yoko, i-RSF yathi "ukuhluthwa kwamandla eTaliban kuye kwanda ngakumbi iimeko zeentatheli kunye nemibutho yeendaba, ekujoliswe kuyo kuzo zonke iindlela zokoyikisa kunye nobundlobongela."
Afghanistan ranked 154th.	I-Afghanistan ikwindawo ye-154.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.	Kwi-Afrika iphela, imithetho eyenza ubuntatheli be-intanethi ibe lulwaphulo-mthetho iye yachaphazela ilungelo lolwazi, i-RSF yatsho, ngelixa ukusasazeka kwamahemuhemu, ipropaganda, kunye nolwazi olungelulo ibe negalelo ekujongeleni phantsi ukufikelela kulwazi olusemgangathweni.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index.	E-Ethiopia, imfazwe kwingingqi yaseTigray, kunye nokucima konxibebelwano kunye nokufikelela okuthintelweyo, zezona zinto ziphambili ezibeka ilizwe ku-114 kwisalathisi.
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.	Ummelwane i-Eritrea kunye ne-Djibouti zimbi kakhulu, zibekwe kufuphi nezantsi kwi-179 kunye ne-164, ngokulandelanayo.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.	Amajelo eendaba ase-Afrika ayaqhubeka nokusokola kwezoqoqosho, iRSF ithe luhlahlelo olukhaphayo.
Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks, the group saidClayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.	Ngaphandle kwamaza enkululeko ngeminyaka yoo-1990, kusekho amaxesha amaninzi, amatyala ovavanyo olungekho mthethweni, ngakumbi kwi-intanethi, ngokuvalwa kwenethiwekhi ngamanye amaxesha, ukubanjwa kweentatheli kunye nokuhlaselwa ngobundlobongela, utshilo uClayton.
When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect, he said.	“Xa sivumela isiko lokungohlwaywa ukuba libekho apho oozwilakhe bevunyelwa ukuba baye emva kweentatheli, bazixhaphaze, bababambe, bazibethe ezitalatweni bazibulale, loo nto ibaneziphumo,” utshilo.
It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same.	Iqinisekisa kwa lowo unegunya linye ukuba ayenze kwakhona kwixesha elizayo, kwaye iqinisekisa abanye abasemagunyeni ababukeleyo benze okufanayo.
US is not perfect.	I-US ayigqibelelanga.
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index.	Emva kwexesha lokubona amajelo eendaba ehlaselwa "njengeendaba zobuxoki" ngowayesakuba nguMongameli uDonald Trump, iUnited States yagcina inqanaba eliphezulu le-42 kwisalathiso seRSF.
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.	Oku kubulela kakhulu ekubuyeni kwe-White House rhoqo kunye nezishwankathelo ze-arhente yomanyano.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."	Kodwa i-RSF ithe iingxaki ziyaqhubeka, kubandakanya "ukunyamalala kwamaphephandaba asekhaya, ukuhlukaniswa okucwangcisiweyo kwemithombo yeendaba, kunye nokukhuliseka kobuntatheli ngamaqonga edijithali phakathi kwesimo sentiyo kunye nobundlongondlongo kwiintatheli, phakathi kwezinye."
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.	Izithintelo zikhona, umzekelo, xa kufikwa ekugqumeni oorhulumente bamazwe kunye noqhanqalazo.
We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them.	Siye sifumanise ukuba oku kungenxa yokungahoywa okucacileyo kwemithetho elawula iirekhodi ezivulekileyo okanye iintlanganiso, okanye bayitolika gwenxa.
An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event," said Beth	Umntu utolika ngendlela engeyiyo ukuba intatheli inokubakho kumsitho othile, utshilo uBeth Francesco, umlawuli omkhulu weNational Press Club Journalism Institute.
A few bright spots.	Iindawo ezimbalwa eziqaqambileyo.
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.	Ngaphandle komkhwa wokuhla ngokubanzi, uClayton uthe kukho izinto ezintle.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.	Abanye oorhulumente banikela ngemali kumajelo eendaba ngaphandle kokuphazamisana nemisebenzi yabo, ukuze baqinisekise ukuzimela geqe kwimpembelelo yezobupolitika.
If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media, he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."	Ukuba ujonga phezulu kuluhlu lwethu, ezinye zezinto ezibalaseleyo ngala mazwe anenkxaso-mali eqinileyo kuluntu kumajelo eendaba, utshilo, ephawula ukuba "kubalulekile ukwahlula inkxaso-mali karhulumente kumajelo eendaba kunye nokulawulwa ngurhulumente."
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index.	Amazwe amathathu aseScandinavia - iNorway, iDenmark kunye neSweden - ngokulandelelana eza phezulu kwisalathiso seRSF.
Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.	I-Estonia, eyayisakuba yiriphabliki yeSoviet Union, ikwindawo yesi-4.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.	I-RSF ithe ukusetyenziswa ngokukhululekileyo kobuntatheli kudlala indima enkulu kwiidemokhrasi ezivelayo ezifana ne-East Timor, indawo ye-17, iBhutan, ibekwe kwi-33, kunye ne-Mongolia, i-90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places.	I-East Timor yayililizwe elinomgangatho ophakamileyo, lenyuka ngeendawo ezingama-54.
But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."	Kodwa i-RSF ilumkise ukuba ngenxa yokutshintsha kwendlela yokusebenza kulo nyaka, "kufuneka kuthathwe unonophelo xa kuthelekiswa umgangatho kunye namanqaku ka-2022 ethelekiswa nalawo ka-2021."
	
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms.	Ukubulawa, Ukuvalelwa Kuxhonywe phezu koHlaziyo lwezomthetho lwaseSaudi.
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	ISaudi Arabia ityhala ukuba ihlaziye inkqubo yayo yezobulungisa eqatha kodwa uhlaziyo lugutyungelwe kukubulawa kwabantu kunye nempatho enzima yabachasayo, iphakamisa imibuzo malunga nokuba kungatshintsha kangakanani na.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubukumkani baziwa ngokutolika ngokungqongqo umthetho we-sharia yamaSilamsi, osisiseko senkqubo yawo yokugweba.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Kodwa kwezi nyanga zidlulileyo uye waqhubela phambili nohlaziyo abathi abahlalutyi banokwenza iinkundla zabo zisebenze njengezinye ezikuMbindi Mpuma.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Loo nzame ixhomekeke kuthotho lwemithetho emitsha kwimiba ebuthathaka efana namalungelo oqhawulo-mtshato lwabasetyhini kunye negunya lejaji lokumisela izigwebo zolwaphulo-mthetho.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Yabhengezwa kulo nyaka uphelileyo ngumlawuli we-de facto Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, amanyathelo, kuquka ikhowudi yokuqala yesohlwayo ebhaliweyo, ibonakala ihambelana nenjongo yeSaudi Arabia yokuvula ihlabathi kunye nokuthambisa umfanekiso walo ogqithiseleyo.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Nditsho nabagxeki bayavuma ukuba utshintsho lunokwenza iinkundla zaseSaudi ziqikeleleke ngakumbi, kwezinye iimeko.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Kodwa akukho lindelo lokuba izithintelo kwinkululeko yokuthetha ziya kudamba, okanye inkqubo yomthetho iya kubaphatha ngokufanelekileyo abachasi bakarhulumente.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism."	Kwaye ngaphandle kohlaziyo, abasemagunyeni ngaxeshanye babonelele ngezikhumbuzo zento eyanika iSaudi Arabia igama layo elikhohlakeleyo kwasekuqaleni, ngokukodwa ukubulawa kwabantu abaninzi be-81 ngosuku olunye ngo-Matshi ngenxa yezono ezinxulumene "nobunqolobi."
	
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.	Imithetho emibini emitsha sele yamkelwe yiKhabhinethi yaseSaudi. Omnye ulawula ukwamkelwa kobungqina, ngaphambili ngokwengqiqo yabagwebi.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June.	Owesibini, umthetho wosapho, uza kuqala ukusebenza ngoJuni.
In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Kwinkqubo eqhelekileyo elawulwa ngamadoda, yandisa amalungelo abasetyhini abaqhawule umtshato kwisondlo kunye nokugcinwa kwabantwana babo.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability."	Ebhengeza umthetho omtsha ngoMatshi, iNkosana uMohammed yathi imele "inqanaba eliphezulu lomgangatho" kumalungelo abasetyhini kunye "nozinzo lwentsapho."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Uhlaziyo lubonakala njengenxalenye yokubonelela iifemu zangaphandle ezityalwa imali kubukumkani, utshilo uAdel al-Saeed, usekela mongameli weEuropean Saudi Organization for Human Rights.
	
The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image, he said.	“Abanikazi bongxowankulu bayakoyika ukutyala imali kweli lizwe, elidume kakubi kwicala lezomthetho, ngoko le mithetho yenzelwe ukutshintsha umfanekiso,” utshilo.
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Umgaqo omtsha wezohlwayo, osaza kutyhilwa, unokuzisa utshintsho olukhulu ngakumbi.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Ngaphantsi kwe-sharia, uwexuko kuphela, ubusela, ukuvukela, ukuphanga kuxhobile, ukukrexeza, ukusela utywala kunye nokunyundela kuthwala izigwebo ezimiselweyo. Abagwebi bayekwa ukuba bagqibe ngesohlwayo kwamanye amatyala.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University.	Ngekhowudi yezohlwayo, "urhulumente uya kulindela ukuba abagwebi bangathembele kuqeqesho lwabo kwi-sharia kodwa kunoko kwimithetho yomthetho (esekelwe kwi-sharia) evunywe ngurhulumente," watsho uNathan Brown, isazi kwiYunivesithi yaseGeorge Washington.
As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region, said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.	“Ngenxa yoko, iSaudi Arabia iya kujongeka ngakumbi njengenkqubo yomthetho woluntu, njengamazwe amaninzi kulo mmandla,” utshilo uBrown, ofunde ngohlaziyo lwaseSaudi.
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."	Isiphumo kufuneka sibe ngakumbi "ukuqikelelwa," utshilo u-Abdullah Alaoudh, ingcali yezomthetho esekwe e-US kunye nomgxeki karhulumente, njengoko imithetho emitsha "isusa kwi-leeway ... ababenayo abagwebi."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added.	Kodwa ukulawulwa okungqongqo kobukhosi nako "kudala ingxaki enkulu: ukungabikho kokuzimela," wongeze watsho.
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Ukumkani uyintloko yenkundla yaseSaudi kwaye usebenza njengenkundla yokugqibela yesibheno.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Utata ka-Alaoudh, umfundisi odumileyo uSalman al-Awdah, ubanjiwe ukusukela ngo-2017, ebonakala ngathi uyaziphindezela ngeposti ye-Twitter eyayingqubana nomgaqo-nkqubo waseSaudi Arabia ngexesha lokuhlukaniswa kweQatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.	Ungomnye wabaninzi ababanjiweyo kwingxaki ecacileyo yokuchasa kunye nabo banokucela umngeni kumandla kaNkosana uMohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Omnye weyona mizekelo ibalaseleyo ngowayesakuba yinkosana u-Mohammed bin Nayef, umhlobo weCIA ohlonitshwa eNtshona ngeenzame zakhe zokulwa nobundlobongela obugqithileyo, kodwa ngubani owagxothwa nguKumkani uSalman kumgca wokulandelelana.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.	INkosana Nayef ayizange ibonwe esidlangalaleni ukususela kwiingxelo zokubanjwa kwakhe ngo-Matshi 2020. Ukuvalelwa kwakhe akuzange kuqinisekiswe ngokusemthethweni.
	
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.	Kwabachasi bakarhulumente, amatyala anjalo omeleza imibuzo malunga nokuba nguwuphi na umahluko oza kwenziwa luhlaziyo lobulungisa oluqhubekayo.
In my view, this is all window-dressing, said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.	“Ngokokubona kwam, konke oku kukufihla inyani,” utshilo uMadawi al-Rasheed, isifundiswa sase-UK kunye nesithethi seqela eliphikisayo leNdibano yeSizwe eyasekwa ngabathinjwa.
It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer.	Kunzima kakhulu ukubona ukuba yintoni intsingiselo yolu tshintsho ngaphandle kweprojekthi yokubonisa (uNkosana uMahammad) njengomhlaziyi.
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.	Ukuxhoma kuyo nayiphi na ingxoxo yobulungisa kunye nohlaziyo lwezomthetho eSaudi Arabia kukubulawa kunye nokunqunyulwa komgxeki kunye nombhali wemihlathi uJamal Khashoggi kwi-consulate yase-Istanbul yobukumkani ngo-2018.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation.	Uvavanyo lwe-intelligence yase-US yafumanisa ukuba iNkosana uMohammed ngokwakhe "wavuma" umsebenzi wokubamba okanye ukubulala uKhashoggi, nangona izikhulu zaseSaudi ziphika oku kwaye zisithi "ngumsebenzi okhohlakeleyo".
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.	Ngo-Epreli, ngaphambi kokuba uMongameli waseTurkey u-Recep Tayyip Erdogan atyelele i-Riyadh ngoLwesine waza wamkela iNkosana uMohammed, iTurkey yadlulisela ityala ngokungabikho kwabarhanelwa abayi-26 kwimeko yaseKhashoggi eSaudi Arabia.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.	Isigqibo saseTurkey sitsale uqhanqalazo olunxungupheleyo lwamagqwetha kunye nentombi kaKhashoggi, eyanyanzelisa ukuba iinkundla zaseSaudi azinakukwazi ukumisa ityala elinesihlahla.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.	Kwabo banabantu ababathandayo abavalelwa kude, ukubulawa kukaKhashoggi kunyusa uloyiko olufanayo malinga nokuthetha ngokukhululekileyo.
I want to, many do, but we're scared, said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.	“Ndiyafuna, abaninzi bayayenza, kodwa siyoyika,” watsho umhlobo weNkosana uSalman bin Abdulaziz, ovalelwe noyise ukusukela ngo-2018.
Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi.	Wonke umntu uyazi ukuba kwenzeke ntoni kuKhashoggi.
	
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans	IMoroccan Prison Program imisela ukutshintsha i-IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war.	Njengomlwi weqela le-Islamic State oshiye ilizwe lakhe laseMorocco ukuya kuba yinxalenye yento awayecinga ukuba ngumlo ongcwele eSyria, uMohsin uthi wabona yonke inkohlakalo yemfazwe.
A terrifying experience, he says.	Amava awoyikisayo, utsho njalo.
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims.	Ngoku elibanjwa, elineminyaka engama-38 ubudala libanga ukuba akasenguye laa mntu wayenenzondelelo yempambano ngelo xesha, enomsindo wokubulala abantu abangengawo amaSilamsi.
Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.	Ubanjelwe eTurkey waza wathunyelwa eMorocco, uthothoza iminyaka elishumi entolongweni ngezityholo zobunqolobi.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.	Ngoku lo wayesakuba ngumlwi uphumelele kunye namanye amabanjwa ali-14 agwetywe kulwaphulo-mthetho lwenkqubo yase-Morocco yotshintsho enokuthi ibenze bafaneleke ngakumbi ukukhululwa phambi kwexesha.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat.	I-Associated Press kunye namanye amajelo eendaba amenyiwe ukuba abukele umsitho wabo wokuphumelela ngoLwesine kwintolongo eseSale kufutshane nekomkhulu laseMorocco, iRabat.
And to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.	Kwaye enze udliwano-ndlebe namanye amabanjwa phantsi kweemeko ezibekwe esweni nezilawulwayo. Amagosa olawulo lwentolongo akhetha amadoda amathathu athi akulungele ukuba nodliwano-ndlebe.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.	Amagosa amisela ukuba amabanjwa akufunekanga achazwe ngamagama awo apheleleyo kwaye ubuso bawo bungaboniswa, echaza izizathu zokufihlwa kwabo.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.	Kodwa amagosa entolongo akazange amamele udliwano-ndlebe okanye angenelele ukuvala imigca yemithombo yeendaba yemibuzo okanye iimpendulo zamabanjwa.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates.	Amabanjwa ali-15 anxibe iihempe neebhulukhwe ema ngokundilisekileyo ephulaphule umhobe wesizwe waseMorocco kwaye anikwa iziqinisekiso.
Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business.	Amagosa entolongo athi inkqubo yotshintsho yayibandakanya iinyanga ezintathu zokufundiswa ngonqulo entolongweni, umthetho nezoqoqosho, kwaye amabanjwa nawo afumana uqeqesho ngendlela yokuqalisa ishishini.
These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.	Aba basanda kuphumelela bebeliqela lethoba ukusukela oko yaqala inkqubo ngo-2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path."	UMoulay Idriss Agoulmam, umlawuli weSocial-Cultural Action and Prisoner Reintergration kwintolongo yaseMorocco, uthe le nkqubo yeyabo bafunayo kwaye isebenza namabanjwa "ukutshintsha indlela yokuziphatha kunye nokuphucula indlela yabo yokuphila."
It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes, he said.	“Ivumela amabanjwa ukuba aqonde ubunzulu beempazamo zawo,” utshilo.
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence.	Ukuthweswa isidanga kule nkqubo akuwenzi amabanjwa afanelekele ukukhululwa kwangoko, kodwa konyusa amathuba awo okufumana uxolelo lwasebukhosini okanye isigwebo esincitshisiweyo.
That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says.	Kube njalo ngaphezu kwesiqingatha sabafundi abaphumeleleyo abangama-222 ukuza kuthi ga ngoku, utshilo abaphathi bentolongo.
Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act.	Ukusukela ngo-2019, olu qeqesho lunikezelwe kwabasetyhini abagwetywe phantsi koMthetho waseMorocco ochasene nobunqolobi.
Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.	Abasetyhini abalishumi baye baphumelela ukuza kuthi ga ngoku - bonke ukusukela oko bakhululwe, kuquka nabasibhozo abaxolelweyo.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.	Ibizwa ngokuba yi-“Moussalaha,” elithetha “uxolelwaniso” ngesiArabhu, le nkqubo inikezelwa kumabanjwa abonakalise ukulungela ukuchasa iimbono ezibaxiweyo.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012.	UMohsin uthe wemka waya kulwa eSyria ngo-2012.
A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad." 	Njengowayeka isikolo ngethuba wayekwishumi elivisayo, wathi "wayengafundanga kwaye engakwazi ukwahlula okulungileyo kokubi." 
He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."	Wathi watshintshwa ngabantu ababembonisa iividiyo eziyingozi "malunga nembopheleleko yobuthixo yokulwa nabo bangayilandeliyo imigaqo yamaSilamsi kunye nokubulala abangengawo amaSilamsi."
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said. "I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."	ESyria, “ndibone ukubulawa kwabantu, ukudlwengulwa, nobusela,” watsho. “Emva kwexesha ndagqiba kwelokuba umlo owawuqhutywa egameni lamaSilamsi awunanto yakwenza nonqulo lwethu.
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.	Wabalekela eTurkey ngo-2018 kwaye wavalelwa unyaka apho ngaphambi kokuba athunyelwe eMorocco.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.	Uthi ngoku uzichasile iimbono ezibaxiweyo.
That period of my life has passed, he said.	“Elo xesha lobomi bam lidlulile,” watsho.
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups.	Uninzi lwabantu baseMorocco luye lwaya eSyria, eIraq nakwezinye iindawo ukuya kubayinxalenye namaqela aneembono ezibaxiweyo.
Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. 	IMorocco ifumane uhlaselo oluphindaphindiweyo ngokwayo. 
Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.	Uhlaselo lohlobo lokuzibulala lwaseCasablanca ngowama-2003 lwabulala abantu abangama-33. Ngo-2011, ugqabhuko-dubulo lwatshabalalisa indawo yokusela ikofu eMarrakech, lwabulala abantu abayi-17, uninzi lwabo bengabakhenkethi bangaphandle.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.	UAl Mustapaha Razrazi, ugqirha wezengqondo kunye nelungu leProgram's Scientific Committee, uthe phakathi kwabantu abayi-156 abathe bakhululwa emva kokuzimasa ezi zifundo, umnye nje uye wabanjwa esenza ulwaphulo-mthetho kwakhona.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.	Loo mntu ugwetyelwe ityala elingento yokwenza nobunqolobi, watsho. 
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war.

Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage	Iyantlukwano, iimbono ezitsha ziyasetyenziswa kuMbindi Mpuma
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism.	U-Natalia Sancha ebesoloko esamkela indlela yokusebenzisana kubuntatheli.
When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.	Xa eyokwenza umsebenzi wakhe ngaphandle, uthetha nabanye abagubungela ibali elifanayo ngeembono zabo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.	Oku ngokuyinxenye kuvela kumdla wokubalisa amabali angabaliswayo ngokwaneleyo, kodwa njengentatheli yasethyini kwindawo elawulwa ngamadoda, uthi intsebenziswano kunye nokuxhasa amanina asebenza nawo ibisoloko ibalulekile.
I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story, the 42-year-old journalist said.	“Bendikhe ndithethe neentatheli zamadoda nabasetyhini, kwaye bendisoloko ndiqaphela ukuba abasetyhini banembono efanayo, kuba nathi besinamava afanayo ngelixa sibhala eli bali,” yatsho intatheli eneminyaka engama-42 ubudala.
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.	Le ndlela yokusebenzisana yaqala ukusebenza ngo-2020 xa umvakalisi wabuza uSancha ukuba unomdla wokubhala incwadi ngeSyria.
She countered with a better offer.	Wachasa enombono olungcono.
I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect, she said.	“Ndimxelele ukuba ibali elidityanelweyo leentatheli zabasetyhini malunga nommandla obanzi lingaba nefuthe elahlukileyo,” utshilo.
I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense.	Ngendiyibhale ngokwam le ncwadi, kodwa ayinakuba nengqiqo efanayo.
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.	Onemvelaphi yaseAndalusia kumazantsi eSpain, uSancha uchithe iminyaka eli-14 edlulileyo kuMbindi Mpuma egubungela ungquzulwano eIraq, eSyria naseYemen, kwaye enika ingxelo eseEgypt, eLebhanon naseTunisia.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.	Usebenze kutsha nje nesebe lezonxibelelwano le-European Union, emva kokushiya i-Beirut ngenxa yezizathu zempilo kulandela ugqabhuko-dubulo olukhulu olwanyakamisa isixeko ngo-2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to.	Abasetyhini “banamava ahlukileyo kuba besisiya kwiindawo abangaziqhelanga oogxa bethu abangamadoda.
Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA.	Hay ngenxa yokuba sihlakaniphile, kodwa ngenxa yokuba uninzi lwalo mmandla lusengama-Arabhu, amaSilamsi kunye nolwahlulo ngokwesini, "uSancha uxelele iVOA.
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.	Ukuba neentatheli zabasetyhini kunempembelelo, waphawula.
If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict.	Ukuba ndizibeka kwindawo yomfundi, ndingathanda ukuba nomntu wasetyhini ondixelela ibali kuba liza kuba malunga ne-100 yepesenti yabemi, oku kuthetha ukuba uya kuba nengxelo ebandakanya ngakumbi kwingxabano. .
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.	Kwincwadi yakhe, u-Sancha wafikelela kwabanye abafazi abagubungela uMbindi Mpuma, ukuqinisekisa iimbono ezahlukeneyo ezivela kwiintatheli zangaphandle kunye nezasekhaya.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.	Isiphumo sentsebenziswano ephantse ibe yiminyaka emibini yiBullets for All, ekhutshwe ngeSpanish ngoAprili.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said.	Kulencwadi, "sibalisa ibali elinye ngamazwi ahlukeneyo amele bonke abafazi" bendawo, utshilo uSancha.
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war.	Nganye ibonelela ngembono yobuqu malunga nokugubungela amaxesha embali, kubandakanya ukuwa koorhulumente bolawulo-melo, intshukumo yoqhanqalazo edumileyo kunye nemfazwe.
It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.	Ikwavavanya ucalucalulo kunye nokuxhatshazwa kwabasetyhini abajongana nabo kwigumbi leendaba nakwizabelo.
	
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily.	UMaya Gebeily uthi ukuqonda ulwimi nenkcubeko kunegalelo elikhulu ekwenzeni inkqubela kulo mmandla.
The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.	Umphathi we-Reuters Bureau yeLebhanon, iSyria kunye neJordani ngomnye wabanegalelo kule ncwadi.
There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting, she said.	“Kuninzi okuthethwa nokuboniswa ngokwembono yeentathezli zasethyini nazo ezithi ziphenjelelwe ngamakhosikazi athe zadibana nawo ngethuba zisenza ingxelo,” utshilo.
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.	Ozalelwe e-US kubazali baseLibanon, uGebeily waqala umsebenzi wakhe wobuntatheli ngo-2013 kwindawo yeendaba yasekhaya eBeirut, eLibanon. Uqhubekile nokugubungela ummandla we-Agence France-Presse ngaphambi kokujoyina iReuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting.	UGebeily uthe imvelaphi yakhe yaseMelika kunye neLibanon yamnceda ukuba awuqonde ngcono ummandla, nto leyo eye yabumba ingxelo yakhe.
Knowing the local language is an important part of that.	Ukwazi ulwimi lwasekuhlaleni yinxalenye ebalulekileyo yoko.
When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust, she said.	“Xa unodliwano-ndlebe nomphathiswa okanye umntu oshiye ikhaya okanye itshantliziyo, eyona nto ibalulekileyo kukufumana ukuthenjwa ngabo,” utshilo.
If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. 	Ukuba uyakwazi ukuthetha ulwimi kwaye ubenze bazive bekhululekile kwasekuqaleni, oko kutshintsha yonke into.
It grants you a very beautiful kind of access.	Ikunika uhlobo oluhle kakhulu lokufikelela. "
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.	Ukongeza e-Iraq naseLebhanon, uGebeily, oneminyaka engama-30 ubudala, naye uye waya eSyria ukuze apapashe imfazwe echasene neqela le-Islamic State (IS).
Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out, she said.	“Ndibe nenyhweba yokufikelela kwiindawo ezithile zoluntu ngokuthe ngqo ngaphandle kokuba ndisebenze nomguquleli okanye umlungisi, nto leyo ebumba indlela aphuma ngayo amabali,” utshilo.
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.	Intatheli yaseSyria-Kurdish uKhabat Abbas, obhale ngemfazwe yaseSyria, uyangqina ukubaluleka koko.
Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you, she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.	Kukwazi ulwimi kunye nenkcubeko eyenza abantu bazive bekhululekile ukuba bathethe nawe, uxelele iVOA evela eQamishli, eSiriya.
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria ,	Olo lwazi lwanceda xa uAbbas, oneminyaka engama-34 ubudala, ngethuba esebenza ngaphandle noSancha ngoMatshi 2021. Baya kwinkampu yamaKurdish ababevalelwe kumntla-mpuma weSiriya,
And interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.	Babe nodliwano-ndlebe nama-jihadists abhinqileyo anxulumene ne-IS, ngebali e-El Pais.
While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the came refused to talk to them,	“Ngethuba ndandiseQamishli [kumntla-mpuma weSyria], ndadibana neentatheli ezimbini zaseBritane, oogxa bam abalungileyo, ababedanile emva kukaShamima Begum nabanye namanye amanina enkampini ala ukuthetha nabo,
" Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.	”utshilo uSancha, ebhekisa kumfazi oselula owashiya ikhaya lakhe eBritane eneminyaka eli-15 ukuya kujoyina i-IS.
Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents, Sancha said.	Umlungisi wabo wayeyindoda, ngoko ke abafazi be-jihadist abazange bathethe nabo ngenxa yokuba abathethi namadoda. Kodwa ke ndakwazi ukuhlala noShamima kunye nabanye abafazi, abanikela udliwano-ndlebe oluhle ngaphakathi kweentente zabo,  Watsho uSancha.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.	U-Abbas wayenefuthe ekufumaneni ukuthetha nabo bafazi, wongeze watsho.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.	Ngokungafaniyo noSancha kunye noGebeily, u-Abbas wakhulela kwingingqi yaseKurdish yaseSyria, apho kwada kwaqala imfazwe ngo-2011, ubuntatheli babungekho.
Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines, Abbas said.	“Abantu abaqhelekileyo kwingingqi yethu bebeqhele ukubona abantu basetyhini bethatha izixhobo kwaye besilwa, kodwa bebengaqhelanga ukubona umntu obhinqileyo ebambe ikhamera ezitratweni  nangaphambili,” utshilo u-Abbas.
It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues.	Kwathatha ukuzincama okukhulu ukuze ndiqinisekise usapho lwam kunye noluntu ukuba ndilungile, ukuba andingcono, njengabalingane bam abangamadoda.
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.	Ubuntatheli bamtsala umdla kuba ibali loMbindi Mpuma belisoloko libaliswa ziintatheli ezingamadoda, alapha ekhaya nakwamanye amazwe.
The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, 	Ibali alitshintshanga ngenxa yoko, kodwa ukuba iintatheli zasekhaya kunye nezamazwe ngamazwe zabasetyhini bafumana ithuba lokwenyani lokubalisa ibali loMbindi Mpuma, 
that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region," Abbas said.	ibali lingatshintsha, elinokuthi lichaphazele indlela abanye abawubona ngayo lo mmandla,”utshilo uAbbas.
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.	U-Sancha naye ukholelwa ukuba abafazi kwi-journalism banempembelelo kwindlela imiba ejongwa ngayo kwingingqi, kubandakanywa uxinzelelo emva kokuphazamiseka kunye nomphumo onalo kwimpilo yabasetyhini, kunye nezifundo ezifana nobundlobongela kunye notywala.
We talk about all these issues that men normally would not speak about, she said.	“Sithetha ngayo yonke le miba amadoda ebengafuni kuthetha ngayo,” utshilo.

Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program.	Umkhosi wase-Iran wenze isibhambathiso sokuziphindezela kabukhali kulo naluphi na uhlaselo lwe-Israel, esoloko ivakalisa inkxalabo ngenkqubo yenyukliya yase-Iran.
Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.	UTehran uthi le nkqubo yeyeenjongo zoxolo kuphela.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.	I-Israel, ubukho bayo i-Islamic Republic engabuboniyo, kudala isoyikisa ngenyathelo lomkhosi ngokuchasene ne-Iran ukuba iingxoxo phakathi kweTehran kunye namagunya ehlabathi ziyasilela ukunqanda umsebenzi wenyukliya waseIran.

As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Njengoko bambalwa abantu baseMelika abaya eCaweni, ingaba iivenkile zekofu zinako ukuzalisa ililize?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society.	Iicawe kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo ngokwembali bezidlala indima ebalulekileyo yezentlalo nezopolitiko kuluntu lwaseMelika.
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.	Kodwa bambalwa abantu abaya kwiinkonzo zonqulo, kwaye ukuwohloka kweecawe kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo kusongela ukushiya indawo enokuthi ivalwe ziivenkile zekofu.
For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation, says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.	Kwimbali enkulu yaseMelika, icawe ibiyeyona nto ibalulekileyo - okanye amabandla abo ebebalulekile, ebonelela ngendima engachazwanga ekuboneleleni ngentsebenziswano kunye nokunxibelelana eluntwini ... Iziko loPhando kuBomi baseMelika kunye nomntu ophezulu kwiZiko loShishino laseMelika.
It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church, Cox says.	“Ayizange ibe sisenzeko nje okanye ithamsanqa ukuba umbutho wamalungelo abantu uphume ecaweni,” utshilo uCox.
And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important.	Kwaye uyayibona loo nto ngokwenkcubeko ... nokuba kukwiindawo ezihlala abantu abamhlophe ubukhulu becala, kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni, naphi na apho, iicawe bezikade zibalulekile ngokwembali.
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	Iinkonzo kunye nezinye izindlu zonqulo nazo ziye zadlala indima ekuncedeni abantu abavela kwamanye amazwe ukuba bafane bakuba befikile eMelika, utshilo uCox.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.	Ngo-1999, i-70% yabantu baseMelika bathi bangamalungu enkonzo, i-mosque okanye indlu yesikhungu.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%.	Ngo-2020, elo nani lehle laya kutsho kuma-47%.
A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.	Uvavanyo luka-2019 lufumanise ukuba bathathu kwabalishumi abantu baseMelika abathi baya kwiinkonzo zeveki ngeveki.
Third places  Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray	Iindawo zesithathu Ukunqongophala kokubandakanyeka kunye nokuzibandakanya neecawe, iimosque kunye nezindlu zesikhungu kuthetha ukuba abantu banokuphoswa yintoni isazi ngentlalo yoluntu uRay.
Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.	U-Oldenburg ezibizwa ngokuba  "ziindawo zesithathu" - iindawo zokuhlanganisana zikawonke-wonke ezibonelela ngento ethile ekhaya, "indawo yokuqala," kunye nomsebenzi, "indawo yesibini," azingenako zona.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.	U-Oldenburg waxoxa ukuba iindawo zesithathu zibalulekile kubomi boluntu ekuhlaleni.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.	Uphando luka-Okthobha ku-2021 olwenziwa yiAmerican Survey Center lufumanise ukuba iindawo zorhwebo njengezindlu zekofu zikhuthaza ukuthembana kunye noqhagamshelo kuluntu lwaseMelika kwaye inokunceda ukuvala isithuba esishiywe ziinkonzo.
	
If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good, says clinical psychologist Dr.	Ukuba uqhelekile kwindawo yokusela ikofu, umenzi kofu unokuyazi into oqhele ukuyi-odola, kwaye bakwenzele yona, kwaye oko kuvakala kulungile, utsholo ugqirha wolwazi ngengqondo.
Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.	UMaria Espinola, unjingalwazi oncedisayo kwiDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience kwiYunivesithi yaseCincinnati College of Medicine.
It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways, Espinola says.	Kuvakala kumnandi ukuqatshelwa, ukwazi ukuba abantu bakulindele, ukwazi ukuba abantu bakukhathalele, ukwazi ukuba unendawo, kuba imfuno yokuba nendawo kunye nokunxibelelana kwabantu sisidingo esisisiseko esinayo sonke, kwaye kubalulekile. ukuba oko kuzalisekiswe ngeendlela ezahlukeneyo,”utshilo uEspinola.
So, places like third places can allow us to do that.	Ke, iindawo ezinjengeendawo zesithathu zinokusivumela ukuba senze loo nto.
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.	Ngaphambili, iinkonzo nezinye izindlu zonqulo beziyindawo yesithathu kubantu abaninzi baseMerika.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place	Ngo-2019, iipesenti ezingama-67 zabantu abaphononongwayo bathi banendawo yesithathu

That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.	Elo nani lehle laya kutsho kwi-56% ngo-2021 - inani elinokuchatshazelwa sisifo sikazwelonke i-COVID-19.
What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community, says Cox.	“Into esiyifumeneyo kukuba abantu ababenendawo yesithathu banxibelelene kakhulu noluntu lwabo,” utshilo uCox.
They're much more likely to engage in other activities there. 	“Babonakala besenza ezinye izinto apho.
They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."	Bakholose ngakumbi ngabamelwane babo. Kukho uluhlu olukhulu lweziphumo ezilungileyo zentlalo ezidityaniswe nokuba nendawo yesithathu ... kwaye kubantu abaninzi baseMelika, yivenkile yekofu okanye ikhefi. "
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country,	Into iivenkile zekofu ezinayo ezizisebenzelayo kukuba zifumaneka phantse kuyo yonke indawo, kulo lonke ilizwe,
And anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.	Kwaye nabani na ofuna ukuya angaya rhoqo.
And many are open most days of the week.	Kwaye ezininzi zivuliwe iintsuku ezininzi zeveki.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.	U-Cox uthi kwa iindibano ezimfutshane kwivenkile yekofu zinokunyusa imvakalelo yokuba izive unendawo.
I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential, Cox says.	“Ndicinga ukuba zininzi izinto ezinokwenzeka apha, kwaye uninzi lwazo lunezinto ezingekafezekiswa,” utshilo uCox.
But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there. 	Kodwa malunga nento abanokuyenza, kuninzi apho.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.	Ndikhe ndakwiindawo apho iqela elifanayo labantu liza kudlala ichess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees. …	Okanye baneqela labo elingekho sikweni labadlali abathathe umhlala-phantsi. …
They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other. …	Badibana nje, bancokola bancokola baxelelana ngobomi babo. …
I don't know where else they would have gone — maybe a church, but maybe not — to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.	Andazi ukuba bebengaya ngaphi na—mhlawumbi ecaweni, kodwa mhlawumbi hayi—ukwabelana ngolwazi, ukukhuthazana ukuba mhlawumbi babandakanyeke kumsebenzi othile.
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops."	Kwaye ndicinga ukuba le yeyona nto inamandla malunga neevenkile zekofu. "
	
Are COVID-19 Restrictions Stunting Children’s Immune Systems?	Ingaba izithintelo ze-COVID-19 ziyawoyisa amajoni omzimba abantwana?
Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Ezinye iingcali zonyango zivakalise inkxalabo yokuba amanyathelo othintelo lwe-COVID-19, njengokugquma imaski kunye nokufundela emakhaya, anokuthi enze buthathaka amajoni omzimba wabantwana ngokubakhusela kwizigulo eziqhelekileyo zobuntwana.
There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things, says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Zininzi izizathu zokukholelwa ukuba abantwana kufuneka bavezwe kwizinto zokugcina amajoni emizimba yabo enamandla, ukuze ukuba bathe badibana nento eyingozi kakhulu, banamanye amajoni omzimba okunokuthi awele kwaye ancede abakhusele kwezo zinto. Utsho uSara Sawyer, unjingalwazi webhayoloji yemolekyuli, yeselula kunye nophuhliso kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Ekuzalweni, iintsana ezisesichengeni zifumana izilwa-buhlungu ezisuka kunina kubisi lwebele, oluzinceda luzikhusele de zibe nokwakha owazo amajoni omzimba.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up.	Akuyongozi ukuba iintsana ziqalise ukubeka izinto emilonyeni yazo ngokukhawuleza nje ukuba zizuze ubugcisa obaneleyo bokuthatha izinto.
They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. 	“Bayenza loo nto ngenxa yokuba bavavanya imekobume kwaye bakha amajoni omzimba.
That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.	Luphawu lokutshintsha kwezinto,” utshilo uSawyer.
Theyre exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity. 	“Baveza imizimba yabo kwiintsholongwane ngendlela ethile, ekumgangatho wokwakha amajoni emizimba yabo.
So, some people would argue that childhood illnesses, like colds and stomach bugs, build our immunity so that when more dangerous things come along, we're prepared and we don't get as sick from those more dangerous things."	Ngoko ke, abanye abantu banokuthi izigulo zobuntwana, ezinjengokubanda kunye nesisu, zakha amajoni omzimba ukuze xa kuvela izinto eziyingozi ngakumbi, sizilungiselele kwaye singaguli ngenxa yezo zinto ziyingozi."
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ngaphambi kwesifo sikazwelonke, ubungqina be-epidemiology bacebisa ukuba abantwana abakumazwe aphuhlileyo, apho ukuhlanjwa kwezandla kunye nokusetyenziswa kwesicoci sezifo kuxhaphake kakhulu, banokuba namajoni omzimba angaphuhlisiyo xa kuthelekiswa nabantwana abakumazwe asakhasayo abasoloko bedibana neebhaktheriya ezininzi, iintsholongwane kunye nezinto ezinokuthi zenzeke.
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."	Oku kwenza abantwana kumazwe ahambela phambili kwezoqoqosho babe sesichengeni sokuphuhlisa izifo ezizimelayo, ezaziwa ngokuba yi "hygiene hypothesis."
The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor, says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.	“IHygiene Hyphothesis eneneni iyaxabanisa kuba kucingelwa ukuba ukudibana kwethu neentsholongwane ayisiyiyo yodwa into,” utshilo uCody Warren, ugqirha wentsholongwane kunye nogcino lwamajoni omzimba osebenza  kwiYunivesithi yaseColorado Boulder.
A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in. 	“Uninzi lwale nto lunokuchazwa lufuzo, ukutya, kunye nendawo esihlala kuyo.
That also shapes our immune system… it's a real multifactorial thing that we can't fully account for just by wearing masks.	Oku kubumba amajoni ethu omzimba… yinto yokwenyani enezinto ezininzi esingenako ukuziphendulela ngokupheleleyo ngokunxiba iimaski.
There are other things that go into that equation."	Kukho ezinye izinto ezingena kulo mba."
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.	UWarren, utata wabantwana abathathu abancinci, uthi ukuchitha ixesha elininzi ngaphandle yenye yeendlela zokulinganisa izinto ezingalunganga zokuba wedwa.
Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system, Warren says.	“Ukuphonononga nje iintsholongwane kwindawo esingqongileyo kuluncedo [kwaye] nokuqeqesha amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.
Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them. 	“Amajoni ethu omzimba aqeqeshwa ngokutya esikutyayo, okunezinto ezincinci esingaziboniyo kuko.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."	Kwaye ke, ngaphandle kwento yokuba sikhe sabambeka kancinci, diyaqonda ukukuba amajoni ethu omzimba azakubambelela.”
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.	Kukho ezinye izinto abazali abanokuzenza, utsho, ukomeleza amajoni omzimba kubantwana babo ngamaxesha obhubhane.
One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines. 	“Enye yezona zinto zibalulekileyo onokuthi uzenze kukuhlala usexesheni ngezitofu zokugonya.
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.	Le yenye yeendlela ezilungileyo ekufuneka siqeqeshele amajoni ethu omzimba,” utshilo uWarren.
But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress. 	Kodwa kwakhona, okubaluleke ngokulinganayo kukuqinisekisa ukuba abantwana bethu banokutya okufanelekileyo kwaye balawula uxinzelelo.
It's been well documented that both of those — having a good diet, a less stressful environment — can have a positive impact on our immune system."	Kubhalwe kakuhle ukuba zombini ezi-zokutya okulungileyo, indawo ephantsi koxinzelelo-zinokuba nefuthe elihle kumajoni ethu omzimba. "
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.	Nje ukuba amagosa ezempilo karhulumente athi iimaski azisafuneki, uSawyer ucinga ukuba ukukhomba izinto ezintle zokubeka iimaski zethu kunokuqinisekisa abazali abathandabuzayo abanexhala lokugula kwabantwana babo.
Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses, she says.	“Mhlawumbi kufuneka sibe nencoko esidlangalaleni malunga nezizathu ezinokubakho zokususa lo maski, ukuba basesikolweni, kwaye sibuyele kwindawo eqhelekileyo yezigulo zobuntwana ezikhuselekileyo,” utshilo.
The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids aagainst new things that then come along.	Elona cala libalaseleyo lezigulo zobuntwana kukuba banokwakha indlwane ye-hornet yokungakhuseleki enokukhusela abantwana kwizinto ezintsha ezizayo.

Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.	UHathaway uxelele abaphulaphuli ukuba, ngoncedo lombutho wophuhliso, uSanchita wafumana imfundo waza waboleka i-60 yeedola ukuze athenge inkomo aze aqalise isitiya semifuno.

UHathaway wathetha ngobuntwana bakhe kwindawo ekhululekileyo yase-US, kunye nexesha apho wayengazi malunga nohlobo lweemeko uSanchita ajongene nazo nokuba angakanani na amantombazana adinga iindawo ezikhuselekileyo zokufunda.

World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.	Umongameli weBhanki yeHlabathi uRobert Zoellick uthe ukungatyali mali kumantombazana kuyaphazamisa uphuhliso.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.	Wongeze ngelithi, ukufundisa amantombazana kuyavakala nakwiintsapho ezihluphekayo, esithi unyaka owongezelelweyo wemfundo yamabanga aphakamileyo unganyusa umvuzo wabo nge-10 ukuya ku-20 ekhulwini.
If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates, Zoellick said.	“Ukuba bafumana umvuzo omkhulu banokufikelela ngakumbi kulwazi kunye neenkonzo zempilo yokuzala, ngoko ke banokulibazisa umtshato kunye nokuzala, babe neentsana ezisempilweni kwaye bafikelele kumazinga aphezulu okufunda,” utshilo uZoellick.
The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty.	Ubungqina bubonisa ngokuqinisekileyo ukuba utyalo-mali kumantombazana afikisayo yindlela ephambili yokuqhawula iipatheni zentlupheko phakathi kwezizukulwana.

Activists Press for Better Help to End Congo Rapes	Amatshantliziyo anyanzelisa uncedo olungcono lokuphelisa udlwengulo lwaseCongo
As U.N. Special Representative for Sexual Violence In Conflict Margot Wallstrom embarks on a new trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, two activists recently concluded lobbying efforts in the United States for more effective action on trying to end conflict-related rapes in Congo.	Njengoko ummeli okhethekileyo we-UN kubundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo kungquzulwano uMargot Wallstrom eqalisa uhambo olutsha oluya eDemocratic Republic of Congo, amatshantliziyo amabini mva nje aqukumbele iinzame zokuphembelela e-United States ngenyathelo elisebenzayo lokuzama ukuphelisa udlwengulo olunxulumene nongquzulwano eCongo.

She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.	Uthe kwezi meko amanina athathwa njengamaxhoba, kwaye awabandakanyeki ekufuneni uxolo.
Striving for peace in the region.	Ukuzabalazela uxolo kulo mmandla.
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.	UBihamba uququzelela umbutho obizwa ngokuba yiSynergy of Women Against Violence.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work.	Abacebisi kunye neqela baye bahlaselwa kwaye basongelwa ngenxa yomsebenzi wabo.
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.	Xa uBihamba wayesemsebenzini ngenye imini, amajoni aseCongo ahlasela ikhaya lakhe, aza axhaphaza ngokwesini enye yeentombi zakhe.
Bihamba explained that what is needed - above all - is peace in eastern Congo.	U-Bihamba wachaza ukuba into efunekayo - ngaphezu kwayo yonke into - luxolo empuma yeCongo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.	Uthe ukholelwa ukuba izenzo zolwaphulo-mthetho ngokwesondo ziyakwehla kakhulu ukuba umlo uyaphela.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.	Itshantliziyo uDonatella Rostagno, ovela kunxibelelwano lwaseYurophu kuMbindi Afrika, wahamba noBihamba kuhambo lwakhe oluya eUnited States.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.	Uthe uyawuxhasa umsebenzi owenziwa ngummeli okhethekileyo we-UN kubundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo kungquzulwano.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.	U-Rostagno uphinde wathi, nangona kunjalo, uluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe alwenzi ngokwaneleyo ukumisa imfazwe yaseCongo, nangona inomsebenzi omkhulu wokugcina uxolo we-UN apho.
The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict, said Rostagno.	“Ubuninzi bezenzo zenziwa kujongwe iziphumo, kusetyenzwe nabasetyhini abangamaxhoba, kodwa akwanelanga kujongwa oonobangela bodlwengulo nongquzulwano,” utshilo uRostagno.

She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.	Woyika ukuba imeko xa iyonke kwimpuma yeCongo iya isiba mbi kakhulu, hayi ngcono - ngaphandle kokuhoywa ngamazwe ngamazwe - ngabavukeli, amajoni, kunye namajoni avukelayo asaqhuba.
A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us, said Rostagno.	“Uninzi lwala maqela abavukeli aphinde alungelelaniswe, kwaye ade angenele umanyano ngoko ke iintshukumo esizibonayo kulo mmandla, ziyasikhathaza,” utshilo uRostagno.
I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today. 	“Ndicinga ukuba besinethemba kulo mmandla kwiinyanga ezintandathu ezidlulileyo kunanamhlanje.
The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province. 	“Umbutho weZizwe eziManyeneyo uchonge amaqela amathathu axhobileyo adlwengule inkitha yabantu
months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.	kwiinyanga ezimbini ezidlulileyo kuhlaselo oluthathe iveki yonke eLuvungi, enye indawo kwiphondo laseNorth Kivu.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.	Abo babandakanyekayo nguMai Mai Cheka, iDemocratic Liberation Forces yaseRwanda, kunye nabalandeli bomgqakhwe womkhosi, uColonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.	Izindululo zokuphuculwangexesha lokunikela kwabo intetho, amatsha ntliziyo amabini, uBihamba noRostagno, nabo banike izindululo ezibambekayo zokwenza imeko ibengcono.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.	URostagno ucacisile ukuba imibutho yangaphandle engekho phantsi kukarhulumente ifumana inkxaso-mali yokuqubisana nomba wobundlobongela obuphathelele kwezesondo, kodwa imibutho yasekuhlaleni ihlala ingahoywa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.	Uthe izicelo ezintsonkothileyo zokufumana inkxaso-mali yangaphandle zithanda imibutho emikhulu.
They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money. 	Bangayenza nje, bayayithumela, bayayifumana imali.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access," said Rostagno.	Ingxaki kukuba imali kwiimeko ezininzi isetyenziselwa ukuhlawula iindleko ezimiselweyo zombutho, kwimivuzo yabantu abaphuma kwamanye amazwe beza kummandla kunye nelizwe, ngelixa imibutho engekho phantsi korhulumente, abo basebenzisana noluntu, kunye nabasetyhini, nabantwana, ezilalini, abo bafuna imali ukuze baphile ukuze benze umsebenzi wabo abanakho ukufikelela, "utshilo uRostagno.
Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.	UBihamba uthe amajoni aseCongo kufuneka ahlawulwe ngokuthe ngqo ngokutsalwa kwemali ebhankini, kunokuba ahlawulwe ngabaphathi bawo.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.	UBihamba uthe ngokwenkqubo ekhoyo bafumana kuphela isiqingatha sesithathu somvuzo wabo, nto leyo ebangela ukuba amanye amajoni aphange kwaye adlwengule.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice.	Ukwamemelele inkundla yamazwe ngamazwe ukuba iCongo incede ukuphelisa ukungohlwaywa ngokubanzi, kunye nenkundla zamatyala zasekuhlaleni zamaxhoba odlwengulo ukuba afune ubulungisa.
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.	EMantla eKivu, apho abantu abangaphezu kwezigidi ezi-5 baqikelelwa ukuba bahlala khona, uthe kukho iinkundla ezintathu kuphela.
	
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life.	UDesmond Tutu Uthatha umhlala-phantsi kuBomi boLuntu.
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.	U-Desmond Tutu walwa ucalucalulo eMzantsi Afrika, kwaye wayegxeka imfazwe yase-Iraq.
We waged a war that shouldn't have happened, he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.	“Silwe imfazwe ebekungamelanga yenzeka,” utshilo.Ukwathethe ngokubulawa kwabantu eRwanda.

God have mercy on us, he said.The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday.	“UThixo abe nenceba kuthi,” utshilo. Ubhishophu omkhulu waseTshetshi osele esidla umhlala-phantsi ubhengeze ukuba uzakurhoxa kubomi boluntu ngomhla wakhe wokuzalwa.
The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons he said.	“Lifikile ixesha lokuba sithobe isantya, ndisele mhlawumbi iti yerooibos nomfazi wam endimthandayo emva kwemini,” utshilo.
	
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.	UTutu wenyuka kwinkonzo yamaTshetshi eMzantsi Afrika waba ngu-archbishophu wokuqala omnyama waseTshetshi eKapa.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid.	Wayengumgxeka kakhulu urhulumente woMzantsi Afrika owawulawulwa ngabamhlophe kwaye wayekhuthaza ukungaphathwa ngobundlobongela ukuze kupheliswe ucalucalulo.
Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating "a democratic and just society without racial divisions.	UTutu nguye owafumana iimbasa ezininzi, kwaye ngo-1984, wafumana iwonga leNobel Peace Prize ngokumela "uluntu lwedemokhrasi nolunobulungisa ngaphandle kocalucalulo ngokobuhlanga.
 He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa. 	“Wasebenzisa olu lwazi ukuqinisa iphulo lokuchasa ucalu-calulo, ememelela ukuba kugxothwe uMzantsi Afrika kwezoqoqosho.
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.	Emva kokuphela kocalucalulo, uTutu wayibiza ngokuba yimini engakholelekiyo xa uNelson Mandela ephumelele unyulo lokuqala lweentlanga zonke eMzantsi Afrika.
I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world, he said.	“Ndingathi eyona nto iphezulu kum kuxa ndandimi ebhalkhoni ngo-1994 ndisazisa umongameli wethu omtsha kraca eMzantsi Afrika nehlabathi,” utshilo.
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.	Ukunceda isizwe, uMongameli Mandela wonyula uTutu njengentloko yeKomishoni yeNyaniso noXolelwaniso yelizwe.
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.	Eli qela likhuphe ingxelo equka izivumo ezininzi zetyala phantsi kocalucalulo ukuze kuxolelwe.
It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur, Tutu said.	“Yenza izindululo ezithe ngqo malunga nokuba singayihlakulela njani inkcubeko yamalungelo oluntu kunye neziseko zokuqinisekisa ukuba izenzo zenkohlakalo zangaphambili azizukwenzeka kwakhona,” utshilo uTutu.
Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.	UTutu ukwakhankasele ukulwa intlupheko kunye nogawulayo.
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.	Kwiminyaka yakutshanje, uvakalise ukuphoxeka kwakhe kuMzantsi Afrika wasemva kocalucalulo, ingakumbi izinga lolwaphulo-mthetho olunobundlobongela.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.	Ngaphandle kokurhoxa kubomi boluntu, uTutu uthi uzakuqhubeka nokuxhasa isiseko sakhe soxolo kwaye uzakuhlala eyinxalenye yeqela labadala baseburhulumenteni abakhankasela uxolo kunye namalungelo oluntu.
But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly "shut up."	Kodwa uTutu uthi akasayi kuphinda enze udliwano-ndlebe kwaye, njengoko eyibeka, "uvale umlomo."
I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed, he said.	“Ndibe yinxalenye yomzabalazo wethu wenkululeko nedemokhrasi, kwaye ndiyinxalenye yombhiyozo wokuba siye saphumelela,” utshilo.
I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better.	“Ndibe yinxalenye yolawulo localucalulo kwaye ndilangazelela ukuba senze ngcono kakhulu.
Many say his voice will be missed.	Abaninzi bathi ilizwi lakhe liza kukhunjulwa.

The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: "[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents.	Umphathi wesikolo uLuc Deschamps wathi: “[Sivakalelwa kukuba] kubaluleke kakhulu ukuba siyibhiyozele iKrismesi kuba abantwana abanabazali.
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children.	Bahlala nomakhulu okanye umakazi okanye umalume okude, kwaye abakwazi ukwenza imibhiyozo ekhaya okanye ukwenza itheko okanye intwana yeelekese nekeyiki yabantwana.
So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas.	Ke, sinika usuku olonwabileyo lokuba abantwana babhiyozele umoya weKrisimesi.
And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."	Kwaye ikwayindlela yabantwana bethu yokufunda ukupha."
No media source currently available.	Akukho mthombo weendaba ukhoyo ngoku.
Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to "a nice meal" from the students.	UDeschamps, okwanguMmeli oHloniphekileyo waseFrance eMalawi, uthe phambi komsitho ophambili abaxhasi baphathelwe "isidlo esimnandi" esivela kubafundi.
We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables. 	Saba nesidlo esikhulu sasemini kunye nenyama emnandi nerayisi, [isitya esenziwe ngomgubo wombona esibizwa] yinsima, kanye nemifuno.
And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people," he said.	Kwaye yayingabafundi ngokwabo ababephekela wonke umntu isidlo, abantu abangaphezu kwama-500, ”utshilo.

I have eaten, and now I am here dancing.	Ndityile, ngoku ndilapha ndiyadanisa.
What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."	Eyona nto indenze ndanomdla kakhulu sisipho esisifumeneyo ezifana neepuffs, iibhiskithi, umngqusho kunye nomdaniso.
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.	Ubulele abaphathi bezikolo ngokwenza itheko leKrisimesi labafundi abathi kwiimeko ezininzi bangabi nayo imibhiyozo elolu hlobo emakhaya.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.	Omnye umfundi u-Emmanuel Chisale uthe ukutya okumnandi ecaleni, lo msitho umfundise umoya wokwabelana.
This party has brought a change in my life.	“Eli qela lizise utshintsho ebomini bam.

Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015.	Iingcali zezoQoqosho zibona amagingxingxi kwindlela eya phambili kuQoqosho lwaseMalawi ngo-2015.
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate.	Iingcali zoqoqosho eMalawi zithi eli lizwe kusenokwenzeka ukuba liqhubeleke lijongene nemingeni yemali ngo-2015 ngaphandle kokuba urhulumente angaphinda athembeke kubaxhasi, abasabambe umyinge wamashumi amane eepesenti ekhulwini wenkxaso yohlahlo lwabiwo-mali ngenxa yorhwaphilizo olwaziwa njengeCashgate.
More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.	Imali engaphezu kwezigidi ezingama-30 zeerandi yaphangwa kwingxowa-mali karhulumente kulo manyala, yaye abantu abaliqela, kuquka namagosa karhulumente, babanjwa.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the	Ukubanjwa koncedo lwabaxhasi kuye kwanyanzela urhulumente waseMalawi ukuba aphumeze oko kwaziwa ngokuba yiZero Aid budget yesizwe.
2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University	Unyaka-mali ka-2014-2015. Abahlalutyi, abafana noAbel Mwanyungwe, umhlohli wezoqoqosho kwiKholeji yasePolytechnic yeYunivesithi.
of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.	waseMalawi, bathi ukuhla kwenkcitho konakalisa uqoqosho.
This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. 	“Lo ibingunyaka wamagingxigingxi njengoko siphuma kwiziphumo zeCashgate ezithe kratya kuqoqosho lweli.
We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals.	Sibonile ukuba kwiimeko ezininzi amasebe abuthathaka nabalulekileyo kunye nabanikezeli beenkonzo baye bachaphazeleka, ngendlela yokuba asinawo amayeza aneleyo ezibhedlele.
In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time," said Mwanyungwe.	Ezikolweni, intlawulo yootitshala ayifiki ngexesha,” utshilo uMwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	UMwanyungwe ukwayamanise iCashgate nokuhla kwexabiso lemali yaseMalawi, kwacha, okubangele uqhankqalazo lwabasebenzi abohlukeneyo bakarhulumente befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Umzekelo, abasebenzi abanika inkxaso kwiinkundla bezikwisithuba seeveki ezintandathu begwayimba, befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo ngeepesenti ezingamashumi amane anesihlanu ekhulwini nto leyo urhulumente athi akanako ukuyifikelela kuba akanamali.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Abasebenzi beAnti-Corruption Bureau eMalawi baye bagwayimba befuna ukunyuselwa imivuzo ngamashumi asixhenxe ekhulwini de urhulumente wabagrogrisa ngelithi baza kuphulukana nemivuzo yabo kaDisemba ukuba ababuyi.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	UMwanyungwe uthe urhulumente angalunqanda olunye uqhankqalazo ngo-2015 ukuba wenza iinzame zokubuyisela intembeko yabaxhasi kulawulo lwemali karhulumente.
My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, 	“Uloyiko lwam kukuba, ukuba asinalo ukuzithemba kwabaxhasi kunye nenkxaso yabaxhasi ibuyela kuqoqosho, 
We may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation, said Mwanyungwe.	Singanyazela urhulumente ukuba angene kwimboleko-mali yasekhaya enokuthi ikhokelele kwiziphumo ezibi malunga nokunyuka kwamaxabiso, ngokwenzala yemali-mboleko kwaye oku kunokuba nemeko yokuphulukana nokubanjiswa,” utshilo uMwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Abaxhasi, phakathi kwezinye izinto, bafuna urhulumente atshutshise bonke abo babandakanyekayo kulo mbhodamo kwaye omeleze inkqubo yolawulo lwemali.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered	UNewton Kambala, umongameli weMalawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, uthe ihlazo elenziwe.
2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."	U-2014 "njengonyaka ombi kakhulu kwicandelo loshishino, ngenxa yamatyala amakhulu urhulumente awatyala icandelo labucala."
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse."	Walumkisa ukuba, ukuba imeko iyaqhubeka, "u-2015 uya kuba mbi."
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.	Kwintetho yakhe yobume besizwe ngoMgqibelo odlulileyo, umongameli waseMalawi uPeter Mutharika uthe urhulumente wakhe wenza konke okusemandleni ukulungisa iingxaki ezibangelwe lihlazo leCashgate.
My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. 	“Urhulumente wam uqinise inkqubo yezemali ukuqinisekisa ukuba iCashgate ayiphindi yenzeke eMalawi.
We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible," said Mutharika.	Siwasebenzise kakuhle amaziko ogcino-mthetho aquka iAnti-Corruption Bureau ukuze enze umsebenzi ozimeleyo ngokucokisekileyo, atshutshise bonke abarhanelwa, abuyise nezixhobo ezibiweyo apho kunokwenzeka,” utshilo uMutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.	UMutharika ukwathe urhulumente wakhe uphumeza inguqu entsha yezemali efuna ukukhulisa uqoqosho lwelizwe nge-5.5 pesenti ngo-2014, isuka kumyinge we-5.0 yeepesenti ngo-2013.
	
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	IMalawi izakwenza uVavanyo lwe-HIV kwindlu ngendlu
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year.	Abantu baseMalawi banezimvo ezahlukileyo kwizicwangciso zikarhulumente zokuqalisa ngovavanyo lwe-HIV kwindlu ngendlu ekuqaleni konyaka ozayo.
Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily.	Abaxhasi bathi eli nyathelo lifuneka ngokungxamisekileyo kuba abantu baseMalawi abali-100 bayasulelwa suku ngalunye, yaye umlinganiselo we-138 ubulawa nguGawulayo mihla le.
Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	UMphathiswa wezeMpilo uJean Kalirani ubhengeze ezi zicwangciso ngethuba kutsha nje isikhumbuzo soSuku lweHlabathi lwe-AIDS kwisithili esisemantla eKaronga.
We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. 	“Sizakungena ezilalini sicela ukuba sithathelwe igazi ukuze kujongwe ukuba loo mntu akanayo na okanye akanayo na.
And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need.	Kwaye abo baya kufunyanwa bene-HIV ngokuqinisekileyo baya kunikwa ukhathalelo abaludingayo.
And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative," said Kalirani.	Nabo bafunyenwe bengenayo nabo bazolulekwa ukuze bahlale bengenayo,” utshilo uKalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are	UKalirani uthe eli phulo lizakuqala phakathi kuMatshi kwaye liza kujolisa ukufikelela kumntu wonke kweli lizwe kuquka nabantu abakhoyo
far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services.	kude nezibonelelo zempilo ezibonelela ngeenkonzo zokuvavanyelwa i-HIV kunye neengcebiso.
She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030.	Uthe eli phulo lihambelana nenjongo yokuphelisa usulelo lwe-HIV ngo-2030.
Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Umlinganiselo wosulelo lweHIV eMalawi ngoku ukwi-10 ekhulwini, ukwehla kancinci xa kuthelekiswa neminyaka emithathu eyadlulayo.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Esi sibhengezo sinyuse uloyiko kwabanye abantu baseMalawi, abanjengoSteven Jailosi, utitshala wesikolo samabanga aphantsi eBlantyre, ocinga ukuba eli phulo lingaphazamisa ubumfihlo babantu.
I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. 	“Ndicinga ukuba akulunganga kuba baza kuphazamisa ubumfihlo bethu.
HIV testing is supposed to be private.	Uvavanyo lwe-HIV kufuneka lube lolwabucala.
No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them," said Jailosi.	Akukho mntu ekumele ukuba azi ukuba ndiye kuvavanyo lwe-HIV ngaphandle kokuba ndenza ukhetho lokumxelela,” utshilo uJailosi.
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.	U-Ester Makonokaya, unobhala eBlantyre, uthe nangona sele evavanyiwe, uvakalelwa kukuba ukuvavanyelwa intsholongwane kaGawulayo kwindlu ngendlu kuzokophula iimfihlo zabantu.
Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions, said Makonokaya.	“Urhulumente makathathe ezi kliniki zihambayo azise ezilalini apho abantu bazokwazi ukufikelela kuzo bodwa kunokuba baye kuvavanyo emakhayeni abo, kuba loo nto ingathetha ukuba abanye abantu ekungafanelanga ukuba bazazi iimeko zabanye abantu. kuba uyazi ukuba xa umntu evavanyiwe ubonakalisa ukusabela,” utshilo uMakonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed."	UMacpherson Maulana, intatheli yaseBlantyre nokwangumvelisi weenkqubo zikanomathotholo ngezempilo, uxelele iVOA ukuba urhulumente uzokwenza ngcono ukufundisa abantu baseMalawi ngesidingo sokuvavanyelwa intsholongwane kagawulayo ukuze abantu baziyele ngokwabo uvavanyo ngaphandle kokutyhalwa.
I fear it could end up into fights. 	“Ndiyoyika ukuba ingaphelela ekulweni.
You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed.	Uyabona kwenzekile eLiberia mva nje apho abantu ababeze kunceda abantu ekurhaneleka ukuba bosulelwe yi-Ebola bade babulawa.
So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily," said Maulana.	Ngoko ke, imfundo yezoluntu yeyona nto ibalulekileyo ukuze abantu bakhuthazwe ukuba baphume baye kuvavanywa ngokuzithandela,” utshilo uMaulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.	Nangona kunjalo, umcebisi weHIV/AIDS, uDavid Odali, nophethe umbutho i-Umunthu Foundation eqhuba iiprojekthi ezinxulumene ne-HIV, ugxininise ukuba iimfihlo ziza kukhuselwa.
Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. 	Imfihlo iya kugcinwa. Makhe siqwalasele ukusekwa kwekhaya.
I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family.	Ndicinga ukuba into yokuqala iya kuba kukubonelela ngengcebiso yeqela kumalungu olo sapho.
[Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately," said Odali.	[Ewe] abantu banokuvavanywa ngelixa abanye bejonge, kodwa xa kuthethwa ngeziphumo, umcebisi kufuneka aveze ezo ziphumo kumntu ngamnye ngokwahlukeneyo,” utshilo u-Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.	UOdali uthe izakuba kuye umntu ovavanyiweyo ukuba aveze ubume bakhe.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people.	Ngo-2006, i-charity Development Aid from People to People yenza uvavanyo lwe-HIV kwindlu ngendlu kwisithili saseThyolo naseBlantyre, lwafikelela kuma-400,000 abantu.
The organization says it worked well.	Lo mbutho uthi usebenze kakuhle.
	
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi.	Ingxaki yamanzi Iphakamisa uloyiko lwezifo ezibangelwa ngamanzi eMalawi.
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water.	Abantu baseMalawi abakwikomkhulu lezorhwebo lelizwe, iBlantyre, bakholisa ukuxhomekeka kumanzi aphuma empompeni.
But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.	Kodwa kwezi nyanga zintlanu zidlulileyo, iitepu bezisoloko zomile, nto leyo enyanzelise abahlali ukuba bakhe amanzi kwimithombo engakhuselekanga efana nemilambo namaqula, logama kusetyenzwa kwisikhululo sokumpompa amanzi edolophini.
The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.	Umngcipheko wokufumana izifo ezibangelwa ngamanzi uyakhula.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.	EBlantyre neziphaluka, abahlali bachithe iintsuku ezintlanu bengenawo amanzi aphuma etephini.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.	Abasetyhini, abathi ngokwesiko laseMalawi banoxanduva lokwenza imisebenzi yasekhaya, bakhalaza ngeengozi abahlangabezana nazo xa besiya kukha amanzi emilanjeni ekude neendawo zokuhlala.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky.	URhoda Milanzi, umama wekhaya kunye nomama wabantwana abathathu, uxelele iVOA ukuba uhambo oluhamba kwiindledlana zeenyawo lunobungozi..
We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. 	“Sivuka yonke imihla ngentsimbi yesi-2 kusasa, ngamanye amaxesha ngo-1 ekuseni, siye kukha amanzi.
There are so many risks.	Kukho imingcipheko emininzi.
You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us."	Uyabona maxa wambi sasidibana namagqwirha, iinyoka endleleni,” utsho, “neengcuka zazisileqa.
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river.	UMlanzi uthi ukuthomalalisa umthwalo wokuthwala amanzi okuhlamba ekhaya, abafazi bakhetha ukuhlamba emlanjeni.
But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.	Kodwa uthi baye baphazanyiswa lulutsha oluzifihle kumatyholo akufutshane.
These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked. 	“Olu lutsha lwanamhlanje luza kufika apho luzifihle ndaweni ithile ukuze lusibone sihamba ze.
This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.	Oku kuye kwaba lihlazo elikhulu. Ngenene sakhalaza kwiinkosi ngalo nto.
They punished some of them, but you know they would sometimes climb trees just to look at older women like us taking a bath," she explains.	Abanye babo bohlwaya, kodwa uyazi ukuba ngamanye amaxesha bebekhwela emithini ukuze bajonge abafazi abadala njengathi xa sihlamba,” ucacise watsho.
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.	Ingxaki yamanzi ikwachaphazele ukuhanjiswa kweenkonzo zempilo.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.	Kwiiveki ezintathu ezidlulileyo, abasemagunyeni kwisibhedlele iQueen Elizabeth Central eBlantyre baqinisekise ukuba baye banqumamisa ukwenza utyando ngenxa yokunqaba kwamanzi.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.	Abakhankasi bamalungelo ezempilo balumkisa ngokuqhambuka kwezifo ezibangelwa ngamanzi, ngakumbi kwiindawo ezixineneyo, ukuba le meko ishiywe ingasonjululwanga.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station.	Amagosa eBlantyre Water Board abalela ingxaki ikakhulu kwiprojekthi eqhubekayo exhaswa ngemali yi-European Union efuna ukufakela oomatshini bokumpompa abatsha kwi-Walkers Ferry, isikhululo sokumpompa esikhulu.
Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.	UPriscilla Mateyu, osisithethi sebhodi yamanzi eBlantyre, uthi le projekthi kulindeleke ukuba inyuse umthamo wokuvelisa amanzi ukuya kutsho kwi-105,000 cubic metres ngosuku ukusuka kwimveliso ekhoyo ngoku eyi-78,000 cubic metres ngosuku.
January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. 	NgoJanuwari kuxa iprojekthi iphela. Kodwa ukuze oomatshini abatsha nayo yonke enye into iqale ukusebenza kakuhle, kufuneka silinde kude kube nguMatshi [2015].
That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be," Mateyu said.	Kulapho silindele ukuba amanqanaba anyuke kwaye nomthamo wemveliso uphucuke ubeyilento silindele ukuba ibe yiyo,” utshilo uMateyu.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks.	Iqumrhu elijongene namalungelo abathengi basekuhlaleni, iConsumers Association of Malawi, bebeceba ukubamba imilindelo kwibhodi yamanzi de kube yinto eqhelekileyo ukuhanjiswa kwamanzi, kodwa ibhodi yacela abaqhankqalazi ukuba bayeke, bethembisa ukuhambisa amanzi kubahlali ngokusebenzisa iitanki zamanzi ezihambayo.
The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.	Iqela lamalungelo abathengi linike ibhodi yamanzi iiveki ezimbini ukuba ifezekise isibophelelo sayo phambi kokuba iqhube noqhanqalazo.

Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists	Umongameli waseMalawi uphantsi komlilo ngokunika imali kwiintatheli
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre.	Umongameli waseMalawi uPeter Mutharika utyholwa ngokunika imvulophu equlethe i-125 yeedola kubantu beendaba abangaphezu kwe-80 kwisidlo ebesibambe kwinyanga ephelileyo eBlantyre.
The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.	Umhleli weTimes Television yabucala uthe abacholacholi baxelelwa ukuba iimvulophu zinezicwangciso zoomongameli kumajelo eendaba - nto leyo ibigxeka ukusebenza kukarhulumente kwezoqoqosho.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.	Kwikholamu yakhe epapashwe kwiphephandaba laseMalawi iSunday Times, umhleli uGrecian Tukula uthe akaqinisekanga ngesizathu sokuba le mali inikwe iintatheli kwisidlo sikarhulumente.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene."	UTukula uthi uqale wathatha isigqibo sokuyibuyisela le mali kodwa wasirhoxisa eso sigqibo ukuze aphephe “ukuzijongisa.”
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.	Kodwa umhleli wephephandaba iWeekend Nation, uGeorge Kasakula, uxelele iVOA ukuba uyibuyise kwangoko le mali.
I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. 	“Ndavakalelwa kukuba ayifanelekanga ukuba ndiyifumane loo mali, ngoko ndayibuyisela.
My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me.	Ukuqonda kwam kukuba xa umntu endimema kwiworkshop, yindima yabo ukuqinisekisa ukuba uyandondla, uyandihlalisa kwaye uyandithutha.
But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace]," said Kasakula.	Kodwa kule meko, andizange ndibone ukuba kutheni ndifanele ndifumane eso sibonelelo kuba andizange ndachitha nto ukuya eSanjika,” utshilo uKasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.	Lo mba utsale umdla woluntu emva kokuba inkampani yabucala yeCapital Radio yasasaza ibali elibuza ngentsingiselo yemali evela kumongameli.
As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. 	“SiyiCapital FM sisebenzela uluntu.
This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter," said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.	Lo mcimbi ubugcwele kumakhasi onxibelelwano, kwaye nathi njengamajelo eendaba siyachaphazeleka “sikholelwa ukuba kubaluleke kakhulu ukuba siwulandele kwaye sifikelele ezantsi kulo mba,” utshilo uSteven Dakalira, intloko yeendaba nemicimbi yangoku. kwiCapital Radio.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.	Kwikholamu yakhe kwiNyasa Times, unjingalwazi wezomthetho eMalawi uDanwood Mzikenge Chirwa uthe into eyenziwa nguMongameli Mutharika ngokunika iintatheli imali kumsitho weendaba kufana nokunyoba. Ucele uMutharika ukuba arhoxe okanye ajongane nenkqubo yokubeka ityala.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute.	Amaqela oluntu asekuhlaleni athi “ngokuzama ukunyoba iintatheli” uMutharika wadelela isidima sakhe sobunkokeli.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.	Ngeli xesha, ezinye iintatheli zinikela ngemali kumbutho wesisa.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.	UBrian Ligomeka, uMhleli oLawulayo weTimes Group, uxelele iTimes Television ukuba bobane abasebenzi abalapho banikele ngemali kwikhaya leenkedama.
At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children, said Ligomeka.	“Siqale sathatha isigqibo sokuba siyibuyisele kumongameli le mali kodwa sabona bubulumko ukuba sithenge izinto ezahlukahlukeneyo ezifana neswekile, ityuwa, iincwadi zokubhalela sanikezela kubantwana abasweleyo,” utshilo uLigomeka.
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."	Kwikholamu yakhe yamva nje yeSunday Times, uRaphael Tenthani, okwabhalela iBBC, ucele uxolo egameni lezinye iintatheli “ngokuphoxa uluntu ukuba luthembe iintatheli ngokungagodli.
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.	UTenthani ukhuphe le mali yemisebenzi yesisa esithi nangona iintatheli bezinokwenza ngcono ukuba bezinokubuyisela le mali ngoko nangoko, ukwenza njalo bekuya kubonwa njengokungahloniphi intloko yelizwe.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of	UMaclan Kanyangwa, okhokela iSebe lezobuntatheli kunye nezifundo zosasazo kwiKholeji yasePolytechnic kwiYunivesithi yase
Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.	IMalawi, ithe ikhowudi yezokuziphatha yeendaba ithintela iintatheli ukuba zamkele intlawulo ngebali.
Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. 	“Ngokucacileyo indibano eyayisebhotwe yayisisiganeko esibalulekileyo seendaba.
There was a possibility that something was going to be published.	Kwakunokwenzeka ukuba kukho into eyayiza kupapashwa.
And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem," said Kanyangwa.	Kwaye kwimeko apho le ntlawulo inokuba nefuthe kwisigqibo sentatheli [kwisigwebo seendaba], loo nto iba yingxaki,” utshilo uKanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.	UKanyangwa uthe uvakalelwa kukuba iintatheli ezininzi zisilele ukubuyisela le mali ngoko nangoko kuba kusenokwenzeka ukuba zazingekho ezingqondweni xa zazifumana le mali.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful.	Iinzame zokuthetha neGosa likaMongameli weendaba uFredrick Ndala azikhange zibe yimpumelelo.
But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.	Kodwa abanye abaphathi bakarhulumente bathi le ntlawulo ibingesosinyobo kodwa yenzelwe ukubuyisela amafutha kwabo bebezimase umsitho wasebusuku.
	
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty.	Ingxelo: Ukwenziwa kwezinto kunokukhulula izizwe ezihluphekileyo kubuhlwempu.
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Ingxelo entsha yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ikhuthaza amazwe ahlwempuzekileyo emhlabeni ukuba atshintshe ukusuka kwizinto eziphantsi ukuya kwimveliso ephezulu ukuphucula uqoqosho lwawo.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development.	KwiNgxelo yayo yaminyaka le yaMazwe angaPhuhliswanga kangako, i-UNCTAD — iNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo yoRhwebo noPhuhliso – ithi la mazwe kufuneka aguqule ngokwesakhiwo uqoqosho lwawo ukuze akhululeke “kumgibe wentlupheko,” nto leyo edodobalisa ukukhula koqoqosho nophuhliso.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015.	Kwiintlanga eziyi-48 i-U.N. iqwalasela "ILeast Developed Country’s" (LDCs), enye kuphela, iLaos, isendleleni yokufezekisa zosixhenxe iiMillennium Development Goals (MDG's) ngo-2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ngamazwe amane kuphela ase-Afrika - i-Ethiopia, iMalawi, iRwanda kunye ne-Uganda - anokuthi afikelele uninzi lwezi njongo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years.	Olu vavanyo lubi kakhulu ngenxa yemiceli mngeni emikhulu elindele la mazwe kwiminyaka ezayo.
The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015.	I-MDGs ibeke injongo yokuba izizwe zinciphise amanqanaba entlupheko ngesiqingatha ngo-2015.
The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Izinto ezibizwa ngokuba yiSustainable Development Goals, eziqhubela phambili ukusuka apho i-MDGs ziyeke khona, ibiza ukupheliswa kwentlupheko ngo-2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Ngokutsho kukaTaffere Tesfachew, igosa le-UNCTAD elisebenza nezizwe zase-Afrika, akuyi kuba yinto engummangaliso ukuba ii-LDC zikhuphe oku.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Ukuze awona mazwe angaphuhlanga aphumeze lo mmangaliso, uthi kuyakufuneka ukuba atshintshe ngokwesakhiwo uqoqosho lwawo.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Uxelela iVOA oku kuthetha ukutshintshwa kwabasebenzi kwimisebenzi enemveliso ephantsi, efana nezolimo ezincinci kunye neenkonzo ukuya kwimisebenzi eguqukayo enemveliso ephezulu, efana nemveliso kunye neenkonzo zexabiso eliphezulu.
Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, 	“Amazwe anyukileyo ngawo adala amathuba okuba abo bashiya ezolimo bazibandakanye kwizinto apho bongeza ixabiso, apho bafumana uqeqesho nanjengoko kusenzeka, imveliso ithanda ukuba nolo hlobo,
that is why this call for manufacturing, he said.	yiyo loo nto ikhwelo lokwenziwa kwemveliso,” utshilo.
Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better.	Amazwe asebenzisa imigaqo-nkqubo yokutshintsha kunye nokuphembelela inkunzi kunye nabasebenzi ukuba bangene kweli candelo lomsebenzi bavame ukwenza ngcono.
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods.	UTesfachew uthi la macandelo anemveliso ephezulu athambekele ekuhlawuleni imivuzo ephezulu kwaye enze imfuno yempahla.
This, he says, encourages investment.	Oku, uthi, kukhuthaza utyalo-mali.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly.	Ngasentla, kubonakala ngathi ii-LDCs azenzi kakubi.
UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community.	Idatha yezoqoqosho ye-UNCTAD ibonisa ukukhula kula mazwe ahlwempuzekileyo phakathi kuka-2002 kunye no-2008 kugqithise kwiipesenti ezisixhenxe ekujoliswe kuzo ezibekwe luluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe.
And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Kwaye, nasemva kwentlekele yezemali ka-2008, i-UNCTAD iqaphela ukuba ii-LDCs zikhule ngokukhawuleza kunamanye amazwe asaphuhlayo, kumyinge we-5.7 yeepesenti ngonyaka.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain.	Kodwa izazi ngezoqoqosho ze-UN zithi imbonakalo yamazwe angawona aphuhlileyo kwixesha elifutshane neliphakathi ayikaqinisekwa.
They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Bathi ukwandisa imveliso yabantu yeyona ndlela ilungileyo yokuphelisa ukusilela kophuhliso lwabantu kunye noqoqosho oluqhubeka lubarhintyela kubuhlwempu.
	
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals.	I-UN: Uninzi lwezizwe zase-Afrika ziphosakele kwi-MDG Goals ka-2015.
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development.	Uninzi lwamazwe aseAfrika aluyi kufikelela kwiMillennium Development Goals ezimiselwe u-2015 ngenxa yomsantsa phakathi kophuhliso loqoqosho noluntu.
That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.	Eso sesinye sezigqibo salonyaka kwingxelo yonyaka ye-U.N.  kuMazwe angaPhuhlanga kangako, enikezelwe ngoLwesine.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.	UJunior Davis, igosa le-UN lemicimbi yezoqoqosho e-Afrika, uthe amazwe ase-Afrika khange akwazi ukuguqulela ukukhula koqoqosho kwinguqu yezakhiwo.
We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities, Davis said.	“Sicinga ukuba kunjalo kuba la mazwe khange agxile ngokukuko ekwakhiweni kwento esiyibiza ngokuba ngamakhono awo okuvelisa,” utshilo uDavis.
These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. 	“La ngamakhono asisiseko ophuhliso lwabantu noqoqosho afunekayo ukukhuthaza uphuhliso loqoqosho oluzinzileyo.
And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."	Kwaye i-MDG, njengoko yakhiwa, ayizange ihoye ubukhulu becala isidingo sokuphuhlisa amandla oveliso.”
	
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow.	Amazwe ase-Afrika nawo akakho endleleni yokunciphisa intlupheko ngesiqingatha ngo-2015, kwaye inkqubela yawo iyonke ekunciphiseni indlala ihamba kancinci.
Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity.	Ubuhlwempu budodobalisa uphuhliso lomntu kwaye bujongela phantsi imveliso.
And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.	Kwaye uphuhliso lwezoqoqosho luyafuneka ukwenza inzuzo kuphuhliso lwabantu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals.	Yi-Ethiopia, iRwanda, iUganda neMalawi kuphela kwamazwe aseAfrika asendleleni yokufikelela uninzi lweenjongo zophuhliso.
They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.	Benza inkqubela-phambili kuba batyala imali eninzi kwiinkalo ezidala uphuhliso oluzinzileyo olufana neziseko ezingundoqo, ezempilo kunye nezemfundo.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the	I-ajenda yophuhliso yasemva kowama-2015 yamazwe abuthathaka apho ulawulo luhlala lungumba - afana noMzantsi Sudan kunye
Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.	IDemocratic Republic of Congo - isaxhomekeke kakhulu kwinkxaso evela kuluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe ukufezekisa uphuhliso lwentlalo noqoqosho, utshilo uDavis.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said.	Uphuculo kuphuhliso lwasemaphandleni, imveliso yemizi-mveliso, ezolimo kunye namacandelo eenkonzo kula mazwe kuya kufuna "iindlela esinokuthi ngazo sibe nepateni yokukhula engagcini nje ngokuzinzileyo kodwa enemisebenzi," utshilo uDavis.
Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way.	Ngenxa yokuba sibona ukukhula kwemisebenzi kunye nengqesho ingundoqo kuyo nayiphi na isicwangciso sophuhliso esijolise ekunciphiseni intlupheko ngendlela ezinzileyo.
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.	Ilizwe libekwe kuluhlu lwaMazwe angaPhuhliswanga kangako ngokusekwe kwingeniso yomntu ngamnye, ukuba sesichengeni kwezoqoqosho, kunye nezikhombisi zophuhliso lwabantu ezifana nempilo kunye nesondlo.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.	Kumazwe angama-48 angaphuhliswanga kangako ehlabathini, angama-34 aseAfrika. Amazwe amathathu athweswe izidanga kwinqanaba lawo elingaphuhliswanga kangako: iBotswana, iCape Verde kunye neSamoa.
	
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services	Uqhankqalazo luqhwalelisa iiNkonzo zeNkundla zaseMalawi
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials.	Uqhankqalazo oluthathe iveki yonke lwabasebenzi bokuxhasa inkqubo yenkundla yaseMalawi liqhwalelise iinkundla, nto leyo ebangele ukuxinana kwizisele zamapolisa kunye nokunqunyanyiswa kwamatyala amakhulu - kuqukwa namatyala urhwaphilizo kurhulumente.
Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.	Iimashali zenkundla, oonobhala kunye nabathunywa bafuna ukonyuselwa imivuzo ngamashumi amathathu eepesenti ekhulwini ababethenjiswe ngurhulumente kwiminyaka emibini edlulileyo.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week.	Ukuxhentsa nokucula kwindawo yenkundla ibe ngumsebenzi wokuzonwabisa kubasebenzi benkundla ababegwayimbile ukusukela oko kuqale ukuhlaliswa kwabantu kwiveki ephelileyo.
Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.	ULinley Hebert, isithethi sabasebenzi abagwayimbileyo, uxelele iVOA ukuba olu qhankqalazo lubangelwa kukungaphumeleli koorhulumente ukuhlonipha isivumelwano sika2012.
In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision, Hebert said.	“Ngenyanga kaOkuthowbha [kulo nyaka] urhulumente uye waphonononga imivuzo yabasebenzi bakarhulumente, kodwa asizange sibandakanywe kolo hlaziyo,” utshilo uHebert.
Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well]. 	“Kodwa ngo-2012, saba nesivumelwano sokuba qho xa behlaziya imivuzo yabasebenzi bakarhulumente, [babe besonyusa imivuzo yethu].
So, [after adhering to the agreement in 2013], we are surprised to see that this time we are left out."	Ke, [emva kokubambelela kwisivumelwano ngo-2013], siyamangaliswa kukubona ukuba ngeli xesha sishiywe ngaphandle. "
Government authorities say the failure to increase judicial workers salaries this year is largely because of financial constraints, following a donor aid freeze against Malawi's government.	Abasemagunyeni kurhulumente bathi ukusilela ukonyusa imivuzo yabasebenzi benkundla kulo nyaka kungenxa yokunqongophala kwemali, kulandela ukumiswa koncedo lwabaxhasi ngokuchasene norhulumente waseMalawi.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers.	Oku kuqhwanyaza kweliso kubangelwe sisityholo semali sikarhulumente apho kwaphangwa ngaphezu kwezigidi ezingama-30 zeerandi kungxowa-mali karhulumente.
Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.	Isithethi sesebe lezimali u-UN Msowoya uxelele isikhululo sikanomathotholo sasekuhlaleni ukuba kunzima kurhulumente ukuhlangabezana nemfuno yabasebenzi.
It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands, "Msowoya said.	“Kunzima ukuthembisa into eza kwenziwa ngunondyebo. Kodwa kwanele ukuthi imeko yezoqoqosho egqubayo kunye nokunqongophala kohlahlo lwabiwo-mali kuza kwenza kubenzima kancinci ukuba unondyebo athobele amabango,” utshilo uMsowoya.
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met.	Kodwa ngokukaHebert, abahlaseli abazuphinda baqhubeke nomsebenzi de kuhlangatyezwane neemfuno zabo.
Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money. 	Oko ndazalwa [akuzange kubekho xesha] urhulumente wathi unemali.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted.	Ineendlela zayo [zokufumana imali] kwaye iya kufumana iindlela ezifanayo zokusinika imali,” utshilo uHebert.
The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.	Uqhankqalazo oluqhubekayo luyiqhwalelisa inkqubo yamatyala, njengoko imisebenzi yeenkundla isanqunyanyisiwe.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.	Amatyala aliqela, kuquka elo lalowo wayesakuba ngumphathiswa wezobulungisa uRalph Kasambara, nophendula izityholo malunga notyhobo lwemali, anqunyanyisiwe kwiveki ephelileyo.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.	Amapolisa akhala ngokuxinana kwizisele zentolongo, nanjengoko kungekho barhanelwa abasiwa enkundleni.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses."	Isithethi samapolisa aseMalawi uRhoda Manjolo uxelele iVOA ekuphela kwendlela abanayo "kukunika ibheyile yamapolisa kwabo banamatyala amancinci."
Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.	Abakhankaseli bamalungelo oluntu kunye neengcali zomthetho zithi olu qhankqalazo lunegalelo ekunyhashweni kwamalungelo oluntu.
There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours, noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu.	“Kukho abo bantu kufuneka basiwe enkundleni kwiiyure ezingamashumi amane anesibhozo,” liqaphele igqwetha uGeorge Kadzipatike osebenza kwindawo yabucala kumantla esixeko saseMzuzu.
We cannot make application for them to be granted bail. 	“Asinakusenza isicelo sokuba banikwe ibheyile.
There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."	Kukho abo bantu bangafuniyo ukuhlala namaqabane abo, bangathanda ukuba inkundla ikhuphe isigunyaziso sokuba baqhawule umtshato, asinakufaka isicelo kwiinkundla zamatyala.”
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe.	Abasemagunyeni kurhulumente bathi uthethathethwano oluvaliweyo lokusombulula lo mba luyaqhubeka kwikomkhulu, iLilongwe.
But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.	Kodwa abasebenzi abagwayimbileyo baxelele iVOA nokuba yintoni na, abazukwamkela nto ngaphandle kokunyuselwa imivuzo yabo ngamashumi amathathu eepesenti ekhulwini.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.	Uqhankqalazo olulolu hlobo lwathatha iinyanga ezintathu ngo-2012 emva kokuba oomantyi neejaji bezibandakanye nentshukumo yabasebenzi.
	
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted.	IUnited Nations World Food Programme ithi indlala esemazantsi eAfrika imbi kakhulu kunokuba bekucingelwa.
WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.	Amagosa eWFP alumkisa ngelithi abantu abazizigidi ezili-13 kumazwe amathandathu: iMalawi, iZambia, iLesotho, iZimbabwe, iSwaziland neMozambique basengozini yokulamba ukuba abalufumani uncedo lokutya.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it.	Amagosa eWorld Food Programme athi adinga isigidi seetoni zokutya ukuze athobe indlala kumazantsi eAfrika, kodwa abaqinisekanga ukuba baza kukufumana.
In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food.	Kwisibheno kuluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe ekuqaleni kukaJulayi, amagosa eWFP acele ngaphezu kwe-0.5 yeebhiliyoni zeedola ukuthenga ukutya.
So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate.	Ukuza kuthi ga ngoku bafumene kuphela ama-20 ekhulwini oko. Umlawuli weWFP kummandla osemazantsi eAfrika, uJudith Lewis, uthi imeko iya isiba maxongo.
The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing, she said.	“Ithuba lokunqanda into enokuba yingxaki enkulu yoluntu liyavala,” utshilo.
We need more assistance now. 	“Sidinga uncedo ngakumbi ngoku.
We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."	Sifuna ukutya kulwandle oluphezulu ngoku, okanye sifuna imali yokuthenga izinto zorhwebo ezisafumaneka kumazantsi e-Afrika, ukuze sithintele le ngxaki inkulu. "
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries.	Ngoku, iWFP inceda izigidi ezithandathu zabona bantu basemngciphekweni kumazwe amathandathu achaphazeleke kakhulu.
About half of these people are in Zimbabwe.	Malunga nesiqingatha saba bantu baseZimbabwe.
The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.	Le arhente ithi iqinisekile ukuba lizakunyuka inani labantu abadinga uncedo lwayo.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates.	IWorld Health Organization iphawula ukuba ummandla osemazantsi weAfrika, ukongezelela kukwanda kweHIV/AIDS ehlabathini lonke, ukwanelona zinga liphakamileyo lokungondleki liphakamileyo ehlabathini.
It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.	Iqikelela malunga nama-300,000 abantu abanokufa kwiinyanga ezintandathu ezizayo ngenxa yezifo ezinxulumene nokungondleki.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. "We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said.	UNksz Lewis uthi ukufa sele kuqalile. “Sibona abantu befuduka ezilalini zabo,” utshilo.
If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. 	Ukuba bayazi ukuba kuza kwabelwa ukutya, baye ngoko nangoko.
The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas.	Ingxaki kukuba asinako nokutya okwaneleyo kokondla abantu abakwi-rolls, singasathethi ke ngokongeza ukutya kwabanye abantu kwiindawo.
Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "	Ngaba kukho isiphithiphithi esinokubakho? Ewe. "
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October.	UJudith Lewis weWFP uthi ngeli xesha lonyaka le arhente idla ngokucwangcisa indlela yokufumana ukutya kulo mmandla phambi kokuba kufike ixesha lemvula kweyeDwarha.
But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.	Kodwa uthi kuba iWFP sele inobunzima ekufezekiseni iithagethi zayo zangoku, ayinakho nokuqalisa ukucwangcisa ukuhanjiswa kokutya kwixesha elizayo.

Child Labor in Malawi - 2002-02-28	Ukuqeshwa kwabantwana eMalawi - 2002-02-28
The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.	Umbutho, i-Eye of the Child, uvakalisa inkxalabo ngento ekuthiwa luninzi lwabantwana abanyanzelwa ukuba baphangele ngenxa yendlala.
It says these children risk being abused.	Ithi aba bantwana basemngciphekweni wokuxhatshazwa.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre.	Abanye abantwana abangaphantsi kweminyaka yobudala basebenza njengabakhwazi kwiibhasi ezincinci kwindawo yoshishino exakekileyo eLimbe kwikomkhulu lezorhwebo, iBlantyre.
They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.	Bangabanye babantwana abaninzi abaye banyanzeleka ukuba baphangele ngenxa yokusokola.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas.	UMaxwell Matewere ngumlawuli olawulayo kwi-Eye of the Child. Uthi uninzi lwabantwana luphuma ezilalini.
He says, "Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization.	Uthi, "Okwangoku asikenzi uhlalutyo lwedatha kodwa uMphathiswa wezaBasebenzi uzimisele ukwenza oko ngokukhawuleza ngemithombo yemali evela kwiInternational Labor Organization.
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.	Kodwa ngokusekwe kuvavanyo lwethu nangemisebenzi yethu, sivakalelwa kukuba ukuqeshwa kwabantwana kuyingxaki enkulu ngakumbi kwiindawo ezisemaphandleni kwaye unokuxela ukuba ukusuka ekurhwebeni kwabantwana besuka ezilalini besiya ezidolophini apho uninzi lolutsha lusebenza kwizindlu zabantu. .
 Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates. 	UMnu. Matewere uthi abantwana abangathathi ntweni bahlala befumana umsebenzi kumafama amakhulu.
He said, "We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates.	Uthe, “Siqaphele ukuba kukho izinto ezibonisa ukuba kukho abantwana abasebenza kwiindawo zeti necuba.
There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. "	Kukwakho abantwana abasebenza ekwenzeni izitena ubukhulu becala abazali babo baya kubaququzelela ukuba basebenze kwezo ntlobo zengqesho. "
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country.	Umnu. Matewere uthi iEye of the Child ifumanise ukuba kukho ukunyhashwa kwamalungelo abantwana kweli lizwe.
These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.	Oku kubandakanya, udlwengulo, ukungcola kunye nokusebenza ngokugqithisileyo.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.	Uthi oku kunyhasha iNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo ngamaLungelo oMntwana.
If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child, he said, "you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education.	Ukuba ujonga kwiNgqungquthela yamaLungelo oMntwana, watsho, "uya kubona ukuba ibonelela ngokhuseleko lwabantwana kulo naluphi na uhlobo lokuxhaphaza kulo naluphi na uhlobo lwemisebenzi eyingozi okanye isenzo esisongela impilo yabo, ukukhula kwabo. nto leyo esisisongelo kwimfundo.
So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. "	Ngoko ke abantwana abafunyanwa besebenza kwiindawo zeti, abafunyanwa ekwenzeni izitena, kucacile, amalungelo abo njengoko ebonelelwe kwiNgqungquthela yamaLungelo abaNtwana ngokunjalo nakumgaqo-siseko bayagxojwa. "
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.	Umphathi we-Eye of the Child uthi umbutho wakhe ujonga iindlela zokukhusela amalungelo omntwana.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs.	Uthi ukuphumeza oku, eli qela liqale iinkqubo eziliqela.
We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child. 	“Kutshanje siqale inkqubo entsha kwaye into esizama ukuyenza kukwazisa uluntu ngokubanzi ngezinto ezilungele umntwana nokubazisa nangamalungelo omntwana.
At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. "	Kwangaxeshanye sifuna ukwakha amandla kubantwana ngokwabo ukuze bakwazi ukusebenzisa ilizwi labo lokwenyani ukuvakalisa iinkxalabo zabo. "
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.	Ngokutsho koMphathiswa wezaBasebenzi, abantwana abaninzi banyanzeleka ukuba bashiye isikolo baye kufuna umsebenzi ngenxa yokuba abazali bengakwazi ukuhlawula imali yesikolo.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.	Nangona isikolo samabanga aphantsi sisimahla eMalawi, uninzi lwabantwana aluyi ngenxa yokunqongophala kwezinto eziyimfuneko njengempahla.

A high court in Malawi has convicted five people of murder for the 2018 killing of a 22-year-old albino man, including the victims brother.	Inkundla ephakamileyo yaseMalawi ibagwebe abantu abahlanu benetyala lokubulala ngo-2018 lokubulala indoda eneminyaka eyi-albino eneminyaka engama-22, kuquka nomzalwana wamaxhoba.
The court convicted seven other people of selling the victim's body parts.	Inkundla igwebe abanye abantu abasixhenxe ngokuthengisa amalungu omzimba wexhoba.
Malawi officials say more than 170 albinos have been attacked in the country since 2014 by people who believe their body parts bring luck and wealth.	Amagosa aseMalawi athi bangaphezu kwekhulu elinamashumi asixhenxe abantu abane-albino abathe bahlaselwa kweli lizwe ukusukela ngo-2014 ngabantu abakholelwa ukuba amalungu abo omzimba azisa amathamsanqa nobutyebi.
Family members of the deceased, MacDonald Masambuka, left the courtroom Thursday with hopes of justice being served after the court convicted all 12 people accused in his death.	Amalungu osapho lomfi, uMacDonald Masambuka, aphume enkundleni ngoLwesine ngethemba lokuba ubulungisa buyenzeka emva kokuba inkundla ibagwebele bonke abantu abalishumi elinesibini abatyholwa ngokubhubha kwakhe.
Family members, including Masambukas mother, appeared calm and composed as Judge Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga read the judgments.	Amalungu osapho, kuquka nomama kaMasambukas, babonakale bezolile kwaye bezolile ngelixa uJaji Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga efunda izigwebo.
Those convicted included a Catholic priest, Father Thomas Muhosa, police officer Chikondi Chileka, clinician Lumbani Kamanga, and the deceaseds brother, Cassim Masambuka.	Kwabo bagwetywe benetyala baquka umfundisi weKhatholika, ubawo uThomas Muhosa, ipolisa uChileka Chileka, ugqirha Lumbani Kamanga, nomntakwabo obhubhileyo uCassim Masambuka.
Charges included murder, extracting human tissues, causing harm to a person with disability, and trafficking in persons.	Izityholo zaziquka ukubulala, ukukhupha izicubu zomntu, ukwenza umonakalo kumntu okhubazekileyo, kunye nokurhweba ngabantu ngokungekho mthethweni.
Kamanga convicted the victims brother and four others of murder.	UKmanga ugwebe amaxhoba ubhuti kunye nabanye abane ngokubulala.
The court convicted seven other people, including the priest and police officer, of selling the victim's body parts.	Inkundla igwebe abanye abantu abasixhenxe abaquka umfundisi nepolisa ngokuthengisa amalungu omzimba wexhoba.
Business with tissue  According to the court, Muhosha, Chileka and others offered to conduct business using human tissue extracted from a human corpse.	Ushishino ngeethishu Ngokwenkundla, uMuhosha, uChileka nabanye bazinikezele ngokuqhuba ishishini besebenzisa izicubu zomntu ezithathwe kwisidumbu somntu.
The judge said the state proved beyond reasonable doubt the 12 people conspired to kill Masambuka to extract his bones based on a perception they would benefit financially.	Ijaji ithi urhulumente ungqinisise ngaphandle kwamathandabuzo ukuba abantu abalishumi elinesibini benze iyelenqe lokubulala uMasambuka ngenjongo yokukhupha amathambo akhe ngokwembono yokuba baza kuxhamla ngokwasezimalini.
She said Masambuka is the latest victim of violent attacks on persons with albinism who have not been protected by the community.	Uthe uMasambuka lixhoba lamva nje lokuhlaselwa kwabantu abane-albinism abangakhuselwanga luluntu.
Director of Public Prosecutions Steve Kayuni represented the state in the case. He said he was pleased the court agreed on all the seven charges he presented.	Umphathi wezoTshutshiso uSteve Kayuni ebemele umbuso kweli tyala. Uthi uyavuya inkundla ivumelene ngawo onke amatyala asixhenxe awathi wawabeka.
Its really something overwhelming on the part of the state considering that this matter, if you notice, there is a police officer involved, a priest involved and there is a brother involved. 	“Kuyinto exakileyo kwicala likarhulumente xa ucinga ukuba lo mba, ukuba uyaqaphela, kukho ipolisa elibandakanyekayo, umfundisi obandakanyekayo kwaye kukho umzalwana obandakanyekayo.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust — that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him," Kayuni said.	Ukuba uyaqaphela, yonke le nto ijikela kwisikhundla sokuthembana — into yokuba umntu ofana nongasekhoyo uMacdonald Masambuka ebemthembile kakhulu, ngabo abagqibele bemngcatsha,” utshilo uKayuni.
Masambuka went missing from his village on March 9, 2018, and his limbless body was found buried in a garden on April 2, 2018, in his home district of Machinga south of Malawi.	UMasambuka waduka kwilali yakhe ngomhla we-9 kweyoKwindla 2018, waza umzimba wakhe ongenamalungu wafunyanwa ungcwatywe egadini ngomhla wesibini kuTshazimpuzi ka-2018, kwisithili sakowabo eMachinga emazantsi eMalawi.
Enticement  Court documents show that Masambuka was enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found a girl for him to marry.	Amaxwebhu enkundla yamatyala abonisa ukuba uMasambuka wahendwa ngumntakwabo ukuba adibane nabahlobo bakhe, abathi bamfumanele intombi afuna ukuyitshata.
But when they reached the scene, the alleged friends grabbed Masambuka by the neck and dragged him to a garden where they killed him. Here, his assailants cut off his limbs, burned his body using petrol and buried it there.	Kodwa bathe bakufika kwindawo yexhwayelo, abo batyholwa ngokuba ngabahlobo bam bambamba uMasambuka entanyeni bamrhuqela egadini apho bambulala khona. Apha, abahlaseli bakhe bamnqumla amalungu omzimba, batshisa umzimba wakhe ngepetroli baza bawungcwaba apho.
This was the first such case involving high-profile community members involved in attacks on persons with albinism.	Eli yayilityala lokuqala elilolu hlobo libandakanya abantu abakwizinga eliphezulu ababandakanyeka kuhlaselo lwabantu abane-albinism.
Masauko Chamkakala, the lawyer for the 12 defendants in the case, said he would comment once he had gone through the judgment.	UMasauko Chamkakala, igqwetha labamangalelwa abalishumi elinesibini kweli tyala, uthe uzakuhlomla xa sele egqibile ukuwisa isigwebo.
We are still waiting to see the perfected judgment so that we can read it and study it and talk to our clients, Chamkakala said.	“Sisalindele ukubona isigwebo esigqibeleleyo ukuze sifunde sifunde kwaye sithethe nabathengi bethu,” uthethe watsho uChamkakala.
Rights activists said they expected the court to give stiffer punishment to those convicted.	Abalwela amalungelo bathi balindele ukuba inkundla inike isohlwayo esiqatha kwabo babanjiweyo.
Serious sentencing'	Isigwebo esiqatha'
Ian Simbota represented the Association of Persons with Albinism at the court.	UIan Simbota ebemele umbutho wabantu abaneAlbinism kule nkundla.
When the judge was reading, what concerned me was that part of a [Priest] Father Muhosha [and others] who have been convicted of transacting body parts. 	“Xa ijaji yayifunda, eyona nto yayindixhalabisa yile nxalenye [kaMbingeleli] uTata uMuhosha [nabanye] abagwetyelwe ukutshintshisa amalungu omzimba.
If you go to the Anatomy Act, it is not so hard on such offenses.	Ukuba uya kwi-Anatomy Act, ayinzima kangako kwezo ziphoso.
So, we are really looking forward to the judge, if at all its possible, to put a human face to the case so that at least we really need to see serious sentencing on this case," Simbota said.	Ngoko ke, sijonge ngenene ukuba ijaji, ukuba kunokwenzeka, ibeke ubuso bomntu kweli tyala ukuze noko sidinga ukubona isigwebo esiqatha kweli tyala,” utshilo uSimbota.
The high court is expected to sentence the perpetrators on May 30.	Inkundla ephakamileyo kulindeleke ukuba igwebe abenzi bobubi ngomhla wamashumi amathathu kuCanzibe.
In another case, a high court on Thursday sentenced a 37-year-old man to life in prison for the 2020 murder of a 14-year-old-boy with albinism in Phalombe district.	Kwelinye ityala, inkundla ephakamileyo ngoLwesine igwebe ixhego elineminyaka engamashumi amathathu anesixhenxe (37) ubudala ngetyala lokubulala inkwenkwana eneminyaka elishumi elinesine (albinism) kwisithili sasePhalombe ngo2020.
	
Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy	Igosa laseZimbabwe likhusela uqhanqalazo, libongoza umonde kuQoqosho
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.	Umphathiswa wemicimbi yangaphandle kunye norhwebo lwamazwe ngamazwe eZimbabwe ngoMvulo ukhusele uqhanqalazo oluchasene norhulumente kwaye wabongoza ukuba nomonde ekuguquleni uqoqosho olusekiyo.
Though "everybody's got the right to demonstrate," there have "been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence,"	Nangona "wonke umntu enelungelo lokubonisa," kuye kwakho "iintetho ezininzi kunye namaphulo obundlobongela,"
Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview.	USibusiso B. Moyo uxelele iVOA kudliwano-ndlebe.
Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.	Ecaphula ukhuseleko loluntu, uye wavumelana nesigqibo senkundla yaseZimbabwe kwiiyure ezingaphambili zokuxhasa ukuvalwa umlomo kwamapolisa kuqhanqalazo olwaluququzelelwa ngumbutho ophikisayo weMovement for Democratic Change (MDC).
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government.	Iinkokheli zomanyano zinyanzelisa uMongameli Emmerson Mnangagwa kunye neqela elilawulayo leZANU-PF ukuba bathathe inxaxheba kurhulumente wenguqu.
They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start.	Bebeququzelele uqhanqalazo ngoMvulo koBulawayo, isixeko sesibini ngobukhulu kweli lizwe, kodwa amapolisa aluvala kwiiyure ezimbalwa phambi kokuba luqale.
Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.	Eminye imiqhankqalazo emibini yenkcaso isacwangcisiwe kule veki: kumbindi wesixeko saseGweru ngoLwesibini nakwisixeko esikumazantsi mpuma eMasvingo ngolwesithathu.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court.	Amapolisa nawo aye aluvala kwangaphambili uqhanqalazo eHarare ngoLwesihlanu odlulileyo, isigqibo esixhaswe yinkundla yaseZimbabwe.
Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police.	Amakhulu-khulu abalandeli be-MDC akasihoyanga esi sithintelo, nto leyo ekhokelele kungquzulwano phakathi kwabahlali namapolisa.
Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.	Ividiyo kunye neefoto zibonise amapolisa ebetha kwaye ekhaba abanye abaqhankqalazi phakathi kwezenzo eziye zazisa izikhalazo zamandla agqithisileyo kumaqela oluntu kunye namalungelo oluntu, kuquka ne-ofisi yamalungelo oluntu yeZizwe eziManyeneyo.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols.	Amapolisa, hayi abaqhankqalazi, athe agaleleka kwizitalato zakwaBulawayo ngoMvulo, ephethe amakhaka, amakhuni, kwezinye iimeko, imipu.
The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.	I-Associated Press inike ingxelo ngeelori zamapolisa kunye neenkanunu zamanzi ezibekwe kumbindi wedolophu.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.	Umfana wakwaBulawayo ozichaze njengoJames kuphela, uxelele iVOA ukuba uthethathethwano phakathi kukarhulumente neenkokheli zamaqela aphikisayo zibaluleke ukodlula uqhanqalazo.
Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. 	“Enyanisweni, ukubonisa, singaphela sonzakele ngokubethwa, sileqwa.
There's really nothing that we see coming out of it," James said.	Akukho nto siyibona iphuma kuyo,” utshilo uJames.
But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … 	“Kodwa la madoda kufuneka ahlale phantsi abone ukuba angasenzela ntoni, ingakumbi thina silulutsha. …
We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."	Sichaphazeleke kakhulu, kwaye siyaguga sibaleka nje. "
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."	UMoyo, umphathiswa wezangaphandle, uxelele iVOA ukuba ulawulo "lwenza utshintsho lwezoqoqosho olusisiseko kwaye lungundoqo ekuqinisekiseni ukuba nolutsha ekugqibeleni luya kudalelwa imisebenzi, ukuze sikwazi ukudala imeko apho abatyali-mali kunye nenkunzi. uzakufumana kulula ukungena kweli lizwe, apho kuza kudaleka imisebenzi, kwaye ulutsha luzakuba yinxalenye yemisebenzi yezoqoqosho.”
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy:	UMoyo uthe iZimbabwe iphakathi kwi "transition stabilization program" yeminyaka emibini yokuvuselela uqoqosho lweli lizwe olunxungupheleyo:
We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums.	Sinonyaka omnye ukuba sihambe kwaye sithi ngelo xesha kufuneka siphume kwi-doldrum.
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption.	Ilizwe elikumazantsi e-Afrika eliphantse libe zizigidi ezili-16 lijongene nengxaki enkulu yezemali ukusukela ngo-2008, lithwaxwa kukunyuka kwamaxabiso ezinto kunye nokuwa korhwaphilizo lwamashumi eminyaka.

Civil Society Workers Run Afoul of Tanzania Security Officials in Sign of Increasing Clampdown	Abasebenzi bemibutho yoluntu baqhubela phambili amagosa okhuseleko eTanzania ngomqondiso wokwandiswa kweClampdown
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.	Abakhankasi boluntui base-Afrika bezimase inkomfa e-Tanzania babuzwa imibuzo kwaye balunyukiswa kwimpelaveki, kwinto abathi abalwela amalungelo oluntu yinxalenye yokuqhubekeka koxinzelelo kwintetho ekhululekileyo kwisizwe saseMpuma Afrika.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.	Iinkcukacha zisaphuma malunga nokuba kwenzeke ntoni kanye kanye kubasebenzi boluntu abangama-40 abathe bangquzulana namagosa okhuseleko kwingqungquthela yalo nyaka yoMbutho woPhuhliso lwaMazantsi e-Afrika eDar es Salaam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.	Kodwa iingcali zamalungelo zathi ngoMvulo esi siqendu sesinye isibonakaliso esixhalabisayo sokunyuka kwezenzo ezingenangqiqo kunye nokuxhatshazwa ngurhulumente.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding.	UCatherine Eden, igqwetha leTanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, uthi esi siganeko sibangelwe kukungaqondi kakuhle.
South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16.	Abathunywa boMzantsi Afrika kwinkomfa yamazwe ali-15, uthe, babefuna ukubamba isikhumbuzo esifutshane sesikhumbuzo sesixhenxe sokubulawa kwendyikitya yokufa yaseMarikana eMzantsi Afrika ngomhla we-16 ka-Agasti.
Thirty-four striking miners were killed by police in the deadliest security incident since the end of apartheid in 1994.	Abasebenzi-mgodini abangamashumi amathathu anesine babulawa ngamapolisa kwesona siganeko sabulala abantu abaninzi ukususela ekupheleni kocalucalulo ngo-1994.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people.	Ngoko abathunywa kumsitho osecaleni bacula umhobe woMzantsi Afrika, bathi cwaka umzuzwana baze bamemelela kurhulumente wabo ukuba akukhusela ngcono abantu bakhe.
But something they wrote on a piece of paper convinced security police the delegates had bigger plans.	Kodwa into ababeyibhale ephepheni yaqinisekisa amapolisa ezokhuseleko ukuba abathunywa banezicwangciso ezinkulu kunoko.
They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 	Babhala imiyalezo ethile kwiitshathi, apho umxholo omncinci owawufakwe kule tshati wawufundeka ngoluhlobo, 
Stop killing our people,'" she said. "...	Yekani ukubulala abantu bethu,'” utshilo.
So I think there was a national security person in that meeting and he saw those messages and so he interpreted that as a plan to demonstrate.	Ke ndicinga ukuba kwakukho umntu wokhuseleko lwesizwe kuloo ntlanganiso kwaye wayibona loo miyalezo kwaye ke wayitolika njengesicwangciso sokubonisa.
But if you look closely, you can't see any relationship as to why they would want to demonstrate for the Marikana shootings in Tanzania."	Kodwa ukuba uyajongisisa, awuboni nabuphi na ubudlelwane bokuba kutheni befuna ukubonisa udubulo lwaseMarikana eTanzania. "
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.	Akukacaci ukuba ukhona umntu owabanjwayo. Amanye amaqela amalungelo athi abanye abakhankasi bamazwe angaphandle babanjwa, kodwa abakhange baabuzwe mibuzo.
	
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning.	U-Eden uthi ubizwe ngabasemagunyeni njengoko wayesiya kwisikhululo samapolisa ngolwesiHlanu ukuya kudibana nomnxibelelanisi wendawo emva koko wakhululwa ngesilumkiso.
Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat.	Kamva amapolisa aya kumagumbi eehotele zabathunywa ekhangela izinto awayecinga ukuba ziyingozi yokhuseleko.
They found nothing, she said.	Abafumananga nto, watsho.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.	UJanet Zhou, umlawuli weZimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, ngomnye wabakhankasi ababuzwa imibuzo ngabezokhuseleko kwihotele yakhe.
I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least, she told VOA, after returning home to Harare.	“Ndandisoyika, ndandiziva ndingakhuselekanga, ndihlukumezekile ukuba ndingatsho,” uxelele iVOA, emva kokubuyela ekhaya eHarare.
Because seven security details coming over after midnight and questioning me about a demonstration and placards that I wasn't going to be able to give them, was something else.	Ngenxa yokuba amadoda asixhenxe okhuseleko eza emva kobusuku kwaye andibuza imibuzo malunga nomboniso kunye neeplakhadsi endandingazokukwazi ukubanika, yayiyenye into.
	
I didn't understand it. It left me really terrified."	Andizange ndiyiqonde. Yandishiye ndosoyika ngokwenene. "
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday.	Uthe amapolisa amxelela kunye negqiza lakhe labantu abangama-40- ukuba bahlale ehotele imini yonke yangoMgqibelo.
She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.	Wababuza ukuba babanjiwe na, abazange bamphendule.
	
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal.	U-Oryem Nyeko, umphandi oseKampala kwi-Human Rights Watch, uqaphele ukuba amapolisa aseTanzania akazange enze into engekhosemthethweni.
But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.	Kodwa, wathi, oko akukwenzi ukuba kulunge, kananjalo.
I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do, he said.	“Ndicinga ukuba yinto efanelekileyo ukuba amapolisa ayenze,” utshilo.
However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. 	“Nangona kunjalo, umceli mngeni apho kukuba ibonisa ngengxaki ebanzi eTanzania xa kujongwe umba wokuvala indawo yasekuhlaleni kunye namathuba okuba abantu basekuhlaleni baveze izimvo zabo ngokukhululekileyo.
This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."	Le yinxalenye yendlela ebanzi yocinezelo loluntu kweli lizwe. "
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression.	Amaqela amazwe ngamazwe afana neCommittee to Protect Journalists nawo alumkise ngokwanda kwengcinezelo.
Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."	Phambi kwengqungquthela ye-SADC, iqela labajongi liqaphele iinkxalabo zalo malunga "nokhukuliseko olukhulu lwenkululeko yeendaba," kunye "nohlaselo lweentatheli ezizimeleyo, ukumiswa kweendaba, ukuvalwa kwe-intanethi, kunye nomthetho othintelayo."
The CPJ made special mention of Tanzanian journalists Azory Gwanda, who has been missing since 2017, and Erick Kabendera, who was arrested last month and charged with economic crimes, which the organization says is in retaliation for his critical journalism.	I-CPJ ithethe ngokukodwa ngeentatheli zaseTanzania u-Azory Gwanda, owalahleka ukusukela ngo-2017, kunye no-Erick Kabendera, owabanjwa kwinyanga ephelileyo wabekwa ityala lolwaphulo-mthetho lwezoqoqosho, apho mbutho uthi uziphindezela ngobuntatheli bakhe obugxekayo.
Kabendera remains behind bars. On Monday, Eden, his lawyer, said the court decided to adjourn to give prosecutors more time to investigate. That will keep him in jail for more than a week longer, until Aug. 30.	UKabendera  usavalelwe. NgoMvulo, u-Eden, igqwetha lakhe, uthe inkundla igqibe kwelokuba inqumamise ukunika abatshutshisi ixesha elongezelelweyo lokuphanda. Loo nto iza kumgcina entolongweni ixesha elingaphezu kweveki, kude kube ngu-Agasti 30.
	
Anna Henga, director of the Legal and Human Rights Center, said police actions only further a worrying trend in Tanzania under President John Magafuli, whom critics say is becoming increasingly authoritarian.	U-Anna Henga, umlawuli weLegal and Human Right Center, uthe izenzo zamapolisa ziqhubela phambili inkxalabo eTanzania phantsi koMongameli uJohn Magafuli, apho abangxeki bathu uya ephatha ngegunya.
This means the continuation of a limited civic space. Because this has happened since 2016. 	Oku kuthetha ukuqhubeka kweendawo zokuhlala ezilinganiselweyo. Kuba oku oko kusenzeke ukususela ngo-2016.
There are a lot of issues, there is a negative development toward limited civic space.	Kukho imiba emininzi, kukho uphuhliso olubi olubhekiselele kwindawo elinganiselweyo yoluntu.
And it is targeted to people like civil society organizations, the media, hindering the freedom of speech, the freedom of association."	Kwaye ijolise kubantu abafana nemibutho yoluntu, amajelo eendaba, ethintela inkululeko yokuthetha, inkululeko yombutho."
	
Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo	Bambalwa abaqhankqalazi abazimase uqhankqalazo lwaseZimbabwe eBulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.	Bambalwa abantu abathe bazimasa  uqhankqalazo eBulawayo, isixeko sesibini saseZimbabwe, ngoMvulo njengoko amapolisa axhobileyo ethe gqolo ukuhlala ezitalatweni nakwinkundla yamatyala apho amaqela aphikisayo anyanzelise ukuba avunyelwe ukuba enze umboniso.
Business in Bulawayo's usually bustling downtown was subdued with the most traffic from police trucks, water cannons and dozens of police officers patrolling on foot.	Amashishini edolophini yakwaBulawayo ahlala ephithizela yothotywa kukuzala kweelori zamapolisa, iimoto zamanzi kunye nentaphane yamapolisa ejikeleza ngeenyawo.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.

But the police banned the protest in the southern city, citing security concerns.	Kodwa amapolisa aluvala uqhanqalazo kwidolophu esemazantsi, echaza inkxalabo yokhuseleko.
A Bulawayo magistrate is hearing the opposition party's challenge to the ban.	Umantyi waseBulawayo umamele umngeni wombutho ophikisayo malunga nokuvalwa koluqhankqalazo.

They beat us up, she said of the police. "What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person.	“Basibethe basibetha,” watsho ngamapolisa. "Senze ntoni? Yonke le mikhosi yezokhuseleko kufanele ukuba isikhusele sonke - hayi umntu omnye.
Where will we go and survive?	Siza kuya phi size sisinde?
Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"	Ingaba kufuneka sibabulale abantwana bethu ekubeni sisokola ukubagcina?"
Make Nyashanu, 27, said he would continue protesting because he is miserable about being unemployed.	UMake Nyashanu ona-27, uthe uzakuqhubeka noqhanqalazo kuba ukhathazekile ngokungaphangeli.
He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators — even elderly ones and people not protesting.	Uthe amapolisa ebebetha ngokungakhethiyo abaqhankqalazi - nabantu abadala kunye nabantu abangaqhankqalaziyo.
Is this democracy? he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos.	Ingaba yidemokhrasi le? ubuze watsho esongeza esithi ibiluqhankqalazo olunoxolo kodwa amapolisa ebedala isiphithiphithi.
The opposition said it will hold another protest Monday in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, and will go to other cities and places until the government addresses the economy.	Iqela eliphikisayo lithi liza kubamba olunye uqhankqalazo ngoMvulo kwidolophu yesibini ngobukhulu eZimbabwe, iBulawayo, kwaye lizakuya kwezinye izixeko neendawo de urhulumente alungise uqoqosho.
Government response	Impendulo karhulumente

Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner, she said.	“Urhulumente uhlaba ikhwelo kubo bonke abemi baseZimbabwe abanenkqubela ukuba bayeke ukusetyenziswa ziimpembelelo ezimbi ukudodobalisa ilizwe labo, kuba oku kuzakwandisa ubunzima urhulumente azama ukubulungisa ngendlela ezinzileyo,” utshilo.
I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation.

UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe	I-UN Igxeka urhulumente ngokuqhawula uqhankqalazo olunoxolo eZimbabwe.
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare.	I-Ofisi yamalungelo oluntu ye-UN igxeka intshukumo yangoLwesihlanu eZimbabwe eyenziwe ngamapolisa  kubantu abaqhankqalaza ngoxolo kwikomkhulu iHarare.
The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.	Le arhente imemelela ukuba kwenziwe uphando malunga nokusetyenziswa kakhulu kwezigalo ngoonogada.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.	Isithethi samaLungelo oLuntu kwi-UN uRupert Colville uthi kukho iindlela ezingcono zokujongana nezikhalazo ezisemthethweni zabemi malunga nemeko yezoqoqosho kweli lizwe kunokuba kunqandwe abaqhankqalaza ngoxolo.
We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe. 	“Sixhalabile kakhulu ngemeko yezoqoqosho nentlalontle eqhubeka eZimbabwe.
While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform	Ngelixa sivuma iinzame ezenziwe ngurhulumente, uluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe kunye ne-UN eZimbabwe ukunciphisa iziphumo zobunzima kunye nohlaziyo.
process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans," Colville said.	Inkqubo, imeko yezoqoqosho emaxongo ngoku inefuthe elibi ekufezekisweni kwamalungelo ezoqoqosho nezentlalo ezigidi zabantu baseZimbabwe,” utshilo uColville.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care.	Abemi baseZimbabwe batsala nzima ngenxa yokonyuka kakhulu kwamaxabiso ngokuhamba kwexesha , ebangele ukuba amaxabiso anyuke kwizinto ezibalulekileyo ezifana namafutha, ukutya, izithuthi kunye nokhathalelo lwezempilo.
Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.	Okongeza iingxaki yimpembelelo eqhubekayo yenkanyamba i-Idai ehlasele iZimbabwe ngoMatshi kunye nembalela enkulu.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.	Umbutho weZizwe eziManyeneyo uthi isinye kwisithathu sabemi baseZimbabwe abantu abazizigidi ezilishumi elinesithandathu badinga uncedo loluntu.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear.	Ukuwa malunga nokwenzakala kunye nokubanjwa okunokwenzeka kuqhanqalazo lwangoLwezihlanu akukacaci.
But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.	Kodwa uColville uxelele iVOA ukuba iofisi yakhe ifumene iingxelo eziphazamisayo zokunyhashwa kwamalungelo oluntu kwezi nyanga zimbalwa zidlulileyo.
There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders. 	“Kukho, njengoko benditshilo, iingxelo ezizayo ngoku zokuxhwilwa kwabantu, ukubethwa njalo njalo kwamatsha ntliziyo okanye abakhuseli bamalungelo abantu.
We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago," Colville said.	Asikhange sibenalo ithuba lokuqinisekisa ezo kwaye sijonge ngokweenkcukacha ngaphandle kwezi zimbini zenzekileyo kwiintsuku ezimbalwa ezidlulileyo, utshilo uColville.
So, it is clearly a very tense situation.	Ngoko, kucacile ukuba yimeko enzima kakhulu.
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.	UColville uthi abasemagunyeni banoxanduva lokuqinisekisa amalungelo abantu okuthetha ngokukhululekileyo kunye nokukhusela ilungelo lokuhlanganisana ngoxolo.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.	I-Ofisi yamalungelo oluntu ye-UN ibongoza urhulumente ukuba abandakanyeke kwingxoxo yelizwe ukuqinisekisa ukuba uluntu kuwo onke amaqhinga alo lukwazi ukwenza imisebenzi yalo ngaphandle koloyiko lokugrogriswa okanye impindezelo ngomsebenzi walo.
	
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs	Ngaphandle  koovimba be-oyile negesi, i-Afrika ifumana uxinzelelo lokunyuka kweendleko zamandla ombane
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.	Abantu baseAfrika baziva becinezelekile ngenxa yokunyuka kwamaxabiso ombane ehlabathini, batsho abahlalutyi, nakumazwe afana neNigeria neAngola angawona athumela ioli ekrwada kwamanye amazwe.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.	Ngelixa elo qela labavelisi be-oyile libona ukunyuka kwengeniso - ingakumbi ukususela ekuhlaseleni kweRussia i-Ukraine ngoFebruwari 24 - ininzi yelizwekazi ayinakho ukucokisa, okunyanzela amazwe ukuba ahlawule amaxabiso aphezulu ukungenisa i-petroli kunye nezinye iimveliso zepetroliyamu ezivela e-Asia naseYurophu.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.	Ilizwekazi lichaphazeleka ngakumbi ngokunyuka kweendleko zegesi yendalo, inxalenye ephambili yezichumisi ezisekelwe kwinitrogen ezisetyenziselwa ukuveliswa kokutya.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.	Njengoko imivuzo ubukhulu becala imile, ngaphezu kwesibini esithathwini sabantu baseAfrika baziva becinezelekile ngenxa yokunyuka kwamaxabiso, utshilo uFranklin Cudjoe, umongameli owaseka i-Imani Centre for Policy and Education yaseGhana.
The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products, Cudjoe told VOA.	“Ilizwekazi liyachaphazeleka nje kuba sixhomekeke kakhulu kubathengisi be-oyile behlabathi, kuba amazwe amaninzi ase-Afrika engenazo iimveliso ze-oyile,” utshilo uCudjoe.
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against	Amaxabiso onyuke kwimarike yeoli yehlabathi emva kohlaselo lwase-Ukraine olubangele ukohlwaywa kwamazwe ngamazwe
Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude.	IRussia, yenye yamazwe ahamba phambili ekuthengiseni izinto ezikrwada kumazwe angaphandle.
The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.	Ixabiso linyuke ngokufutshane laya kuthi ga kwi-120 yeedola umphanda kule nyanga ngaphambi kokuba lihle liye kutsho kwi-103 yeedola umphanda ngoLwesihlanu.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa.	Ukunyuka kwamaxabiso ombane kungunbangela wokunyuka kwezinga lwamaxabiso kwi-Afrika iphela.
In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.	E-Ghana, umzekelo, ukunyuka kwamaxabiso omthengi kuwonke kwakuxhomekeke kwi-15.7% ngonyaka-nonyaka ngoFebruwari xa kuthelekiswa ne-13.9% ngoJanuwari, i-Statistical Service yelizwe yatsho kwiveki ephelileyo.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight.	EZimbabwe, amaxabiso enyuka kakhulu – nangobusuku.
At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday.	Kwivenkile enkulu yeTM kwikomkhulu laseHarare, ikhreyithi yamaqanda angama-30 ixabisa i-6.70 yeedola ngoLwesibini kwaye malunga ne-7.81 yeedola ngoLwesithathu.
The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.	Ixabiso lesonka lasuka kwi-1,49 yeedola ukuya kwi-1,84 yeedola; ngekhilogram yenkomo, ixabiso lenyuke ukusuka kwi-3.35 ukuya kwi-5,22 yeedola.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.	Amaxabiso epetroli anyukile, nawo. E-Harare, ixabiso le-litha linyuke ukusuka kwi-$ 1.41 ukuya kwi-$ 1.69 ukusuka ngoLwesibini ukuya ngoLwesithathu.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.	Ukunyuka kwamaxabiso okutya kwaba ngoyena mqhubi mkhulu wokunyuka kwamaxabiso e-Egypt, anyuke nge-8.8% ngoFebruwari – okona kunyuka kuphezulu phantse kwiminyaka emithathu, ngokutsho kwe-arhente karhulumente yezibalo, iCAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.	UCudjoe uthe kubalulekile ukuba oorhulumente kunye namaqumrhu engingqi anje ngeManyano yase-Afrika bakhe ukhuselo lokukhusela abathengi ngamaxesha okungaqiniseki kwezoqoqosho.
Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food, said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."	Nokuba oko kuthetha ukwakha ukhuseleko malunga nokubonelela ngokutya, utshilo uCudjoe, esongeza, "Ndiyayicingela iNigeria, ukuba yayinendlela yayo, inokuthengisa ukutya kumazwe amaninzi ngexabiso elithotyiweyo ngoku."
There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world.	Kunokuba khukho ukungxamiseka kokuzakhela ukhuseleko ngokunokwabo, iimali ebezinokusenza ukuba sizigcine-- noko ukusithintela ekutshatyalalisweni ngokupheleleyo koku kungaqiniseki emhlabeni.
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries.	UChibamba Kanyama, ingcali yezoqoqosho kwikomkhulu laseZambia eLusaka, uthe ukunqumamisa irhafu yamafutha kuya kuba "yeyona nto ilungileyo ukuyenza ngoku phantsi kwelemeko" ukuxhasa abathengi kunye namashishini.
African governments must find a way of responding," he said.	“Oorhulumente baseAfrika kufuneka bafumane indlela yokusabela,” utshilo.
It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."	Kufuneka kukhetwe phakathi kuncitshiswa irhafu ukuthoba amaxabiso okanye ukugcina amaxabiso aphantsi kunye nokusebenzisa ingeniso ukuxhasa abona bantu basesichengeni kuluntu."
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.	Kodwa uKanyama ukwacebise ukuba ingxaki yezelizwe kunye nezopolitiko ebandakanya iRussia ne-Ukraine - omabini amazwe angabathengisi abakhulu bokutya okuziinkozo e-Afrika - ingadala amathuba kubavelisi baseAfrika.
Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities]	“Amazwe abonelela ngeenkonzo afana noMzantsi Afrika, aneenkqubo ezomeleleyo noomatshini abaphezulu, anokufumana ifestile yokuthumela ngaphandle [impahla]
like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine," Kanyama said.	njengengqolowa kunye nezinye iimveliso zokuvala izikhewu ezishiywe yiRussia ne-Ukraine," utshilo uKanyama.
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.	UKanyama uphinde wathi inkxaso yoluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe - umzekelo, ngendlela yokunciphisa amatyala kwamanye amazwe aseAfrika - yamkelekile.
He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – "is trying to offer some debt relief."	Waphawula ukuba iQela lama-20 - eliquka amazwe asixhenxe aphuhlileyo, amanye amazwe anoqoqosho oluqinileyo okanye olukhula ngokukhawuleza, kunye ne-European Union - "izama ukunika isiqabu kwityala."
Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis," Kanyama added.	Amanye amazwe, afana neZambia, aphantsi kweenkqubo zokuhlengahlengisa amatyala kunye nenkqubo ye-IMF, kwaye kum, le kuphela kwendlela yokuphuma kule ngxaki, wongeze watsho uKanyama.

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February	I-WHO ithi ugonyo lwaseAfrika lwe-COVID lwenyuke nge-15% ngoFebruwari
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic.	IWolrd Health Organisation ithi ugonyo lwe-COVID-19 eAfrica lunyuke nge-15% phakathi kukaJanuwari noFebruwari, njengoko amazwe aliqela aye aqalisa ukuqhubela phambili ngokugonywa ukuze andise ukhuseleko kunye nokukhusela abantu kwesisifo sikazwelonke.
Zimbabwes government says it is launching a "national vaccination blitz" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uthi usungula "inational vaccination blitz" elijolise kwabo bangekagonywa kwilizwe apho abantu banokungawethembi amayeza okugonya ukususela oko yaqalayo inkqubo yogonyo kulo nyaka uphelileyo.
The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases.	Eli phulo liza phakathi kwenkxalabo karhulumente ngokunyuka kwamanani abantu abafunyenwe bene-COVID-19.
Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.	UGqr. Matshidiso Moeti, ongumlawuli wengingqi ye-Afrika kwo-WHO, uthethe wenjenje kwingxelo, ukwanda kogonyo lwe-COVID-19 kwilizwekazi kuqhutywa ikakhulu ngamaphulo kumazwe anabantu abaninzi, ukuquka iDemocratic Republic of Congo, i-Ethiopia, iKenya kunye neNigeria.
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant.	UGqr. Thierno Balde, umphathi we-WHO kwingingqi yaseAfrika kwicandelo le-COVID-19, uthi ilizwekazi kufuneka lihlale liphaphile.
We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible.	Siyibonile into eyenzekayo eChina, kunye nomngcipheko wokuba nohlobo lwesifo olutsha, uhlobo lwalentsholongwane ohlustha lusenokwenzeka.
We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally.	Ngokwenene kunyanzelekile siqhubeke nokukhusela abantu bethu ngokuthatha inxaxhwba kugonyo ngokungaphumli ngokupheleleyo.
The situation might change.	Le meko inokutshintsha.
So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination," Balde said.	Ke kunyanzelekile ukuba siqhubeke sihlengahlengisa amanye ala manyathelo asekuhlaleni kwaye sifumane ugonyo, utshilo uBalde.
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month.	I-WHO ithe ukonyusa ukwamkelwa kwesitofu sokugonya i-COVID-19 eAfrica, yona kunye neminye imibutho ixhasa ugonyo lwesininzi kumazwe ali-10 aphambili ukufikelela kubantu abazizigidi ezili-100 ekupheleni kwenyanga ezayo.
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind.	UNqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, umphathiswa wezolwazi obambeleyo waseZimbabwe, uthe ilizwe lakhe alizukushiywa ngasemva.
Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date.	Ngokuphathelele kwinkqubo yogonyo, ukusukela nge-15 kaMatshi, 2022, xa kubalwa i-159,628 yezigonyo zesithathu sele zikhutshiwe ukuza kuthi ga ngoku.
The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so," Ndlovu said.	Iphulo leNational vaccination blitz liza kuqala ngoMvulo, umhla we21 kaMatshi, ngo-2022, kwaye urhulumente ubongoza abo bangekagonywa ukuba basebenzise eli thuba ukwenza oko,” utshilo uNdlovu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.	Uninzi lwabantu baseZimbabwe abalufuni ugonyo, besithi abaluthembi izitofu zogonyo ekunikelwe ngazo zohlobo lweSinopharm kunye neSinovac eyenziwe eChina.
The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.

Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns.	UGqr. Cleophas Chimbetete, umongameli weZimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, uthi loo nto ibangelwa kukushenxiswa kwamva nje kwemiqathango ethintelayo, enje ngokulwa kwezinto.
He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing.	Uthi, nangona kunjalo, ayiloxesha lokoyika, lixehsa lokunyanzelisa imigaqo ye-WHO, efana nokufihla ubuso kunye nokuncitshiswa kwentlalo.
After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up.	“Emva kokuba kuncitshiswe lemithetho, kulindeleke ukuba amanani abantu abanesisifu anyuke kancinci.
But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us.	Kodwa ndicinga ukuba kusekutsha kakhulu ukuba senze naziphi na izigqibo ezinentsingiselo, ndicinga ukuba lithuba nje lethu lokuba someleze amanyathelo ethu okuthintela kwaye siqhubeke nokungxininisa kuluntu ukuba i-COVID iseyinto ekhoyo.
The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up.	Noko ke, iindaba ezimnandi zezokuba imeko zabagula ngamandla azikho phezulu.
What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers.	Into ekunyazeleke ukuba siyenzile kukuqhubeka nokugonywa kwaye okubalulekileyo kukuba urhulumente enze – njengoko esenza – abeke iliso kula manani.
There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures," Chimbetete said.	Akukho sizathu soloyiko okanye isizathu sokuba senze amanyathelo amatsha, ”utshilo uChimbetete.
Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance.	Ilizwe laseZimbabwe belijolise ekugonyeni abantu abazizigidi ezilishumi ubuncinci ekupheleni konyaka ophelileyo, inani abathi bekunzima ukufikelela kulo ngenxa yokunqongophala kwezixhobo kunye nokuthandabuza koluntu.
It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity.	Kusafuneka ibhengeze ukuba iceba ukufezekisa ukugonyeka kwabantu abaninzi.

Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch.	Abantu baseMntla baseYurophu baphinde balawula iindawo eziphezulu - iDanes yikwindawo yesibini emva kweFinns, ilandelwa yi-Icelandic, iSwiss kunye neDutch.

The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing," report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote.	Imfundiso yengxelo yeWorld Hapiness Report  kwiminyaka edlulileyo kukuba inkxaso yentlalontle, isisa komnye nomnye kunye nokunyaniseka kukarhulumente kubalulekile kwintlalo-ntle, utshilo umbhali uJeffrey Sachs.

Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer	Inkundla yaseZimbabwe ikhupha umyalelo wetyala lomntu osebenzela iNY Times ngokuzimeleyo.
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist.	Inkundla yaseZimbabwe isichithile isicelo sokukhululwa ngoLwesibini kwityala elijongene nentatheli yeNew York Times.
Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.	Intatheli ezimeleyo uJeffrey Moyo utyholwa ngokutyeshela imithetho yokungena kwabantu eZimbabwe xa kutyholwa ukuba wanceda iintatheli ezimbini zamazwe angaphandle ukuba zingene kweli lizwe laMazantsi eAfrika ngokungekho mthethweni kunyaka ophelileyo.
Kathleen Mpofu — one of Moyo's lawyers — said the journalist will go on trial April 28.	UKathleen Mpofu - elinye lamagqwetha kaMoyo - uthe intatheli izakuvela enkundleni ngomhla wama-28  kuEpreyli.
The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding," Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.	Umantyi usikhabile isicelo. Ufumanise ukuba urhulumente ukhokele ubungqina obaneleyo ukuba uMnu Moyo aziphendulele kwaye eze kwesi sigqibo, uMpofu uxelele iVOA esuka kwaBulawayo, kuWhatsApp.
It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense."	“Kukhangeleka ngathi umantyi wayethembele kurhulumente ngobubungqina bamakhadi okutyholwa ngokuba bubuxoki afunyenwe yintatheli yelizwe langaphandle kwaye ngokwendlela atolika ngayo ubungqina obukhokelwa ngurhulumente, wafumanisa ukuba banele ukuba aziphendulele umtyholwa.
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media	Amagqwetha kaMoyo akholelwa ukuba eli tyala lingachithwa, emva kokuba kwa le nkundla inye ekuqaleni kwale nyanga yalikhulula iphephandaba laseZimbabwe.
Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported.	Igosa lekomishini, u-Thabang Manhika, ngezityholo zokuqhuba iziqinisekiso zomgunyathi kwiintatheli ezimbini zase Mzantsi Afrika ze-New York Times ezingene eZimbabwe zaza zagxothwa kamva.
Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.	UMoyo noManhika bebexoxa amatyala abo ngokwahlukeneyo.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uthi uMoyo kunye noManhika bobabini bophule imithetho yokufudukela kwelinye ilizwe.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.	Unobhala osisigxina kwiSebe lezoLwazi uNdabaningi Nick Mangwana uphawule ngesi sigwebo sangoLwesibini.
We just want to see that there's law and order. 	Sifuna nje ukubona ukuba kukho umthetho nocwangco. 
If somebody has committed a crime or is percied, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system.	Ukuba umntu wophule umthetho okanye kuyacingelwa, uyakufumana usuku lwakhe enkundleni, ngoko ke ujongene nenkundla, ngoko ke isigqibo asikho sezandleni zethu, sisezandleni zenkqubo zobulungisa kulwaphulo mthetho.
That's our position," Mangwana said.	Yindawo yethu leyo,” utshilo uMangwana.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.	UTabani Moyo weMedia Institute of Southern Africa, okanye iMISA, umemelele ukuba le ntatheli iphathwe ngokufanelekileyo.

All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial," Moyo said.	Kuyo yonke into esiyithethayo kukuba naye njengaye nawuphi na ummi, ufanelwe kukufumana ukuxoxa ityala lakhe ngobulungisa,” utshilo uMoyo.
Moyo, a Zimbabwean national, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.	UMoyo, ongummi waseZimbabwe, ujongene neminyaka elishumi entolongweni ukuba ufunyenwe enetyala.
	
Zimbabwe Government Orders Vaccinated Workers Back to Work.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uyalele abasebenzi abagonyiweyo ukuba babuyele emsebenzini.
Zimbabwes government has ordered civil servants who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to immediately report for duty after more than a year of working from home, citing a declining in new cases of the virus in the country.	Urhulumente waseZimbabwe uyalele abasebenzi bakarhulumente abathi bagonyelwe i-COVID-19 ukuba bakhawuleze baye emsebenzini emva konyaka besebenza ekhaya, echaza ukwehla kwamanani abantu abanalentsholongwane elizweni.
Authorities also announced any government workers without proof of vaccination will be barred from workplaces and face punishments, including a freeze on their salaries.	Abasemagunyeni baphinde babhengeza nabaphi na abasebenzi bakarhulumente abangenabo kobungqina bogonyo baya kuthintelwa kwiindawo zokusebenza kwaye bajongane nesohlwayo, kubandakanya nokumiswa kwemivuzo yabo.
In a statement this week, President Emmerson Mnangagwas government said it wants its employees to resume meeting in person.	Kwingxelo kule veki, urhulumente kaMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa uthe ufuna abasebenzi bakhe baphinde baqalise ukuhlangana ngokobuqu.
Late Tuesday, Monica Mutsvangwa, the countrys information minister, said the number of people being hospitalized for COVID-19 is on a steady decline.	 Ngorhatya lwangoLwesibini, uMonica Mutsvangwa, umphathiswa wezolwazi welizwe, uthe inani labantu abalaliswe esibhedlele ngenxa ye-COVID-19 liyehla ngokuthe ngcembe.
This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off.	“Oku kubonisa ukuba amanyathelo okusabela kuzwelonke asungulwe ngurhulumente ayaqhubeka nokuba neziqhamo.
In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to," she said.	Ngobona ukwehla okuqhubekayo kumanani abantu abosuleleka sisifo sikazwelonke kunye nokufa, kudityaniswa nokwehla kwezinga labo baneziphumo ezimbi kuvavanyo okubonisa ukuba usulelo loluntu lwehlile, zonke iindawo zokungena kufuneka zivulwe kwakhona, kodwa kuqinisekiswe ukuba yonke imiqathango nemiyalelo  yokuzikhusela kwiCOVID-19 iyathotyelwa,” utshilo.
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.	Nangona kunjalo, umthetho osisinyanzelo wogonyo awamkelwa ngabo bonke abasebenzi baseburhulumenteni.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.	Umongameli weAmalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, uObert Masaraure, uthi abasebenzi bazakuwusa enkundleni lo mcimbi ukuba urhulumente uyanyanzelisa.
A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.	“Ikhontrakthi eyasayinwa ngabasebenzi bakarhulumente ayinayo imiqathango yogonyo olunyanzeliswayo.
So if the Public Service Commission wants to bar civil servants who are not vaccinated, they are in breach of contract and its unacceptable.	Ngoko ke ukuba ikomishoni yekonzo zikarhulumente ifuna ukuvalela ngaphandle abasebenzi bakarhulumente abangagonywanga, bophula isivumelwano kwaye oko akwamkelekanga.
Secondly, civil servants have a right to dignity, they have right to make choices.	Okwesibini, abasebenzi bakarhulumente banelungelo lesidima, banelungelo lokuzikhethela.
No one can be forced foreign substances to be inserted into their bodies," he noted.	Akekho umntu unokunyanzelwa ukuba kufakwe izinto zangaphandle emizimbeni yakhe,” utshilo.
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.	UGqirha Norman Matara, intloko yeZimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, uthi umbutho wakhe uqaphele ukuba amanye amazwe amaninzi ajonge kugonyo olusisinyanzelo.
It is something that we are strongly against. We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.	Yinto esichasene nayo kakhulu. Sicinga ukuba ukugunyazisa amayeza okugonya yinto ephembelela ukuthandabuza kogonyo.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory that goes around when people are saying we are being forced to be vaccinated.	Ininzi into ethethekayo ejikelezayo xa abantu besithi sinyanzelwa ukuba sigonywe.
We really have to get the buy in of people: spread the gospel of vaccines, how they work and then encourage people to get vaccinated and not force them to get vaccinated," he pointed out.	Ngokwenene kufuneka sifumane imvume yabantu: sisasaze ulwazi ngogonyo, indlela asebenza ngayo emva koko sikhuthaze abantu ukuba bagonywe kwaye bangabanyanzeli ukuba bagonywe, ”utshilo.
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.	Kodwa uSifiso Ndlovu ophuma kwiZimbabwe Teachers Association uyaluxhasa uluvo lukarhulumente.
Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.	Ngokuqinisekileyo, bonke abasebenzi kufuneka bathathe ugonyo.
Not because they want to protect themselves, but they want to protect their colleagues at work.	Hayi ngokuba befuna ukuzikhusela, kodwa bafuna ukukhusela abantu abasebenza nabo emsebenzini.
Scientific evidence has it that if you are fully vaccinated it comes with a mild attack.	Ubungqina benzululwazi buthi ukuba ugonywe ngokupheleleyo luza nohlaselo olungephi.
Why not take up that? There is nothing wrong or sinister about it," he said.	Kutheni ungayithathi loo nto? Akukho nto iphosakeleyo okanye imbi ngayo,” utshilo.
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.	Bamalunga ne-3.3 yezigidi abantu eZimbabwe abaye bafumana izitofu ezimbini ze-COVID-19, ngelixa malunga ne-86,000 befumene isitofu sesithathu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.	Uninzi lwabantu baseZimbabwe abavumi ukugonywa, besithi abawathembi amayeza ogonyo eSinopharm kunye neSinovac enziwa eChina..
	
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa	Iikontraka zomkhosi zabucala zixhasa impembelelo yeRussia eAfrika
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" — an entity with no known legal status.	Amabhongo e-Russia malunga nezejiyografi kunye nezopolitiko e-Afrika kule minyaka yakutsha nje aye axhaswa ngoonokontraka babucala bazomkhosi, abasoloko bechazwa ngokuba ngamalungu "iWagner" - iqumrhu elingaziwayo ngokwasemthethweni.
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.	Kutshanje, izizwe zaseNtshona zikugxekile ukufika kwamajoni aseRussia kwikomkhulu laseMali iBamako, ibango elaliweyo yiJunta eyathatha amandla okuphatha ngo-2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.	Njenokuba ubudlelwane neFrance busiya busiba mandundu, abalawuli basemkhosini banokuthi bakhangela iindlela zokulungiselela ukuncipha kwenani lemikhosi yaseYurophu ebikade isilwa ukuvukela kweJihadist yaseMali iminyaka.
Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank.	IiMercs [amajoni] asebenza e-Afrika yinto eqhelekileyo" ngenxa yamashumi eminyaka yokusebenza kweekontraka ezivela eMzantsi Afrika, utshilo uJason Blazakis weqela labacingi iSoufan eliseNew York.
The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk," he added.	Abantu bakwaWagner bangena kumnyango ekudala uvulelwe uhlobo lwabo,” wongeze watsho.
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.	Akukho lwazi lukhoyo lufumanekayo malunga nobungakanani beliqela okanye ubume bezimali yalo.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.	Kodwa malunga ne-Afrika, iCenter for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) eWashington ifumene ubungqina ukususela ngo2016 amajoni aseRassia e-Fortune eSudan, eSouth Sudan, eLibya, kwiCentral African Republic (CAR), iMadagascar kunye neMozambique.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.	I-Botswana, iBurundi, iChad, iComoros, iDemocratic Republic of Congo, iCongo-Brazzaville, iGuinea, iGuinea-Bissau, iNigeria kunye neZimbabwe nazo zikuluhlu lweCSIS.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP.	E-Afrika "kukho ukuhlangana korhulumento lwamazwe amaninzi , oku kubandakanya iChina," u-Alexey Mukhin weCenter for Political Information eseMoscow utsho njalo  kwi-AFP.
Every state has the right to defend its business assets," he added.	Wonke urhulumente unelungelo lokukhusela inzuzo yeshishini lakhe,” wongeze watsho.
	
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.	iWagner ayikho ngokusemthethweni, kwaye akukho kubhaliswa kwenkampani, iimbuyekezo zerhafu okanye inkcukaca zombutho ezifumanekayo.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.	Ngethuba i-EU yayifuna ukugweba eliqela ngo-2020, yayijolise kumphathi onamandla  waseRussia u-Yevgeny Prigozhin, umlingani kaMongameli u-Vladimir Putin okrokrelwa ngokukhokela iWagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow.	Yabeka ezinye izohlwayo ngoDisemba kulo nyaka uphelileyo xa ukufika kwamajoni eMali kubonakala ngokuqinisekileyo - kutyholwa "ukungabina ngqiqo" okuvela eMoscow.
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.	Iingcali zaseNtshona zithi iikontraka zomkhosi zifakwe kwimikhosi esemthethweni yaseRussia njengee-arhente zobuntlola kunye nomkhosi, zinika inkxaso iMosco ngokuyikhanyelela.
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee.	Ukuthunyelwa kwabo kumazwe aseAfrika kujolise "ekubeni iRussia ikwazi ukuba... iphinde ifumane elinqanaba lempembelelo" elatshabalala ukuwa kweSoviet Union, utshilo umphandi weCSIS uCatrina Doxsee.
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.	Ubukho bamajoni buya bukhula ngokukhawuleza ukusukela kwingqungquthela yeRussia-Afrika summit yango-2019.
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.	IMoscow ibisebenza “ingakumbi kwindawo ebikade inempembelelo zaseFrance” kwiindawo ezazisakuba yimihlaba yabo ezifana neCAR neMali, utshilo uDjallil Lounnas, umphandi kwiyunivesithi yase-Al Akhawayn yaseMorocco.
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said.	Ngelixa iikontraka zomkhosi ngamanye amaxesha zikhulisa ukuthengiswa kwezixhobo zaseRussia, ingeniso "incinci kakhulu xa ithelekiswa nengeniso abakwaziyo ukuyenza kwiimvumelwano zemigodi kunye nokufikelela kwimithombo yendalo," utshilo uDoxsee.
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.	Oko kwenza amazwe angazinzanga aneeminerali okanye ubutyebi be-hydrocarbon abathengi abaphambili - njengaseSyria apho la majoni aqala ukwaziwa kuluntu ngokubanzi.
No questions asked	Kungekho mibuzo ibuzwayo
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.	U-Lounnas uthe enye inzuzo kubathengi kukunqongophala kwengxabano kumalungelo oluntu kunye nedemokhrasi enokuthi ize namaqabane aseNtshona.
Russia has its interests.	IRussia inezinto enomdla kuzo.
It doesn't ask questions," he added.	Ayibuzi mibuzo, ”wongeze watsho.
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.	Iingxelo zobundlobongela kunye nokuphathwa gadalala aphoi zibonakalisa ukuba inkululeko efanayo inokufikelela kumajoni ngokwawo.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.	Kwi-CAR, umbutho weZizwe Ezimanyeneyo uphonononga ukubulawa kwabantu abaninzi ngethuba kusebenzisana umkhosi karhulumente kunye namajoni weWagner.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions."	Oyimpimpi yasemkhosini uxelele i-AFP ukuba bangaphezulu kwe-50 abantu ababhubhileyo, abanye " bebulawa emva kokuthyolwa."
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.	NgoLwesine, i-European Union ithe ayizukuphinda iqhubeke noqeqesho lwasemkhosini e-CAR - enqunyanyisiwe ukusukela phakathi kuDisemba - ngaphandle kokuba amajoni elizwe ayeke ukusebenzela iWagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.	Ngeloxesha iziphumo zalamajoni azisoloko zifikelela kumathemba oorhulumente ababaqeshileyo.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.	E-Libya, amajoni aseRussia afumana ilahleko enkulu kumzamo wonyaka ka-Marshal Khalifa Haftar wokoyisa ikomkhulu i-Tripoli, engazange iphumelele.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.	Kwaye eMozambique, amaRussia arhoxa ebusweni beqela lama-Jihadists e-Islamic State, ekugqibeleni boyiswa ngabo bakhuphisana noMzantsi Afrika.
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said.	Nangona bengenazo izakhono zolwimi kunye namava kule ndawo, iWagner "yachongwa ngenxa yokuba yayiyeyona inexabiso eliphantsi", utshilo uDoxsee.
They didn't have what it took to succeed," she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa.	“Babengenako konke okudingekayo ukuze baphumelele,” wongeze watsho, ephawula ukuba “babenoko ukusilela okumbalwa” kwi-Afrika iphela.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.	Ukuphumelela ngokupheleleyo kusenokwenzakalisa ishishini labarhwebi, eliqhuba kakuhle kwisiphithiphithi, ungquzulwano kunye nobunzima.
If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed," Doxsee said.	“Ukuba ilizwe elinje ngeCAR libaqeshele ukuqeqesha imikhosi, ukubanceda kwiinzame zabo zomkhosi, kubalukelike ukuba kuyiphumeza oko ukuze baqhubeke nokuqeshwa,” utshilo uDoxsee.
If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."	Ukuba ngenene bebengayenza kakuhle ngokwaneleyo ukusombulula impixano, bekungazokubakho sidingo sabo.

Batsirai has weakened," Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening.	“I-Batsirai ibuthathaka,” utshilo uMeteo Madagascar, esongeza ukuba isantya somoya esiphakathi kwalenkanyamba siphantse sehla ukuya kuma-80 kph, ngethuba ezona mvula zivuthuza ngamandla ziye zehla zaya kutsho kwi-110 kph ukusuka kuma-235 aqwalaselweyo xa ifike ngokuhlwa kwangoMgqibelo.
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.	Inkanyamba, isaqhwithi sesibini esihlasele ilizwe elikhulu lesiqithi selwandle iIndian Ocean kwiiveki nje ezimbalwa, sasisiya ngasentshona ngesantya se-19 kph, zatsho iinkonzo zemozulu.
But "localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains," it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday.	Kodwa "izantyalantyala zemvula okanye iimpuphuma zasekuhlaleni zisoyikwa emva kweemvula ezinkulu," yatsho, isongeza ukuba iBatsirai kulindeleke ukuba ivele elwandle kwijelo laseMozambique kamva ngeCawe.
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.	I-Batsirai yenze ukunkuphuka komhlabal kwisithili saseMananjary, ngaphezulu kweekhilomitha ezingama-530 kumazantsi mpuma we-Antananarivo, malunga ngezithuba zo-8 ngorhatya lexesha lendawo (1700 GMT) ngoMgqibelo.
It reached the island as an "intense tropical cyclone", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP.	Ifike kwisiqithi "njengenkanyamba enkulu", ephethe imimoya engama-165 kph, uFaly Aritiana Fabien we-arhente yokulawula iintlekele yelizwe uxelele i-AFP.
The national meteorological office has said it fears "significant and widespread damage."	I-ofisi yemozulu yelizwe ithe yoyika "umonakalo omkhulu kwaye owndileyo."
Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.	Kwiyure nje enesiqingatha emva kokuba ifikile emhlabeni, phantse abantu abangama-27,000 babalwe njengangasenawo makhaya, utshilo uFabien.
He said his office has accommodation sites, food and medical care ready for victims, as well as search and rescue plans already in place.	Uthe iofisi yakhe ineendawo zokuhlala, ukutya kunye nokhathalelo lwezonyango olulungele amaxhoba, kunye nezicwangciso zokukhangela nokuhlangula ezisele zikhona.
Very serious threat'	Ingozi enkulu kakhulu'
The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present "a very serious threat" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days.	Inkonzo yemozulu yaseMeteo-France yaxela kwangaphambili ukuba iBatsirai uza kuba "yingozi enkulu" eMadagascar, emva kokudlula eMauritius kwaye yamanzisa isiqithi saseFrance iLa Reunion ngemvula enkulu iintsuku ezimbini.
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly tropical storm Ana late last month.	Kwiiyure ezingaphambi kokuba inkanyamba ifike, abahlali baqubuda bazifika kwelizwe lizihluphekelayo, besachacha kubhubhani wenkanyama iAna ekhupheleni kwenyanga.
	
In the eastern coastal town of Vatomandry, more than 200 people were crammed in one room in a Chinese-owned concrete building.	Kwidolophu esempuma yonxweme yaseVatomandry, abantu abangaphezu kwama-200 babexinaniselene kwigumbi elinye kwisakhiwo sekonkile samaTshayina.
Families slept on mats or mattresses.	Iintsapho zazilala kwiimethi okanye koomandlalo.
Community leader Thierry Louison Leaby lamented the lack of clean water after the water utility company turned off supplies ahead of the cyclone.	Inkokeli yabahlali uThierry Louison Leaby ukhale ngokungabikho kwamanzi acocekileyo emva kokuba inkampani esebenza ngamanzi yacima izixhobo ngaphambi kwenkanyamba.
People are cooking with dirty water," he said, amid fears of a diarrhea outbreak.	“Abantu bapheka ngamanzi amdaka,” utshilo, phakathi koloyiko lokuqhambuka korhudo.
Outside plastic dishes and buckets were placed in a line to catch rainwater dripping from the corrugated roofing sheets.	Ngaphandle izitya zeplastiki kunye nee-emele zazibekwe emgceni ukuze kubanjwe amanzi emvula athontsiza kumacangci ophahla.
The government must absolutely help us. We have not been given anything," he said.	“Urhulumente makasincede ngokupheleleyo, akukho kwanto esikhe sayifumana,” utshilo.
Residents who chose to remain in their homes used sandbags and yellow jerrycans to buttress their roofs.	Abahlali abakhethe ukuhlala emakhayeni abo babesebenzisa iingxowa zesanti neejeri ezityheli ukuze baqinise uphahla lwabo.
Cyclone still 'dangerous'	Inkanyamba 'iseyingozi'
Other residents of Vatomandry were stockpiling supplies in preparation for the storm.	Abanye abahlali baseVatomandry babeqokelela izixhobo belungiselela inkanyamba.
We have been stocking up for a week, rice but also grains because with the electricity cuts we cannot keep meat or fish," said Odette Nirina, a 65-year-old hotelier in Vatomandry.	“Sineveki siqokelela izixhobo, irayisi kodwa neenkozo kuba ngenxa yokunqanyulwa kombane asikwazi ukugcina inyama okanye intlanzi,” utshilo u-Odette Nirina, oneminyaka engama-65 ubudala waseHolelier eVatomandry.
I have also stocked up on coal. Here we are used to cyclones," she told AFP.	Ndikwaqokelele namalahle. Apha siyiqhelile inkanyamba, uxelele i-AFP.
Winds of more than 50 kph pummeled Vatomandry on Saturday morning, accompanied by intermittent rain.	Imimoya engaphezulu kwe-50 kph ibethe i-Vatomandry ngentsasa yangoMgqibelo, ihamba nemvula.
The disaster agency said the cyclone was expected to remain "dangerous" as it swept across the large island overnight and in the morning.	I-arhente yeentlekele yathi inkanyamba bekulindeleke ukuba ihlale "iyingozi" njengoko ikhukulise isiqithi esikhulu ngobusuku nasekuseni.
Flooding is expected due to excessive rainfall in the east, southeast and central regions of the country, it warned.	ukudama kwamanzi kulindelekile ngenxa yokuna kwemvula emandla kwimpuma, kumzantsi-mpuma nakumbindi welizwe, ilumkisile.
The United Nations was ramping up its preparedness with aid agencies, placing rescue aircraft on standby and stockpiling humanitarian supplies.	IZizwe eziManyeneyo zazinyusa ukulungela kwazo ngee-arhente zoncedo, zibeka iinqwelomoya zokuhlangula kwindawo elindileyo kwaye ziqokelela izixhobo zokunceda abantu.
At least 131,000 people were affected by Ana across Madagascar in late January.	Ubuncinci abantu abayi-131,000 bachaphazeleka nguAna kulo lonke elaseMadagascar ngasekupheleni kukaJanuwari.
Close to 60 people were killed, mostly in the capital Antananarivo.	Bamalunga nama-60 abantu ababuleweyo, uninzi lwabo kwikomkhulu iAntananarivo.
That storm also hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, causing dozens of deaths.	Lenkanyamba ikwahlasele iMalawi, iMozambique kunye neZimbabwe, yabulala abantu abaninzi.
The U.N.'s World Food Program pointed to estimates from national authorities that some 595,000 people could be directly affected by Batsirai, and 150,000 more might be displaced due to new landslides and flooding.	I-World Food Programme ye-UN yalatha kuqikelelo oluvela kwabasemagunyeni belizwe ukuba abantu abamalunga nama-595,000 banokuchatshazelwa ngokuthe ngqo yiBatsirai, kwaye abongezelweyo abayi-150,000 bangashiyeka bengenamakhaya ngenxa yokudilika komhlaba okutsha kunye nokudama kwamanzi.
The storm poses a risk to at least 4.4 million people in one way or another, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.	Le nkanyamba ibeka engokuzi ubuncinane i-4.4 yezigidi zabantu ngendlela enye okanye enye, i-International Federation ye-Red Cross kunye ne-Red Crescent Societies yathetha yenjenjalo.
	
US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa	Ukunqongophala kwabefundisi bamaKhatholika base-US kuncitshiswe ngabaqeshwa abasuka e-Afrika
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.	Umfundisi uAthanasius Chidi Abanulo - esebenzisa izakhono ezihlonitshiweyo kwilizwe lakhe laseAfrika ukuze alungiselele ngokufanelekileyo emaphandleni ase-Alabama - umisela ixesha elide anokulolula iiholide zakhe zangeCawe ngokusekelwe ekubeni ngubani ohleli ezitulweni.
Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee.	Imizuzu esixhenxe yeyona ndawo imnandi kuninzi lwamarhamente amhlophe nasele esidla umhlala-phantsi azimase uMthendeleko wolwimi lwesiNgesi e-Immaculate Conception Catholic Church kwidolophu encinci yaseWedowee.
If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people," he said.	“Ukuba udlulela ngaphaya koko, ulahlekelwa yingqalelo yabantu,” utshilo.
For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. 	KwiMisa yolwimi lwesiSpanish kwiyure kamva, umfundisi owazalelwa eNigeria - omnye wabefundisi abaninzi baseAfrika okhonza e-US - uyazi ukuba angaliphindaphinda kane ixesha lakhe lokufundisa.
	
The more you preach, the better for them," he said.	Wathi: “njekokuba esiya eshumayela, kukhona kuba ngcono kubo.
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.	Njengoko esuka kwesinye isikhundla saseMelika esiya kwesinye, u-Abanulo uye wafunda indlela yokwenza ubulungiseleli bakhe obulungele inkcubeko yoluntu alukhonzayo ngelixa efaka umoya welizwe lakhe kwisingqi seMisa.
Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church," Abanulo said.	“Abantu baseNigeria bayakhululeka xa besiza enkonzweni,” utshilo uAbanulo.
They love to sing, they love to dance.	“Bayakuthanda ukucula, bayakuthanda ukudanisa.
The liturgy can last for two hours.	Inkonzo yonqulo inokuthatha iiyure ezimbini.
They don't worry about that."	Abazikhathazi ngaloo nto.
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church.	Ngexesha lakhe leminyaka eli-18 e-US, u-Abanulo uye wathabatha iindima ezahlukeneyo zobufundisi kwilizwe liphela, ebonisa imeko eqhubekayo kwinkonzo yaseMelika yamaKatolika.
As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.	Njengoko embalwa amadoda nabasetyhini abazalelwe eMelika abangena kwiiseminari nakwiindawo zoonongendi, iidayosisi zase-US kunye namaziko obuKatolika aguqukele ekufuneni abantu bamanye amazwe ukuze bavale ezo izithuba.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica.	IDiocese of Birmingham, apho uAbanulo ekhokela amarhamente amabini, iye yandisa iphulo layo lokukhangela abefundisi kwiindawo ezinobizo lwenkolo olugqugqisayo njengeNigeria neCameroon, utshilo uBhishophu waseBirmingham uSteven Raica.
Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.	Abefundisi baseAfrika nabo babebalulekile kwidayosisi yaseMichigan apho uRaica wayekhonza khona ngaphambili.
They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us," he said.	“Babeluncedo olukhulu kuthi ukuze sikwazi ukubonelela ngobubanzi nobume bobulungiseleli esinabo kuthi,” utshilo.
Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region.	IAfrika ngowona mmandla ukhula ngokukhawuleza kwicawa yamaKatolika.
There, the seminaries are "fairly full," said the Rev.	Khona, iiseminari "zigcwele ngokufanelekileyo," watsho uMfundisi.
Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church falling numbers.	Thomas Gaunt, umlawuli weGeorgetown University Centre for Applied Research in the Apostolate, eqhuba uphando malunga necawa yamaKatolika enamanani ahlayo.
	
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.	Kwahlukile e-US apho inkonzo yamaKatolika ijongene nemiqobo ekufuneni abefundisi abakhulele ekhaya emva kwamashumi eminyaka yokuhla kokuya enkonzweni kunye neziphumo ezonakalisayo zokuxhatshazwa kwabefundisi ngokwesondo.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership.	Amabhinqa angamaKatolika namadoda atshatileyo ahlala ethintelwe ekubeni ngababingeleli; Iingxoxo zokuba ukususwa kwezo zithintelo kuya kunciphisa ukunqongophala kwabefundisi azizange zifumane ukuhambela phambili kwiinkokeli eziphezulu zenkolo.
What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country," Gaunt said.	“Into esinayo linani elincinane kakhulu ukuqala kwiminyaka yoo-1970 labantu abangena kwiiseminari okanye kwiinkomfa kwilizwe lonke,” utshilo uGaunt.
Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."	Abo bangena ngeminyaka yee-50s kunye nee-60s ngoku sele bekhulile, kwaye ke amanani amiselwa ingakumbi ngokusweleka kwabantu.
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center.	Ukususela ku-1970 ukuya ku-2020, inani lababingeleli e-US lehla nge-60%, ngokolwazi olusuka kwiziko laseGeorgetown.
This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama.	Oku kushiye amarhamente angaphezu kwama-3,500 engenamfundisi ongumhlali. U-Abanulo wongamela amarhamente amabini kumaphandle ase-Alabama.
His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line.	ICawa yakhe eqhelekileyo iqala ngeMisa yolwimi lwesiNgesi kwi-Holy Family Catholic Church eLanett, malunga neekhilomitha ezingama-200 (125 yemiles) ukusuka eBirmingham ecaleni yemida yelizwe lase-Alabama-Georgia.
After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.	Emva koko, uqhuba iyure ukuya emantla eWedowee, apho abhiyozela khona iMisa enye ngesiNgesi, enye ngeSpanish.
He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories," said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988.	“Utsho nje ngengoma kunye neentetho zakhe ezininzi, unxulumanisa ubukhwenkwe bakhe, kwaye ndiyathanda ukuva loo mabali,” utshilo u-Amber Moosman, utitshala webanga lokuqala nobelikholwa kwi-Holy Family ukusukela ngo-1988.
For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. "There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that.	KuMoosman, isimbo sika-Abanulo sokushumayela sahluke kakhulu kubefundisi awayebabone ngaphambili. "Kwakungekho ngequbuliso, yokuba umfundisi acule, akukho nto injalo.
… It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict," she said.	… kwakuthe cwaka kakhulu, kunesithethe, kungqongqo kakhulu,” utshilo.
It's a lot different now."	Yahluke kakhulu ngoku.
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate paster in the Diocese of Oakland, Califonia, where his ministry focused on the fast growing Nigerian Catholic Community.	U-Abanulo wamiselwa eNigeria ngo-1990 kwaye weza e-US ngo-2003 emva kokuhlala e-Chad. Indima yakhe yokuqala yase-US yaba kuba ngumfundisi omncinci esebenza kwidayosisi yase-Oakland, eCalifornia, apho ubulungiseleli bakhe bugxile kubuKatolika baseNigeria abakhula ngokukhawuleza kuluntu.
	
Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.	Ukusukela ngoko, ube ngumfundisi wesibhedlele kunye nomfundisi eNashville, eTennessee, kunye nomfundisi kwiYunivesithi yaseAlabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.	Phakathi kokunqongophala kwabefundisi eU.S, oodade bonqulo baye nabo bafumane ukuhla okuqatha, bahle nge-75% ukususela ngowe-1970, ngokutsho kweziko laseGeorgetown.
Culture shocks	Inkcubeko iyothusa
When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, "Where is West Virginia?"	Ngethuba uMaria Sheri Rukwishuro waxelelwa ukuba wayethunywe kwiSisters of the Infant Jesus order eZimbabwe ukuya kusebenza eWest Virginia ukuba abe ngunongendi ongumvangeli wasemazweni, wabuza unina ophetheyo, “Iphi iWest Virginia?”
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.	Wayesoyika, exhalabile ngoko angakwaziyo.
What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country," Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004.	Ndiya kubantu abanjani? Ndingunongendi omnyama ohambele  kwilizwe elimhlophe, uRukwishuro uxelele i-Associated Press yaseClarksburg, eWest Virginia, apho ebefundisa khona imfundo yezenkolo kubafundi besikolo sikawonkewonke kunye namaKatolika ukususela oko efikile. ngo-2004.
Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and "rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank.	URukwishuro ukhumbula kakuhle ukuba kwintshayelelo yakhe, kwafika intombazana encinane kuye "yayihlikihla umnwe wayo kwiminwe yam yonke, emva koko yajonga umnwe wayo wancuma kodwa intliziyo yam yababuhlungu.
… She thought I was dirty." Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming.	… Wayecinga ukuba ndimdaka.” Nangona kunjalo, uRukwishuro uthi abantu abaninzi baye bandamkela ngezandla ezishushu.
She's now a U.S. citizen and says,	Ngoku ungummi wase-US kwaye uthi,
It feels like home."	Kuvakala ngathi kusekhaya.
One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall.	Enye yezinto ezamothusayo yokuqala zenkcubeko yaba kukuwa kwekhephu ngobusuku.
I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world," she said.	“Ndakhala kakhulu. Ndandicinga ukuba sisiphelo sehlabathi,” watsho.
Now I love it.	Ngoku ndiyalithanda.
I do my meditations to that."	Ndenza iingcinga zam ezinzulu kuloo."
During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.	Ngethuba lukudityaniswa kwabo kubomi baseMelika, kuyinto eqhelekileyo ukuba abefundisi abasandul’ ukufika bajongane nomothuko kwicala lezenkcubeko.
For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation.	KuDade uChristiana Onyewuche waseNigeria, umfundisi wesibhedlele saseBoston owayesenza izithethe zokugqibela ngokufa, yayikukutshiswa kwesidumbu.
She recalled thinking, "Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine."	Wakhumbula ecinga, "Nyani? ... Bangamtshisa njani umntu? Andikwazi nokuyicinga lonto."
She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.	Weza e-US kwiminyaka eli-18 eyadlulayo kwaye ngaphambili wasebenza njengomongameli weAfrican Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, iqela lenkxaso yabavangeli basemazweni base-Afrika abakhonza e-U.S.
	
Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve.	UOnyewuche uthe abefundisi baseAfrika banokujamelana nocelomngeni lokunxibelelana nabantu baseMelika ababancedayo.
To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.	Ukulungisa oku, iidayosisi ezininzi zinike uqeqesho lokuthambisa intlela abathetha ngayo, utshilo. U-Abanulo, ohambe kuqeqesho e-Oakland, uthi oko kwamnceda ukuba acothise intetho yakhe kwaye aphucule nendlela abiza ngayo.
Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.	U-Abanulo, owafudukela e-Alabama ngo-2020, uyavuma ukuba ekuqaleni wayenexhala malunga nokungeniswa kwakhe kwamva nje, nto leyo eyayithetha ukutshintshiselana ngendima yakhe njengomfundisi waseyunivesithi etshintshelwa kumarhamente amabini asemaphandleni.
People were telling me 'Father, don't go there.	“Abantu babesithi kum ‘Mfundisi, musa ukuya apho.
The people there are rednecks,'" he said.	Abantu baphaya ngabantu bohlanga lweRednecks,” utshilo.
But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, "There are no rednecks here.	Kodwa emva konyaka, kunye nokwamkelwa ngokufudumeleyo, uthi ngoku uxelela abahlobo bakhe, "Akukho hlanga lweRednecks apha.
All I see are Jesus necks."	Ekuphela kwento endiyibonayo ngabantu bakaYesu.

The U.S. will lift travel restrictions to eight southern African countries on New Year's Eve, the White House announced Friday.	I-US iza kuphakamisa izithintelo zokuhamba ukuya kumazwe asibhozo aseMazantsi e-Afrika ngosuku oluphambi  koNyaka oMtsha, i-White House yabhengeza ngoLwesihlanu.
The restrictions, imposed last month, were meant to blunt the spread of the COVID omicron variant.	Izithintelo, ezibekwe kwinyanga ephelileyo, zenzelwe ukuphazamisa ukusasazeka kwe-COVID omicron uhlobo olutsha lwesisifo.

White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said on Twitter that the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	Isithethi se-White House uKevin Munoz uthe kuTwitter ukuba isigqibo sicetyiswe yiCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
Munoz said the temporary travel bans bought scientists necessary time to study the new virus variant and conclude that the current vaccinations are effective in blunting its impact.	UMunoz uthe izithintelo zokwethutyana malunga nohambo zinike izazinzulu ixesha ebezilidinga lokufunda uhlobo olutsha lwentsholongwane kwaye zigqibe kwelokuba ugonyo olukhoyo luyasebenza ekulweni impembelelo zesisifo.
Omicron is now spreading rapidly throughout the U.S., including among the vaccinated, but a huge majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated.	I-Omicron ngoku isasazeka ngokukhawuleza kulo lonke elase-US, kubandakanywa nabagonyiweyo, kodwa uninzi lwabo balaliswe esibhedlele abagonywanga.
The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron," Munoz wrote on Twitter.	Izithintelo zisinike ixesha lokuqonda i-Omicron kwaye siyazi ukuba amayeza ethu ogonyo akhoyo asebenza ngokuchasene ne-Omicron," utshilo uMunoz kuTwitter.
	
Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending	Uwenza isakhelo ngekamva leeprojekthi zeziseko zophuhliso zaseChina e-Afrika emva kweshumi leminyaka lokuboleka 
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas.	I-China ixhasa ngezezimali ulwakhiwo lwemizi-mveliso emine yokuphehla umbane ngamalahle kuMazantsi e-Afrika, nangona yayenze isibhambathiso sayo malunga nesimo sezulu ngoSeptemba sokuyeka ukuxhasa oluhlobo lwezeseko zophuhliso phesheya kolwandle.
But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.	Kodwa amaziko amatsha aqala ukumila eMzantsi Afrika naseZimbabwe lutyalo-mali olukhulu lwaseBeijing kwizikhululo zeenqwelomoya, imizila kaloliwe kunye nezinye iziseko zelizwe kwilizwekazi lase-Afrika.
Many countries have been eager for the investment, but mounting levels of debt over the past five years are raising doubts about the long-term prospects for more expensive infrastructure projects.	Amazwe amaninzi ebelulangazelela utyalo-mali, kodwa ukunyuka kwenqanaba lamatyala kule minyaka mihlanu idlulileyo anyusa ukuthandabuza malunga nethemba lexesha elide leeprojekthi zeziseko ezingundoqo ezisexabisweni eliphezulu.
	
China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down.	I-China izibophelele ekubolekeni amazwe ase-Afrika i-153 yeebhiliyoni zeedola ukusuka ngo-2000-2019, kodwa isantya sokuboleka imali sinokucotha.
Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.	Izibophelelo zemali-mboleko yaseTshayina zehle ngama-30% ngo-2019 xa kuthelekiswa nonyaka ophelileyo, ngokutsho kweNyathelo loPhando lwaseTshayina-Afrika kwiSikolo seYunivesithi yaseJohns Hopkins yeZifundo eziPhakamileyo zaMazwe ngaMazwe.
The research looks at loan commitments which get "disbursed to borrowers as projects are implemented."	Uphando lujonga izibophelelo zemali-mboleko ethi "ihlawulwe kubaboleki njengoko kuphunyezwa iiprojekthi."
In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.	Ngokomzekelo, eZambia, abaxhamli bezimali baseTshayina baboleka i-10.3 yeebhiliyoni zeerandi kwimali-mboleko ukususela ngowama-2000 ukuya ku-2010.
Uganda now owes China $200 million for its only international airport, fanning fears that China could seize it.	I-Uganda ngoku ityala i-China i-200 yezigidi zeedola kwisikhululo seenqwelomoya sayo kuphela, esoyikela ukuba i-China inokusithimba.
Both countries have rejected speculation in African media outlets of a Chinese takeover.	Omabini la mazwe ayikhabile intelekelelo kumajelo eendaba ase-Afrika malunga nokuthathwa kweTshayina.
Loan repayment measures  Neighboring Kenya had received a $4.5 billion loan to build a railway from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, and China indicates it will redo the terms after a committee of the African countrys parliament found that operating losses and debt to Chinese banks were straining taxpayers.	Amanyathelo okubuyisela imali-mboleko Ummelwane waseKenya ufumene imali-mboleko ye-4.5 yeebhiliyoni zeerandi zokwakha uloliwe osuka eNairobi usiya kwisixeko saseMombasa, kwaye iChina ibonisa ukuba iza kuphinda iphinde ilandele imigaqo emva kokuba ikomiti yepalamente yamazwe ase-Afrika ifumanise ukuba ilahleko yokusebenza kunye namatyala kwiibhanki zaseTshayina. ukucinezela abahlawuli berhafu.
Some analysts have warned that opaque lending terms means China could eventually seize infrastructure should countries struggle to meet repayments	Abanye abahlalutyi balumkisile ukuba imiqathango yokuboleka imali e-opaque ithetha ukuba i-China inokubamba iziseko zophuhliso ukuba amazwe ayasokola ukuhlawula.
U.S. and British officials say, "debt traps," where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time.	Amagosa aseMelika kunye neBhritane athi, "amatyala," apho amazwe angenako ukuqokelela imali eyaneleyo yokubuyisela imali mboleko yaseTshayina, acwangciselwe ukunika amandla iBeijing ngokuhamba kwexesha.
Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire "significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera."	Kwinyanga ephelileyo, intloko yeBritish Secret Intelligence Service, uRichard Moore, kudliwano-ndlebe ne-BBC Radio 4 yathi iBeijing inokufumana "amachweba abalulekileyo anokuba ngamaziko omkhosi wamanzi njl njl."
Sri Lanka earlier this year passed legislation that critics say will give China control over a key deep-water port that Beijing financed.	I-Sri Lanka ekuqaleni kwalo nyaka ipasise umthetho abathi abagxeki baya kunika i-China ukulawula izibuko eliphambili lamanzi anzulu elixhaswe yiBeijing.
But that has not happened so far in Africa, where Chinese diplomats reject seizures are a part of Beijings strategy.	Kodwa oko akwenzekanga ukuza kuthi ga ngoku e-Afrika, apho oonozakuzaku baseTshayina besala ukubanjwa yinxalenye yeqhinga laseBeijing.
Not a single project in Africa has ever been "confiscated" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans.	Akukho nanye iprojekthi e-Afrika eyake yahluthwa yi-China ngenxa yokusilela ukuhlawula imali-mboleko yaseChina
On the contrary, China firmly supports and is willing to continue our efforts to improve Africa's capacity for home-driven development," stated the Chinese Embassy in Uganda.	Ngokuchasene noko, i-China ixhasa ngokuqinileyo kwaye izimisele ukuqhubeka nemigudu yethu yokuphucula amandla e-Afrika kuphuhliso oluqhutywa ekhaya, "watsho uMzi wozakuzo waseChina eUganda.
Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA.	Endaweni yokubamba i-asethi, iBeijing inokwandisa ixesha lokuhlawula imali-mboleko okanye imiqathango yokubuyisela kwakhona njengenzala, abahlalutyi baxelele iVOA.
Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms.	Loo manyathelo anokuthi athintele ukuthathwa kweziseko zophuhliso ngokwawo kwaye agcine isidima samaChina e-Afrika apho urhwebo kunye nokuboleka imali kuye kwagqwesa lowo unamandla amakhulu ngokweedola.
China will probably "keep kicking the can down the road" until creditors find the means to settle the loans, Bulelani Jili, an African studies Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, told VOA.	I-China ngokuqinisekileyo iya "kuqhubeka ikhaba itoti ezantsi kwendlela" de ababolekisi bafumane iindlela zokuhlawula imali-mboleko, u-Bulelani Jili, ongumfundi wase-Afrika we-Ph.D. umviwa kwiYunivesithi yaseHarvard, uxelele iVOA.
To confiscate any assets, including minerals, would "confirm peoples initial biases of China as a neocolonial actor," Jili said, and risk upsetting diplomatic ties with "some of the few friends that China has on the global stage."	Ukuthimba nayiphi na impahla, kubandakanya nezimbiwa, "kuya kuqinisekisa ukuthambekela kwabantu baseChina njengomdlali we-neocolonial," utshilo uJili, kunye nomngcipheko wokuphazamisa ubudlelwane bezozakuzo "nabanye babahlobo abambalwa i-China enabo kwihlabathi."
From the China side, its about getting access to new possible markets and expanding both economic activity — also the diplomatic relation," he said.	Ukusuka kwicala laseChina, malunga nokufikelela kwiimarike ezintsha ezinokwenzeka kunye nokwandisa imisebenzi yoqoqosho - kunye nobudlelwane bozakuzo, utshilo.
Chinese loan concerns	Iinkxalabo zemali-mboleko yaseChina
China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.	I-China ikhuthaza ukuboleka imali kwi-Afrika ekufuneni imbuyekezo ephezulu kutyalo-mali kunye nodumo lwehlabathi jikelele njengomxhasi wamazwe ahluphekileyo, utshilo u-Edward Miguel, unjingalwazi we-Oxfam kwi-Environmental Resource Economics kwiYunivesithi yaseCalifornia, eBerkeley.
It is trying to "equal the U.S." as a donor country, he said.	Izama "ukulingana ne-U.S." njengelizwe elinikelayo, watsho.
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.	Nangona kunjalo, iTshayina yohlukile kwabanye ababolekisi bamazwe ngamazwe kunye nabaxhasi ikakhulu ngenxa yokungafihli nto okubangela imibuzo e-Afrika kunye naseNtshona, uMiguel ukholelwa ukuba.
Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as "no strings attached," which has been attractive for many countries.	Ngokungafaniyo nemali-mboleko evela koorhulumente basentshona okanye imibutho ebolekisa ngemali yamazwe ngamazwe njengeBhanki yeHlabathi, efuna ukukhuselwa kwabasebenzi kunye nokusingqongileyo kwiiprojekthi ezixhaswa ngemali, uncedo lwaseChina kunye neemali-mboleko e-Afrika ziye zachazwa ngokuthi "akukho ntambo ziqhotyoshelweyo," eziye zanomtsalane kumazwe amaninzi.
But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.	Kodwa amazwe ase-Afrika, ngakumbi uqoqosho luluhle ngenxa yeempembelelo ze-COVID-19, ajongene nengxaki eyandayo yokuhlawula imali mboleko, utshilo uHannah Ryder, ugxa omkhulu kwiNkqubo yeAfrika kwiziko lokucinga lase-US leSifundo seQhinga kunye neHlabathi.
China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another," wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article.	I-China kunye namanye amazwe aya ephucuka ngakumbi ekuxoxweni omnye nomnye, wabhala uDeborah Brautigam weSikolo se-Advanced International Studies kwiYunivesithi yaseJohns Hopkins kunye neHarvard Business School's Meg Rithmire kwinqaku elidibeneyo.
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.	Abahlali baseDakar, eSenegal, apho i-500-personment Forum ye-China-Africa Cooperation yenzeke ngoNovemba 29-30, bafuna iziseko ezingakumbi ezixhaswa ngemali yaseTshayina kodwa ngaphandle kwamanqanaba etyala njengalawo e-1990, uRyder waphawula.
Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already "sobered down" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said.	Ababolekisi baseTshayina kulindeleke ukuba baboleke imali encinci e-Afrika ukuya phambili kwaye bahlalutye ngononophelo ngakumbi iiprojekthi ezixhasa inkxaso-mali, iingcali zithi. Iimali-mboleko sele "zithobile" [zicinywe] ukusuka kwincopho ngo-2014, utshilo uJili.
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018.	Izibophelelo ngemali-mboleko kunye nolunye utyalo-mali olwenziwe kwintlanganiso yeNtsebenziswano ye-China ne-Afrika lufike kwiibhiliyoni ezingama-40 zeerandi, isinye esithathwini esingaphantsi kweebhiliyoni ezingama-60 zeerandi ezenziwe kwinkomfa enye ngowama-2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.	Ababolekisi banokulinganisa imali mboleko ngokusekwe kuqikelelo lwekamva lobhubhane xa amazwe ase-Afrika enemali eninzi, utshilo uYun Sun, umlawuli wenkqubo yaseMpuma Asia kwiziko iStimson eWashington.
Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview.	Enye inketho, uthe, kukuqinisekisa ukulingana kwamaTshayina kwiiprojekthi ezizayo njengembuyekezo yemali mboleko endala, utshilo kudliwanondlebe lweVOA.
Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while," Sun said.	Iyingozi kwezopolitiko, kuba nangona ingelulo utshintshiselwano lwe-asethi, inuka kakhulu njengokutshintshana, kwaye [ukuba] i-China ixhaphaza isikhundla esibuthathaka saseAfrika, ngoko andicingi ukuba kuya kwenzeka kwixesha elizayo kwaye enyanisweni. olu hlengahlengiso lwetyala luthatha ixesha,” utshilo uSun.
China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary.	I-China iya isiba nokuzithemba ngakumbi ngalo lonke eli xesha ekusekeni intsebenziswano phakathi kwamashishini abucala namazwe ngamazwe, nangona amazwe amaninzi ase-Afrika esaxhalabile malunga nokuphindaphinda ingxaki yamatyala ngeminyaka yoo-1980 noo-1990 xa amazwe ayengakwazi ukuhlawula amatyala, utshilo uRyder kwingxelo yoShishino lwase-Afrika. .
International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening "their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs	Imibutho yezizwe ngezizwe ekugqibeleni yalicima elatyala elingafikelelekiyo ngeemeko ezibandakanya ukuvula "uqoqosho lwabo kurhwebo lwamazwe ngamazwe, ukukhulula iimali zabo kunye nokunciphisa kakhulu iindleko.
in exchange for loans," wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies.	ukutshintshiselana ngemali-mboleko,” wabhala uPeter Fabricius kwiZiko leZifundo zoKhuseleko.
Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking "what did we agree to do" and "how much do we owe" China.	Ukukhawuleza ukuza ngoku, kunye nemali-mboleko evela e-China, amazwe ase-Afrika, uMiguel uthe, bahlala bebuza ukuba "sivumelene ukwenza ntoni" kwaye "sityala malini" e-China.
	
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers	IDutch yenza uvavanyo lohlobo olutsha lwesisifo emva kokufumana abantu abangama-61 abane-COVID phakathi kwabakhweli boMzantsi Afrika.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.	Abasemagunyeni kwezempilo baseDutch bathi ngoMgqibelo bafumene abantu abayi-61 abanesifo se-COVID-19 phakathi kwabantu ababhabhe ngenqwelomoya ngolweSihlanu besuka eMzantsi Afrika kwaye ngoku besenza olunye uvavanyo ukubona ukuba ingaba bakho na abosulelwe luhlobo olutsha lwesifo i-omicron.
The cases were discovered among around 600 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on two flights Friday before the Dutch government halted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.	Ezizigulane zifunyanwe phakathi kwabakhweli abamalunga nama-600 abafike kwisikhululo seenqwelomoya i-Amsterdam Schiphol ngeenqwelomoya ezimbini ngolweSihlanu phambi kokuba urhulumente waseDutch amise iinqwelo moya ezisuka emazantsi eAfrika ngenxa yenkxalabo malunga nohlobo olutsha lwesisifo.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they also would seek to contact travelers who had arrived from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe since Monday and urge them to take a test as soon as possible.	Abaphathi bezempilo baseDutch bathi ngoMgqibelo bazakufuna ukunxibelelana nabahambi abafike bevela eMzantsi Afrika, eBotswana, e-Eswatini, eLesotho, eMozambique, eNamibia kunye naseZimbabwe ukusukela ngoMvulo kwaye babakhuthaze ukuba bathathe uvavanyo ngokukhawulezileyo.
The passengers from Friday's flights were kept separated from other travelers and those who tested positive are being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.	Abakhweli abavela kwiinqwelomoya zangoLwesihlanu bagcinwe bohlukene nabanye abahambi kwaye abo bafunyaniswe benaso esisifo bagcinwe bodwa kwihotele ekufutshane nesikhululo seenqwelomoya.
A spokesperson for the health ministry said it would not be known until later Saturday whether any of passengers are infected with the new variant.	Isithethi senkonzo yezempilo sithe ayizukwaziwa de kube nguMgqibelo ukuba ingaba kukhona na abakhweli abosulelekileyo kolu hlobo lutsha lwesisifo.
A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.	Isithethi se-KLM, ingalo yaseDutch ye-Air France, ithe inkampani yeenqwelomoya ibizama ukufumanisa ukuba yeyiphi na imigaqo ekhoyo ukusukela ngentsasa yangoLwesihlanu ukuthintela abantu abosulelekileyo yi-COVID-19 ukuba bakhwele kwiinqwelomoya, ezisuka eKapa kunye naseRhawutini.
Rules on the company's website said passengers had to present a negative COVID-19 "rapid antigen" test result taken 24 hours before departure but were not required to show proof of vaccination.	Imithetho kwiwebhusayithi yenkampani yathi abakhweli kufuneka baveze iziphumo zovavanyo lwe-COVID-19  iziphumo "zerapid antigen" ethathwe kwiiyure ezingama-24 ngaphambi kokuhamba kodwa bekungafuneki ukuba babonise ubungqina bogonyo.
Really Weird'  Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.	Iyamangalisa ngokwenene' uPaula Zimmerman, umfoti waseDutch ubuye kutyelelo losapho lwakhe eMzantsi Afrika ngentsasa yangoLwesihlanu, uthe imeko yabakhweli kwiinqwelomoya yayinesiphithiphithi, njengoko babegcinwe belindile kwindlela yeenqwelomoya nakwisikhululo sazo iiyure.
Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 a.m., almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam, but said she then found out she was standing right next to a man who knew he had tested positive for an infection.	UZimmerman waxelelwa ukuba ufunyaniswe engenaso esisifo ngentsimbi yesi-4 kusasa, phantse kwiiyure ezili-18 emva kokufika e-Amsterdam, kodwa wathi emva koko wafumanisa ukuba wayemi ecaleni kwendoda eyayisazi ukuba yona inaso esisifo.
It was really weird.	“Yayingummangaliso ngokwenene.
There was no coordination.	Kwakungekho kulungelelaniswa.
There were too few people and there really wasnt anybody who took control."	Kwakukho abantu abambalwa kwaye kungekho mntu ulawulayo."
Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said.	Emveni kokuchitha iiyure kwinqwelomoya ekusenokwenzeka ukuba inabakhweli abaninzi abosulelekileyo kwenza uZimmerman wanexhala iintsuku, utshilo.
Ive been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days.	“Ndixelelwe ukuba balindele ukuba baninzi abantu abaza kufunyanwa banaso esisifo emva kweentsuku ezintlanu.
It's a little scary the idea that you've been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive."	Inendawo eyothusayo into yokuba ubukwinqwelomoya enabantu abaninzi abafunyaniswe ukuba banaso esisifo.”
The Dutch flight ban does not mean that all flights from southern Africa to the Netherlands are halted, as Dutch citizens are allowed to return home, while EU citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.	Ukuvalwa kwenqwelomoya zaseDutch akuthethi ukuba zonke iinqwelomoya ezisuka eMazantsi e-Afrika zisiya eNetherlands ziyanqunyanyiswa, njengoko abemi baseDutchi bevumelekile ukuba babuyele ekhaya, ngelixa abemi be-EU bevumelekile ukuba bangene kumazwe abo.
Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel.	Abasebenzi bezempilo, abasebenzi beenqwelo moya kunye nabantu abanezidingo ezicinezelayo basavumelekile ukuba bahambe.
KLM will continue flights to the region, but travelers need to stay in quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.	I-KLM iya kuqhubekeka ineenqwelomoya eziya kulo mmandla, kodwa abahambi kunyanzelekile ukuba bahlale bodwa kangangeentsuku ezintlanu xa befika eNetherlands.
The new variant has been detected just as many European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases.	Uhlobo olutsha lwesisifo lufunyaniswe ngethuba amazwe amaninzi aseYurophu exakene nokwenyuka kwamanani abantu abane-coronavirus.
The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its health care system.	NgoLwesihlanu urhulumente waseDutch ubhengeze ukuvalwa ebusuku kweebhari, iivenkile zokutyela kunye neevenkile ezininzi njengoko ezama ukunqanda irekhodi elophula irekhodi lwabantu abanesifo i-COVID-19 egxobha inkqubo yakhe yezempilo.
	
EU to Suspend Travel From Southern Africa Over New COVID Variant	I-EU iyakunqumamisa ukuhanjelwa ngabantu abasuka eMazantsi e-Afrika ngenxa ye-COVID entsha eyahlukileyo
European Union states have agreed to suspend travel from southern Africa after the detection of a new COVID-19 variant, the presidency of the EU said Friday.	Amazwe e-European Union avumile ukumisa ukuhanjelwa ngabantu abasuka kuMazantsi e-Afrika emva kokubhaqwa kolunye uhlobo olutsha lwe-COVID-19, umongameli we-EU uthethe wenjenjalo ngoLwesihlanu.
A committee of health experts from all 27 EU states "agreed on the need to activate the emergency break & impose temporary restriction on all travel into EU from southern Africa," the Slovenian presidency of the EU said on Twitter.	Ikomiti yeengcali zezempilo ezisuka kuwo onke amazwe angama-27 e-EU "avumelene ngesidingo sokubeka ikhefu likaxakeka kwaye abeke uthintelo lwexeshana lokumisa konke ukuhamba okuya e-EU kusuka eMazantsi e-Afrika," utshilo umongameli waseSlovenia we-EU kuTwitter.

Each of the 27 EU countries is free to apply the new measures when it prefers. Some are already applying restrictions.	Ilizwe ngalinye kumazwe angama-27 e-EU likhululekile ukusebenzisa imilinganiselo emitsha ngokuthanda kwalo. Amanye sele ebesebenzisa imiqathango.
EU officials said that no decision had yet been made on other countries in other parts of the world where cases were detected, which include Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium, an EU country.	Amagosa e-EU athi akukabikho sigqibo senziweyo malunga namanye amazwe akwezinye iindawo zehlabathi apho kufunyenwe khona oluhlobo lwesisifo, amazwe aquka iHong Kong, Israel kunye neBelgium, ilizwe le-EU.
Global alarm	Uloyiko lwehlabathi
The new coronavirus variant, first detected in South Africa, has caused global alarm as researchers seek to find out if it is vaccine-resistant.	Uhlobo lutsha lwe-coronavirus, olufunyenwe kuqala eMzantsi Afrika, lubangele uloyiko ehlabathini njengoko abaphandi befuna ukufumanisa ukuba ingaba luyanyangeka na ngogonyo.
Marc Van Ranst, the virologist who detected the new variant in Belgium, told Reuters it was more likely the infected woman had contracted the variant in Belgium rather than while traveling outside Europe.	UMarc Van Ranst, ugqirha wentsholongwane ofumene uhlobo olutsha eBelgium, uxelele iReuters ukuba kunokwenzeka ukuba lo wasethyini usuleleke loluhlobo lutsha lwesisifo eBelgium kunokuba usuleleke nethuba ehambele ngaphandle kweYurophu.
She had been in Egypt earlier in November but developed symptoms only 11 days after her return to Belgium. She is not vaccinated.	Ebehambele e-Egypt ekuqaleni kukaNovemba kodwa waba neempawu kuphela kwiintsuku ezili-11 emva kokubuyela kwakhe eBelgium. Akagonywanga.

In the meantime, we will adopt the greatest possible caution," Speranza said.	Okwangalomzuzu, siza kuthatha esona silumkiso sibalaseleyo,”utshilo uSperanza.
	
Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change	Iingcali zokusingqongileyo zaseZimbabwe zifuna ngaphezulu malunga nentetho ngoTshintsho lweMozulu
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change.	Iingcali zokusingqungileyo eZimbabwe ziphendule ngomsindo kwintetho kaMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa kwinkomfa ye-COP26, apho athembise ngokulwa kukarhulumente wakhe esilwela ngokuchaseneyo nokugawulwa kwamahlathi kunye nokutshintsha kwemozulu.
Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.	Iingcali zokusingqungileyo zithi urhulumente uxakekile enikezela ngomhlaba kwiinkampani, ingakumbi ezamaTshayina, ukuba zembe amalahle ukuze zisebenzise amandla, nto leyo i-COP26 ifuna apheliswe.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere.	NgoLwesibini eSkotlani, uMongameli uEmmerson Mnangagwa uthethe kwiNkomfa yeZizwe eziManyeneyo yoTshintsho lweMozulu ka-2021, eyaziwa ngokuba yiCOP26, apho ebongoze amazwe aphuhlileyo ukuba ahlawule ngokubangela ukufudumala kwehlabathi ngokukhupha iigesi emoyeni.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions.	Uthe amazwe asaphuhlayo afana neZimbabwe ahlawula iziphumo zoko kukhutshwa komoya ongcolileyo.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change.	Ukwathembise ngentsebenziswano lelizwe lakhe kumlo ochasene nokutshintsha kwemozulu.
Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030.	“IZimbabwe iye yalihlaziya igalelo layo elimiselwe kuzwelonke, ukuzimisela okunemiqathango engama-40% ngomntu ngamnye ekujoliswe ekunciphiseni kokukhutshwa kwegesi engcolisayo ngo-2030.
Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy," Mnangagwa said.	Amaqhinga abanzi ayaphunyezwa ekumiseleni uhlengahlengiso lokutshintsha kwemozulu kunye nokomelela kuwo onke amacandelo oqoqosho lwethu, utshilo uMnangagwa.
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use.	Oku kuvele kanye xa iingcaki zokusingqungileyo eZimbabwe zicela urhulumente ukuba arhoxise iphepha-mvume lokuhlola elinikwe inkampani yase China ukuba imbe amalahle ukuze isebenzise amandla awo.
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license.	Iziko loLawulo lweMithombo yeNdalo ngomnye wemibutho ephikisana nokunikezelwa kweli phepha-mvume.
The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation.	Eli qela likhuthaza amandla ohlaza, kwaye liloyiko lokuba ukusetyenziswa  kwamalahle kubangela ukutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi okugqithisileyo.
Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on.	UHenry Nyapokoto, umphathi wenkqubo yeli qela, uthe izimvo zikaMnangagwa zihamba ngokuchasene noko akubona kusenzeka.
But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy.	“Kodwa urhulumente ebekwimo esebenza ngokugqithisileyo ukukhuthaza imigodi kuyo yonke indawo ukuze kufikelelwe kuqoqosho lwemigodi yeebhiliyoni eziyi-12 zeedola.
In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster.	Kunjalo nje, ayenzi ngqiqo yendalo ukuba iZimbabwe ifumane uqoqosho lweedola ezili-12 leebhiliyoni ezisekelwe kwiindlela ezimbi zemveliso, ukusetyenziswa okungalunganga, okushiya kusetyesiswe indawo enkulu yendalo okanye ilifa lentlekele yendalo.
We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife," Nyapokoto said.	Sonke siyaqonda ukuba imigodi iza nokutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi asebenza njengendawo yokucoca umoya nendawo apho izilwanyana zasendle zihlala khona,” utshilo uNyapokoto.
Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation.	UNyapokoto wongeze wathi iZimbabwe ihlola ioyile negesi kumda wayo osemntla-mpuma neZambia, enye yezinto enokukhokelela ekutshatyalalisweni kwamahlathi.
Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems.	Ngaphandle kwempembelelo yeoyile kunye negesi kukufudumala kwehlabathi, kuza kubakho (a) isiphumo esicacileyo, esithe ngqo sale migodi yeoli kunye negesi kuluntu okanye kwinqkubo yendalo.
Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining.	Umhlaba uya kucocwa ukwenzela imigodi nezinye iziseko zophuhliso eziza kuxhasa loo migodi.
That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow," Nyapokoto said.	Oku kuchasene nokwenza luhlaza uqoqosho abathetha ngalo eGlasgow,” utshilo uNyapokoto.
He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually.	Uthe iZimbabwe ikwishumi lamazwe aphambili ekutshatyalalwisweni kwamahlathi, malunga neehektare ezingama-300,000 zamahlathi ezithi zigawulwe ngonyaka.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy.	Kodwa uByron Zamasiya weZimbabwe Environmental Law Association uthi uMnangagwa wayenyanisekile kwintetho yakhe yeCOP26 malunga nokulwa ukugawulwa kwamahlathi okubangelwa sisidingo sokusebenzisa amandla ombane.
So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe.	“Kungoko ke, umba wokulwa ukutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi yeyona nto iphambili ekufuneka inikwe iingqwalasela malunga nokukhutshwa kwegreenhouse gas eZimbabwe.
The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming.	Imithi isebenza njengendawo yokucoca umoya njengoko ifunxa icarbon dioxide, eyona nto ingunobangela wokufudumala kwehlabathi.
What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation.	Into esinokuyifuna njengelizwe kukufumana eminye imithombo yamandla ombane ekhoyo, ingakumbi kuluntu lwasemaphandleni oluthembele kumafutha eenkuni kwaye olunenxalenye enkulu ekugawuleni imithi.
We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields," Zamasiya said.	Kuunganyanzeleka ukuba sikhuthaze iindlela zokulima ngokunzulu ngokuchasene neendlela ezibanzi zokulima ezifuna amasimi amakhulu kunye nokutshatyalaliswa kwamahlathi amatsha ukwenzela amasimi,” utshilo uZamasiya.
The Environmental Management Agency in Zimbabwe has been fining people caught cutting or burning forests. But so far, that hasnt stopped the trees from coming down.	IArhente yoLawulo lokusiNgqongileyo eZimbabwe ihlawulise abantu ababanjwe begawula okanye betshisa imithi. Kodwa ukuza kuthi ga ngoku, oko akukunciphisanga ukutshatyalaliswa kweimithi.

Red Cross: 48,000 People Confirmed Missing Across Africa	IRed Cross: ngabantu abangama-48,000 akuqinisekiweyo ukuba balahlekile kwi-Afrika jikelele.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says more than 48,000 people are missing across Africa, and at least 21,600 are minors.	I-International Committee ye-Red Cross ithi bangaphezu kwe-48,000 abantu abalahlekileyo kwi-Afrika iphela, kwaye ubuncinane abayi-21,600 ngabantwana.
Most of the registered disappearances — widely believed to be a fraction of the continents wider, undocumented humanitarian tragedy — are linked to armed conflict, violence, disasters and migration across the continent.	Uninzi lwababhalisiweyo abanyamaleleyo - okukholelwa ngokubanzi ukuba liqhezu lelizwekazi elibanzi, intlekele yobuntu engabhalwanga - inxulunyaniswe nongquzulwano oluxhobileyo, ubundlobongela, iintlekele kunye nokufudukela kwilizwekazi liphela.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says the number of people coming forward to report missing persons is on the rise in Africa.	I-International Committee yombutho weRed Cross ithi liyanda inani labantu abaza phambili bazokuxela abantu abalahlekileyo eAfrika jikelele.
Amaya Fernandez, the humanitarian organizations adviser on the missing and their families for Western Africa, says the cause of the increasing numbers is two-fold.	U-Amaya Fernandez, ongumcebisi wemibutho yoluntu lwabalahlekileyo kunye neentsapho zabo eNtshona Afrika, uthi unobangela wokunyuka kwamanani kuphindwe kabini.
On one hand, [it's] due to the fact we are trying to register more systematically cases of missing persons throughout the region.	“Kwesinye isandla, kungenxa yokuba sizama ukubhalisa amatyala abantu abalahlekileyo mmandla uphel.
But also, certainly, [it's] due to the increased violence and conflict experienced on the continent, which increases at the same time the likelihood of people going missing.	Kodwa kwakhona, ngokuqinisekileyo, kungenxa yokuba kwande undlobongela kunye nongquzulwano olufunyenwe kwilizwekazi, kwangaxeshanye lunyusa amathuba okuba abantu balahleke umphelo.
Looking at our figures, almost half of the missing persons have been recorded underage and most of them are men.	Xa kujongwa amanani ethu, phantse isiqingatha sabantu abalahlekileyo ngabantwana abancinci kwaye uninzi lwabo ngamadoda.
Among the women ... we can see that the majority are minors," she said.	Phakathi kwabantu ababhinqileyo...siyabona ukuba uninzi ngabantwana, utshilo.
The ICRC finding shows that 39,360 of the 48,000 missing people are from seven countries with armed conflicts.	Ukufunyanwa kwe-ICRC kubonisa ukuba abantu abayi 39,360 abalahlekileyo kubantu abayi-48,000 bavela kumazwe asixhenxe aneengxabano ezixhobileyo.
According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, 20 countries in Africa have armed conflict.	Ngokutsho kweStockholm International Peace and Research Institute, amazwe angama-20 aseAfrika anongquzulwano ngezixhobo.
Out of the 20, 10 are witnessing high-intensity armed conflicts.	Kumazwe angama-20, ali-10 abona ungquzulwano oluqatha.
Fernandez says the ongoing conflict in some African countries has created more pain and suffering for families of missing persons.	UFernandez uthi ungquzulwano oluqhubekayo kumazwe athile eAfrika lubangele intlungu engakumbi kunye nokubandezeleka kwiintsapho zabo abalahlekileyo.
Humanitarian consequences... caused by protracted armed conflicts are often... reflected in most of the interviews.	Iziphumo zobuntu... ezibangelwa lungquzulwano oluxhobileyo oluthatha ixesha elide luhlala lubonakala  kudliwano-ndlebe.
For instance, half of the families interviewed in Nigeria reported that their relatives had gone missing in 2014-2015.	Umzekelo, isiqingatha seentsapho ezifumane udliwano-ndlebe eNigeria zaxela ukuba izalamane zabo zilahlekile ngo-2014-2015.
[In] South Sudan, [the] majority of the families were looking for people that went missing between 2013 and 2016.	E-South Sudan, uninzi lwezizalwane bezikhangela abantu abalahlekileyo phakathi kweminyaka u-2013 no-2016.
In Libya, families reported that they were looking for missing relatives from the late '70s until the present day, and the same goes for families in Ethiopia and Uganda," she said.	E-Libya, izizalwane zitshilo ukuba zikhangela izalamane zazo ezilahlekileyo ukusukela kwiminyaka yoo-70 ukuzokuthi ga ngoku, kwaye kuyafana ngokunjalo kwabo base-Ethiopia nase-Uganda,”utshilo.
Some experts see the need to train community workers and security agencies on the importance of information sharing to help locate missing persons.	Ezinye iingcaphephe zibona kunyanzelekile ukuba kuqeqeshwe abasebenzi basekuhlaleni kunye nee-arhente zokhuseleko malunga nokubaluleka kokwabelana ngolwazi ukunceda ukufumana abantu abalahlekileyo.
Zimbabwes assistant police commissioner Crispen Lifa says his country and the region need a data management system to follow up on the missing person cases.	Umncedisi womkomishinala wamapolisa eZimbabwe uCrispen Lifa uthi ilizwe lakhe kunye nommandla badinga inkqubo yolawulo lolwazi ukuze kulandelelwe amatyala abantu abadukileyo.
There is a need to have a database which should be continuously updated so that all missing persons, and even those that are deceased... is captured in a database by police stations.	“Kukho isidingo sokuba kubekho uvimba weenkcukacha ekufuneka uhlaziywa ngalo lonke ixesha ukuze bonke abantu abalahlekileyo, kwanabo bangasekhoyo... bafakwe kwiziko ledatha kwizikhululo zamapolisa.
At the end of the day, that information has to be put in place... [so] if you want to check across the country the number of missing persons, [you] would quickly get that information from a central point," he said.	Ekugqibeleni, olo lwazi kunyanzelekile ukuba lubekwe endaweni... ngoko ukuba ufuna ukujonga kwilizwe liphela inani labantu abalahlekileyo, uyakulufumana ngokukhawulezileyo ulwazi kwindawo ephakathi, utshilo. 
Fauziya Hussein's brother went missing in June after a Kenyan court released him.	Umninawa kaFauziya Hussein walahleka ngoJuni emva kokukhululwa yinkundla yaseKenya.

His sister, Fauziya Hussein, says they never saw him again.	Udadewabo, uFauziya Hussein, uthi abaphendanga bambona.
I know they still have him. At every point [of his detention], my brother got a chance to make a phone call. He called my mother.	Ndiyayazi ukuba basambambile. Ngalo lonke ixesha awayevalelwe ngalo, umnakwethu wazinika ixesha lokufowuna. Wafowunela umama.
So, if he was released, why didnt he call my mother?	Ngoko ukuba bamkhulula kutheni engamfowuneli umama?
So, I know for a fact they did not release him," she said.	Ngoko, ndiyazi ukuba azange bamkhulule, utshilo.
According to Hussein, police told her they released her brother.	NgokukaHussein, amapolisa amxelela ukuba amkhulule umnakwabo.
The ICRC calls on African governments to prevent disappearances and help with search and identification, and addressing families needs.	I-ICRC icela oorhulumente baseAfrika ukuba bancede banqande ukunyamalala kwabantu ngokuthu kukhangelwe, kuchongwe,  kwaye kujongwe iimfuno zeentsapho ezilahlekelweyo.

U-Amaya Fernandez, ongumcebisi wemibutho yoluntu lwabalahlekileyo kunye neentsapho zabo eNtshona Afrika, uthi unobangela wokunyuka kwamanani kuphindwe kabini.
On one hand, [it's] due to the fact we are trying to register more systematically cases of missing persons throughout the region.	“Kwesinye isandla, kungenxa yokuba sizama ukubhalisa amatyala abantu abalahlekileyo kummandla uphela.
But also, certainly, [it's] due to the increased violence and conflict experienced on the continent, which increases at the same time the likelihood of people going missing.	Kodwa kwakhona, ngokuqinisekileyo, kungenxa yokuba kwande undlobongela kunye nongquzulwano olufunyanwa kwilizwekazi, kwangaxeshanye lunyusa amathuba okuba abantu balahleke umphelo.
Looking at our figures, almost half of the missing persons have been recorded underage and most of them are men.	Xa kujongwa amanani ethu, phantse isiqingatha sabantu abalahlekileyo ngabantwana abancinci kwaye uninzi lwabo ngabafana.
Among the women ... we can see that the majority are minors," she said.	Phakathi kwabantu ababhinqileyo...siyabona ukuba uninzi ngabantwana, utshilo.
The ICRC finding shows that 39,360 of the 48,000 missing people are from seven countries with armed conflicts.	Ukufunyanwa kwe-ICRC kubonisa ukuba abayii-39,360 abalahlekileyo kubantu abayi-48,000 bavela kumazwe asixhenxe aneengxabano ezixhobileyo.
According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, 20 countries in Africa have armed conflict.	Ngokutsho kweStockholm International Peace and Research Institute, amazwe angama-20 aseAfrika anongquzulwano ngezixhobo.
Out of the 20, 10 are witnessing high-intensity armed conflicts.	Kumazwe angama-20, ali-10 abona ungquzulwano oluqatha.
Fernandez says the ongoing conflict in some African countries has created more pain and suffering for families of missing persons.	UFernandez uthi ungquzulwano oluqhubekayo kumazwe athile eAfrika lubangele intlungu engakumbi kunye nokubandezeleka kwiintsapho zabo abalahlekileyo.
Humanitarian consequences... caused by protracted armed conflicts are often... reflected in most of the interviews.	Iziphumo zobuntu... ezibangelwa lungquzulwano oluxhobileyo oluithatha ixesha elide luhlala lubonakala kudliwano-ndlebe.
For instance, half of the families interviewed in Nigeria reported that their relatives had gone missing in 2014-2015.	Umzekelo, isiqingatha seentsapho ezifumane udliwano-ndlebe eNigeria zaxela ukuba izalamane zabo zilahlekile ngo-2014-2015.
[In] South Sudan, [the] majority of the families were looking for people that went missing between 2013 and 2016.	E-South Sudan, uninzi lwezizalwane bezikhangela abantu abalahlekileyo phakathi kweminyaka u-2013 no-2016.
In Libya, families reported that they were looking for missing relatives from the late '70s until the present day, and the same goes for families in Ethiopia and Uganda," she said.	E-Libya, izizalwane zitshilo ukuba zikhangela izalamane zazo ezilahlekileyo ukusukela kwiminyaka yoo-70 ukuzokuthi ga ngoku, kwaye kuyafana ngokunjalo kwabo base-Ethiopia nase-Uganda,”utshilo.
Some experts see the need to train community workers and security agencies on the importance of information sharing to help locate missing persons.	Ezinye iingcaphephe zibona kunyanzelekile ukuba kuqeqeshwe abasebenzi basekuhlaleni kunye nee-arhente zokhuseleko malunga nokubaluleka kokwabelana ngolwazi ukunceda ukufumana abantu abalahlekileyo.
Zimbabwes assistant police commissioner Crispen Lifa says his country and the region need a data management system to follow up on the missing person cases.	Umncedisi womkomishinala wamapolisa eZimbabwe uCrispen Lifa uthi ilizwe lakhe kunye nommandla badinga inkqubo yolawulo lolwazi ukuze kulandelelwe amatyala abantu abadukileyo.
There is a need to have a database which should be continuously updated so that all missing persons, and even those that are deceased... is captured in a database by police stations.	“Kukho isidingo sokuba kubekho uvimba weenkcukacha ekufuneka uhlaziywe ngalo lonke ixesha ukuze bonke abantu abalahlekileyo, kwanabo bangasekhoyo... bafakwe kwiziko ledatha kwizikhululo zamapolisa.
At the end of the day, that information has to be put in place... [so] if you want to check across the country the number of missing persons, [you] would quickly get that information from a central point," he said.	Ekugqibeleni, olo lwazi kunyanzelekile ukuba lubekwe endaweni... ngoko ukuba ufuna ukujonga kwilizwe liphela inani labantu abalahlekileyo, uyakulufumana ngokukhawulezileyo ulwazi kwindawo ephakathi, utshilo.
Fauziya Hussein's brother went missing in June after a Kenyan court released him.	Umninawa kaFauziya Hussein walahleka ngoJuni emva kokukhululwa yinkundla yaseKenya.
The 39-year-old was accused of terrorism-related issues, but the court found him innocent and ordered the police to release him.	Le ndoda ineminyaka engama-39 utyholwa ngemiba edibene nobunqolobii, kodwa inkundla yamfumana engenatyala yaze yayalela ukuba akhululwe ngamapolisa.
His sister, Fauziya Hussein, says they never saw him again.	Udadewabo, uFauziya Hussein, uthi abaphindanga bambona.
I know they still have him. At every point [of his detention], my brother got a chance to make a phone call.	Ndiyayazi ukuba basambambile. Ngalo lonke ixesha awayevalelwe ngalo, umnakwethu wayezinika ixesha lokufowuna.
He called my mother.	Wafownela umama.
So, if he was released, why didnt he call my mother?	Ngoko ukuba bamkhulula kutheni engamfowuneli umama?
So, I know for a fact they did not release him," she said.	Ngoko, ndiyazi ukuba azange bamkhulule, utshilo.
According to Hussein, police told her they released her brother.	NgokukaHussein, amapolisa amxelela ukuba amkhulula umnakwabo.
The ICRC calls on African governments to prevent disappearances and help with search and identification, and addressing families needs.	I-ICRC icela oorhulumente baseAfrika ukuba bancede banqande ukunyamalala kwabantu ngokuthi kukhangelwe, kuchongwe,  kwaye kujongwe iimfuno zeentsapho ezilahlekelweyo.
	
Olympics: Post-Bolt Era in 100m Begins in Tokyo	IiOlimpiki: Ixesha le-Post-Bolt kwi-100m Iqala eTokyo
The post-Usain Bolt era in the men's Olympic 100 meters began on Saturday in Tokyo with Dorian Keletela, who is competing as part of the Olympic Refugee team, advancing to the next round with a personal best 10.33 seconds.	Ixesha le-post-Usain Bolt kwi-Olimpiki ye-100 yeemitha zamadoda liqale ngoMgqibelo eTokyo kunye noDorian Keletela, okhuphisanayo njengenxalenye yeqela le-Olympic Refugee, eqhubela phambili kumjikelo olandelayo nge-10.33 yemizuzwana.
Bolt won three straight titles from Beijing in 2008 and his retirement in 2017 has left something of a vacuum in the showpiece athletics event, with no one stepping up to fill the Jamaican's shoes.	UBolt uphumelele izihloko ezithathu ezithe ngqo eBeijing ngo-2008 kwaye umhlala-phantsi wakhe ngo-2017 ushiye umngxuma kumsitho weembaleki, kungekho mntu unyukayo ukuzalisa izihlangu zaseJamaica. 
On Saturday, amid stifling temperatures that hovered above 30 degrees Celsius, sprinters took the track as they began their attempts to succeed world-record holder Bolt.	NgoMgqibelo, phakathi kwamaqondo obushushu angaphezulu ku-30, iimbaleki zangena ebaleni njengoko ziqala iinzame zokuphumelela uBolt ophethe irekhodi yehlabathi.
Keletela, 22, is one of those athletes.	UKeletela, oneminyaka engama-22, ngomnye wabo badlali.
Originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he moved to Portugal in 2016 following the death of his parents due to conflict in his homeland and ran a personal best 10.33 to advance to the next round later on Saturday.	Ophuma kwilizwe iDemocratic Republic of the Congo, wafudukela ePortugal ngo-2016 emva kokusweleka kwabazali bakhe ngenxa yongquzulwano kwilizwe lakhe kwaye wabaleka eyona 10.33 engcono ukuya kumjikelo olandelayo kamva ngoMgqibelo.
am very, very proud of this and I am very, very proud of this team.	Ndinebhongo kakhulu ngale nto kwaye ndiyazingca kakhulu ngeli qela.
It gives me a lot of strength to go on," Keletela said after the race.	Kundinika amandla amakhulu okuqhubekeka,” utshilo uKeletela emva kogqatso.
You can do ... anything, whether you are a refugee or not."	Unokwenza ... nantoni na, nokuba uyimbacu okanye awuyiyo.
Others who progressed from the preliminary heats include Zimbabwe's Ngoni Makusha, who got off the block fast to win his heat in 10.32, and Oman's Barakat Al Harthi, who posted 10.27s to win his race.	Abanye abathe baqhubela phambili kwindima yokuqala baquka uNgoni Makusha waseZimbabwe, ophume ngokukhawuleza ukuze aphumelele ugqatso lwakhe ngo-10.32, kunye noBarakat Al Harthi waseOman, obeke i-10.27s ukuphumelela ugqatso lwakhe.
There were three preliminary heats overall and the first three in each heat qualify to round one, along with the athlete who posts the next fastest time.	Kukho izigaba zogqatso ezohlulwe kathathu kwaye abokuqala abathathu kwisigaba ngasinye baphumelela kwisigaba sokuqala, kunye nembaleki ebeka ixesha elilandelayo ngokukhawuleza.
The world's top sprinters enter the equation later Saturday, with the United States, who have won more golds in the event than all other nations combined, determined to take Bolt's mantle and regain their supremacy.	Iimbaleki ezigqwesileyo zehlabathi zingena kule nkquleqhu kamva ngoMgqibelo, kunye ne-United States, ephumelele igolide eninzi kulo mnyhadala ngaphezu kwazo zonke ezinye izizwe zidityanisiwe, zizimisele ukuthabatha ingubo kaBolt kwaye ziphinde zizuze ukongama kwazo.
Their last gold medal win in the event came via Justin Gatlin in 2004.	Imbasa yabo yokugqibela yegolide kulo msitho yeza ngoJustin Gatlin ngo-2004.
Contenders include Trayvon Bromell, whose 9.77 second run in Florida last month is the fastest of the year and propels him into the top tier of favorites in the race.	Abantu abakhuphisanayo baquka uTrayvon Bromell, obaleka imizuzwana eyi-9.77  eFlorida kwinyanga ephelileyo ngoyena ukhawulezayo kulonyaka kwaye oku umqhubele kwinqanaba eliphezulu leentandokazi kugqatso.
His compatriot Ronnie Baker is probably his closest rival for podium positions and finished second to him at the U.S. trials with a time of 9.85.	Umlingane wakhe uRonnie Baker mhlawumbi ungoyena mntu usondeleyo kwizikhundla zeqonga kwaye wagqiba okwesibini kuye kwiimvavanyo zase-US ngemizuzwabz eyi-9.85.
Canada's Andre De Grasse, who won bronze in the 100m in Rio five years ago, will be looking to go for the title this time around while South African sprinter Akani Simbine, fifth in Brazil and boasting the second-fastest time of the year, will also be in the running.	U-Andre De Grasse waseCanada, owaphumelela ubhedu kumgama we-100m eRio kwiminyaka emihlanu edlulileyo, uzakube ejonge ukulwela intshinga kweli tyeli lo gama imbaleki yoMzantsi Afrika, u-Akani Simbine, owaphumelela indawo yesihlanu eBrazil, ezingomba indawo yesibini kulo nyaka. naye uzakungenelela olugqatso.
Bolt's former training partner, 2012 silver medalist Yohan Blake, the second-fastest man in history, will carry his nation's hopes on his shoulders.	Owayesakuba ngugxa kaBolt ekuqeqeshweni, owafumana imbasa yesilivere ngo-2012 u-Yohan Blake, indoda yesibini ngesantya embalini, uzakuthwala amathemba esizwe sakhe emagxeni akhe.
	
South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor	UZuma woMzantsi Afrika uzakuqhuba uTshutshiso lwaBucala ngakuMtshutshisi
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday.	Owayesakuba ngumongameli weli loMzantsi Afrika uJacob Zuma uqhuba iinkqubo zokutshutshisa ukususa umtshutshisi okhokelayo kwityala lobuqhophololo emva kokungaphumeleli kwezomthetho, isiseko sakhe satsho ngeCawe.
Last month the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) torpedoed Zuma's latest bid to have lead prosecutor Billy Downer taken off the case after accusing him of bias and leaking of confidential information to a journalist in contravention of the national prosecution act, among other complaints.	Kwinyanga ephelileyo iNkundla ePhakamileyo yeziBheno (SCA) yasikhaba isicelo sikaZuma sokuba umtshutshisi okhokelayo uBilly Downer alishenxise eli tyala emva kokumtyhola ngokukheth’ icala kunye nokupapasha ulwazi oluyimfihlo kwintatheli ngokuchasene nomthetho wesizwe wotshutshiso, phakathi kwezinye izikhalazo.
The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.	I-SCA isikhabile isicelo semvume yokubhena ngesizathu sokuba akukho themba libambekayo lokuphumelela kwaye asikho esinye isizathu esibambekayo sokuba kutheni isibheno kufuneka simanyelwe.
The spokesman of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi told a press briefing that Zuma's instructions to his legal team to institute private prosecution "will now be put into operation in the next few days."	Isithethi seJacob Zuma Foundation, uMzwanele Manyi, uxelele indibano yonondaba ukuba imiyalelo kaZuma kwiqela lakhe lezomthetho ukuba liqalise ukutshutshisa labucala “iza kuqala ukusebenza kwezi ntsuku zimbalwa zizayo.
He also said Zuma's legal team has filed a reconsideration application to the president of the SCA, a petition to hear the appeal.	Ukwathe igqiza lamagqwetha kaZuma lifake isicelo sokuphinda siqwalaselwe kumongameli weSCA, uxwebhu lwezikhalazo zokumamela isibheno.
Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.	UZuma, owagxothwayo kumbutho olawulayo we-African National Congress ngo-2018 emva kweminyaka engamashumi amabini engumongameli, uzikhanyelanga izityholo zobuqhophololo, ukurhwaphiliza imali kunye norhwaphilizo kwityala ekudala ligquba malunga nesivumelwano sezixhobo ezixabisa iibhiliyoni ezimbini zeerandi kwiminyaka yoo-1990.
The deal case has dogged Zuma since he was sacked as deputy president of the country in 2005. He said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.	Ityala lesivumelwano limphethe kakubi uZuma ukusukela oko wagxothwa njengosekela mongameli welizwe ngo-2005. Wathi wayelixhoba lokuzingelwa kwamagqwirha kwezopolitiko.
On Monday the long-delayed trail is set to get underway and Zuma will be present in court.	NgoMvulo lo ukuxoxwa kwetyala okusele kulibazisile kuzokuqala kwaye uZuma uzakube ekhona enkundleni.
Manyi said Zuma, who turns 80 on Tuesday, is applying for a postponement because "it is very clear that the conditions for a fair trail are non-existent."	UManyi uthe uZuma, nogqiba iminyaka engamashumi asibhozo ubudala ngoLwesibini, ufaka isicelo sokumiswa ngenxa yokuba “kucace gca ukuba iimeko zokuxoxwa kwetyala ngokufanelekileyo azikho.
On Monday his team will also respond to the supplementary affidavit served by the National Prosecution Authority where they seek to introduce new evidence in the trial.	NgoMvulo iqela lakhe liza kuphendula kwakhona kwingxelo efungelweyo eyongeziweyo enikwe nguGunyaziwe woTshutshiso weSizwe apho bafuna ukwazisa ubungqina obutsha kwityala.
All His Excellency President Zuma really wants is his day in court, in a fair trial and certainly not in a forum which is being rigged by the State," Manyi said.	“Eyona nto ifunwa nguMongameli uZuma yimini yakhe enkundleni, kuxoxwe ngokungenamkhethe hayi kwiqonga eliqhathwa nguRhulumente,” utshilo uManyi.
	
South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts	UBume boMzantsi Afrika bokungathathi cala kwiRussia bubeka umngcipheko wobudlelwane babazwe ngamazwe: abahlalutyi
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation.	Umongameli woMzantsi Afrika uCyril Ramaphosa ngoMvulo ukhusele ukungathabathi cala kwakhe kuhlaselo lwase-Ukraine yiRussia, ememelela iingxoxo- hayi ukugxeka.
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor.	Abagxeki baye bagxeka urhulumente ngokusilela ukuxhasa iUkraine ngokuchasene nommelwane wayo.
Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world.	Abahlalutyi bathi uMzantsi Afrika uvumela ubudlelwane bezopolitiko nezoqoqosho neMoscow bubeke emngciphekweni ubudlelwane nehlabathi liphela.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict.	Uthethathethwano endaweni yezixhobo okanye uxinzelelo lwezoqoqosho yindlela uRamaphosa angathanda ukuyibona isetyenziselwa ukulungisa impixano yaseRussia-neUkraine.
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces.	Ukungaguquguquki kukaRamaphosa kwasikhaba isicelo sangaphambili sesebe lezobudlelwane bezizwe ngezizwe sokuba iRussia mayirhoxise imikhosi yayo.
Leaza Jernberg is a Johannesburg-based independent researcher and consultant on diplomacy.	ULeaza Jernberg ngumphandi ozimeleyo oseRhawutini kunye nomcebisi kwidiplomacy.
The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable.	“ISebe lezobudlelwane bamazwe ngamazwe nentsebenziswano, ngonozakuzaku boMzantsi Afrika ubukhulu becala, ithuku labo lakuqala yayikukuthi, ‘Kaloku, le ayamkelekanga.
And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like," Jernberg said.	Kwaye loo nto yayihlehlisiwe ngumongameli endicinga ukuba unenkxalabo malunga namahlakani kunye neRussia kwaye ijongeka njani le nto, utshilo uJernberg.
So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government."	Ngoko nalapha eMzantsi Afrika, isikhundla soMzantsi Afrika sixabene kakhulu, nangaphakathi kurhulumente.
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters.	Amakhonkco oMzantsi Afrika kunye neRussia asuka ukusukela kwiminyaka yoo-1960 xa iSoviet Union yanika inkxaso kubalweli benkululeko ababechasene nocalucalulo.
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia.	Kwiminyaka eyalandelayo, abezopolitiko, kuquka abo bombutho olawulayo, iAfrican National Congress, bagcina ubuhlobo obusenyongweni neRassia.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin.	Kungoko abahlalutyi besithi ayothusi into yokuba isiseko esikhokelwa ngowayesakuba ngumongameli uJacob Zuma sivakalise inkxaso kuVladimir Putin waseRussia.
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.	URichard Calland yinjingalwazi yezomthetho kwiYunivesithi yaseKapa.
He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma," Calland said.	“U[Putin] ebenobudlelwane obusondeleyo nowayesakuba nguMongameli wethu, uJacob Zuma,” utshilo uCallland.
It was a corrupt relationship.	“Yayibubudlelwane borhwaphilizo.
It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts.	Kwaphembelela into engekho mthethweni ekugqibeleni, inkundla yathi, ukuthengwa ngokungekho mthethweni kwamandla enyukliya aseRassia, okwayekiswa ziinkundla.
And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa.	Kwaye ndinoloyiko lokuba oko kuphazamisana nezimo ezithile zezopolitiko eMzantsi Afrika.
But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."	Kodwa andikholelwa ukuba yayisisizathu esithe ngqo kwisikhundla esithathwe nguMzantsi Afrika.
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts.	Endaweni yoko, uCallland uthi, amagosa oMzantsi Afrika alandela nje umgangatho welizwe kwimilo yamazwe angaphandle.
I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment," Calland said.	“Ndibazi kakuhle kwaye ndinxibelelana kakhulu namagosa aphezulu ozakuzo eMzantsi Afrika, kwaye bangene nzulu kwelisiko lokungakhethi cala,” utshilo uCallland.
Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak.	Ingxoxo yezopolitiko ligama labo eliphakathi, xa sesithetha.
And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."	Kwaye ndicinga ukuba kule, bebefuna ukugcina olu hlobo lwesikhundla esingakhethi cala ukuze bakhuthaze loo ngxoxo.
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.	Enye into edlala indima kukuma kwelizwe kumanyano lwezoqoqosho, iBRICS, equka iBrazil, Russia, India, China kunye noMzantsi Afrika.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China.	Abahlalutyi bathi uMzantsi Afrika usenokuba uzama ukugcina ubudlelwane borhwebo neRussia neChina.
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive.	Kodwa ingcaphephe kubudlelwane bamazwe aphesheya uJernberg uthe ukuma akunamveliso.
In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse," Jernberg said.	Xa kunjalo, sixhasa ihashe elingelilo,” utshilo uJernberg.
When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."	Xa ujonga i-EU, iEuropien Union njengebhloko, urhwebo oludityanisiweyo loMzantsi Afrika kwiManyano yaseYurophu ngokwenene lukhulu kakhulu. I-United States naphakathi, kunye neYurophu, ngokwenene inomdla omkhulu wezoqoqosho. 
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future.	Nokuba zithini na iinjongo, oko kushiye amazwe aseNtshona abambisene  neiUkraine edanile, kwaye iingcaphephe zilumkisa ngelithi kusenokubakho ifuthe kuMzantsi Afrika kwixesha elizayo.
Ina Gouws is a political science lecturer at South Africas University of the Free State.	U-Ina Gouws ngumhlohli wenzululwazi yezopolitiko kwiYunivesithi yoMzantsi Afrika yaseFreyistata.
These kinds of things down the road, become problematic," Gouws said.	“Ezi ntlobo zezinto ekuhambeni kwexesha, ziba yingxaki,” utshilo uGouws.
If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community."	Ukuba awubonisi olo hlobo lwentsebenziswano kunye nokucinga okuvakalayo, kunye nokugwetywa okuqinileyo xa ilizwe lenza into enje, ekuhambeni kwexesha, iyakuluma xa udinga inkxaso evela kuluntu lwamazwe ngamazwe.
While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.	Ngelixa iziphumo zoMzantsi Afrika zisahleli zingaqinisekanga, iingcali ziyavuma ukuba akunakufane kwenzeke ukuba elilizwe litshintshe imeko yalo okwangoku.
	
Divided America: America's Beauty Hasn't Faded. Has its Greatness?	IMelika eyahlulahluliweyo:Ubuhle beMelika abuphelanga. Ukubalasela kwayo kona?
Americans agree on this much: They are disgusted with politics.	Abemi basemelika bavumelana ngoku:Bakruqukile zezopolitiko.
They look toward Washington and see a broken federal government.	Bathi bokujonga eWashington, babone urhulumente weFederal owophukileyo. 
A place where politicians seem more interested in self-preservation than We the People.	Indawo apho abezopolitiko babonakala umdla wabo ujolise eziqwini zabo kunokuba ujolise eluntwini.

Kodwa abemi baseMelika bathi basakholelwa kwiMelika, indlela abaseki belizwe abalicacisa ngalo ilinge ledemokhrasi njengendawo apho urhulumente kunyazeleke ukuba akhusele amalungelo oluntu, inkululeko kwakunye nokufuna ulonwabo.
	
There's something at the core of America they long for, even if it's hard to define and seems distant in 2016.	Ikhona into kumbindi weMelika abayilangazelelayo, nokuba kunzima ukuyicacisa kwaye ibonakala ikude ngo-2016.

But what does that even mean?	kodwa oku kuthetha ukuthini?
