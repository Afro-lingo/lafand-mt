UNICEF Pushes for Demobilizing Child Soliders Near Africa's Great Lakes - 2002-10-07	UNICEF irashyira ingufu mu kuvana abana mu gisirikare mu karere k'ibiyaga bigari bya Afurika - 2002-10-07
The United Nations children's agency, UNICEF, is pushing for child soldiers to be demobilized in Africa's Great Lakes region, as several peace drives there build momentum. 	Ishami ry’umuryango w’abibumbye ryita ku bana, UNICEF, rirasaba ko abana b’abasirikare bavanwa mu gisirikare mu karere k’ibiyaga bigari bya Afurika, kubera ko amahoro menshi ari ho agaragarira. 
The agency says funding is in place to help the children leave the military and restart their lives.	Iki kigo kivuga ko inkunga ihari yo gufasha abana kuva mu gisirikare no gutangira ubuzima bwabo.
UNICEF's top child protection official, Manuel Fontaine, says peace initiatives in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are making it possible to get more children under the age of 18 out of fighting units. 	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe kurengera abana muri UNICEF, Manuel Fontaine, avuga ko ingamba z’amahoro muri Uganda, Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo no mu Rwanda zituma bishoboka ko abana benshi bari munsi y’imyaka 18 bava mu mitwe irwana. 
"We insist that child soldiers could be demobilized, even in conflict situations. 	Turashimangira ko abana b'abasirikare bakwiriye kuva mu gisirikare, ndetse no mu bihe by'amakimbirane.
We should never wait for peace to get children out of any form of armed group. 	Ntidukwiye na rimwe gutegereza amahoro kugira ngo abana bavanwe mu mutwe uwo ari wo wose witwaje intwaro. 
But, obviously, that's a better timing at the moment. It's more conducive to demobilization," Mr. Fontaine said.	Ariko, ikigaragara ni uko iki ari igihe cyiza cyo kubikora. Bizadufasha cyane nibava mu gisirikare, Bwana Fontaine ni ko yavuze.
He says there are currently 1,200 child soldiers in Uganda, fighting mainly with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army. He says that over the past 14 years, the group has abducted some 10,000 children, boys to fight and girls to serve as sex slaves.	Avuga ko muri Uganda muri iki gihe hari abasirikare 1200 b'abana, barwana ahanini n'ingabo za Lord Resistance Army. Avuga ko mu myaka 14 ishize, iryo tsinda ryashimuse abana bagera ku 10,000, abahungu bajyanwa kurwana n'ab’abakobwa kugira ngo bagirwe imbata z’imibonano mpuzabitsina.
According to UNICEF, The Democratic Republic of Congo still has some 10,000 children recruited to fight, while Rwanda has up to 2,000 children involved in combat.	UNICEF ivuga ko Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo igifite abana bagera ku 10,000 binjijwe mu ntambara, mu gihe u Rwanda rufite abana bagera ku 2000 bagize uruhare mu ntambara.
UNICEF says, even though some of the children do not directly engage in fighting, they are exposed to many dangers. 	UNICEF ivuga ko, nubwo bamwe mu bana batishora mu mirwano, bahura n'ingaruka nyinshi. 
They may be used as porters, carrying very heavy loads, or as messengers or spies passing information and scouting out enemy territory.	Bashobora gukoreshwa nk'abatwara ibintu, batwara imitwaro iremereye cyane, cyangwa nk'intumwa cyangwa abatasi batanga amakuru kandi bagashakisha agace k'umwanzi.
Sometimes, boys, but mainly girls, are used as sex slaves. They are exposed to violence and HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. 	Rimwe na rimwe, abahungu, ariko cyane cyane abakobwa, bakoreshwa nk'abacakara. Bahura n’ihohoterwa na Virus itera SIDA n'izindi ndwara zandurira mu mibonano mpuzabitsina.
The girls may become pregnant, making it harder for them to reintegrate into their communities.	Abakobwa bashobora gusama, bikabagora gusubira mu miryango yabo.
UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine says demobilization takes time and money. 	Manuel Fontaine wa UNICEF avuga ko gusubiza mu buzima busanzwe bitwara igihe n'amafaranga. 
He says the children must first be found, and then removed from their government or rebel units.	Avuga ko abana bagomba kubanza kuboneka, hanyuma bakavanwa muri guverinoma cyangwa mu mitwe y'inyeshyamba. 
Then, resources are needed to help them rebuild their lives. That involves providing schools, vocational training and health care.	Noneho, ibikoresho bikabona gukenewe kugira ngo bibafashe kubaka ubuzima bwabo. Ibyo bikubiyemo gutanga amashuri, amahugurwa y'imyuga no kwita ku buzima.
"You do not want to stigmatize them and individualize them. 	Ntawifuza kubatesha agaciro no kubatandukanya. 
They are basically going back to communities where there are a lot of other children, many of whom have suffered from consequences of war, even if they were not recruited. 	Basanzwe ahanini basubira mu baturage aho usanga hari abandi bana benshi, benshi muri bo bakaba baratewe n'ingaruka z'intambara, kabone niyo baba batinjijwe mu gisirikare. 
So, you are trying to build services in those communities that are broad services, that would be made available to all those children," Mr. Fontaine said.	Rero, uragerageza kubaka serivisi muri iyo miryango ari serivisi zagutse, zizahabwa abo bana bose , Bwana Fontaine.
Mr. Fontaine says, as part of various peace packages in the Great Lakes region, the World Bank and other donors are providing $500 million to help demobilize children. 	Bwana Fontaine avuga ko, mu rwego rwo guharanira amahoro atandukanye mu karere k'ibiyaga bigari, Banki y'Isi n'abandi baterankunga batanga miliyoni 500 z'amadolari yo gufasha abana mu bikorwa.
He says, unfortunately, the needed government institutions are not yet in place in some countries to move the process ahead quickly enough. 	Avuga ko ikibabaje ari uko inzego za Leta zikenewe zitarashyirwaho mu bihugu bimwe na bimwe kugira ngo inzira igerweho vuba bihagije. 
He says that's why UNICEF is pressing to see such structures develop, so that children can get back home and start to lead normal lives once again.	Avuga ko ari yo mpamvu UNICEF irihatira kubona izo nzego zitera imbere, kugira ngo abana basubire mu rugo batangire kubaho ubuzima busanzwe.

"My name is Sanchita. I come from a small village called Ishwarpur in Bangladesh," American actress Anne Hathaway delivered her lines as powerfully from behind a podium at the World Bank as she does on the silver screen, telling the story of an impoverished girl.	Nitwa Sanchita. Nkomoka mu mudugudu muto witwa Ishwarpur muri Bangladesh." Umukinnyi w'amafirime ukomoka muri Amerika, Anne Hathaway, yatanze umurongo ukomeye cyane inyuma ya podium kuri Banki y'Isi nk'uko abikora kuri ecran ya silver, avuga amateka y'umukobwa ukennye.
"When a baby is born in Ishwarpur, families desperately hope it will be a boy," she continued. "It has been this way for as long as anyone can remember.	Yakomeje agira ati: "Iyo umwana avukiye Ishwarpur, imiryango ntiba yizeye ko azaba umuhungu." "Byabaye gutya igihe cyose umuntu ashobora kwibuka.
It is believed that boys will contribute to the family income in a place where people are very poor.	Byizerwa ko abahungu bagira uruhare mu muryango rwo kwinjiza umutungo ahantu abantu bakennye cyane.
"These circumstances are familiar to those who benefit from the Adolescent Girls Initiative.	Ibi bihe biramenyerewe ku bantu bungukirwa n'ibikorwa by'abakobwa b'abangavu bafata iyambere.
Who benefits?A dozen such teenage girls and young women visited the World Bank from developing Asian, Middle Eastern and African countries.	Ninde ubyungukiramo? Abakobwa cumi na babiri n’abagore bakiri bato basuye Banki y'isi baturutse mu bihugu bya Aziya, Uburasirazuba bwo hagati na Afurika.
They were just a few of the girls who benefit from training and education programs that help them transition from school to employment.	Bari bake mu bakobwa bungukirwa n'amahugurwa na gahunda y'uburezi bibafasha kuva mu mashuri bajya mu kazi.
Hathaway told the audience that, with the help of a development organization, Sanchita gained an education and borrowed $60 to buy a cow and start a vegetable garden.	Hathaway yabwiye abari aho ko, abifashijwemo n’umuryango w’iterambere, Sanchita yize amashuri maze aguza amadorari 60 yo kugura inka no gutangiza ubusitani bw'imboga.
The teenage girl could then afford to pay her own school fees, as well as her brother's, and contribute to her family in such a way that Sanchita's parents hope she does not marry any time soon.	Umukobwa w'umwangavu noneho yashoboraga kwiyishyurira amafaranga y'ishuri, kimwe na murumuna we, akanatanga umusanzu mu muryango we ku buryo ababyeyi ba Sanchita bizeye ko atazashyingirwa vuba. 
Hathaway spoke of her own childhood in a comfortable suburban U.S. neighborhood, and of a time when she had no idea about the kind of circumstances Sanchita faced nor how much girls need safe spaces for education.	Hathaway yavuze ubwana bwe mu mugi mwiza n'abaturanyi bo muri Amerika, kandi mu gihe atigeze atekereza ku byerekeye ibihe Sanchita yahuye na byo cyangwa uko abakobwa bakeneye ahantu hizewe kugira ngo bige.
"Places that could teach them how to take the light they have as girls and ignite the world," explained Hathaway.	Hathaway yasobanuye agira Ari: "Ahantu hashobora kubigisha gufata umucyo bafite nk'abakobwa no kumurikira isi."
"I wouldn't know how much the world needs 'The Girl Effect.'" Girl power"The Girl Effect" is what the Adolescent Girls Initiative wants to see happen for 600 million girls in developing countries.	Ntabwo nari kumenya uko isi ikeneye 'Uruhare rw'umukobwa." "Imbaraga z'umukobwa" Uruhare rw'umukobwa "ni cyo Gufata iyambere bishaka kwerekana ku bakobwa miliyoni 600 mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere.
Overall, an estimated one-third of young women in developing nations are not employed and not in school.World Bank President Robert Zoellick said underinvesting in girls impedes development.	Muri rusange, abagera kuri kimwe cya gatatu cy’abagore bakiri bato mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere ntibakoreshwa kandi ntibari no mu ishuri. Perezida wa Banki y'Isi, Robert Zoellick, yavuze ko gushora imari mu bakobwa bidindiza iterambere.
He added that educating girls also makes sense for poor families, noting that an extra year of secondary schooling can raise their wages by 10 to 20 percent.	Yongeyeho ko kwigisha abakobwa na byo byumvikana ku miryango ikennye, anagaragaza ko umwaka w’inyongera w’amashuri yisumbuye ushobora kuzamura umushahara wabo kugeza kuri 10%.
"If they earn greater income they also have greater access to reproductive health information and services, so then more likely to delay marriage and childbirth, have healthier babies and attain higher literacy rates," Zoellick said.	Zoellick ati: "Niba binjiza amafaranga menshi kandi bafite amahirwe menshi yo kumenya amakuru na serivisi z'ubuzima bw'imyororokere, birashoboka cyane ko batinda gushaka no kubyara, bakagira abana bafite ubuzima bwiza kandi bakabona umubare munini w'abazi gusoma no kwandika".
"The evidence strongly suggests that investing in adolescent girls is a key way to break inter-generational patterns of poverty."	Ibimenyetso byerekana neza ko gushora imari mu bakobwa b'ingimbi ari inzira y'ingenzi yo guca ukubiri n''ubukene. "
Current operations The Adolescent Girls Initiative public-private partnership, with its $20 million in funds, is already at work in seven countries, with plans to expand to Haiti and Yemen.

Umwe muri bo, Justine Masika Bihamba, yabwiye abari bateraniye i Washington, muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, abanyeshuri ba kaminuza ndetse n’abaturage bireba ko akarere akoreramo, Beni, mu ntara ya Kivu y’amajyaruguru, gakomeje kwigarurirwa n’inyeshyamba zo muri Uganda zikunze gufata abagore ku ngufu. 
She said in these situations women are considered victims, and are not implicated in the search for peace.	Avuga ko muri ibi bihe abagore bafatwa nkabahohotewe, kandi ntibagira uruhare mugushakisha amahoro.
Striving for peace in the region	Guharanira amahoro mu karere
Bihamba coordinates an organization called the Synergy of Women Against Sexual Violence.	Bihamba ahuza umuryango witwa Synergy y'abagore wo kurwanya ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina.
Counselors with the group have been attacked and threatened because of their work. 	Abajyanama hamwe n'itsinda baratewe kandi babangamiwe n'ibikorwa byabo. 
When Bihamba was at work one day, Congolese soldiers attacked her home, and sexually assaulted one of her daughters.	Umunsi umwe ubwo Bihamba yari ku kazi, abasirikari ba congo bateye iwe, basambanya umwe mu bakobwa be.
One of them, Justine Masika Bihamba, told a gathering of Washington, D.C., university students and concerned citizens that the area in which she works, Beni, in North Kivu province, is still overrun by Ugandan rebels who regularly rape women.	Bihamba yasobanuye ko igikenewe - ikiruta byose - ari amahoro mu burasirazuba bwa Kongo.
She said she believes sexual crimes would go down drastically if fighting stopped.	Yavuze ko yizera ko ibyaha by'ihohotera rishingiye ku gitsina bizagabanuka cyane imirwano iramutse ihagaze.
Activist Donatella Rostagno, from the European network for Central Africa, accompanied Bihamba on her trip to the United States.	Umurwanashyaka Donatella Rostagno, ukomoka mu ihuriro ry’iburayi rikorera muri Afurika yo hagati, yaherekeje Bihamba mu rugendo rwe muri Amerika.
She said she supports the work being done by the U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict.	Yavuze ko ashyigikiye imirimo ikorwa n’uhagarariye Umuryango w’abibumbye ushinzwe ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina mu makimbirane.
Rostagno also said feels, however, the international community is not doing enough to stop Congo's war, despite having a large U.N. peacekeeping mission there.	Rostagno yavuze kandi ko abyumva, ariko ko, umuryango mpuzamahanga udakora ibishoboka byose ngo uhagarike intambara ya Congo, nubwo hariyo akazi katoroshye ku Muryango w'Abibumbye ko kubungabunga amahoro.
"The majority of the actions is made to look at the consequences, to work with the women who are victims, but not enough is done to look at the causes of the rapes and the conflict," said Rostagno.	Rostagno ati: "Ibyinshi mu bikorwa bikorwa kugira ngo harebwe ingaruka, gukorana n'abagore bahohotewe, ariko ntibihagije kugira ngo harebwe ibitera gufata ku ngufu n'amakimbirane."
Deteriorating situation amid global concern	Ibintu byifashe nabi kandi biteye impungenge isi
She fears the overall situation in eastern Congo is getting worse, not better - despite the international attention - with rebels, militias, and renegade soldiers still running rampant.	Afite ubwoba ko muri rusange mu burasirazuba bwa Kongo , ibintu bigenda birushaho kuba bibi - nubwo amahanga abitayeho - inyeshyamba, imitwe yitwara gisirikare, n'abasirikare bigometse bikomeje kwiyongera.
"A lot of these rebel groups are getting reorganized, and are even getting in a coalition so the movements that we see in the region, it is worrying us," said Rostagno.	Rostagno ati: "Benshi muri iyo mitwe y'inyeshyamba barimo kongera kuvugururwa, ndetse bakinjira mu ihuriro bityo imitwe tubona mu karere, iraduhangayikishije."
"I think we were more optimistic on this region six months ago than today.	Ndatekereza ko twagize ibyiringiro muri kano karere amezi atandatu ashize kurusha uyu munsi.
"The United Nations has identified three armed groups that gang raped dozens of people about two months ago in a week-long attack in Luvungi, another part of North Kivu province.	Umuryango w'abibumbye wagaragaje imitwe itatu yitwaje intwaro yasambanyije ku gahato abantu benshi mu gihe cy'amezi abiri ashize mu gitero cyabereye i Luvungi, mu kindi gice cy'intara ya Kivu y'Amajyaruguru.
Those implicated are the Mai Mai Cheka, the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, and followers of an army deserter, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.	Ababigizemo uruhare ni Mai Mai Cheka, Ingabo ziharanira Demokarasi yo Kwibohoza mu Rwanda, hamwe n'abayoboke b'umuntu watorotse ingabo, Colonel Emmanuel Nsengiyumva.
Proposals for improvementDuring their presentation, the two activists, Bihamba and Rostagno, also offered concrete proposals to make the situation better.	Ibyifuzo byo kunoza. Mu gihe cyo kwerekana uko byifashe, abaharanira inyungu bombi, Bihamba na Rostagno, na bo batanze ibyifuzo bifatika kugira ngo ibintu birusheho kuba byiza.
Rostagno explained that foreign non-governmental organizations get funding to tackle the issue of sexual violence, but local organizations often get ignored.	Rostagno yasobanuye ko imiryango itegamiye kuri Leta y’amahanga ibona inkunga yo gukemura ikibazo cy’ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina, ariko imiryango y'aho ikunze kwirengagizwa.
She said complex applications to get outside funding favor bigger organizations.	Yavuze ko gusaba bigoye cyane kubona inkunga yo hanze y'imiryango minini.
"They can just do it, they send it, they receive the money.	Bashobora kubikora, bakabyohereza, bakabona amafaranga.
The problem is that the money in most cases is spent to pay for the fixed cost of the organization, for the salaries of expat people coming to the region and to the country, while the local non-governmental organizations, those working with the communities, with the women, with the children, in the villages, those who need need money to survive in order to do their work do not have access," said Rostagno. Bihamba said Congolese soldiers should be paid directly through bank withdrawals, rather than being paid through their superiors.	Ikibazo ni uko amafaranga menshi akoreshwa mu kwishyura ikiguzi cyagenwe cy'umuryango, ku mishahara y'inzobere ziza mu karere ndetse no mu gihugu, mu gihe imiryango itegamiye kuri leta yaho, ikorana n'abaturage, hamwe n'abagore n'abana, mu midugudu, abakeneye amafaranga kugira ngo babeho kugira ngo bakore akazi kabo ntibayabone ”, ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Rostagno. Bihamba yavuze ko abasirikare ba Kongo bakwiye guhembwa binyuze mu kubikuza mu mabanki, aho guhembwa binyuze ku bayobozi babo.
Bihamba said with the current system they receive only about a third of their salary, which causes some soldiers to loot and rape.	Bihamba yavuze ko hamwe n'uburyo buriho bahabwa gusa kimwe cya gatatu cy'umushahara wabo, bigatuma bamwe mu basirikare basahura no gufata ku ngufu.
She also called for an international tribunal for the Congo to help end general impunity, as well as more local tribunals for raped victims to seek justice. 	Yasabye kandi urukiko mpuzamahanga rwa Kongo kugira ngo rufashe guca burundu umuco wo kudahana muri rusange, ndetse n'inkiko nyinshi z’abafashwe ku ngufu kugira ngo barenganurwe. 
In North Kivu, where more than 5 million people are estimated to live, she said there are only three tribunals.	Mu majyaruguru ya Kivu, aho bivugwa ko abantu barenga miliyoni 5 batuye, yavuze ko hari inkiko eshatu gusa.
	
Desmond Tutu Retires From Public Life	Desmond Tutu yasezeye mu buzima rusange.
Desmond Tutu fought apartheid in South Africa, and was critical of the war in Iraq.	Desmond Tutu yarwanyije ivangura muri Afurika y'Epfo, kandi yanenze intambara yo muri Iraki.
"We waged a war that shouldn't have happened," he said.He also spoke out against genocide in Rwanda.	Ati: "Twakoze intambara itagomba kubaho". Yavuze kandi ku kurwanya jenoside yakorewe mu Rwanda.
"God have mercy on us," he said.The retired Anglican archbishop announced in July that he would retire from public life on his birthday."	Ati: "Imana itugirire impuhwe." Umwepiskopi mukuru wa Anglican uri mu kiruhuko cy'izabukuru yatangaje muri Nyakanga ko azasezera mu buzima rusange ku munsi w'amavuko.
The time has come to slow down, and sip maybe rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons" he said.	Ati: "Igihe kirageze cyo gutinda, kandi tunywa icyayi cya rooibos hamwe n'umugore wanjye nkunda nyuma ya saa sita".
Tutu rose through the ranks of the Anglican church in South Africa to become the first black Anglican archbishop of Capetown.	Tutu yazamutse mu ntera mu itorero ry'Abangilikani muri Afurika y'Epfo aba umwepiskopi wa mbere w’abirabura wa Anglican wa Capetown.
He was a vocal critic of South Africa's white-ruled government and encouraged non-violence to end apartheid. 	Yamaganaga cyane guverinoma iyobowe n’abazungu kandi ashishikariza kurwanya ihohoterwa no kurangiza ivangura. 
Tutu was the recipient of many awards, and in 1984, he received a Nobel Peace Prize for advocating "a democratic and just society without racial divisions.	"Tutu ni we wahawe ibihembo byinshi, maze mu 1984, ahabwa igihembo cy’amahoro cyitiriwe Nobel kubera ko yashyigikiye "sosiyete ishingiye kuri demokarasi kandi itabera idafite amacakubiri ashingiye ku moko."
" He used the recognition to step up the anti-apartheid campaign, calling for an economic boycott against South Africa. 	Yakoresheje uburyo bwo kumenyekanisha n'ingufu igikorwa cyo kurwanya ivanguramoko, asaba kwamagana ibangamirwa ry'ubukungu muri Afurika y'Epfo. 
After the end of apartheid, Tutu called it an incredible day when Nelson Mandela won South Africa's first all-race elections.	Nyuma y'ivangura rya apartheid, Tutu yavuze ko ari umunsi udasanzwe ubwo Nelson Mandela yatsindaga amatora ya mbere yo muri Afurika y'Epfo.
"I would say the highest point for me was when I stood on the balcony in 1994 to introduce our new, brand new president to South Africa and the world," he said.	Ati: "Navuga ko ingingo isumba izindi kuri njye ari igihe nahagararaga kuri ruhimbi mu 1994 kugira ngo menyekanishe perezida mushya, mushya muri Afurika y'Epfo no ku isi".
To help mend the nation, President Mandela appointed Tutu as head of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 	Mu rwego rwo gufasha igihugu, Perezida Mandela yashyizeho Tutu nk'umuyobozi wa komisiyo ishinzwe ukuri n'ubwiyunge mu gihugu. 
The group issued a report that included numerous confessions of guilt under apartheid in return for amnesty.	Itsinda ryasohoye raporo ikubiyemo kwatura ibyaha byinshi muri apartheid n'itangwa ry' imbabazi.
"It makes specific proposals on how we can cultivate a culture of human rights and of structures to insure that the atrocities of the past will not reoccur," Tutu said.Tutu also campaigned to fight poverty and AIDS.	Tutu yagize ati: "Itanga ibitekerezo byihariye ku buryo dushobora kwimakaza umuco w'uburenganzira bwa muntu n'inzego kugira ngo twizere ko amarorerwa yo mu bihe byashize atazongera kubaho."
In recent years, he expressed his disappointment in post-apartheid South Africa, especially the level of violent crime.	Mu myaka yashize, yagaragaje ko atishimiye muri Afurika y'Epfo nyuma ya apartheid, cyane cyane urwego rw'ibyaha by'urugomo.
Despite his withdrawal from public life, Tutu says he will continue to support his peace foundation and will remain part of a group of elder statesmen who campaign for peace and human rights.	N'ubwo yavuye mu buzima rusange, Tutu avuga ko azakomeza gushyigikira umusingi w’amahoro kandi ko azakomeza kuba mu itsinda ry’abasaza bakuru baharanira amahoro n’uburenganzira bwa muntu.
But Tutu says he will no longer give interviews and, as he put it, will mostly "shut up."	Ariko Tutu avuga ko atazongera gutanga ibiganiro kandi nk'uko yabivuze, ahanini "azaceceka."
"I have been part of our struggle for freedom and democracy, and I am part of the celebration that we did succeed," he said. "I have been part of the post apartheid dispensation and long for us to do infinitely better."Many say his voice will be missed.	Ati: "Nagize uruhare mu rugamba rwo guharanira ubwisanzure na demokarasi, kandi ndi mu birori ko twatsinze". Nagize uruhare mu ivangura rya apartheid kandi ndifuza ko dukora neza bitagira akagero. Benshi bavuga ko ijwi rye ritazabura.
	
Malawi's Jacaranda School for Orphans Celebrates Christmas	Ishuri Jacaranda rya Malawi ry’imfubyi ririzihiza Noheri
The management for the Jacaranda School for Orphans in Malawis commercial capital Blantyre recently hosted a party for its students as it closed for Christmas and New Years Day holidays.	Ubuyobozi bw'ishuri rya Jacaranda ry'impfubyi mu murwa mukuru w'ubucuruzi wa Malawis Blantyre riherutse gukora ibirori ku banyeshuri baryo kuko ryizihije iminsi mikuru ya Noheri n'Ubunani.
Around 500 people including students, staff members and others from surrounding areas attended the event, which was held at the schools premises in Chigumula area.	Abantu bagera kuri 500 barimo abanyeshuri, abakozi ndetse n’abandi baturutse mu turere tuhakikije bitabiriye ibirori byabereye mu bigo by’amashuri mu gace ka Chigumula.
The party included gifts, Santa Claus, and a "dancing show case" by the students.	Muri ibyo birori harimo impano, Santa Claus n'imbyino by'abanyeshuri.
The school management told VOA that the yearly celebration has been a school tradition for the past 13years.	Ubuyobozi bw'ishuri bwatangarije VOA ko kwizihiza isabukuru buri mwaka byabaye umuco w'ishuri mumyaka 13 ishize.
The school's director, Luc Deschamps, said: "[We feel] it is very important for us to celebrate Christmas because the children do not have parents.	Umuyobozi w'iryo shuri, Luc Deschamps, yagize ati: "[Twumva] ari ngombwa kuri twe kwizihiza Noheri kuko abana badafite ababyeyi.
They stay with either a grandmother or a distant aunt or uncle, and they are not able to cerebrate at home or have a party or a little bit of sweets and cake for the children. 	Bagumana na nyirakuru, nyirasenge cyangwa nyirarume kandi ntibashobora guterana mu rugo cyangwa kugira ibirori cyangwa akantu gato karyoshye hamwe na keke ku bana.
So, we provide a happy day for the children to celebrate the spirit of Christmas. And it is also a way of our children to learn to give."	Rero, dukora umunsi mwiza ku bana twizihiza Noheri. Kandi ni n'inzira yo gutuma abana bacu biiga gutanga. "
No media source currently available	Nta soko y'amakuru ubu ihari.
Deschamps, who is also an Honorary Consul of France in Malawi, said before the main event the patrons were treated to "a nice meal" from the students.	Deschamps, akaba kandi ari n'Umujyanama w’icyubahiro w’Ubufaransa muri Malawi, yavuze ko mbere y’ibirori nyamukuru abo bagenzuzi bahawe "ifunguro ryiza" n’abanyeshuri.
"We had a big, big lunch with good meat and rice,[the dish made from maize flour called] nsima, of course, and vegetables. 	Yagize ati: "Twabonye ifunguro rya saa sita rihagije kandi rifite inyama n'umuceri mwiza, [ifunguro rikozwe mu ifu y'ibigori yitwa] nsima, ndetse n'imboga. 
And it was the students themselves who cooked the meal for everybody, for over 500 people," he said.	Kandi abanyeshuri ubwabo ni bo bariteguriye buri wese, ku bantu barenga 500.
One of the students, Eddah Zimba, said, "The celebrations are really cool, ... I have enjoyed myself. I have eaten, and now I am here dancing. 	Umwe mu banyeshuri, Eddah Zimba, yagize ati: "Ibirori ni byiza rwose, ... ubwange nishimye. Nariye, none ndimo no kubyina. 
What has interested me most is the gift that we have received the like the puffs, the biscuits, the squash and the dance."	Icyanshimishije cyane ni impano twahawe zirimo nk'ibi puffs, ibisuguti, amashu n'imbyino. "
She thanked the schools management for hosting the Christmas party for students who in most cases do not have such celebrations at home.	Yashimiye ubuyobozi bw'amashuri kuba bwaremeye gukora ibirori bya Noheri ku banyeshuri usanga akenshi badafite ibirori nk'ibi mu rugo.
Another student Emmanuel Chisale said good meal aside, the event has taught him the spirit of sharing.	Undi munyeshuri Emmanuel Chisale yavuze ifunguro ryiza ku ruhande rwe, ibirori byamwigishije umuco wo gusangira.
"This party has brought a change in my life. I have learned that we have to have a heart for sharing one another as the Father Christmas was doing," he said.	Ati: "Ibi biroro byazanye impinduka mu buzima bwanjye. Namenye ko tugomba kugira umutima wo gusangira nk'uko Papa Noheri yabikoraga".
Founded in 2002, the Jacaranda School for Orphans is the only one in Malawi which provides free primary, secondary and tertiary education to children without parents.	Ishuri ry'imfubyi rya Jacaranda ryashinzwe mu 2002, rikaba ari ryo ryonyine muri Malawi ritanga uburezi bw'amashuri abanza, ayisumbuye na kaminuza ku buntu ku bana badafite ababyeyi.
A Malawian woman, Marie Da Silva, started the school after she returned from the United States where she spent nineteen years working as a nanny.	Umugore wo muri Malawi, Marie Da Silva, yatangije ishuri nyuma yo kuva muri Amerika aho yari amaze imyaka cumi n'icyenda akora akazi ko kurera.
"In 2022, it's really undeniable that media polarization and information chaos are really fueling social divisions in ways that are pretty new," said Clayton Weimers, deputy director of RSF for the United States, told VOA. 	Umuyobozi wungirije wa RSF muri Leta Zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Clayton Weimers, yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika ati: "Mu 2022, ntawahakana ko kuba itangazamakuru rikabije ndetse n'akajagari mu makuru bitera amacakubiri mu mibereho mu buryo bushya." 
He said the prevalence of partisan news around the world has come at the expense of authentic journalism.	Yavuze ko ubwamamare bw'amakuru y'amashyaka ku isi bwazanywe no gutangaza amakuru nyayo.
The group's annual report ranks 180 countries based on the environment for independent journalism. 	Raporo ngarukamwaka y'itsinda rishyira ku rutonde ibihugu 180 bishingiye ku itangazamakuru ryigenga. 
This year, however, RSF said it used a new method that blends each country's political, legal, economic, sociocultural and security conditions.	Uyu mwaka ariko, RSF yavuze ko yakoresheje uburyo bushya buhuza buri gihugu mu buryo bwa politiki, amategeko, ubukungu, umuco ndetse n’umutekano.
Now, the index classifies a record 28 countries as "having very bad media freedom." 	Noneho, urutonde rwerekana ibihugu 28 "bifite umudendezo mubi w'itangazamakuru." 
That group includes China, which is exporting censorship beyond its borders while also amplifying the Kremlin's propaganda on Russia's devastating war against Ukraine.	Iri tsinda ririmo Ubushinwa, bwohereza ibicuruzwa hanze y’umupaka ndetse bikanashimangira poropagande ya Kremle ku ntambara ibabaje y’Uburusiya na Ukraine.
Russia, China among worst	Uburusiya, Ubushinwa mu bibi cyane
Since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Russia has sought total control over news coverage, passing a new law that carries 15-year prison terms for reporting "false news" on the military, and even forbids calling the conflict a "war."	Kuva igitero cyagabwa muri Ukraine ku ya 24 Gashyantare, Uburusiya bwashatse kugenzura amakuru yose, butora itegeko rishya rigena igifungo cy’imyaka 15 kubera itangazwa "ry'amakuru y'ibinyoma" ku gisirikare, ndetse rikabuza kuvuga ko amakimbirane ari "intambara."
That has forced most remaining independent news outlets, including the renowned Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Ekho Moskvy radio and Dozhd TV, to shut down or move outside Russia to continue operating.	Ibyo bikaba byaratumye ibitangazamakuru byinshi byigenga bisigaye, birimo ikinyamakuru kizwi cyane cya Novaya Gazeta, radiyo Ekho Moskvy na TV ya Dozhd, bihagarika cyangwa byimukira mu Burusiya kugira ngo bikomeze gukora.
With independent voices absent, experts say, the Russian government has been able to flood state-run airwaves with propaganda that downplays the war and spreads false or misleading justifications for the Kremlin's invasion.	Impuguke zivuga ko mu gihe amajwi yigenga adahari, guverinoma y’Uburusiya yashoboye gukwiza amakuru ya leta hamwe na poropagande yerekana intambara kandi ikwirakwiza impamvu z’ibinyoma cyangwa zibeshya ku gitero cya Kremle.
Russia's media repression stands at 155 out of 180 countries included in RSF's index, where one is the most free and 180 the least.	Ihohoterwa ry’itangazamakuru ry’Uburusiya rihagaze ku bihugu 155 mu bihugu 180 byashyizwe ku rutonde rwa RSF, aho kimwe ari cyo kiba gifite ubwisanzure kandi 180 bikaba bifite ubwisanzure buke.
"It's safe to say at this point that the free press is a thing of the past in Russia," Clayton said.	Clayton ati: "Ni byiza kuvuga kuri ubu ko itangazamakuru ryigenga ari ikintu cyahise mu Burusiya."
Throughout Russian President Vladimir Putin's 22 years in power, Moscow has been targeting journalists and the independent press, he said.	Yavuze ko mu myaka 22 Perezida w’Uburusiya Vladimir Putin amaze ku butegetsi, Moscou yibasiye abanyamakuru n’ibitangazamakuru byigenga.
"But since the invasion of Ukraine, it seems that Putin has really finished off the independent media once and for all in Russia," Clayton said. "At this point, it is impossible to accurately report on the war in Ukraine."	Clayton ati: "Ariko kuva Ukraine yaterwa, birasa nkaho Putin yarangije itangazamakuru ryigenga rimwe na rimwe mu Burusiya." Kugeza ubu, ntibishoboka gutanga raporo neza ku ntambara ibera muri Ukraine.
China ranked 175th in the new report. And now that it is firmly under Beijing's influence, Hong Kong also registered a dramatic decline, ranking 148th out of 180 following a lengthy series of raids and arrests that shuttered pro-democracy news sites.	Ubushinwa bwashyizwe ku mwanya wa 175 muri raporo nshya. Noneho, kubera ko iyobowe na Beijing, Hong Kong na yo yagabanutse ku buryo bugaragara, iza ku mwanya wa 148 kuri 180 nyuma y’igitero kinini n’ifatwa byafunze imbuga za interineti zishyigikira demokarasi.
RSF's country file on China says it is the world's biggest jailer of journalists, with 120 in detention. The regime uses coercion, harassment, intimidation and surveillance to keep independent and foreign journalists from reporting on issues deemed "sensitive."	Idosiye ya RSF mu gihugu cy’Ubushinwa ivuga ko ari ho hari ifungwa ry’abanyamakuru benshi ku isi, 120 barafashwe. Ubutegetsi bukoresha agahato, gutotezwa, iterabwoba no kugenzura kugira ngo abanyamakuru bigenga ndetse n’abanyamahanga badatanga amakuru ku bibazo bifatwa nk’ibikomeye.
"President Xi Jinping, in power since 2013, has restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era, in which freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime," RSF's country file states.	Perezida Xi Jinping, wagiye ku butegetsi kuva mu 2013, yagaruye umuco w'itangazamakuru ukwiye, mu gihe cya Maoist ho, aho kubona amakuru ku bwisanzure byabaye icyaha no gutanga amakuru bikaba icyaha gikomeye kurushaho.
Rising authoritarianism	Kwiyongera k'ubutegetsi bw'igitugu
North Korea remains the worst country in the rankings at 180th. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, political turmoil, conflict and rising authoritarianism have wiped out years of progress.	Koreya ya ruguru ikomeje kuba igihugu kibi ku rutonde kikaba icya 180. Ahandi hose mu karere ka Aziya-Pasifika, imvururu za politiki, amakimbirane hamwe n’ubutegetsi bw'igitugu byiyongereye byahanaguyeho iterambere.
The 2021 coup in Myanmar marked a 10-year setback for media rights, with journalists detained, media licenses revoked, and many news outlets returning to exile. 	Ihirikwa ry’ubutegetsi bwo mu 2021 muri Miyanimari ryagaragaje ko hasubijwe imyaka 10 uburenganzira bw’itangazamakuru, abanyamakuru barafungwa, impushya z’itangazamakuru zivanwaho, ndetse n’ibitangazamakuru byinshi bisubira mu buhungiro. 
Under the military junta, Myanmar, ranking 176th, is one of the world's biggest jailers of journalists.	Ku butegetsi bwa gisirikare, Miyanimari iri ku mwanya wa 176, ni hamwe mu hafunze abanyamakuru bakomeye ku isi.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgents pledged to uphold press freedom when they took power in August 2021.	Muri Afuganisitani, inyeshyamba z’abatalibani ziyemeje guharanira ubwisanzure bw’itangazamakuru igihe zabafatiye ku butegetsi muri Kanama 2021. 
Instead, RSF said the "Taliban's seizure of power has further worsened conditions for reporters and news organizations, who are the targets of all forms of intimidation and violence." Afghanistan ranked 154th.	Nyamara, RSF yavuze ko "kwigarurira ubutegetsi bw’abatalibani byarushijeho kuba bibi ku banyamakuru n’imiryango itangaza amakuru, bakaba ari bo bakorerwa iterabwoba n’urugomo." Afuganisitani iri ku mwanya wa 154.
Across Africa, laws criminalizing online journalism have dealt a new blow to the right to information, RSF said, while the spread of rumors, propaganda, and disinformation has contributed to undermine access to quality information.	RSF yavuze ko hirya no hino muri Afurika, amategeko ahana itangazamakuru ku rubuga rwa interineti yagize ingaruka nshya ku burenganzira bwo kumenya amakuru, mu gihe ikwirakwizwa ry’ibihuha, poropagande, ndetse n’amakuru yanduye byagize uruhare mu guhungabanya amakuru meza.
In Ethiopia, the war in the Tigray region, with its communication blackouts and restricted access, were the main factors that placed the country 114 on the index. 	Muri Etiyopiya, intambara yo mu karere ka Tigray, hamwe n’itumanaho no kubuza kwinjirira amakuru, ni byo bintu nyamukuru byashyize igihugu ku rutonde rwa 114. 
Neighboring Eritrea and Djibouti are far worse, ranking near the bottom at 179 and 164, respectively.	Abaturanyi ba Eritereya na Djibouti ho ni bibi cyane, biza hafi ya 179 na 164.
African media continue to struggle economically, RSF said it its accompanying analysis.	Ibitangazamakuru byo muri Afurika bikomeje guhangana mu by’ubukungu, RSF yavuze ko isesengura rihari riherekeje.
"Despite a wave of liberalization in the 1990s, there are still, too often, cases of arbitrary censorship, especially on the internet, with occasional network shutdowns in some countries, arrests of journalists and violent attacks," the group said.	Iri tsinda ryagize riti: "Nubwo mu myaka ya za 90 habaye umudendezo wo kwishyira ukizana, haracyari, kenshi na kenshi, ibibazo byo kugenzura uko bishakiye, cyane cyane kuri interineti, rimwe na rimwe bifunga imiyoboro mu bihugu bimwe na bimwe, ifatwa ry'abanyamakuru ndetse n'ibitero by'urugomo."
Clayton said the rising authoritarianism feeds on itself.	Clayton yavuze ko igitugu kigenda cyiyongera.
"When we allow a culture of impunity to exist where authoritarians are allowed to go after journalists, harass them, arrest them, beat them in the streets and kill them, it has a knock-on effect," he said.	Ati: "Iyo twemeye ko umuco wo kudahana ubaho aho abategetsi b'igitugu bemerewe gukurikirana abanyamakuru, kubatoteza, kubafata, kubakubita mu mihanda no kubica, bigira ingaruka mbi". 
"It emboldens that same authoritarian to do it again next time, and it emboldens other authoritarians who are watching to do the same."	Irashimangira ubwo butegetsi bumwe bwo kuzongera kubikora ubutaha, kandi bugashimangira abandi bayobozi bareba ko babikora.
US not perfect	Amerika ntabwo Ari intunganye
After a period of seeing its media attacked as "fake news" by former President Donald Trump, the United States retained a relatively high ranking of 42 in RSF's index. 	Nyuma y'igihe kinini cyo kubona itangazamakuru ryacyo ryibasiwe "n'amakuru y'ibinyoma" n'uwahoze ari perezida Donald Trump, Amerika yagumanye umwanya wa 42 ukurikije urutonde rwa RSF. 
That is largely thanks to the return of regular White House and federal agency press briefings.	Ibyo ahanini tubikesha kugaruka kwa White House bisanzwe hamwe n'abanyamakuru ba federasiyo.
But RSF said problems persist, including "the disappearance of local newspapers, the systematic polarization of the media, and the erosion of journalism by digital platforms amid a climate of animosity and aggression toward journalists, among others."	Ariko RSF yavuze ko ibibazo bikomeje, harimo "ibura ry'ibinyamakuru byaho, itumanaho rya buri gihe ry'itangazamakuru, ndetse no gutsemba abanyamakuru ku mbuga za interineti mu gihe hari inzangano n'ibitero byibasiye abanyamakuru, n'ibindi."
Barriers exist, for instance, when it comes to covering state governments and protests.	Inzitizi zirahari, nk'urugero, mu gihe cyo gusigasira inzego za leta n’imyigaragambyo.
"We typically find that this is either due to just a blatant disregard for the laws governing open records or meetings, or they're simply misinterpreting them. 	Umuyobozi mukuru w'ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe itangazamakuru, Beth Francesco ati: "Ubusanzwe dusanga ibyo biterwa no kwirengagiza byimazeyo amategeko agenga inyandiko zifunguye cyangwa inama, cyangwa se bakabisobanura nabi. 
An individual is misinterpreting whether a journalist can be present at a particular event," said Beth Francesco, senior director of the National Press Club Journalism Institute.	Umuntu ku giti cye arimo gusobanura nabi niba umunyamakuru ashobora kwitabira ibirori runaka."
A few bright spots	Ahantu hakeye
Despite an overall trend of decline, Clayton said there are positives.	Nubwo muri rusange bigenda bigabanuka, Clayton yavuze ko hari ibyiza.
Some governments provide funding for news media without interfering in their operations, to ensure independence from political influence.	Guverinoma zimwe na zimwe zitanga inkunga mu bitangazamakuru zitivanze mu bikorwa byabyo, mu kugaragaza ubwigenge ko nta ruhare rwa politiki rurimo.
"If you look at the top of our list, some of the things that stand out are these are countries that have robust public funding for media," he said, noting that "it's always important to separate state funding for media and state-controlled media."	Ati: "Iyo urebye hejuru y'urutonde rwacu, bimwe mu bigaragara ni ibi bihugu bifite inkunga ya Leta mu itangazamakuru", akomeza agira ati: "Buri gihe ni ngombwa gutandukanya inkunga ya Leta mu bitangazamakuru no kugenzurwa na leta."
Three Scandinavian countries — Norway, Denmark and Sweden — respectively come at the top of RSF's index. Estonia, a former Soviet Union republic, ranked 4th.	Ibihugu bitatu bya Scandinaviya - Noruveje, Danemarke na Suwede - biza ku isonga ku rutonde rwa RSF. Esitoniya yahoze ari repubulika y’Abasoviyeti, iri ku mwanya wa 4.
RSF said the free exercise of journalism plays a major role in emerging democracies such as East Timor, ranked 17, Bhutan, ranked 33, and Mongolia, ranked 90.	RSF yavuze ko itangazamakuru rikorera mu bwisanzure rigira uruhare runini muri demokarasi igaragara nka Timoru y’iburasirazuba, iri ku mwanya wa 17, Bhutani, 33, na Mongoliya iri ku mwanya wa 90.
East Timor was one country whose ranking skyrocketed, rising 54 places. But RSF cautioned that because of its change in methodology this year, "care should be taken when comparing the 2022 rankings and scores with those from 2021."	Iburasirazuba bwa Timoru ni igihugu kimwe cyashyizwe hejuru cyane, kizamuka ahantu 54. Ariko RSF yibukije ko kubera ihinduka ry’imikorere muri uyu mwaka, "hagomba kwitonderwa iyo ugereranije amanota 2022 n'amanota yo mu 2021."
	
UN’s Guterres Meets with Nigerian Leaders After Visiting Volatile Borno State	Loni ya Guterres ihura n'abayobozi ba Nigeriya Nyuma yo gusura Leta ya Borno

Ku wa gatatu, umunyamabanga mukuru wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Antonio Guterres yabonanye n’abayobozi ba Nijeriya nyuma y’uruzinduko rw’iminsi ibiri muri Nijeriya n’urugendo rw’ibihugu bitatu muri Afurika. Ku wa kabiri, yasuye abimuwe mu gihugu (IDP) mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba bwa Nijeriya maze abasaba ko basubizwa mu ngo zabo amahoro. Abategetsi ba Nijeriya barateganya gufunga inkambi zose z’abimuwe mu myaka mike iri imbere nubwo hari impungenge z'umutekano. Ku wa gatatu, Antonio Guterres yageze mu nzu y’umuryango w’abibumbye i Abuja ahura n’umuhuzabikorwa w’umuryango w’abibumbye mbere yo kugirana ibiganiro n’abahagarariye abagore bo muri Nijeriya.
On Tuesday, he visited internally displaced people (IDPs) in northeast Nigeria and called for them to be safely returned to their homes. 	
Nigerian authorities plan to close all IDP camps in the next few years despite security concerns. 	
Antonio Guterres arrived the United Nations house in Abuja around 9 a.m. Wednesday and met with U.N. local coordinators before holding talks with Nigerian womens representatives.	
The delegates, led by Nigeria's minister for womens affairs, Pauline Kedem Tallen, discussed gender equality and the inclusion of women in politics with the U.N. secretary-general. 	Izi ntumwa ziyobowe na minisitiri w’ibikorwa by’umugore muri Nijeriya, Pauline Kedem Tallen, baganiriye ku buringanire bw’umugore no kwinjiza abagore muri politiki n’umunyamabanga mukuru wa Amerika.
"His coming to Nigeria today has given us hope, because we know that he will lend his voice to all the issues affecting women, gender-based violence, early marriage, lack of implementation of some of our laws," said Tallen.	Tallen yagize ati: "Uyu munsi kuza muri Nijeriya byaduhaye ibyiringiro, kuko tuzi ko azatanga ijwi rye ku bibazo byose bireba abagore, ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina, gushyingirwa hakiri kare, kudashyira mu bikorwa amategeko yacu."
Guterres afterwards met with Nigeria's religious leaders and later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the U.N. house to remember the 23 people killed during the 2011 bombing of the building.	Nyuma Guterres yahuye n’abayobozi b’amadini ya Nijeriya nyuma aza kwitabira umuhango wo gushyira indabyo mu nzu y’umuryango w’abibumbye kugira ngo bibuke abantu 23 bishwe n'igisasu cyaturikiye mu nyubako ya 2011.
He began his three-nation Africa visit Sunday in Senegal as part of his Ramadan solidarity tour, and later went to Niger.	Yatangiye uruzinduko rwe muri Afurika y'ibihugu bitatu ku cyumweru muri Senegali mu rwego rwo kuzenguruka ubumwe bwa Ramadhan, nyuma ajya muri Niger.
On Tuesday, he visited northeastern Borno state and met with the state governor as well as IDPs and families impacted by the Boko Haram conflict.	Ku wa kabiri, yasuye intara y’amajyaruguru ya Leta ya Borno maze abonana na guverineri w’intara hamwe n’abimuwe n’imiryango yibasiwe n’intambara ya Boko Haram.
Guterres also visited repentant Boko Haram fighters and praised authorities' reintegration program for more than 1,000 former fighters.	Guterres kandi yasuye abarwanyi ba Boko Haram bihannye anashimira gahunda y’abategetsi bahoze mu barwanyi barenga 1.000.
He also commended authorities efforts to resettle displaced people back to their communities and called for more support to rebuild the region. 	Yashimye kandi ubuyobozi bwashyize ingufu mu gucyura abimuwe mu byabo kandi asaba ko hashyigikirwa kubaka izindi nyubako.
"The Borno that I found today is the Borno of hope, the Borno with future and I was very impressed to see the policy that is being deployed here, recognizing that you don't fight terrorism just by military means, you fight terrorism addressing the root causes of terrorism," he said. 	Borno nasanze aha uyu munsi ni Borno y'ibyiringiro, Borno y'ejo hazaza kandi natangajwe cyane no kubona politiki iri gukoreshwa hano, nkamenya ko utarwanya iterabwoba ukoresheje inzira za gisirikare gusa, urwanya iterabwoba rivuga n'ntandaro y'iterabwoba. 
"The people that I met today in the IDP camps want to go back home in safety and dignity. 	Abantu nahuye na bo uyu munsi mu nkambi z'abimuwe barashaka gusubira mu rugo mu mutekano no mu cyubahiro. 
The way to address terrorism effectively is to provide not only hope but a future of reality."	Inzira yo guhangana n’iterabwoba ni ugutanga ibyiringiro ndetse ahubwo ni ejo hazaza h'ukuri.
Nigerian authorities have been closing IDP camps since late last year and want to close all camps by 2026. More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes since the start of the Boko Haram insurgency in 2009.	Abategetsi ba Nijeriya bafunze ingando kuva mu mpera z'umwaka ushize kandi barashaka gufunga inkambi zose mu 2026. Abantu barenga miliyoni 2 bavanywe mu byabo kuva aho inyeshyamba za Boko Haram zitangiriye mu 2009.
But aid groups have been warning some communities may still be attacked.	Ariko amatsinda atabara yagiye aburira abaturage bamwe bashobora kugabwaho igitero.
"There are multiple solutions when it comes to resettlement. We need to get people stabilized," said Adenike Oladosu, a climate justice activist, met with the U.N. secretary-general.	Adenike Oladosu, uharanira ubutabera mu by'ikirere, yabonanye n'umunyamabanga mukuru wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika ati: "Hariho ibisubizo byinshi mu bijyanye no gutuza. Tugomba gutuma abantu batekana." 
"Climate change is leading to the rise of armed conflicts affecting people in the region and around and the need for us to see that we have more climate action and not always military action."	Imihindagurikire y’ibihe ituma amakimbirane yitwaje intwaro yiyongera ku baturage bo mu karere ndetse no hirya no hino kandi dukeneye ko tubona ko dufite ibikorwa byinshi by’ikirere kandi ko atari ko buri gihe haba ibikorwa bya gisirikare.
The U.N. secretary-general ended his visit at the Abuja presidential village, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari and his top Cabinet members.	Umunyamabanga mukuru wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika yakoze uruzinduko rwe mu mudugudu wa perezida wa Abuja, aho yabonanye na Perezida Muhammadu Buhari n'abagize Guverinoma bakuru.
	
Al-Shabab Raids African Union Military Base	Al-Shabab yagabye igitero ku kigo cya gisirikare cy’ubumwe bwa Afurika
Al-Shabab fighters stormed an African Union military base in the village of El-Baraf in Somalias Middle Shabelle region early Tuesday, local officials and security sources say.	Abayobozi b'inzego z'ibanze ndetse n'abashinzwe umutekano bavuga ko abarwanyi ba Al-Shabab bateye mu birindiro by'ingabo z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika mu mudugudu wa El-Baraf mu karere ka Somaliya Hagati mu karere ka Shabelle.
Officials told VOA Somali that the militants briefly seized the base before withdrawing from it. State media said Burundian solders at the base repulsed the attack.	Abayobozi babwiye VOA ikorera muri Somaliya ko abarwanashyaka bafashe ibirindiro mbere gato yo kubivamo. Ibitangazamakuru bya Leta byavuze ko abarwanyi bo mu Burundi bari mu kigo bashubije inyuma icyo gitero.
"The Federal Government of Somalia condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous attack targeting the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia forward operating base in Elbaraf, Middle Shabelle," the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted on its official Facebook page.	Minisiteri y’ububanyi n’amahanga ya Somaliya yanditse ku rubuga rwayo rwa Facebook, igira iti: "Guverinoma y’igihugu cya Somaliya iramagana mu magambo akomeye bishoboka ko igitero kibi cyagabwe ku butumwa bw’inzibacyuho bw’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika Yunze ubumwe muri Somaliya i Elbaraf, hagati ya Shabelle."
"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of this terrorist attack and their families."	Twihanganishije cyane abahuye n'ingaruka n'iki gitero cy'iterabwoba n'imiryango yabo.
The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs. He said the militants then fought their way onto the base.	Umuyobozi w'akarere ka El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, yavuze ko aba barwanyi batangiye kugaba ibitero bakoresheje bisasu bibiri by'amakamyo. Yavuze ko abarwanashyaka bahise barwanira mu birindiro.
Al-Shabab claimed the killing of 173 African Union forces. The group also claimed responsibility for capturing AU forces as prisoners-of-war. Both claims could not be independently verified. AU force headquarters and Somali military officials could not be immediately reached for comment.	Al-Shabab yatangaje ko hapfuye ingabo 173 z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika. Uyu mutwe kandi wavuze ko ufite inshingano zo gufata ingabo za AU nk'imfungwa z'intambara. Ibyo birego byombi ntibishobora kugenzurwa mu bwigenge. Icyicaro gikuru cy’ingabo za AU hamwe n’abayobozi b’igisirikare cya Somaliya ntibashoboye guhita batanga ibisobanuro.
In an interview with VOA, Muhumed, who was not at the village at the time of the attack, said he was told there were "many deaths" among Burundian forces but could not give an exact figure.	Mu kiganiro yagiranye na VOA, Muhumed, utari mu mudugudu igihe igitero cyagabwaga, yavuze ko yabwiwe ko hari "imfu nyinshi" mu ngabo z’Uburundi ariko ko adashobora gutanga imibare nyayo.
"Fighting like this never happened in this area," he said. "It was heavy fighting."	Ati: "Imirwano nk'iyi ntabwo yigeze ibera muri kariya gace". Yari imirwano ikomeye.
He said two civilians were also killed and more than 10 others injured.	Yavuze ko abasivili babiri na bo bishwe abandi barenga 10 barakomereka.
Muhumed confirmed to VOA that al-Shabab militants withdrew from the base. He also reported airstrikes targeting the militants as they left the base but did not say who was responsible for the strikes.	Muhumed yemeje VOA ko abarwanyi ba al-Shabab bavuye mu birindiro. Yavuze kandi ko ibitero by’indege byibasiye abarwanashyaka ubwo bavaga mu birindiro ariko ntiyavuze uwagize uruhare muri ibyo bitero.
El-Baraf, approximately 150 kilometers north of Mogadishu, is one of the forward operating bases of African Union forces from Burundi.	El-Baraf, nko mu birometero 150 mu majyaruguru ya Mogadishu, ni kimwe mu birindiro by'ingabo z’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ziba mu Burundi.
The incident marked the first major al-Shabab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month.	Iki cyabaye igitero cya mbere gikomeye al-Shabab yagabye ku ngabo za AU kuva ubwo butumwa bwahinduye izina n'imikorere yabyo mu kwezi gushize.
The U.N. Security Council, which authorized the new mission called the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), gives it a mandate to reduce the threat posed by al-Shabab, support the capacity-building of Somali security forces, and conduct a phased handover of security responsibilities to Somalia. The mission has until the end of 2024 to operate in the country.	Akanama k'umuryango w’abibumbye gashinzwe umutekano, kemereye ubutumwa bushya bwitwa Mission Union Transition Mission muri Somaliya (ATMIS), giha inshingano yo kugabanya iterabwoba ryatewe na al-Shabab, gushyigikira kongerera ubushobozi inzego z’umutekano za Somaliya. Hakozwe kandi ihererekanyabubasha ry’umutekano muri Somaliya. Inshingano ifite kugeza mu mpera za 2024 gukorera mu gihugu.
	
India’s Muslims Mark Eid al-Fitr Amid Community Violence	Abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde bagize Eid al-Fitr mu gihe cy’ihohoterwa ry’abaturage
Muslims across India marked Eid al-Fitr on Tuesday by offering prayers outside mosques, even as the celebrations this year came in the backdrop of a series of recent attacks against the community during the month of Ramadan.	Ku wa kabiri, Abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde bizihije umunsi mukuru wa Eid al-Fitr basengera hanze y’imisigiti, nubwo kwizihiza uyu mwaka byaje nyuma y’ibitero byibasiye abaturage mu kwezi kwa Ramadhan.
"We will not have the same kind of festivity" this time, said Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, a civil engineer in Indias financial capital, Mumbai. "This is the most painful Eid with worst memories for Indian Muslims."	Mohammad Habeeb ur Rehman, umushakashatsi mu by'ubwubatsi mu murwa mukuru w'imari wa Indias, Mumbai, yagize ati: "Ntabwo tuzagira ibirori nk'ibyo." Uyu ni umunsi ukomeye ubabaza cyane twibuka abayisilamu bo mu Buhinde.
Anti-Muslim sentiment and attacks have surged across the country in the last month, including stone throwing between Hindu and Muslim groups during religious processions and subsequent demolitions of a number of properties mostly belonging to Muslims by authorities.	Mu kwezi gushize imyumvire yo kurwanya abayisilamu n'ibitero byagaragaye hirya no hino mu gihugu, harimo gutera amabuye hagati y'amatsinda y'abahindu n'abayisilamu mu gihe cy'imyigaragambyo y'idini ndetse no gusenya imitungo myinshi ahanini yari iy'abayisilamu n'abayobozi.
The community, which makes up 14% of Indias 1.4 billion population, is reeling from vilification by hard-line Hindu nationalists who have long espoused an anti-Muslim stance. Some leaders of Indias ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have tacitly supported the violence, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far been silent about it. Eid al-Fitr is typically marked with communal prayers, celebratory gatherings around festive meals and new clothes, but celebrations in India for the past two years have been marred by COVID-19 restrictions.	Uyu muryango ugizwe na 14% by'abaturage ba Indias miliyari 1.4, bahangayikishijwe no gutukwa n’abenegihugu b’Abahindu bakomeye kuva kera bashyigikiye imyigaragambyo yo kurwanya Abayisilamu. Bamwe mu bayobozi b’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi ry’Abahindu baharanira inyungu z’Abahindu bashyigikiye byimazeyo ihohoterwa, mu gihe Minisitiri w’intebe Narendra Modi kugeza ubu acecetse. Ubusanzwe Eid al-Fitr irangwa n'amasengesho rusange, guterana kwizihiza amafunguro y'iminsi mikuru hamwe n'imyenda mishya, ariko ibirori mu Buhinde mu myaka ibiri ishize byarangijwe na COVID-19.
In Indian-controlled Kashmir, the Muslim festival has been subdued for the past three years because of an unprecedented military lockdown after India stripped the regions semi-autonomy in 2019, followed by the pandemic. The region also saw a rise in violence during Ramadan, with at least 20 militants, two civilians and five police and soldiers killed.	Mu mujyi wa Kashmir ugenzurwa n’Ubuhinde, iserukiramuco ry’abayisilamu rimaze imyaka itatu ryigaruriwe n’igitero kitigeze kibaho nyuma y’uko Ubuhinde bwambuye uturere igice cyigenga muri 2019, hagakurikiraho icyorezo. Muri ako karere kandi hagaragaye urugomo muri Ramazani, hapfa nibura abarwanyi 20, abasivili babiri n'abapolisi n'abasirikare batanu.
"As we prepare to celebrate Eid, a strong sense of collective loss jars at us," said Bashir Ahmed, a businessman in Srinagar.	Umucuruzi muri Srinagar, Bashir Ahmed yagize ati: "Mu gihe twitegura kwizihiza umunsi mukuru wa Eid, twumva ko ari ibibindi byuzuye igihombo kuri twe."
Kashmir is the Muslim-majority disputed region where a violent insurgency against Indian rule and New Delhis brutal crackdown has raged for over three decades. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict.	Kashmir ni agace kagizwe n’abayisilamu aho usanga inyeshyamba zikaze ku butegetsi bw’Ubuhinde ndetse n’igitero simusiga cya New Delhis kimaze imyaka isaga mirongo itatu. Abantu ibihumbi mirongo bapfiriye muri iyo ntambara.
Meanwhile in the capital, New Delhi, hundreds assembled in the Jama Masjid, one of Indias largest mosques, while offering Eid prayers there for the first time in over two years due to pandemic restrictions. Families came together early on Tuesday morning while many people shared hugs and wishes.	Hagati aho, mu murwa mukuru, New Delhi, abantu babarirwa mu magana bateraniye i Jama Masjid, umwe mu misigiti minini ya Indias, mu gihe basengaga umunsi mukuru wa Noheri ku nshuro yabo ya mbere mu myaka irenga ibiri kubera inzitizi z’ibyorezo. Imiryango yateraniye kare mugitondo cyo kuwa kabiri mugihe abantu benshi basangiye guhobera no kwifuriza.
	
Beijing Residents Brace for COVID-19 Lockdown	Abatuye Beijing bitegura Gumamurugo kubera COVID-19 
Unlike Shanghai, Beijing has yet to require that all its residents remain at home to contain the spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, many people in its Chaoyang district and elsewhere are preparing for that possibility.	Bitandukanye na Shanghai, Beijing ntisaba ko abaturage bayo bose baguma mu rugo kugira ngo birinde COVID-19. Nubwo bimeze bityo ariko, abantu benshi mu karere kayo ka Chaoyang n'ahandi barimo kwitegura ku buryo bushoboka.
On Wednesday, city officials closed 60 subway stations, more than 10% of Beijing's vast system. They did not say when service would be resumed, according to ABC News.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi b'umugi bafunze gari ya moshi 60, zirenga 10% bya sisitemu ngari ya Beijing. Ntibavuze igihe serivisi izasubukurirwa nk'uko ABC News ibitangaza.
Beijing, a city of 21 million people, has been on high alert for the spread of COVID-19, as restaurants and bars pivot to takeout, gyms close and schools suspend classes indefinitely, according to CNBC.	Nk’uko CNBC ibitangaza, umujyi wa Beijing, umujyi utuwe na miliyoni 21, wakomeje kuba maso kugira ngo COVID-19 ikwirakwizwe, kubera ko amaresitora n'utubari bikurwaho, siporo zirafunga ndetse n'amashuri ahagarika amasomo mu gihe kitazwi.
People who live in "controlled" areas, neighborhoods where cases have been discovered, have been told to stay in the city, and all residents must test for the virus three times throughout the week, according to ABC.	Nk’uko ABC ibitangaza, abantu baba mu duce "tugenzurwa", mu duce twagaragayemo ibibazo, basabwe kuguma mu mujyi, kandi abaturage bose bagomba kwipimisha virusi mu cyumweru cyose.
Chinese authorities reported 5,489 cases nationwide on Wednesday, of which 4,982 were in Shanghai, which has been under a draconian lockdown for weeks.	Ku wa gatatu, abategetsi b'Abashinwa bavuze ko abantu 5489 mu gihugu hose, muri bo 4982 bari i Shanghai, bamaze ibyumweru byinshi bifunzwe.
Beijing reported 46 symptomatic cases and five asymptomatic on Wednesday. The city's total since April 22, what it considers the start of its omicron outbreak, is 544.	Ku wa gatatu, Pekin yatangaje ibibazo 46 by'ibimenyetso na bitanu bidafite ibimenyetso. Umujyi wose kuva 22 Mata, icyo ubona ko ari intangiriro yicyorezo cyawo, ni 544.
Mr. Zhang, a Beijing resident, said he had bought extra food and water, even though he doesn't think Beijing will be locked down like Shanghai. He asked that VOA not use his full name because he was afraid of attracting official attention.	Bwana Zhang utuye i Beijing, yavuze ko yaguze ibiryo n'amazi by'inyongera, nubwo adatekereza ko Beijing izafungwa nka Shanghai. Yasabye ko VOA idakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kuko yatinyaga gukurura abayobozi.
"I have six bags of rice, two bags of noodles, and several boxes of water, instant noodles and (nutritionally dense) biscuits, and I haven't stocked up too much," Zhang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview last week. He said he bought his groceries online because the supermarket was crowded.	Mu cyumweru gishize, Zhang yatangarije VOA Mandarin ati: "Mfite imifuka itandatu y'umuceri, imifuka ibiri ya noode, hamwe n'amasanduku menshi y'amazi, isafuriya ihita hamwe na biscuits (byuzuye intungamubiri), kandi sinigeze mbika byinshi".Yavuze ko yaguze ibyo kurya kuri interineti kubera ko supermarket yari yuzuye.
Ms. Yao, who lives in the Chaoyang district, told VOA Mandarin that she had been stocking up on necessities since the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Commerce recommended that everyone do so. She asked that VOA Mandarin not use her full name because she wanted to avoid official retribution.	Madamu Yao utuye mu karere ka Chaoyang, yatangarije VOA Mandarin ko yabitse ibikenerwa kuva mu ntangiriro z'uyu mwaka, nyuma y'uko Minisiteri y'Ubucuruzi ibasabye ko buri wese yabikora. Yasabye ko VOA Mandarin idakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kuko yashakaga kwirinda ibihano byemewe.
"I have always maintained a good habit of reserving food. So I have a lot of rice, noodles and oil at home," she said, adding that she figured her family would be fine even if Beijing locked down for a month.	Ati: "Nahoraga ngira akamenyero keza ko kubika ibiryo. Mfite rero umuceri, isafuriya n'amavuta mu rugo", akomeza avuga ko yasanze umuryango we uzaba mwiza nubwo Beijing yafunzwe ukwezi.
And while Beijing has not yet closed the city, citizens' lives have been disrupted.	Mu gihe kandi Beijing itarafunga umujyi, ubuzima bw’abaturage bwahurangabanye.
On April 28, the Beijing Chaoyang District Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital issued a notice that the outpatient and emergency departments of the hospital would suspend the admission of patients.	Ku ya 28 Mata, ibitaro byita ku buzima bw’ababyeyi n’abana bo mu karere ka Beijing Chaoyang byasohoye itangazo rivuga ko ishami ry’ibitaro n’ubutabazi by’ibitaro bizahagarika kwakira abarwayi.
On the same day, Chaoyang Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Beijing, announced on its official Weibo account that its emergency department would also suspend the admission of patients. Weibo is China's equivalent of Twitter.	Kuri uwo munsi, ibitaro bya Chaoyang, kimwe mu bitaro binini i Beijing, byatangaje ku rubuga rwayo rwa Weibo ko ishami ryihutirwa naryo rizahagarika kwakira abarwayi. Weibo nu Bushinwa bungana na Twitter.
Angry Chinese netizens left more than 800 messages under the official WeChat account "Beijing Headline."	Abashinwa bafite umujinya mwinshi basize ubutumwa burenga 800 munsi ya konte ya WeChat "Umutwe wa Beijing."
"Why do you stop the emergency room as soon as there is a new COVID case, and how many people will be killed due to the secondary disaster caused by the COVID?" a netizen asked in a Weibo post.	"Kuki uhagarika icyumba cyihutirwa ukimara kubona ikibazo gishya cya COVID, kandi ni bangahe bazahitanwa n’impanuka ya kabiri yatewe na COVID?" umu netisen yabajije mu nyandiko ya Weibo.
Some Beijing residents said they were not worried about a Shanghai-like lockdown.	Bamwe mu baturage ba Beijing bavuze ko badahangayikishijwe no gufunga nka Shanghai.
"Basically, I'm not afraid," said Mr. Wang, who asked VOA Mandarin to not use his full name so he could avoid attracting authorities' attention. "The party, government and military are here, and the people are here."	Bwana Wang wasabye VOA Mandarin kudakoresha izina rye ryuzuye kugira ngo yirinde gukurura abayobozi. Ati: "Muri rusange, ntabwo ntinya." Ishyaka, guverinoma n'abasirikare bari hano, kandi abaturage bari hano.
However, Wang told VOA Mandarin, in mid-October last year, after one person in his apartment building was diagnosed as positive, about 600 people from more than 200 families were forced into isolation at several hotels in the Changping district for 21 days.	Icyakora, Wang yabwiye VOA Mandarin, ko hagati mu Kwakira umwaka ushize, nyuma yuko basanze umuntu umwe mu nyubako ye afite icyiza, abantu bagera kuri 600 bo mu miryango irenga 200 bahatiwe kwigunga mu mahoteri menshi yo mu karere ka Changping mu gihe cy'iminsi 21.
Wang and his wife were not allowed to share a room at their hotel.	Wang n'umugore we ntibari bemerewe gusangira icyumba muri hoteri yabo.
What particularly puzzled and annoyed Wang was that on the last day of the mandatory hotel quarantine, in addition to routine nasal and oral swabs during testing, authorities added anal swabs to the regimen.	Icyatangaje cyane kandi cyarakaje Wang ni uko ku munsi wanyuma wa karantine ya hoteri iteganijwe, usibye kwizuru ryamazuru hamwe n'umunwa mu gihe cyo kwipimisha, abayobozi bongeyeho anal kuri rejime.

At US Urging, Fiji Seizes Russian Oligarch’s Yacht	Muri Amerika babisabye, Fiji Yafashe Yacht ya Oligarch yo mu Burusiya.
Another Russian oligarchs yacht was seized Thursday as part of efforts to punish Russia over its war in Ukraine.	Indi yacht yo mu Burusiya yafashwe mu rwego rwo guhana Uburusiya kubera intambara yabereye muri Ukraine.
At the request of the United States, Fijian officials took a $300 million yacht belonging to Suleiman Kerimov, the Justice Department said. Officials say the yacht is in Lautoka, Fiji.	Ishami ry’ubutabera rivuga ko bisabwe n’Amerika, abayobozi ba Fijiyani batwaye ubwato bwa miliyoni 300 z’amadolari ya Suleiman Kerimov. Abayobozi bavuga ko ubwato buri i Lautoka, muri Fiji.
Kerimovs yacht, the Cayman Island-flagged Amadea, reportedly has been in Fiji since last month, arriving from Mexico. Defense lawyers claimed the vessel belonged to another oligarch.	Yacht Kerimovs, ikirwa cya Cayman Flagged Amadea, bivugwa ko ari muri Fiji kuva mu kwezi gushize, ageze muri Mexico. Abunganira abaregwa bavuze ko ubwo bwato ari ubwa oligarch.
Kerimov had already been sanctioned by the U.S. in 2014 and 2018 for Russias activities in Syria and Ukraine. The European Union also sanctioned him.	Kerimov yari amaze kwemererwa na Amerika muri 2014 na 2018 kubera ibikorwa by'Uburusiya muri Siriya na Ukraine. Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’i Burayi na we wamwemereye.
In March, the U.S. government announced a comprehensive effort to identify and seize the assets of wealthy Russians who have supported the government of Russian President Vladmir Putin, as part of the response to Moscows February 24 invasion of Ukraine.	Muri Werurwe, guverinoma y’Amerika yatangaje ko hashyizweho ingufu mu kumenya no gufata umutungo w’Abarusiya bakize bashyigikiye guverinoma ya Perezida w’Uburusiya Vladmir Putin, mu rwego rwo gusubiza i Moscou igitero cyo ku ya 24 Gashyantare.
The initiative, led by the Justice Department, is called Task Force KleptoCapture.	Iyi gahunda iyobowe n’ishami ry’ubutabera, yitwa Task Force KleptoCapture.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday in a statement there is "no hiding place for the assets of criminals who enable the Russian regime." He also said, "The Justice Department will be relentless in our efforts to hold accountable those who facilitate the death and destruction we are witnessing in Ukraine."	Ku wa kane, umushinjacyaha mukuru wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Merrick Garland, yatangaje ko "nta hantu hihishe umutungo w’abagizi ba nabi bashoboza ubutegetsi bw’Uburusiya." Yavuze kandi ati: "Ishami ry’Ubutabera ntirizahwema gushyira ingufu mu kuryozwa aborohereza urupfu n’irimbuka tubona muri Ukraine."

WHO Report Says COVID Cases Decline, Except in Americas, Africa	Raporo ya OMS ivuga ko Imanza za COVID zigabanuka, Usibye muri Amerika, Afurika
The World Health Organization said Wednesday that the number of newly reported coronavirus cases and deaths globally continued to fall in the last week, continuing a decline that began in March.	Ku wa gatatu, Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima ryatangaje ko umubare w'abantu banduye coronavirus n'impfu zavuzwe ku isi wakomeje kugabanuka mu cyumweru gishize, bikomeza kugabanuka byatangiye muri Werurwe.
In its weekly report on the pandemic, the U.N. health agency said there were about 3.8 million new infections and more than 15,000 deaths last week, a 17% and 3% drop on the week respectively. But those figures are believed to be a significant underestimate of COVID-19's true toll as increasing numbers of countries abandon widespread testing and surveillance.	Muri raporo y’icyumweru ivuga ku cyorezo, ikigo cy’ubuzima cya Leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika cyavuze ko mu cyumweru gishize hari abantu bashya bagera kuri miliyoni 3.8 n’impfu zirenga 15.000, icyumweru 17% na 3% bikagabanuka. Ariko iyo mibare ngo ni ugusuzugura cyane umubare wa COVID-19 kuko umubare w’ibihugu ugenda ureka kwipimisha no kugenzura.
Still, WHO noted that cases rose by about a third in Africa and 13% in the Americas. There was also a nearly 70% jump in deaths reported in India, although that was attributed to delayed reporting rather than a recent surge of disease.	Ninde, OMS yavuze ko imanza ziyongereyeho kimwe cya gatatu muri Afurika na 13% muri Amerika. Habayeho kandi gusimbuka hafi 70% by'impfu zavuzwe mu Buhinde, nubwo ibyo byatewe no gutinda gutanga raporo aho kuba indwara ziherutse kwiyongera.
Last week, authorities in South Africa said they had noted an uptick in COVID-19 cases attributable to the BA.4 mutant of omicron, although they said it was too early to tell if that would result in a significant new wave of disease. Although the BA.4 version of COVID-19's omicron variant appears more infectious than omicron, WHO said there was no evidence yet that it was leading to substantially higher rates of hospitalization or death.	Mu cyumweru gishize, abategetsi bo muri Afurika yepfo bavuze ko babonye ikibazo cya COVID-19 cyatewe na BA.4 mutant ya omicron, nubwo bavuze ko hakiri kare kumenya niba ibyo byavamo indwara nshya. Nubwo verisiyo ya BA.4 ya COVID-19 ya omicron isa nkaho yanduye kurusha omicron, OMS yavuze ko nta kimenyetso cyerekana ko biganisha ku mubare munini w’ibitaro cyangwa urupfu.
Salim Abdool Karim, a public health expert at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that while only a "modest" rise in cases had been noted, South Africa was also in the middle of a holiday period and testing had dropped significantly. He said the cases were slowing and were "not following a rocket-like upward trajectory we would expect" in another spike of disease.	Salim Abdool Karim, impuguke mu buzima rusange muri kaminuza ya KwaZulu-Natal, yavuze ko mu gihe hagaragaye ubwiyongere bukabije mu manza, Afurika yepfo nayo yari mu kiruhuko kandi ikizamini cyaragabanutse cyane. Yavuze ko imanza zidindiza kandi ko "zidakurikiza inzira ya roketi imeze nk'izamuka hejuru".
At a press briefing on Wednesday, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said it was too soon to tell if COVID-19 was entering a seasonal pattern and warned against countries dropping all of their restrictions too quickly — as many in the West have done.	Ku wa gatatu, mu kiganiro n'abanyamakuru, umuyobozi mukuru w’ibihe bidasanzwe muri OMS, Dr. Michael Ryan, yavuze ko bidatinze kumenya niba COVID-19 yinjiye mu bihe by’ibihe kandi akanaburira ibihugu kureka ibyo bibuza byose - nk'uko benshi mu Burengerazuba babikoze.
"The jury is still out as to how seasonal this virus will become," he said, explaining that it wasn't proven yet that COVID-19 would naturally drop off in the summer and that the world could yet face more unsettling variants. "If people are crowded together in conditions where a new variant is spreading, you will see high levels of transmission," he said.	Ati: "Inteko y'abacamanza iracyareba uko iyi virusi izagenda iba ibihe", asobanura ko bitaragaragaye neza ko COVID-19 izagwa mu mpeshyi kandi ko isi ishobora guhura n'ibindi bintu bitesha umutwe. Ati: "Niba abantu bateraniye hamwe mu bihe aho usanga ubundi buryo bushya bukwirakwira, uzabona ubwinshi bwo kwandura."
Meanwhile in China, authorities continued to crack down on cities, including Beijing, where more than 10% of the subway system was shut down in an effort to curb the virus' spread, after authorities in the capital already closed down indoor dining, gyms and school classes.	Hagati aho, mu Bushinwa, abayobozi bakomeje guhashya imijyi, harimo na Beijing, aho abantu barenga 10% bya sisitemu ya metero zafunzwe mu rwego rwo gukumira virusi ikwirakwizwa, nyuma y’uko abayobozi mu murwa mukuru bamaze gufunga ibyokurya byo mu ngo, siporo ndetse amasomo y'ishuri.
In Shanghai, rigid and widely derided restrictions have led to shortages of food and medical aid along with a wider — though likely temporary — impact on the national economy. Desperate, outraged citizens have confronted authorities at barricades and online, screamed out of their windows and banged pots and pans in a sign of frustration and anger.	Muri Shanghai, imbogamizi zikomeye kandi zisebya abantu benshi zatumye ibura ry'ibiribwa n'inkunga z'ubuvuzi hamwe n’ingaruka nini nubwo zishobora kuba iz'igihe gito - ku bukungu bw'igihugu. Abaturage bihebye, bararakaye bahanganye n'abayobozi kuri bariyeri no kuri interineti, bavuza induru bava mu madirishya maze bakubita inkono n'amasafuriya mu rwego rwo kwiheba n'uburakari.
	
Myanmar Supreme Court Rejects Aung San Suu Kyi Appeal on Corruption Charges	Urukiko rw'Ikirenga rwa Miyanimari rwanze ubujurire bwa Aung San Suu Kyi ku byaha aregwa bya ruswa
An appeal of a five-year jail sentence against ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi was rejected Wednesday by the country's supreme court.	Ku wa gatatu, urukiko rw’ikirenga rw’igihugu rwanze ubujurire bw’igifungo cy’imyaka 5 ku muyobozi wa Miyanimari wirukanwe Aung San Suu Kyi.
The decision reportedly came as soon as the claim for an appeal was lodged, and the court didn't entertain arguments from either side in the case.	Iki cyemezo ngo cyafashwe akimara gutanga ikirego mu bujurire, kandi urukiko ntirwakiriye impaka ku mpande zombi muri uru rubanza.

Her lawyer called the charge absurd.	Umwunganizi we yavuze ko ikirego kitumvikana.
Suu Kyi had already been sentenced to six years for actions against the military, breaking COVID-19 rules and breaking a telecommunications law.	Suu Kyi yari amaze gukatirwa imyaka itandatu kubera ibikorwa byo kurwanya igisirikare, kurenga ku mategeko ya COVID-19 no kurenga ku itegeko ry'itumanaho.
She faces many more charges, and if found guilty could be sentenced to more than 150 years in jail.	Akurikiranyweho ibindi byaha byinshi, kandi aramutse ahamwe n'icyaha ashobora gukatirwa imyaka irenga 150.
Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since a military coup took over the country last year.	Suu Kyi afungiye mu rugo kuva ihirikwa ry’abasirikare ryigarurira igihugu umwaka ushize.
Since the coup, on Feb. 1, 2021, there have been widespread protests against the military regime. The regime cracked down violently in many cases, leaving more than 1,800 civilians dead and more than 10,000 arrested, charged or sentenced, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma).	Kuva ihirikwa ry’ubutegetsi, ku ya 1 Gashyantare 2021, habaye imyigaragambyo yo kwamagana ubutegetsi bwa gisirikare. Ishyirahamwe rifasha imfungwa za politiki (Birimaniya) rivuga ko ubwo butegetsi bwahagurukiye mu buryo bwinshi, hasigara abasivili barenga 1.800 abandi barenga 10,000 batawe muri yombi, bakurikiranyweho cyangwa bakatirwa.

Report: Iran to Execute Swedish-Iranian National by May 21	Raporo: Irani izica igihugu cya Suwede-Irani bitarenze ku ya 21 Gicurasi
Iran will later this month execute a Swedish-Iranian national whom it has imprisoned since 2016 and convicted of spying for Israel, media reported.	Ibitangazamakuru byatangaje ko Irani mu mpera z'uku kwezi izica umunyagihugu wa Suwede na Irani yafunzwe kuva mu 2016 kandi ahamwa n'icyaha cyo kuneka Isiraheli.
Irans semiofficial ISNA news agency on Wednesday released a report in which Iranian officials stated that Tehran will implement the death penalty against Ahmad Reza Jalali by May 21.	Kuri uyu wa gatatu, ibiro ntaramakuru ISNA bitanga amakuru kuri Irans byatangaje raporo aho abayobozi ba Irani bavuze ko Tehran izashyira mu bikorwa igihano cy'urupfu kuri Ahmad Reza Jalali bitarenze ku ya 21 Gicurasi.
Jalali, a researcher and physician who specializes in disaster relief, was arrested during a visit to Iran in April 2016. In 2017, Jalali was sentenced to death in Iran after he had been found guilty of passing information about two Iranian nuclear scientists to Israel to help it assassinate several nuclear scientists.	Jalali, umushakashatsi n’umuganga w’inzobere mu gutabara ibiza, yatawe muri yombi ubwo yari mu ruzinduko muri Irani muri Mata 2016. Muri 2017, Jalali yakatiwe urwo gupfa muri Irani nyuma yo guhamwa n’icyaha cyo kugeza amakuru kuri siyansi ebyiri za Irani muri Isiraheli fasha guhitana abahanga benshi ba kirimbuzi.
Rights groups have condemned Jalalis detention, citing Irans pattern of detaining dual nationals and expatriates without due process.	Imiryango iharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu yamaganye ifungwa rya Jalalis, ivuga ko Irans yo gufunga abenegihugu bombi ndetse n’ababa mu mahanga nta nzira iboneye.
Iran does not recognize dual nationals.	Irani ntiyemera abenegihugu babiri.
The announcement came as authorities in Stockholm wrapped up the trial of Hamid Nouri, a former Iranian prosecution official whom Swedish officials arrested in November 2019.	Ibi byatangajwe mu gihe abayobozi i Stockholm bashoje urubanza rwa Hamid Nouri wahoze ari umushinjacyaha wa Irani, abayobozi ba Suwede bata muri yombi mu Gushyingo 2019.
Authorities say Nouri played a role in the deaths of political prisoners executed on Iranian government orders at Irans Gohardasht prison during the final phase of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Nouri has been held in custody in Sweden since his arrest.	Abayobozi bavuga ko Nouri yagize uruhare mu rupfu rw’imfungwa za politiki ziciwe ku itegeko rya guverinoma ya Irani muri gereza ya Irans Gohardasht mu cyiciro cya nyuma cy’intambara ya Irani na Iraki mu 1988. Nouri afungiye muri Suwede kuva yatabwa muri yombi.
On Wednesday, the final day of Nouri's trial, a Stockholm district court judge set the date of the verdict for July 14.	Ku wa gatatu, umunsi wa nyuma w’urubanza rwa Nouri, umucamanza w’urukiko rw’intara ya Stockholm yashyizeho itariki y’urubanza ku ya 14 Nyakanga.
Amnesty International put the number of those executed at the prison at 5,000 but said in a 2018 report that the number could be higher.	Amnesty International yashyize ahagaragara umubare w'abiciwe muri gereza ku 5.000 ariko muri raporo ya 2018 ivuga ko umubare ushobora kuba mwinshi.
Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, said, "Iran continues to be one of the worlds leading implementers of the death penalty."	Human Rights Watch, muri raporo iherutse, yagize ati: "Irani ikomeje kuba umwe mu isi iyobora abashyira mu bikorwa igihano cy'urupfu."
If Nouri is convicted, he will face a maximum life sentence on charges of international war crimes and human rights abuses. Iran recently summoned the Swedish envoy in protest over Nouris case.	Nouri aramutse ahamwe n'icyaha, azahanishwa igifungo cya burundu ashinjwa ibyaha mpuzamahanga by'intambara no guhonyora uburenganzira bwa muntu. Irani iherutse guhamagara intumwa ya Suwede mu rwego rwo kwamagana ikibazo cya Nouris.
Maja Aberg, senior policy adviser with Amnesty International Sweden, says it is no coincidence that Iran announced Jalalis pending execution just after Swedish prosecutors moved on Nouris trial.	Maja Aberg, umujyanama mukuru muri politiki muri Amnesty International Suwede, avuga ko bidahwitse ko Irani yatangaje Jalalis mu gihe hagitegerejwe kwicwa nyuma yuko abashinjacyaha ba Suwede bimukiye mu rubanza rwa Nouris.
"It indicates that (Iran) sees him as a kind of piece in the jigsaw puzzle, which is very worrying," Aberg told Sweden's TT news agency.	Aberg yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru TT byo muri Suwede ati: "Byerekana ko (Irani) imubona nk'igice cyo mu gihirahiro, biteye impungenge cyane."
Swedish law allows for the prosecution of Swedish citizens and other nationals for crimes against international law committed abroad.	Amategeko ya Suwede yemerera gukurikirana abenegihugu ba Suwede n’abandi baturage ku byaha byibasiye amategeko mpuzamahanga akorerwa mu mahanga.

Erdogan Goes to Riyadh to Seal Rapprochement	Erdogan Yagiye Riyadh Kashe Kwiyegereza
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan heads to Saudi Arabia Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at easing old tensions between Ankara and Riyadh.	Ku wa kane, Perezida wa Turkiya, Recep Tayyip Erdogan yerekeje muri Arabiya Sawudite mu ruzinduko rw’iminsi ibiri rugamije kugabanya amakimbirane ashaje hagati ya Ankara na Riyadh.
The Turkish leaders visit with the Saudi king comes after years of rivalry between their once-close countries.	Abayobozi ba Turukiya basuye n’umwami wa Arabiya Sawudite bije nyuma y’imyaka myinshi bahanganye hagati y’ibihugu byabo byahoze.
Mehmet Ogutcu is the head of the London Energy Club, a grouping of government and energy sector leaders. Ogutcu says the visit is the culmination of intense international diplomacy.	Mehmet Ogutcu ni umuyobozi wa Club y’ingufu za Londres, itsinda ry’abayobozi ba guverinoma n’ingufu. Ogutcu avuga ko uruzinduko ari indunduro ya diplomasi mpuzamahanga.
"President Erdogan has good relations with the king; with the crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman, we had serious difficulties," said Ogutcu. "Now it looks that I believe the*(Britons), and Americans, and the Qataris of course played some role, even the Azeris might have done this. And things are changing and relaxing a bit more, and now at the presidential level, it's going to be sealed."	Ogutcu ati: "Perezida Erdogan afitanye umubano mwiza n'umwami; n'umutware w'ikamba Muhammad Bin Salman, twagize ibibazo bikomeye". "Noneho birasa nkaho nizera * (Abongereza), n'Abanyamerika, ndetse na Qatar birumvikana ko hari uruhare bagize, ndetse n'abanya Azerisitani bashobora kuba barabikoze. Kandi ibintu birahinduka kandi biruhura gato, none kurwego rwa perezida, bigiye gushyirwaho kashe. "
Erdogan and the crown prince have been bitter rivals. The Turkish president led international condemnation over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabias consulate in Istanbul.	Erdogan n'umutware w'ikamba babaye abanywanyi bakaze. Perezida wa Turkiya yamaganye amahanga kubera iyicwa ry'umunyamakuru wa Arabiya Sawudite, Jamal Khashoggi, yiciwe muri konsuline ya Arabiya Sawudite i Istanbul.
The killing was linked to the crown prince, a charge he denied. But the decision earlier this month to move the Khashoggi murder trial from Istanbul to Riyadh is seen as a gesture by Ankara, opening the way for Erdogan's visit.	Ubwicanyi bwari bufitanye isano nigikomangoma, ikirego arabihakana. Ariko icyemezo cyatangiye muri uku kwezi cyo kwimura urubanza rw’ubwicanyi rwa Khashoggi kuva Istambul kugera i Riyadh gifatwa nk’ikimenyetso cya Ankara, kikaba cyarafunguye inzira y'uruzinduko rwa Erdogan.
Ogutcu says with presidential elections due next year, Erdogan is looking for Saudi help to bail out the ailing Turkish economy.	Ogutcu avuga ko hamwe n'amatora ya perezida ateganijwe umwaka utaha, Erdogan arimo gushaka ubufasha bwa Arabiya Sawudite kugira ngo akize ubukungu bwa Turukiya burwaye.
"Turkey has an interest in reviving relations with Riyadh because Turkey needs financial support," said Ogutcu. "The Turkish economy is not attracting any significant portfolio investments nor sovereign wealth funds coming to invest Turkey. But this will be a give-and-take package deal involving these countries. So, there are real economic and political security interests involved."	Ogutcu ati: "Turkiya ishishikajwe no kongera umubano na Riyadh kuko Turukiya ikeneye inkunga y'amafaranga". "Ubukungu bwa Turukiya ntabwo bukurura ishoramari rikomeye cyangwa amafaranga y’umutungo wigenga uza gushora Turukiya. Ariko aya azaba amasezerano yo gutanga no gufata ibyemezo birimo ibi bihugu. Ku bw'ibyo, hari inyungu z’ubukungu n’ubukungu bya politiki zirimo."
Shared concerns over Iran's growing influence in the region -- along with its nuclear energy program -- provide important common ground between Riyadh and Ankara, says international relations professor Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University, especially as American attention is expected to pivot away from the Middle East and toward China.	Umwarimu w’umubano mpuzamahanga, Soli Ozel wo muri kaminuza ya Kadir Has ya kaminuza ya Istanbul, avuga ko impungenge z’uko Irani igenda yiyongera muri kariya karere - hamwe na gahunda yayo y’ingufu za kirimbuzi - bitanga icyerekezo rusange hagati ya Riyadh na Ankara. Uburasirazuba bwo hagati no mu Bushinwa.
"Turkey does propose itself as a counterweight to Iran. Both countries have an interest along with all the western countries for Iran not to be as influential throughout the region as it is today," said Ozel. "And the Iranians are also constantly sending signals that they are not going to let others draw them away from those countries - Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - where they have quite a lot of influence."	Ozel yagize ati: "Turukiya yiyerekana nk'ikibazo cyo guhangana na Irani. Ibihugu byombi bifite inyungu hamwe n'ibihugu byose byo mu burengerazuba bw'isi kugira ngo Irani itagira uruhare runini mu karere nk'uko bimeze ubu." "Kandi Abanyayirani nabo bahora bohereza ibimenyetso byerekana ko batazemera ko abandi babavana muri ibyo bihugu - Iraki, Libani na Siriya - aho bafite uruhare runini."
Erdogan's Saudi visit is part of a wider policy of seeking to repair relations across the region in a bid to end its isolation. The Turkish president has recently visited the United Arab Emirates and earlier this month hosted the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog.	Uruzinduko rwa Erdogan muri Arabiya Sawudite ni imwe muri politiki yagutse yo gusana umubano mu karere kose hagamijwe guhagarika akato. Perezida wa Turukiya aherutse gusura Leta zunze ubumwe z'Abarabu kandi mu ntangiriro z'uku kwezi yakiriye perezida wa Isiraheli, Isaac Herzog.
But analyst Ozel warns Ankara is in a vulnerable position.	Ariko umusesenguzi Ozel aragabisha Ankara ari mu bihe bigoye.
"Turkey alienated, insulted, offended a lot of countries with which it had at least decent relations. And they all recognize that this burst of diplomacy is coming out of weakness rather than strength," said Ozel.	Ozel yagize ati: "Turukiya yitandukanyije, iratukwa, ibabaza ibihugu byinshi byari bifitanye nibura n'imibanire myiza. Kandi bose baremera ko uku guturika kwa diplomasi biva mu ntege nke aho gukomera."
But analysts say Ankara is banking on its importance as a potential bulwark to Iranian ambitions, a factor that may help overcome any remaining hostility among the neighbors it is trying to win back.	Ariko abasesenguzi bavuga ko Ankara ari banki ku kamaro kayo nk’igihome gikomeye cyo kwifuza kwa Irani, kikaba ari ikintu gishobora gufasha gutsinda inzangano zisigaye mu baturanyi igerageza gutsinda.
	
Executions, Detentions Hang Over Saudi Legal Reforms	Iyicwa, Gufungwa bamanitse Kuvugurura Amategeko yo muri Arabiya Sawudite
Saudi Arabia is pushing to revamp its harsh justice system but reforms are overshadowed by executions and tough treatment of dissidents, raising questions about how much will change.	Arabiya Sawudite irihatira kuvugurura imikorere y’ubutabera ikarishye ariko ivugurura rirengerwa n’iyicwa ndetse n’ifatwa rikomeye ry’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, bitera kwibaza niba byinshi bizahinduka.
The kingdom is known for its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which forms the basis of its judicial system.	Ubwami buzwiho gusobanura byimazeyo amategeko ya shariya ya kisilamu, agize ishingiro ryubucamanza.
But in recent months it has moved ahead with reforms that analysts say could make its courts function more like others in the Middle East.	Ariko mu mezi ashize yateye imbere hamwe n'ivugurura abasesenguzi bavuga ko rishobora gutuma inkiko zayo zikora nk'abandi bo mu burasirazuba bwo hagati.
That effort hinges on a series of new laws for sensitive issues like women's divorce rights and judges' power to determine criminal sentences.	Iyo mbaraga ishingiye ku ruhererekane rw'amategeko mashya ku bibazo byoroshye nk'uburenganzira bwo gutandukana kw'abagore n'ububasha bw'abacamanza bwo kumenya ibihano.
Announced last year by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the measures, including the first written penal code, appear to align with Saudi Arabia's goal of opening up to the world and softening its extremist image.	Byatangajwe umwaka ushize n’umutegetsi w’ikirenga, igikomangoma, Mohammed bin Salman, ingamba, harimo n’igitabo cya mbere cy’amategeko ahana, bigaragara ko zihuye n’intego ya Arabiya Sawudite yo gukingura isi no koroshya isura y’intagondwa.
Even critics concede the changes could make Saudi courts more predictable, in some cases.	Ndetse n'abanenga bemeza ko impinduka zishobora gutuma inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zishobora guhanurwa, mu bihe bimwe na bimwe.
But there is no expectation that restrictions on free speech will ease, or that the legal system will treat more favorably perceived opponents of the government.	Ariko ntawiteze ko kubuza kuvuga mu bwisanzure bizoroha, cyangwa se ko amategeko azafata neza abatavuga rumwe na leta.
And despite the reforms, authorities have simultaneously provided reminders of what gave Saudi Arabia its ruthless reputation in the first place, notably the mass execution of 81 men in a single day in March for offenses related to "terrorism."	Nubwo hari ivugurura ryakozwe, abayobozi batanze icyarimwe kwibutsa icyahaye Arabiya Sawudite izina ryayo ribi, cyane cyane iyicwa ry’abantu 81 ku munsi umwe muri Werurwe kubera ibyaha bifitanye isano n’iterabwoba.
Notorious' system	Sisitemu izwi
Two new laws have already been approved by the Saudi Cabinet. One governs the admissibility of evidence, previously at the judges' discretion.	Amategeko abiri mashya yamaze kwemezwa na Guverinoma ya Arabiya Sawudite. Umuntu agenga iyakirwa ryibimenyetso, mbere kubushake bwabacamanza.
The second, a family law, is to take effect in June. In a traditionally male-dominated system, it expands the rights of divorced women to alimony and custody of their children.	Iya kabiri, amategeko yumuryango, agomba gukurikizwa muri kamena. Muri gahunda gakondo yiganjemo abagabo, yagura uburenganzira bwabagore bahukanye kubatunga no kurera abana babo.
Announcing the new law in March, Prince Mohammed said it represented "a major qualitative leap" for women's rights and "family stability."	Mu kwezi kwa Werurwe, igikomangoma Mohammed yatangaje iryo tegeko rishya, yavuze ko rihagarariye "gusimbuka ubuziranenge" ku burenganzira bw'umugore no "gutekana mu muryango."
The reforms seem partly to cater to foreign firms whose investment the kingdom is courting, said Adel al-Saeed, vice president of the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights.	Adel al-Saeed, visi perezida w’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu, Adel al-Saeed yavuze ko iryo vugurura risa nkaho ryita ku masosiyete y’amahanga ashora imari mu bwami.
"The owners of capital are afraid of investing in this country, which is notorious in the legal aspect, so these laws are intended to change the image," he said.	Ati: "Ba nyir'imari bafite ubwoba bwo gushora imari muri iki gihugu, kizwiho amategeko, bityo aya mategeko agamije guhindura isura".
The new penal code, yet to be unveiled, could bring further dramatic changes.	Igitabo gishya cy'amategeko ahana, kitarashyirwa ahagaragara, gishobora kuzana izindi mpinduka zikomeye.
Under sharia, only apostasy, theft, revolt, armed robbery, adultery, drinking alcohol and slander carry prescribed sentences. Judges are left to determine punishment in other cases.	Muri shariya, ubuhakanyi, ubujura, kwigomeka, ubujura bwitwaje intwaro, gusambana, kunywa inzoga no gusebanya bitwara ibihano byateganijwe. Abacamanza basigaye bagena ibihano mu zindi manza.
With a penal code in place, "the state will expect judges to rely not on their own training in sharia but instead on the legal rules (based on sharia) approved by the state," said Nathan Brown, an academic at George Washington University.	Hamwe n’amategeko ahana, "leta izateganya ko abacamanza batashingira ku mahugurwa yabo bwite muri shariya ahubwo bakurikiza amategeko (ashingiye kuri shariya) yemejwe na leta", ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Nathan Brown, umunyeshuri muri kaminuza ya George Washington.
"As a result, Saudi Arabia will look much more like a civil law system, much like most states in the region," said Brown, who has studied the Saudi reforms.	Brown wize ku ivugurura rya Arabiya Sawudite yagize ati: "Kubera iyo mpamvu, Arabiya Sawudite izasa cyane na gahunda y’amategeko mbonezamubano, kimwe na Leta nyinshi zo mu karere."
The result should be more "predictability," said Abdullah Alaoudh, a U.S.-based legal expert and government critic, as new rules "take away from the leeway ... that the judges used to have."	Ibisubizo bigomba kurushaho kuba "guhanura", nk'uko byavuzwe na Abdullah Alaoudh, impuguke mu by'amategeko ukomoka muri Amerika akaba anenga guverinoma, kubera ko amategeko mashya "akuraho inzira ... abacamanza bari bafite."
But tighter regulation by the monarchy also "creates a larger problem: lack of independence," he added.	Yongeyeho ko ariko gukurikiza amategeko agenga ubwami nabyo "bitera ikibazo kinini: kubura ubwigenge".
The king is the head of the Saudi judiciary and acts as the final court of appeal.	Umwami ni umuyobozi wubutabera bwa Arabiya Sawudite kandi akora nkurukiko rwa nyuma rwubujurire.
Alaoudh's own father, prominent cleric Salman al-Awdah, has been held since 2017, seemingly in retaliation for a Twitter post that clashed with Saudi Arabia's policy at the time of isolating Qatar.	Se wa Alaoudh, umunyamadini ukomeye Salman al-Awdah, afunzwe kuva mu 2017, bisa nkaho ari ukwihorera ku rubuga rwa Twitter ruvuguruzanya na politiki ya Arabiya Sawudite mu gihe cyo guha akato Qatar.
He is one of many detained in an apparent crackdown on dissent and those who could challenge Prince Mohammed's power.	Ni umwe mu bantu benshi bafunzwe mu rwego rwo guhashya abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ndetse n’abashobora guhangana n’ubutegetsi bwa Muganwa Mohammed.
One of the most prominent examples is former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the CIA ally respected in the West for his efforts to counter violent extremism, but who King Salman ousted from the line of succession.	Imwe mu ngero zikomeye ni uwahoze ari igikomangoma cy’ikamba, Mohammed bin Nayef, umufasha wa CIA wubahwa mu Burengerazuba kubera umuhate we wo kurwanya ubuhezanguni, ariko Umwami Salman yirukanye ku murongo w'izungura.
Prince Nayef has not been seen in public since reports of his arrest in March 2020. His detention was never officially confirmed.	Igikomangoma Nayef ntabwo yagaragaye mu ruhame kuva amakuru avuga ko yafashwe muri Werurwe 2020. Ifungwa rye ntiryigeze ryemezwa ku mugaragaro.
Shadow of Khashoggi	Igicucu cya Khashoggi
For government opponents, such cases reinforce questions about what difference the ongoing justice reforms will make.	Kubatavuga rumwe na leta, imanza nkizo zishimangira ibibazo bijyanye n’itandukaniro ivugurura ry’ubutabera rizagira.
"In my view, this is all window-dressing," said Madawi al-Rasheed, a U.K.-based academic and spokesperson for the opposition National Assembly Party founded by exiles.	Madawi al-Rasheed, umunyeshuri ukomoka muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika akaba n'umuvugizi w'ishyaka ry’inteko ishinga amategeko ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ryashinzwe n’abajyanywe mu bunyage, yagize ati: "Njye mbona, ibi byose byambaye idirishya".
"It's very, very difficult to see what the meaning is of these reforms apart from the project of portraying (Prince Mohammed) as a reformer."	"Biragoye cyane, kubona icyo iryo vugurura risobanura usibye umushinga wo kwerekana (Prince Mohammed) nk'umuntu uvugurura."
Hanging over any discussion of justice and legal reform in Saudi Arabia is the 2018 murder and dismemberment of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.	Kuzamura ikiganiro icyo ari cyo cyose cyerekeye ubutabera n’ivugurura ry’amategeko muri Arabiya Sawudite ni ubwicanyi no gutandukanya abanegura n’umwanditsi Jamal Khashoggi muri konsulasi y’ubwami ya Istanbul.
A U.S. intelligence assessment found Prince Mohammed himself "approved" an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi, though Saudi officials deny this and say it was a "rogue" operation.	Isuzuma ry’ubutasi ry’Amerika ryasanze igikomangoma Mohammed ubwe "yemeye" igikorwa cyo gufata cyangwa kwica Khashoggi, nubwo abayobozi ba Arabiya Sawudite babihakana bakavuga ko ari igikorwa "kibi".
In April, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Riyadh on Thursday and embraced Prince Mohammed, Turkey transferred the trial in absentia of 26 suspects in the Khashoggi case to Saudi Arabia.	Muri Mata, mbere yuko Perezida wa Turkiya, Recep Tayyip Erdogan asura Riyadh ku wa kane maze ahobera igikomangoma Mohammed, Turukiya yimuriye urubanza adahari abantu 26 bakekwaho icyaha cya Khashoggi muri Arabiya Sawudite.
Turkey's decision drew anguished protest from lawyers and Khashoggi's fiancée, who insisted Saudi courts couldn't possibly hold a credible trial.	Icyemezo cya Turukiya cyamaganye abanyamategeko ndetse n'umukunzi wa Khashoggi, bashimangira ko inkiko zo muri Arabiya Sawudite zidashobora kuburanishwa mu buryo bwizewe.
For the loved ones of those locked away, Khashoggi's killing fuels a uniform fear of speaking out.	Ku bakunzi bafunzwe, iyicwa rya Khashoggi ritera ubwoba bumwe bwo kuvuga.
"I want to, many do, but we're scared," said a friend of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, who has been detained along with his father since 2018.	Inshuti y'igikomangoma Salman bin Abdulaziz wafunzwe na se kuva mu 2018, yagize ati: "Ndashaka, benshi barabikora, ariko dufite ubwoba."
"Everyone knows what happened to Khashoggi."	"Abantu bose bazi ibyabaye kuri Khashoggi."
	
Moroccan Prison Program Sets Out to De-Radicalize IS Veterans	Gahunda ya Gereza ya Maroc Yashyizweho Kuri De-Radicalize IS Veterans
As a combatant for the Islamic State group who left his native Morocco to join what he felt was a holy fight in Syria, Mohsin says he saw all the horrors of war. "A terrifying experience," he says.	Ati: "Nk'umurwanyi w'umutwe wa kisilamu wavuye muri Maroc kavukire kugira ngo yinjire mu byo yumvaga ko ari intambara yera muri Siriya, Mohsin avuga ko yabonye amahano yose y'intambara." Ati: "Ibintu biteye ubwoba."
Now a prisoner, the 38-year-old claims he is no longer the fanatic he was then, enraged with a murderous hatred for non-Muslims. Captured in Turkey and extradited to Morocco, he is serving a 10-year prison term on terrorism charges.	Noneho imfungwa, ufite imyaka 38 y'amavuko avuga ko atakiri umufana icyo gihe, yarakajwe n'inzangano z'ubwicanyi ku batari Abayisilamu. Yafatiwe muri Turukiya yoherezwa muri Maroc, akatiwe igifungo cy'imyaka 10 ashinjwa iterabwoba.
Now the former fighter has graduated with 14 other prisoners convicted of terror offenses from a Morocco de-radicalization program that might make them more eligible for an early release.	Ubu uwahoze ari umurwanyi yahawe impamyabumenyi hamwe n’abandi bagororwa 14 bahamwe n’icyaha cy’iterabwoba muri gahunda ya Maroc de-radicalisation ishobora gutuma bemererwa kurekurwa hakiri kare.
The Associated Press and other media were invited to observe their graduation ceremony Thursday in a prison in Sale near the Moroccan capital, Rabat, and to interview some prisoners under monitored and controlled conditions. Prison administration officials picked out three men they said were willing to be interviewed.	Ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika Associated Press hamwe n'ibindi bitangazamakuru byatumiwe kureba umuhango wo gutanga impamyabumenyi ku wa kane muri gereza i Sale hafi y'umurwa mukuru wa Maroc, Rabat, no kubaza imfungwa zimwe na zimwe zikurikiranwa kandi zikagenzurwa. Abayobozi ba gereza batoye abagabo batatu bavuga ko bafite ubushake bwo kubazwa.
Officials stipulated that the inmates shouldn't be identified by their full names and that their faces mustn't be shown, citing privacy reasons.	Abayobozi bavuze ko abagororwa batagomba kumenyekana ku mazina yabo yose kandi ko mu maso habo hatagomba kwerekanwa, kubera impamvu z’ibanga.
But prison officials didn't listen to the interviews or intervene to shut down media lines of questioning or inmates' answers.	Ariko abayobozi ba gereza ntibigeze bumva ibibazo cyangwa ngo bagire icyo bakora kugira ngo bahagarike umurongo w'itangazamakuru ryo kubaza cyangwa ibisubizo by'abagororwa.
The 15 inmates in crisp shirts and trousers stood solemnly for Morocco's national anthem and were handed certificates. Prison officials said the de-radicalization program consisted of three months of classes in prison on religion, law and economics, and that inmates also received training on how to start a business. These most recent graduates were the ninth batch since the program started in 2017.	Abagororwa 15 bambaye amashati n'ipantaro bahagaze neza kubera indirimbo yubahiriza igihugu cya Maroc kandi bahabwa ibyemezo. Abayobozi ba gereza bavuze ko gahunda ya de-radicalisation yari igizwe n’amezi atatu muri gereza ku bijyanye n’idini, amategeko n’ubukungu, kandi ko abagororwa na bo bahawe amahugurwa y’uburyo bwo gutangiza umushinga. Aba barangije vuba ni icyiciro cya cyenda kuva gahunda yatangira muri 2017.
Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, the director of social-cultural action and prisoner reintegration at Morocco's prison administration, said the program is entirely voluntary and works with inmates "to change their behavior and improve their life path."	Umuyobozi ushinzwe ibikorwa by’imibereho n’umuco no gusubiza mu buzima busanzwe imfungwa ku buyobozi bwa gereza ya Maroc, Moulay Idriss Agoulmam, yavuze ko iyi gahunda ari ubushake kandi ko ikorana n’abagororwa "guhindura imyitwarire yabo no kuzamura imibereho yabo."
"It enables prisoners to form an awareness of the gravity of their mistakes," he said.	Ati: "Bituma imfungwa zimenyekanisha uburemere bw'amakosa yabo".
Graduating from the program doesn't make inmates automatically eligible for early release, but does increase their chances of getting a royal pardon or a reduced sentence. That's been the case for just over half the program's 222 graduates so far, the prison administration says. Since 2019, the training has also been offered to women convicted under Morocco's Anti-Terrorism Act. Ten women have graduated so far — all of them since released, including eight with pardons.	Kurangiza porogaramu ntibituma abagororwa bahita bemererwa kurekurwa hakiri kare, ariko byongera amahirwe yo kubona imbabazi zumwami cyangwa kugabanyirizwa ibihano. Ubuyobozi bwa gereza buvuga ko ibyo byabaye ku barenga kimwe cya kabiri cy'abanyeshuri 222 barangije porogaramu kugeza ubu. Kuva mu mwaka wa 2019, amahugurwa yahawe kandi abagore bahamwe n'icyaha hakurikijwe itegeko ryo kurwanya iterabwoba muri Maroc. Abagore icumi barangije kugeza ubu - bose kuva barekuwe, harimo umunani bafite imbabazi.
Called "Moussalaha," meaning "reconciliation" in Arabic, the program is offered to prisoners who have demonstrated a readiness to disavow extremism.	Iyi gahunda yiswe "Moussalaha," bisobanura "ubwiyunge" mucyarabu, iyi gahunda ihabwa imfungwa zagaragaje ko ziteguye kwanga ubuhezanguni.
Mohsin said he left to fight in Syria in 2012. A school dropout as a teen, he said he "was virtually illiterate and couldn't discern good from bad." He said he was radicalized by people who showed him extremist videos "about the divine obligation to battle those who don't follow Islamic principles and to murder non-Muslims."	"Mohsin yavuze ko yavuye kurwana muri Siriya mu 2012. Yataye ishuri akiri ingimbi, yavuze ko" "yari azi gusoma no kwandika kandi ko adashobora gutandukanya icyiza n'ikibi." " kubyerekeye inshingano ziva ku Mana zo kurwanya abadakurikiza amahame ya kisilamu no kwica abatari Abayisilamu. ""
In Syria, "I saw massacres, rapes, and thefts," he said. "I concluded after a time that the fight being conducted in the name of Islam had nothing to do with our religion."	Ati: "Muri Siriya," Nabonye ubwicanyi, gufata ku ngufu n'ubujura ". "Nafashe umwanzuro nyuma y'igihe ko intambara ikorwa mu izina rya Islamu ntaho ihuriye n'idini ryacu."
He escaped to Turkey in 2018 and was detained for a year there before being extradited to Morocco.	Yahungiye muri Turukiya mu 2018, afungirwa umwaka umwe mbere yo koherezwa muri Maroc.
He says he has now disavowed extremism.	Avuga ko ubu yanze ubuhezanguni.
"That period of my life has passed," he said.	Ati: "Icyo gihe cy'ubuzima bwanjye cyarashize."
Numerous Moroccans have traveled to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere to join extremist groups. Morocco has also experienced multiple attacks itself. Five suicide attacks in Casablanca in 2003 killed 33 people. In 2011, an explosion destroyed a cafe in Marrakech, killing 17 people, most of them foreign tourists.	Abanyamerika benshi bagiye muri Siriya, Iraki n'ahandi kugira ngo binjire mu mitwe y'intagondwa. Maroc nayo yahuye n'ibitero byinshi ubwayo. Ibitero bitanu byo kwiyahura byabereye i Casablanca mu 2003 byahitanye abantu 33. Mu 2011, igisasu cyaturikiye ikawa i Marrakech, gihitana abantu 17, abenshi muri bo bakaba ari ba mukerarugendo b'abanyamahanga.
Al Mustapaha Razrazi, a clinical psychologist and member of the program's scientific committee, said among 156 people who have been released after attending the courses, just one has been caught committing a crime again.	Al Mustapaha Razrazi, inzobere mu by'imitekerereze ya muntu akaba n'umwe mu bagize komite ishinzwe ubumenyi muri iyo gahunda, yavuze ko mu bantu 156 barekuwe nyuma yo kwitabira amasomo, umwe gusa yongeye gufatwa akora icyaha.
That person was convicted of a non-terrorism-related offense, he said.	Yavuze ko uwo muntu yahamijwe n'icyaha kijyanye n'iterabwoba.
	
Iran Gets Opportunity to Sell Auto Parts to Russian Carmaker	Irani ibonye amahirwe yo kugurisha ibice by'imodoka ku Barusiya bakora imodoka.
A member of Iran's syndicate of car parts manufacturers says Iranian producers have an opportunity to export their wares to a Russian carmaker, state media reported.	Ibitangazamakuru bya Leta byatangaje ko umunyamuryango wa syndicat ya Irani y’ibicuruzwa by’imodoka avuga ko abakora muri Irani bafite amahirwe yo kohereza ibicuruzwa byabo mu ruganda rukora imodoka mu Burusiya.
The late Monday report quoted Hossein Bahrainian as saying "a prominent Russian car maker" requested parts from Iran. He did not name the manufacturer. He said it requested brake parts, airbags, air-conditioner parts and other components.	Raporo yo ku wa mbere yarangiye ivuga ko Hossein Bahrein yavuze ko "uruganda rukomeye rw’imodoka yo mu Burusiya" rwasabye ibice muri Irani. Ntiyavuze uwabikoze. Yavuze ko isaba ibice bya feri, ibikapu byo mu kirere, ibyuma bifata ibyuma bikonjesha n'ibindi bikoresho.
Both Iran and Russia are under U.S. sanctions but the export of Iranian cars and car parts is not subject to sanctions.	Irani n'Uburusiya byombi bihanishwa Amerika ariko kohereza imodoka za Irani n'ibice by'imodoka ntabwo bihanwa.
The import of automobiles to Iran is also not subject to sanctions. However, Tehran has not imported cars since 2018, after the U.S. withdrew from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed oil and banking sanctions on Iran.	Gutumiza imodoka muri Irani nabyo ntabwo bihanwa. Icyakora, Tehran ntabwo yatumije imodoka kuva mu 2018, nyuma y’uko Amerika ivuye mu masezerano ya kirimbuzi hagati ya Irani n’ibihugu by’isi ndetse ikanafatira Irani ibihano bya peteroli na banki.
Western nations stopped exporting to Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.	Ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byahagaritse kohereza mu Burusiya nyuma yo gutera Ukraine.
Iran in recent years has exported car radiators and suspension systems to Russia. In the past it exported cars to Iraq, Syria and Venezuela.	Irani mu myaka yashize yohereje mu Burusiya imirasire y’imodoka na sisitemu zo guhagarika. Kera yoherezaga imodoka muri Iraki, Siriya na Venezuwela.
Tehran and Moscow have had close relations in recent years, especially after Iran's sole nuclear power plant went online in 2011 with help from Russia.	Tehran na Moscou bafitanye umubano wa hafi mu myaka yashize, cyane cyane nyuma y’uko uruganda rukora ingufu za kirimbuzi rukumbi rwa Irani rujya kuri interineti mu 2011 babifashijwemo n’Uburusiya.
Separately on Tuesday, Iran said it has played a mediatory role in the war in Ukraine.	Ku wa kabiri, Irani yavuze ko yagize uruhare mu bunzi mu ntambara yo muri Ukraine.
"So far twice I have conveyed messages from the foreign minister of Ukraine to my Russian counterpart," said Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian in a phone conversation with his Irish counterpart. He said Iran supports diplomatic solutions for restoring peace and stability.	Minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga Hossein Amir Abdollahian mu kiganiro kuri telefoni na mugenzi we wa Irlande yagize ati: "Kugeza ubu inshuro ebyiri zose nagejeje ubutumwa kuri minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga wa Ukraine kuri mugenzi wanjye w’Uburusiya." Yavuze ko Irani ishyigikiye ibisubizo by’ububanyi n’amahanga mu kugarura amahoro n’amahoro.
Abdollahian did not elaborate but said Iran "opposes war and displacement of human beings in Ukraine," and other paces like Yemen, the Palestinian lands and Afghanistan.	Abdollahian ntabwo yabisobanuye ariko yavuze ko Irani "irwanya intambara no kwimura abantu muri Ukraine," ndetse n'indi ntera nka Yemeni, ibihugu bya Palesitine na Afuganisitani.
	
Diversity, New Perspectives Are Applied to Middle East Coverage	Dutandukanye, Ibitekerezo bishya bikoreshwa muburasirazuba bwo hagati
Natalia Sancha has always adopted a collaborative approach to journalism. When out on assignment, she speaks to others covering the same story about their perspectives.	Nataliya Sancha yamye afata inzira yo gufatanya mubanyamakuru. Iyo asohotse mukoro, avugana nabandi bavuga inkuru imwe kubitekerezo byabo.
This partly stems from an interest in telling underreported stories, but as a female journalist in a male-dominated region, she says collaboration and supporting the women she works with have always been important.	Ibi bimwe bituruka ku gushimishwa no kuvuga inkuru zidasobanutse, ariko nkumunyamakuru wumugore mukarere kariganjemo abagabo, avuga ko ubufatanye no gutera inkunga abagore bakorana byahoze ari ngombwa.
"I would talk to male and female journalists, and I always realized that women had a similar perspective, because we had similar experiences while covering the story," the 42-year-old journalist said.	Umunyamakuru w'imyaka 42 yagize ati: "Naganiriye n'abanyamakuru b'abagabo n'abagore, kandi buri gihe nabonaga ko abagore bafite imyumvire imwe, kuko natwe twagize ibyabaye mugihe twatangaga inkuru".
That collaborative approach came into play in 2020 when a publisher asked Sancha if she was interested in writing a book about Syria.	Ubwo buryo bwo gufatanya bwatangiye gukurikizwa mu 2020 ubwo umubwiriza yabazaga Sancha niba ashishikajwe no kwandika igitabo kivuga kuri Siriya.
She countered with a better offer.	Yarwanyije icyifuzo cyiza.
"I told him that a collective narrative by women journalists about the broader region would have a different effect," she said. "I could have written the book myself, but it would not have the same sense."	Ati: "Namubwiye ko inkuru rusange y'abanyamakuru b'abagore ivuga ku karere kanini byagira ingaruka zitandukanye." "Nanjye ubwanjye nashoboraga kwandika igitabo, ariko ntabwo cyari kumva kimwe."
Originally from Andalusia in southern Spain, Sancha spent the past 14 years in the Middle East covering conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and reporting from Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.	Sancha ukomoka muri Andalusiya mu majyepfo ya Espagne, Sancha yamaze imyaka 14 ishize mu burasirazuba bwo hagati yerekana amakimbirane yo muri Iraki, Siriya na Yemeni, kandi atanga raporo avuye muri Egiputa, Libani na Tuniziya.
She has been working more recently with the European Union communications department, after leaving Beirut for health reasons following a mass explosion that rocked the city in 2020.	Aherutse gukorana n’ishami ry’itumanaho ry’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi, nyuma yo kuva i Beirut kubera impamvu z’ubuzima nyuma y’igiturika kinini cyibasiye umujyi muri 2020.
Women "have a different experience because we would go to places that our male colleagues were not used to. Not because we're smarter, but just because the majority of the region is still Arab, Muslim and gender-segregated," Sancha told VOA.	Sancha yabwiye VOA ati: "Abagore" bafite uburambe butandukanye kuko twajya ahantu bagenzi bacu b'igitsina gabo batamenyereye. Ntabwo ari ukubera ko turi abanyabwenge, ahubwo ni ukubera ko igice kinini cy'akarere kikiri abarabu, abayisilamu ndetse n'abagabo."
Having women reporters has an impact, she noted.	Yavuze ko kugira abanyamakuru b'abagore bigira ingaruka.
"If I put myself in the position of the reader, I would prefer to have a woman telling me the story because it is going to be about 100 percent of the population, which means you are going to have a more inclusive narrative on the conflict."	"Niba nishyize mu mwanya w'abasomyi, nahitamo kugira umugore umbwira inkuru kuko igiye kuba hafi 100 ku ijana by'abaturage, bivuze ko uzaba ufite inkuru zuzuye zirimo amakimbirane."
For her book, Sancha reached out to other women who cover the Middle East, to ensure diverse perspectives from foreign and local reporters.	Ku gitabo cye, Sancha yageze ku bandi bagore bavuga iburasirazuba bwo hagati, kugira ngo babone ibitekerezo bitandukanye n'abanyamakuru bo mu mahanga ndetse n'abenegihugu.
The result of the nearly two-year collaboration is Bullets for All, released in Spanish in April.	Ibisubizo byubufatanye bwimyaka hafi ibiri ni Bullets kuri Bose, yasohotse mu cyesipanyoli muri Mata.
In the book, "we tell one story with different voices that represent all the women" from the region, Sancha said.	Muri iki gitabo, Sancha yagize ati: "Muri iki gitabo," tuvuga inkuru imwe n'amajwi atandukanye ahagarariye abagore bose ".
Each offers a personal perspective on covering historic moments, including the collapse of autocratic governments, popular protest movements and war. It also examines the discrimination and harassment women face in the newsroom and on assignment.	Buri kimwe gitanga icyerekezo cyihariye cyo kwerekana ibihe byamateka, harimo gusenyuka kwa guverinoma yigenga, imyigaragambyo yamamaye nintambara. Irasuzuma kandi ivangura n'ihohoterwa abagore bahura nabyo mu cyumba cy'amakuru no ku mukoro.
Making connections	Gukora amasano
Understanding language and culture goes a long way toward making progress in the region, says Maya Gebeily. The Reuters bureau chief for Lebanon, Syria and Jordan is one of the contributors to the book.	Maya Gebeily avuga ko gusobanukirwa ururimi n'umuco bigana inzira igana ku iterambere. Umuyobozi w'ikigo cya Reuters muri Libani, Siriya na Yorodani ni umwe mu bagize uruhare muri iki gitabo.
"There's a lot to say and show from the perspective of women reporters who were also then influenced by the women that they met as they were doing their reporting," she said.	Ati: "Hariho byinshi byo kuvuga no kwerekana nkurikije uko abanyamakuru b'abagore na bo bahise bayoborwa n'abagore bahuye igihe bakoraga raporo zabo".
Born in the U.S. to Lebanese parents, Gebeily started her journalism career in 2013 with a local news site in Beirut, Lebanon. She went on to cover the region for Agence France-Presse before joining Reuters.	Gebeily yavukiye muri Amerika ku babyeyi bo muri Libani, yatangiye umwuga we w'itangazamakuru mu 2013 akoresheje urubuga rw'amakuru i Beirut, muri Libani. Yakomeje yerekeza mu karere ka Agence France-Presse mbere yo kwinjira muri Reuters.
Gebeily said her American and Lebanese background helped her understand the region better, which in turn has shaped her reporting. Knowing the local language is an important part of that.	Gebeily yavuze ko amateka ye y'Abanyamerika na Libani yamufashije kumva neza akarere, ari nako kagize uruhare mu gutanga raporo. Kumenya ururimi rwaho nigice cyingenzi cyibyo.
"When interviewing a minister or a displaced person or an activist, the most important element is getting their trust," she said. "If you're able to speak the language and make them feel comfortable from the beginning, it changes everything. It grants you a very beautiful kind of access."	Ati: "Iyo ubajije minisitiri cyangwa umuntu wimuwe cyangwa umurwanashyaka, ikintu cy'ingenzi ni ukugirira icyizere." "Niba ushoboye kuvuga ururimi no gutuma bumva bamerewe neza kuva mu ntangiriro, bihindura byose. Iraguha uburyo bwiza cyane bwo kwinjira."
In addition to Iraq and Lebanon, Gebeily, 30, has also traveled to Syria to cover the war against the Islamic State (IS) militant group.	Usibye Iraki na Libani, Gebeily w'imyaka 30 yanagiye muri Siriya kugira ngo akurikirane intambara yo kurwanya umutwe w'abarwanyi ba Leta ya Kisilamu (IS).
"Ive been very privileged to access some communities directly without having to work with a translator or a fixer, which also shapes the way that the stories come out," she said.	Ati: "Ive nagize amahirwe yo kugera ku baturage mu buryo butaziguye ntiriwe nkorana n'umusemuzi cyangwa uwakosoye, ibyo bikaba binerekana uburyo inkuru zisohoka".
Syrian-Kurdish journalist Khabat Abbas, who has covered the war in Syria, attests to the importance of that.	Umunyamakuru wa Siriya-Kurdiya, Khabat Abbas, wanditse ku ntambara yo muri Siriya, ahamya akamaro kayo.
"Its knowing the language and the culture that gives people a sense of comfort to open up to you," she told VOA from Qamishli, Syria.	Yatangarije VOA avuye i Qamishli, muri Siriya ati: "Kumenya ururimi n'umuco biha abantu ihumure ryo kukwugururira."
That knowledge helped when Abbas, 34, was on assignment with Sancha in March 2021. They traveled to a Kurdish-run detention camp in northeast Syria and interviewed female jihadists affiliated with IS, for a story in El Pais.	Ubwo bumenyi bwafashije igihe Abbas w'imyaka 34 yari mu butumwa na Sancha muri Werurwe 2021. Baragiye mu kigo cy’imfungwa cy’Abanyakorde mu majyaruguru y’amajyaruguru ya Siriya maze babaza abajihadiste b’abagore bafitanye isano na IS, kugira ngo babone inkuru muri El Pais.
"While in Qamishli [in northeast Syria], I ran into two British journalists, very good colleagues of mine, who were disappointed after Shamima Begum and other women at the camp refused to talk to them," Sancha said, referring to a young woman who left her home in Britain aged 15 to join IS.	Sancha yagize ati: "Nkiri i Qamishli [mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba bwa Siriya], nahungiye mu banyamakuru babiri b'Abongereza, abo dukorana cyane, batengushye nyuma yuko Shamima Begum n'abandi bagore bari mu nkambi banze kuvugana nabo." wavuye iwe mu Bwongereza afite imyaka 15 yinjira muri IS.
"Their fixer was a man, so the jihadist women didnt talk to them because they are radical, and they dont talk to men. But then I was able to sit with Shamima and other women, who gave fantastic interviews from inside their tents," Sancha said.	"Umukosora wabo yari umugabo, ku buryo abagore ba jihadiste batavuganye nabo kubera ko ari intagondwa, kandi ntibavugana n'abagabo. Ariko rero nashoboye kwicarana na Shamima n'abandi bagore, batanga ibiganiro bitangaje bivuye mu mahema yabo." Sancha ati.
Abbas had a role in getting to talk to those women, she added.	Yongeyeho ko Abbas yagize uruhare mu kubona abo bagore.
Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.	Unlike Sancha and Gebeily, Abbas grew up in the marginalized Kurdish region of Syria, where until the war began in 2011, journalism effectively didnt exist.
"Ordinary people in our region were used to seeing women pick up arms and fight, but they werent used to seeing a woman hold a camera on the streets and on front lines," Abbas said. "It took a lot of sacrificing for me to convince my family and society that Im as good, if not better, as my male colleagues."	Bitandukanye na Sancha na Gebeily, Abbas yakuriye mu karere ka Siriya k’abasigajwe inyuma na Siriya, kugeza igihe intambara yatangiriye mu 2011, itangazamakuru ntiryabayeho.
Journalism appealed to her because the story of the Middle East has often been told by male journalists, both local and foreign.	Itangazamakuru ryaramushimishije kubera ko inkuru yo mu burasirazuba bwo hagati yagiye ivugwa n'abanyamakuru b'abagabo, baba abo mu mahanga ndetse n'abanyamahanga.
"The narrative hasnt changed because of that, but if local and international women journalists get a real chance to tell the story of the Middle East, that narrative could change, which would affect the way others see this region," Abbas said.	Abbas yagize ati: "Ibitekerezo ntabwo byahindutse kubera ibyo, ariko niba abanyamakuru b’abagore bo mu karere ndetse n’amahanga babonye amahirwe nyayo yo kuvuga amateka y’iburasirazuba bwo hagati, iyo nkuru ishobora guhinduka, ibyo bikaba byagira ingaruka ku kuntu abandi babona aka karere."
Sancha also believes women in journalism have an impact on the way issues are viewed in the region, including post-traumatic stress disorder and the effect it has on female health, and subjects such as violence and alcohol.	Sancha yizera kandi ko abagore mu itangazamakuru bagira ingaruka ku buryo ibibazo bigaragara mu karere, birimo ihungabana ry’ihungabana ndetse n’ingaruka bigira ku buzima bw’umugore, ndetse n’ihohoterwa n’inzoga.
"We talk about all these issues that men normally wouldnt not speak about," she said.	Ati: "Turaganira kuri ibyo bibazo byose abagabo ubusanzwe batavuga."
	
Iran's Guards Commander Says Israel Creating Conditions for Own Destruction	Umuyobozi w'ingabo za Irani avuga ko Isiraheli ishyiraho uburyo bwo kurimbuka
Israel's actions are creating conditions for its own destruction, Irans Revolutionary Guards commander on Friday told a Jerusalem Day rally at which the countrys new domestically-made Kheibar Buster missile was displayed.	Ku wa gatanu, umuyobozi w’ingabo z’abasirikare barinda impinduramatwara ya Irans, yatangaje ko ibikorwa bya Isiraheli bitera uburyo bwo kurimbuka kwayo.
State television said millions of Iranians joined rallies marking Quds Day, the Arabic name for Jerusalem, in state-organized marches across the country.	Televiziyo ya Leta yavuze ko miliyoni z'Abanyayirani bitabiriye imyigaragambyo yizihizaga umunsi wa Quds, izina ry'icyarabu ryitwa Yeruzalemu, mu rugendo rwateguwe na leta mu gihugu hose.
It showed the Israeli flag being set on fire and groups of people around the country shouting choreographed "Death to America, Death to Israel" slogans.	Yerekanye ibendera rya Isiraheli ritwikwa hamwe nitsinda ryabantu hirya no hino basakuza koreografiya "Urupfu muri Amerika, Urupfu kuri Isiraheli".
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech that anti-Israeli protests and attacks showed that Palestinians rejected compromises by Arab authorities with Israel.	Umuyobozi w'ikirenga, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, mu ijambo rye kuri televiziyo yavuze ko imyigaragambyo n'ibitero byo kurwanya Isiraheli byerekanaga ko Abanyapalestine banze kumvikana n'abayobozi b'Abarabu na Isiraheli.
Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamist militant groups opposed to peace with Israel, which Tehran does not recognize.	Kurwanya Isiraheli ni ibuye rikomeye ku myizerere ya Irani, ishyigikiye imitwe yitwara gisirikare ya kisilamu ya Palesitine na Libani irwanya amahoro na Isiraheli, Tehran ikaba itemera.
"What has happened in Palestine in recent years annuls all plans for compromise with the Zionist enemy (Israel) because no plan for Palestine can be implemented in the absence or contrary to the opinions of its owners, the Palestinians," Khamenei said, speaking in Arabic and addressing Palestinians and other Arabs.	Mu magambo ye, Khamenei yagize ati: "Ibyabereye muri Palesitine mu myaka yashize bivanaho gahunda zose zo kumvikana n’umwanzi w’abaziyoniste (Isiraheli) kuko nta gahunda ya Palesitine ishobora gushyirwa mu bikorwa idahari cyangwa binyuranye n’ibitekerezo bya ba nyirayo, Abanyapalestine". Icyarabu no kuvugana nabanyapalestine nabandi barabu.
Thus, Khamenei said, all previous peace agreements -- such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, the two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan dubbed the Deal of the Century "are null and void".	Ni yo mpamvu, Khamenei yavuze ko amasezerano y’amahoro yabanjirije aya - nk’amasezerano ya Oslo yo mu 1993, igisubizo cy’ibihugu byombi kugira ngo gikemure amakimbirane hagati ya Isiraheli na Palesitine, ndetse n’umugambi wahoze ari Perezida wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Donald Trump wise amasezerano y’ikinyejana "nta gaciro ufite." 
President Ebrahim Raisi, Irans military commanders and senior officials also attended the rallies in which people were allowed to march through the streets, the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic two years ago.	Perezida Ebrahim Raisi, abayobozi b'ingabo za Irans n'abayobozi bakuru na bo bitabiriye imyigaragambyo aho abantu bemerewe kugenda mu mihanda, ku nshuro ya mbere kuva icyorezo cya coronavirus gitangira mu myaka ibiri ishize.
Iran's Jerusalem Day rallies are held annually in support of Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state in territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.	Igiterane cy’umunsi wa Yeruzalemu cya Irani kiba buri mwaka mu rwego rwo gushyigikira Abanyapalestine, bifuza ko Yeruzalemu y’iburasirazuba iba umurwa mukuru w’igihugu kizaza mu turere twafashwe na Isiraheli mu ntambara yo mu 1967, ku wa gatanu wanyuma w’ukwezi kwa Ramazani kwisonzesha kw’abayisilamu.
"Stop your vicious deeds. You know well that we are people of action and reaction," Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami, addressing Israel, told demonstrators in Tehran.	Umuyobozi w'ingabo zishinzwe impinduramatwara, Hossein Salami, yabwiye Isiraheli, yabwiye abigaragambyaga i Tehran ati: "Hagarika ibikorwa byawe bibi. Uzi neza ko turi abantu bakora kandi bakitwara neza."
"Our responses are painful. You create conditions for your own destruction. We will not leave you alone ...You know better than me what will befall you if you take evil action."	"Ibisubizo byacu birababaje. Ushiraho uburyo bwo kurimbuka kwawe. Ntabwo tuzagutererana wenyine ... Uzi kundusha ibizakubaho uramutse ufashe nabi."
Iran's military has vowed to retaliate harshly against any attack by Israel, which has often voiced concern over the Iranian nuclear program. Tehran says the program is for peaceful purposes only.	Igisirikare cya Irani cyiyemeje kwihorera bikabije igitero icyo ari cyo cyose cyagabwe na Isiraheli, cyakunze kugaragaza impungenge kuri gahunda ya kirimbuzi ya Irani. Tehran ivuga ko gahunda igamije amahoro gusa.
Israel, whose existence the Islamic Republic does not recognize, has long threatened military action against Iran if talks between Tehran and world powers fail to curb Iranian nuclear activity. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.	Isiraheli, repubulika ya kisilamu itabaho, imaze igihe kinini itera ubwoba ibikorwa bya gisirikare byo kurwanya Irani niba ibiganiro hagati ya Tehran n’ibihugu by’ibihugu bidashoboye guhagarika ibikorwa bya kirimbuzi bya Irani. Irani ivuga ko intego zayo za kirimbuzi ari amahoro.
In February, the Islamic Republic unveiled its "Kheibar Buster" missile with a range of 1,450 km (900 miles).	Muri Gashyantare, Repubulika ya Kisilamu yashyize ahagaragara misile yayo "Kheibar Buster" ifite uburebure bwa kilometero 1,450.
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programs in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.	Irani, ifite imwe muri gahunda zikomeye za misile mu burasirazuba bwo hagati, ivuga ko misile zayo zo mu bwoko bwa ballistique zifite uburebure bwa kilometero zigera ku 2.000 kandi ko zishobora kugera ku birindiro byazo bya Isiraheli ndetse n'ibirindiro by’Amerika muri ako karere.
Kheibar refers to an ancient Jewish oasis in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century.	Kheibar bivuga oasisi ya kera y'Abayahudi yo mu gace ka Hijaz ka Arabiya y’Abarabu yigaruriwe n'abarwanyi b'Abayisilamu mu kinyejana cya 7.
Tehran regards its ballistic missile program as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries, and has rejected Western demands to halt it.	Tehran ibona gahunda yayo ya misile ballistique nk'ikintu gikomeye cyo gukumira Amerika, Isiraheli ndetse n'abanzi bayo, kandi yanze icyifuzo cy'iburengerazuba cyo kuyihagarika.
Over the past year, Iran and the United States have engaged in fitful, indirect talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal that then-President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018 and that Iran, in turn, began violating in 2019.	Mu mwaka ushize, Irani na Amerika byaganiriye na Vienne mu biganiro bifatika kandi bitaziguye kugira ngo byongere kubyutsa amasezerano ya kirimbuzi yo muri 2015 icyo gihe Perezida Donald Trump yanze kuva muri 2018 kandi ko Irani nayo yatangiye kurenga muri 2019.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.	Mu masezerano ya 2015, Irani yemeye kugabanya gahunda zayo za kirimbuzi mu rwego rwo gukuraho ibihano by’ubukungu.
While they appeared close to resurrecting the deal in March, talks stalled over last-minute Russian demands and whether Washington might drop Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its Foreign Terrorist Organization list.	Mu gihe basaga nkaho bari hafi kubyutsa ayo masezerano muri Werurwe, ibiganiro byahagaritse icyifuzo cy’Uburusiya ku munota wa nyuma ndetse n’uko Washington ishobora gukuraho abashinzwe umutekano w’impinduramatwara ya Irani ku rutonde rw’umuryango w’iterabwoba w’amahanga.
	
As Fewer Americans Attend Church, Can Coffee Shops Fill the Void?	Nk'uko Abanyamerika bake Bajya mu Itorero, Amaduka ya Kawa Yuzuza Icyuho?
Churches and other houses of worship have historically played critical social and political functions in American society. 	Amatorero n'andi mazu asengeramo yagiye akora amateka akomeye mubikorwa bya politiki na politiki muri societe y'Abanyamerika. 
But fewer people are attending religious services, and the decline of churches and other houses of worship threatens to leave a void that could potentially be filled by coffee shops.	Ariko abantu bake ni bo bitabira ibikorwa by’amadini, kandi kugabanuka kwamatorero nandi mazu yo gusengeramo bikangisha gusiga icyuho gishobora kuzuzwa n'amaduka ya kawa.
"For so much of American history, the church has really been — or their congregations have really been — essential, providing an unheralded role in providing cohesion and connectedness in communities … encouraging civic engagement and political participation," says Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.	Umuyobozi w'ikigo, Daniel Cox agira ati: "Mu mateka menshi y'Abanyamerika, itorero ryabaye - cyangwa amatorero yabo yabaye ngombwa - kugira uruhare rudasanzwe mu gutanga ubumwe no guhuza abaturage… gushishikariza uruhare rw'abaturage no kugira uruhare muri politiki." Ubushakashatsi ku Buzima bw'Abanyamerika na mugenzi wawe mukuru muri American Enterprise Institute.
"It was not happenstance or luck that the civil rights movement emerged out of the church," Cox says.	Cox agira ati: "Ntabwo byari ibintu by'uruhurirane cyangwa amahirwe kuba umuryango uharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu wavuye mu itorero."
"And you see that cross-culturally … whether it's in predominantly white rural communities, in the suburbs, wherever, churches have historically been really, really important."	"Kandi urabona ko imico itandukanye… haba mu baturage biganjemo abazungu bo mu cyaro, mu nkengero, ahantu hose, amatorero yabaye amateka mu by'ukuri, ni ngombwa."
Churches and other houses of worship have also played a role in helping immigrants assimilate once they arrive in America, Cox says.	Cox avuga ko amatorero n'andi mazu asengeramo nabyo byagize uruhare mu gufasha abimukira kwimuka bamaze kugera muri Amerika.
In 1999, 70% of Americans said they belonged to a church, mosque or synagogue.	Mu 1999, 70% by'Abanyamerika bavuze ko bari mu rusengero, umusigiti cyangwa mu isinagogi.
By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%. A 2019 survey found that only about three in 10 Americans say they attend weekly religious services.	Muri 2020, iyo mibare yari yagabanutse kugera kuri 47%. Ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu mwaka wa 2019 bwerekanye ko Abanyamerika bagera kuri batatu gusa ari bo bavuga ko bitabira amadini ya buri cyumweru.
Third places Lack of involvement and affiliation with churches, mosques and synagogues means people might be missing out on what urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg dubbed as "third places" — public gathering spots that offer something that home, the "first place," and work, the "second place," might not.	Umwanya wa gatatu Kutagira uruhare no gufatanya n'amatorero, imisigiti n'amasinagogi bivuze ko abantu bashobora kubura icyo umuhanga mubya societologue wo mumijyi Ray Oldenburg yise "umwanya wa gatatu" - ahantu hateranira abantu benshi batanga ikintu murugo, "umwanya wa mbere," nakazi, "umwanya wa kabiri," ntabwo.
Oldenburg argued that third places are critical to a communitys social vitality.	Oldenburg yavuze ko umwanya wa gatatu ari ingenzi ku mibereho y'abaturage.
An October 2021 survey conducted by the American Survey Center found that commercial spaces like coffee houses foster trust and connection in American communities and could help fill the void left by churches.	Ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu Kwakira 2021 bwakozwe n’ikigo cy’Abanyamerika gishinzwe ubushakashatsi bwerekanye ko ahantu h’ubucuruzi nk’amazu ya kawa bitera kwizerana no guhuza imiryango y'Abanyamerika kandi bikaba byafasha kuziba icyuho cyasizwe n'amatorero.
"If you're a regular at a cafe, the barista may know what you usually order, and they can make it for you, and that feels good," says clinical psychologist Dr. Maria Espinola, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.	Inzobere mu by'imitekerereze ya muntu, Dr. Maria Espinola, umwarimu wungirije mu ishami ry’indwara zo mu mutwe, agira ati: "Niba usanzwe muri cafe, barista irashobora kumenya icyo usanzwe utumiza, kandi barashobora kukugukorera, kandi ibyo ni byiza." na Neuroscience Imyitwarire muri kaminuza ya Cincinnati College of Medicine.
"It feels good to be recognized, to know that people are expecting you, to know that people care about you, to know that you belong, because the need for belonging and human connection is a fundamental need that we all have, and it's important to have that fulfilled in different ways," Espinola says.	"Ni byiza kumenyekana, kumenya ko abantu bagutegereje, kumenya ko abantu bakwitayeho, kumenya ko uri uwawe, kuko gukenera kuba hamwe no guhuza abantu nikintu cyibanze twese dufite, kandi ni ngombwa kugira ngo ibyo bisohozwe mu buryo butandukanye, "Espinola.
"So, places like third places can allow us to do that."	"Rero, ahantu nka gatatu harashobora kutwemerera kubikora."
In the past, churches and other houses of worship have been a third place for many Americans.	Mu bihe byashize, amatorero n'andi mazu yo gusengeramo yabaye umwanya wa gatatu ku Banyamerika benshi.
In 2019, 67% of people surveyed said they have a third place — a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, park or other place in their community that they visit regularly.	Muri 2019, 67% by'abantu babajijwe bavuze ko bafite umwanya wa gatatu - iduka rya kawa, akabari, resitora, parike cyangwa ahandi hantu basura buri gihe.
That number dropped to 56% in 2021 — a number that could have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.	Umubare wagabanutse kugera kuri 56% muri 2021 - umubare washoboraga kwanduzwa nicyorezo cya COVID-19.
"What we found was that people who had a third place were much more connected to their community," says Cox. "They're much more likely to engage in other activities there.	Cox agira ati: "Icyo twabonye ni uko abantu bafite umwanya wa gatatu bari bahuze cyane n'abaturage babo". "Birashoboka cyane ko bakora ibikorwa bindi.
They are much more trusting of their neighbors. There's a whole great array of positive social outcomes that were connected to having a third place … and for a lot of Americans, it's a coffee shop or a cafe."	Barizera cyane abaturanyi babo. Hano hari byinshi byiza byagezweho mu mibereho bifitanye isano no kugira umwanya wa gatatu… kandi ku Banyamerika benshi, ni ikawa cyangwa ikawa. "
What coffee shops have in their favor is that they can be found almost everywhere, all over the country, and anyone who wants to can stop by regularly.	Icyo amaduka yikawa abifitemo inyungu nuko ashobora kuboneka hafi ya hose, mugihugu cyose, kandi umuntu wese ubishaka ashobora guhagarara buri gihe.
And many are open most days of the week.	Kandi benshi barakinguye iminsi myinshi yicyumweru.
Cox says even brief coffee shop encounters can increase a sense of belonging.	Cox avuga ko no guhura kwa kawa bigufi bishobora kongera imyumvire.
"I think there's a lot of potential here, and a lot of it is unrealized potential," Cox says.	Cox agira ati: "Ntekereza ko hano hari byinshi bishoboka, kandi ibyinshi muri byo ntabwo bishoboka."
"But in terms of what they could do, there's a lot there.	"Ariko ukurikije ibyo bashoboraga gukora, hano hari byinshi.
I've been in places where the same group of folks come in there to play chess.	Nabaye ahantu itsinda rimwe ryabantu baza ngaho gukina chess.
Or they have their informal bunch of retirees. … They just got together, and they talked and chatted and caught up with each other. … I don't know where else they would have gone — maybe a church, but maybe not — to share information, to encourage each other to maybe get involved in an activity.	Cyangwa bafite udutsiko twabo twabasezeye. … Bahuye gusa, baraganira baraganira kandi bafatana. Sinzi aho bari kuba bagiye - ahari itorero, ariko birashoboka ko atari - gusangira amakuru, gushishikarizanya wenda kwishora mubikorwa.
And I think that is what is so powerful about coffee shops."	Kandi ndatekereza ko ari cyo gikomeye cyane mu bubiko bwa kawa. "
	
What US Mayors Are Most Worried About After the Pandemic	Ibyo abayobozi ba Amerika bahangayikishijwe cyane na byo nyuma y'icyorezo
Americas mayors are most concerned about the lingering mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a nationwide survey of 126 mayors conducted during the summer of 2021.	Abayobozi ba Amerika bahangayikishijwe cyane n’ingaruka ziterwa n’ubuzima bwo mu mutwe bw’icyorezo cya COVID-19, nk’uko ubushakashatsi bwakozwe mu gihugu hose bwakorewe ku bayobozi 126 bwakozwe mu mpeshyi ya 2021.
The respondents headed cities with at least 75,000 residents. The local leaders are still focused on traditional issues such as violent crime, the economy and infrastructure, but they are most concerned about the pandemics long-term impact on the mental health of their constituents.	Ababajijwe bayoboye imijyi byibuze abaturage 75.000. Abayobozi b'inzego z'ibanze baracyibanda ku bibazo gakondo nk'ibyaha by'urugomo, ubukungu n'ibikorwa remezo, ariko bahangayikishijwe cyane n'ingaruka z'icyorezo ku buzima bwo mu mutwe bw'abatoye.
Mental health was top of mind for Michael Udine when he was sworn in as mayor of Broward County, Florida, in November 2021.	Ubuzima bwo mu mutwe bwibanze kuri Michael Udine ubwo yarahiraga kuba umuyobozi w’intara ya Broward, muri Floride, mu Gushyingo 2021.
"Everything that was a potential issue pre-pandemic has pretty much been exacerbated by the pandemic," he says. 	Agira ati: "Ikintu cyose cyashoboraga kuba ikibazo mbere y’icyorezo cyarushijeho kwiyongera kubera icyorezo." 
"There were issues going into the pandemic, and it was becoming more and more important on everyone's radar screen about the mental health of people of all ages. And I think the pandemic pretty much supercharged those issues."	"Hariho ibibazo byagiye mu cyorezo, kandi byagendaga birushaho kuba ingenzi kuri ecran ya radar ya buri muntu ku bijyanye n'ubuzima bwo mu mutwe bw'abantu b'ingeri zose. Kandi ndatekereza ko icyorezo cyarenze ibyo bibazo."
It is not unusual for large outbreaks of disease to have a negative impact on mental health, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which reports that rates of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults increased during the pandemic.	Ntibisanzwe ko icyorezo kinini cy’indwara kigira ingaruka mbi ku buzima bwo mu mutwe, nk’uko ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara kibitangaza, ngo raporo y’uko abantu bahangayitse ndetse n’indwara yo kwiheba yiyongera mu gihe cy’icyorezo.
The pandemic has also adversely influenced the emotional and mental health of about one-third of Americas youth.	Icyorezo kandi cyagize ingaruka mbi ku buzima bw'amarangamutima no mu mutwe by'urubyiruko rwo muri Amerika.
"What we've seen is just such anxiety, kids who wouldn't ordinarily have a meltdown, because it's so much change and difficulty adjusting to transitions," Maryland psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord told VOA last month. "We've also seen a lot more sadness and depression."	Mu kwezi gushize, umuhanga mu by'imitekerereze ya muntu witwa Maryland, Mary Karapetian, Alvord, yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika ati: "Ibyo twabonye ni impungenge nk'izo, abana badakunze kugira ikibazo cyo gushonga, kubera ko ari impinduka nyinshi kandi bigoye guhindura inzibacyuho." "Twabonye kandi umubabaro mwinshi no kwiheba."
Early on in the pandemic, mayors were more focused on city operations, budget shortfalls and the threat the pandemic posed to small businesses, according to David Glick, an associate professor of political science at Boston University and a co-author of the 2021 Menino Survey of Mayors.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na David Glick, umwarimu wungirije wa siyanse ya politiki muri kaminuza ya Boston, akaba n'umwanditsi umwe w’ubushakashatsi bwakozwe na Menino 2021, nk'uko byatangajwe na David Glick, umwarimu wungirije ushinzwe ubushakashatsi mu bya politiki, nk'uko byatangajwe na David Glick. 
"Some of those concerns still remain, but what we saw more of in 2021 … is concern about some of the long-term impacts on individual residents," Glick says. 	Glick agira ati: "Zimwe muri izo mpungenge ziracyahari, ariko ibyo twabonye byinshi mu 2021… ni impungenge z'ingaruka z'igihe kirekire ku baturage ku giti cyabo." 
"Concerns about polarization over vaccines and just people being pushed to their limits … and certainly less on their city budgets and revenues and having to cut programs and some of those types of things that were probably more top of mind earlier in the pandemic."	"Guhangayikishwa no gukingira inkingo ndetse n'abantu basunikwa ku mipaka yabo… kandi rwose ni bike ku ngengo y’imari y’umujyi n’amafaranga yinjira ndetse no kugabanya gahunda ndetse na bimwe muri ibyo bintu byashobokaga kuba byaragaragaye mbere mu cyorezo."
Over half of mayors, 52%, are worried about "lingering mental health challenges and trauma," according to the survey. 	Ubushakashatsi buvuga ko kimwe cya kabiri cy’abayobozi, 52%, bahangayikishijwe n’ikibazo cy’ubuzima bwo mu mutwe n’ihungabana. 
Additionally, more than one-third of mayors, 37%, are worried about learning loss among young people.	Byongeye kandi, kimwe cya gatatu cyabayobozi, 37%, bahangayikishijwe no gutakaza imyigire mu rubyiruko.
"Second only to mental health and trauma, and they're probably not totally independent concerns," Glick says. 	Glick agira ati: "Icya kabiri ku buzima bwo mu mutwe no guhahamuka, kandi birashoboka ko atari byo byigenga rwose." 
"It is part of that shift of mayors concerns from immediate threats to businesses closing and people getting sick, to some of these longer-term consequences that are going to persist in the future. 	"Ni bimwe mu byo guhindura abayobozi b'abayobozi biturutse ku iterabwoba ryihuse ku bucuruzi no gufunga abantu, kuri zimwe mu ngaruka z'igihe kirekire zizakomeza kubaho mu gihe kiri imbere.
And learning loss among their students, theyre worried it's going to persist for many, many, many years into the future. It's hard to make up for."	Kandi gutakaza imyigire mu banyeshuri babo, bafite impungenge ko bigiye. komeza kuri benshi, benshi, imyaka myinshi mugihe kizaza. Biragoye kubihimbira. "
According to the survey, other top concerns for Americas mayors include the financial insecurity of low-income residents (33%), the closing of small businesses (29%) and increased crime and violence (26%).	Nk’uko ubushakashatsi bwabigaragaje, izindi mpungenge z’abayobozi b’Amerika zirimo umutekano muke w’amafaranga ku baturage bafite amikoro make (33%), guhagarika imishinga mito (29%) no kongera ibyaha n’ihohoterwa (26%).
Just 7% of mayors are worried about the shift to remote work and the long-term impact that could have on outmigration — people moving away from their cities.	7% by'abayobozi gusa bafite impungenge zo kwimukira mu kazi ka kure n'ingaruka z'igihe kirekire zishobora kugira ku kwimuka - abantu bava mu migi yabo.
The $350 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan to local and state governments could help mayors address some of their concerns. 	Inkunga ingana na miliyari 350 z'amadorali yatanzwe na gahunda yo gutabara y'Abanyamerika kuri guverinoma z'ibanze na leta zishobora gufasha abayobozi gukemura ibibazo byabo. 
The survey found that 78% of mayors believe the money will allow them to make meaningful change.	Ubushakashatsi bwerekanye ko 78% by'abayobozi bemeza ko amafaranga azabafasha guhindura ibintu bifatika.
"What we're seeing is a large majority are using it for things they consider to be transformative and will make major changes to their cities," Glick says, "instead of feeling obligated or feeling the necessity to use it to plug up over-budget gaps to keep the doors open and the lights on."	Glick agira ati: "Ibyo tubona ni benshi babikoresha mu bintu babona ko bihinduka kandi bizahindura imijyi yabo, aho kumva ko ari itegeko cyangwa kumva ko ari ngombwa kubikoresha kugira ngo uzibe icyuho cyingengo yimari kugirango imiryango ikingure kandi itara.

Renting an apartment can be a challenge for new college graduates who are facing the hottest U.S. rental market in a decade, along with some unexpected competition from millennials — people aged 24 to 40 — and even baby boomers — the over-57 club.	Gukodesha inzu birashobora kuba ingorabahizi kubanyeshuri barangije kaminuza bashya bahura nisoko rishyuha cyane muri Amerika mumyaka icumi, hamwe namarushanwa atunguranye kuva mumyaka igihumbi - abantu bafite imyaka 24 kugeza 40 - ndetse nabana bavuka - club irenga 57.
"You have aging millennials who are creating families who should be moving from rental situations into ownership but, because of the lack of housing supply, that has been stopped in a lot of instances. 	"Ufite imyaka igihumbi ishaje irimo gushinga imiryango igomba kuva mu bukode ikajya mu nyungu, ariko, kubera kubura amazu, ibyo bikaba byarahagaritswe ahantu henshi. 
And so, what you see is the aging millennial population continues to rent," says Doug Ressler, manager of business intelligence at Yardi-Matrix, a commercial real estate data and research firm.	Kandi rero, icyo ubona ni uko imyaka igihumbi ishaje ikomeje gukodesha, "ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Doug Ressler, umuyobozi ushinzwe amakuru y’ubucuruzi muri Yardi-Matrix, amakuru y’ubucuruzi n’ikigo cy’ubushakashatsi.
"It's not just about millennials, it's not just about [Gen] Z [people under 24], we also see that boomers are making a transition, he added. "Their percentage of moving into rental properties is growing in the last five years."	Yongeyeho ati: "Ntabwo ari nko mu myaka igihumbi gusa, ntabwo bireba gusa [Gen] Z [abantu bari munsi y’imyaka 24], turabona kandi ko abaterankunga barimo gukora inzibacyuho."
There are a variety of reasons older people are opting for rentals, according to Ressler.	Hariho impamvu zitandukanye abantu bakuze bahitamo gukodesha nkuko Ressler abitangaza.
"They've lived in a home for so long and they want to be able to reduce their expenses on a fixed income," he says. 	Agira ati: "Babaye mu rugo igihe kirekire kandi barashaka kugabanya amafaranga bakoresheje ku musaruro uteganijwe."
"They want to live in a social cohort, like a retirement community, and things like that where it's much more socially amenable to them."	"Bashaka gutura mu mibereho, nk'umuryango w'izabukuru, n'ibindi nk'ibyo aho biborohera cyane kuri bo."
The asking price of apartment rentals was up 10.7% in September 2021 compared to last year at the same time, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).	Nk’uko Ishyirahamwe ry’Abacuruzi (NAR) ribitangaza ngo muri Nzeri 2021, igiciro cy’ubukode bw’amazu cyazamutseho 10.7% muri Nzeri 2021 ugereranije n’umwaka ushize.
"It's a hot market. We have never seen this market so hot in the last decade," says Gay Cororaton, NARs senior economist and director of housing and commercial research. "The average rent growth, year-over-year, is about 3-to-5%. We're seeing 11% rent growth now, so, clearly, way above trends weve had in the past."	Gay Cororaton, impuguke mu by'ubukungu akaba n'umuyobozi ushinzwe imiturire n'ubushakashatsi mu bucuruzi, agira ati: "Ni isoko rishyushye. Ntabwo twigeze tubona iri soko rishyushye cyane mu myaka icumi ishize." 
Renters are feeling the squeeze because the COVID-19 pandemic caused supply chain issues, slowing down home building in the United States. 	Abakodesha bumva bahungabanye kuko icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyateje ibibazo byo gutanga amasoko, bidindiza inyubako zamazu muri Amerika.
Instead of the usual 5-to-6 month supply of available single-family homes, supply dropped below two months in January 2021. 	Aho kugirango amezi 5 kugeza 6 asanzwe atange amazu yumuryango umwe, itangwa ryagabanutse munsi yamezi abiri muri Mutarama 2021.
The lack of housing supply means millennials are having a harder time buying a single-family home, which has been the traditional trajectory in the past.	Kubura amazu yo guturamo bivuze ko imyaka igihumbi igira ikibazo cyo kugura inzu yumuryango umwe, wahoze ari inzira gakondo mugihe cyashize.
"The whole building industry was beset by supply chain issues," Cororaton says. 	Cororaton agira ati: "Inganda zose zubaka zari zugarijwe n'ibibazo bitangwa." 
"Shipments couldn't come in, the price of lumber was rising, manufacturing slowed, workers could not come in [to work], so you have shortages of frames, appliances. So, essentially, just a short supply."	"Kohereza ntibishobora kwinjira, igiciro cy'ibiti cyariyongereye, inganda zidindiza, abakozi ntibashobora kwinjira [ku kazi], bityo ukaba ufite ikibazo cyo kubura amakadiri, ibikoresho. Rero, cyane cyane, ni bike."
	
The housing supply got even tighter during the pandemic as more investors put their money into housing, according to Cororaton, while existing homeowners looked for second homes.	Itangwa ry'amazu ryarushijeho kwiyongera mu gihe cy'icyorezo kuko abashoramari benshi bashyira amafaranga yabo mu mazu nk'uko Cororaton abitangaza, mu gihe ba nyir'amazu bariho bashakisha amazu ya kabiri.
"With the pandemic, there was also a big demand for second homes, for vacation homes. Typically, vacation homes accounted for just about 5% [of the market]," she says. 	Agira ati: "Hamwe n'icyo cyorezo, hakenewe kandi amazu ya kabiri, amazu yo kuruhukiramo. Ubusanzwe, amazu y'ibiruhuko yari hafi 5% [ku isoko]". 
"Early this summer they rose to about 8%. So again, strong demand and strong imbalance of demand and supply caused home prices to rise, made them less affordable."	"Mu ntangiriro z'iki cyi cyazamutse kigera kuri 8%. Ubundi rero, icyifuzo gikomeye hamwe n'ubusumbane bukabije bw'ibisabwa n'amasoko byatumye ibiciro by'amazu bizamuka, bituma bihendutse."
The hottest rental markets right now are in the West and South. More renters are moving to Dallas and Houston in Texas, followed by Atlanta, Georgia; New York; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington, D.C., according to NAR.	Amasoko akodeshwa ashyushye kurubu ni muburengerazuba no mumajyepfo. Abapangayi benshi bimukira i Dallas na Houston muri Texas, bakurikirwa na Atlanta, Jeworujiya; New York; Los Angeles; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; na Washington, D.C., nk'uko NAR ibivuga.
Cororaton expects the coming year to be a little better but says the housing shortage is likely to continue for the next few years.	Cororaton yiteze ko umwaka utaha uzaba mwiza ariko akavuga ko ikibazo cyo kubura amazu gishobora gukomeza mu myaka mike iri imbere.
"You know, the old adage of moving from rentals into homeownership, that whole polemic may be changing," says Ressler. 	Ressler agira ati: "Urabizi, umugani wa kera wo kuva mu bukode ukajya mu nzu, ko icyorezo cyose gishobora guhinduka." 
"The sweet spot was always the millennials, and now the millennials are being replaced by the [Gen] Zs, but the millennials are staying longer and the Zs are coming on board, and now you've got the demographic of the boomers … What it means is a very profitable and dynamic [rental] market that's going to continue to grow."	"Ahantu heza hahoze haribihumbi, none imyaka igihumbi irasimburwa na [Gen] Zs, ariko imyaka igihumbi iragumaho kandi Zs ziraza mubwato, none ufite demografiya yabatezimbere… Niki? bivuze ko ari isoko ryunguka kandi rifite imbaraga [gukodesha] rigiye gukomeza gutera imbere.

Some medical experts have expressed concern that COVID-19 preventative measures, like masking and remote schooling, are potentially weakening childrens immune systems by shielding them from the usual childhood illnesses.	Bamwe mu bahanga mu by'ubuvuzi bagaragaje impungenge z'uko ingamba zo gukumira COVID-19, nko guhisha no kwishuri rya kure, zishobora kugabanya intege nke z'abana babakingira indwara zisanzwe zo mu bwana.
"There are a lot of reasons to believe that kids need to be exposed to things to keep their immunity complex, so that should they encounter something very dangerous, they have aspects of their immunity that might cross over and help protect them against those things," says Sara Sawyer, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Hariho impamvu nyinshi zituma twemera ko abana bakeneye guhura nibintu kugirango bagumane ubudahangarwa bwabo, kuburyo nibaramuka bahuye nikintu kibi cyane, bafite ingingo zubudahangarwa bwabo zishobora kwambuka zikabafasha kubarinda ibyo bintu, ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Sara Sawyer, umwarimu w’ibinyabuzima bya molekuline, selile n’iterambere muri kaminuza ya Colorado Boulder.
At birth, vulnerable infants get antibodies from their mothers breast milk, which helps protect them until they can build their own immunity.	Mu gihe cyo kuvuka, impinja zitagira kivurira zibona antibodi kuri ba nyina amashereka, abafasha kubarinda kugeza igihe bazubaka ubudahangarwa bwabo.
Its no accident that babies start putting things in their mouths as soon as they gain enough dexterity to pick things up. 	Ntabwo ari impanuka ko abana batangira gushyira ibintu mu munwa bakimara kugira ubuhanga buhagije bwo gutoragura ibintu. 
"They're doing that because they're sampling the environment and building their immunity. That's an evolutionary trait," Sawyer says.	Sawyer agira ati: "Ibyo babikora kubera ko batoranya ibidukikije kandi bakubaka ubudahangarwa bwabo. Iyo ni imwe mu bwihindurize."
"They're exposing their body to germs in a certain, level way to build their immunity.	Bagaragaza umubiri wabo kuri mikorobe mu buryo runaka, bwo kubaka ubudahangarwa bwabo. Abantu bamwe rero bavuga ko indwara zo mu bwana, nk'ubukonje ndetse n'udukoko two mu gifu, byubaka ubudahangarwa bwacu kugira ngo igihe ibintu byinshi biteye akaga, twiteguye kandi ntituzarwara muri ibyo bintu bibi cyane. 
Even before the pandemic, epidemiological evidence suggested that children in more developed countries, where handwashing and the use of sanitizer are more prevalent, might have less-developed immune systems compared to kids in developing nations who are routinely exposed to more bacteria, viruses and allergens.	Ndetse na mbere y’icyorezo, ibimenyetso by’ibyorezo byerekanaga ko abana bo mu bihugu byateye imbere cyane, aho gukaraba intoki no gukoresha isuku byiganje, bashobora kuba bafite sisitemu y’umubiri idateye imbere ugereranije n’abana bo mu bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere bakunze guhura na bagiteri nyinshi, virusi na allergene. .
This makes kids in more industrialized countries more vulnerable to developing autoimmune diseases, according to whats known as the "hygiene hypothesis."	Ibi bituma abana bo mu bihugu byinshi byateye imbere bibasirwa n'indwara ziterwa na autoimmune, ukurikije icyo bita "hypothesis yisuku."
"The hygiene hypothesis is actually quite controversial because it's thought that our exposure to microbes isn't the only factor," says Cody Warren, a virologist and immunologist who is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado Boulder.	Cody Warren, inzobere mu bijyanye na virusi akaba n'umu immunologue akaba ari umunyeshuri w’iposita muri kaminuza ya Colorado Boulder, agira ati: "Igitekerezo cy’isuku mu byukuri ntikivugwaho rumwe kuko twibwira ko guhura na mikorobe atari byo byonyine."
"A lot of this could also be dictated by genetics, diet, and the environment that we live in.	Byinshi muri byo bishobora nanone guterwa na genetiki, imirire, n'ibidukikije dutuyemo. Ibyo kandi bigira uruhare runini mumubiri… nikintu gifatika tudashobora kubara byuzuye twambaye masike. Hariho ibindi bintu bijya muri iryo gereranya. 
Warren, the father of three young children, says spending lots of time outdoors is one way to balance the negatives of isolation.	Warren, se w'abana batatu bato, avuga ko kumara umwanya munini hanze ari bumwe mu buryo bwo guhuza ibibi byo kwigunga.
"Just exploring microbes in the environment also is benefiting [and] training our immune system," Warren says. "Our immune systems get trained through the foods that we eat, which also have microorganisms on them.	Warren agira ati: "Gusa gukora ubushakashatsi kuri mikorobe mu bidukikije nabyo byunguka [no] guhugura umubiri." "Ubudahangarwa bw'umubiri bwacu butozwa binyuze mu biryo turya, bifite na mikorobe kuri byo.
And so, despite the fact that we've kind of been hunkered down a little bit, I do feel that our immune systems will catch up."	Kandi rero, nubwo twaba twarahigishijwe gato, ndumva ko ubudahangarwa bwacu buzafatwa. "
There are other things parents can do, he says, to boost their childrens immune systems during pandemic times.	Avuga ko hari ibindi bintu ababyeyi bashobora gukora, kugirango bongere abana babo ubudahangarwa bw'umubiri mugihe cyibyorezo. 
"One of the most important things you can do is just to stay up to date on vaccines.	"Kimwe mu bintu by'ingenzi ushobora gukora ni ugukomeza kugezwaho amakuru ku nkingo.
That's one of the best ways that we have to train our immune systems," Warren says.	Ubu ni bumwe mu buryo bwiza tugomba kumenyereza umubiri, "Warren.
"But also, equally important is making sure our children have a good diet and they regulate stress.	Ariko nanone, icy'ingenzi ni ukureba niba abana bacu bafite indyo yuzuye kandi bagenga imihangayiko. Byanditswe neza ko ibyo byombi - kugira indyo yuzuye, ibidukikije bidahangayikishije - bishobora kugira ingaruka nziza ku mikorere yacu. 
Once public health officials say masks are no longer necessary, Sawyer thinks pointing out the positives of putting our masks away could reassure hesitant parents who worry about their children getting sick.	Abashinzwe ubuzima rusange bamaze kuvuga ko masike atagikenewe, Sawyer atekereza ko kwerekana ibyiza byo gushyira maska ​​yacu bishobora guhumuriza ababyeyi bashidikanya bahangayikishijwe n’abana babo barwara.
"Maybe we should have a public conversation about the possible reasons to take that mask off, if they are in school, and get back to the normal repertoire of relatively safe childhood illnesses," she says.	Agira ati: "Ahari twakagombye kugirana ikiganiro mbwirwaruhame ku mpamvu zishoboka zo gukuramo iyo mask, niba bari ku ishuri, hanyuma tugasubira mu ndirimbo zisanzwe z’indwara zo mu bwana zifite umutekano."
"The plus side of childhood illnesses is that they can build up that hornet's nest of immunity that could protect kids against new things that then come along."	Icyiza cy’indwara zo mu bwana ni uko zishobora kubaka icyari cya hornet cy’ubudahangarwa gishobora kurinda abana ibintu bishya hanyuma bikaza.
	
US Quietly Expands Asylum Limits While Preparing to End Them	Amerika Yaguye Bituje Imipaka Yubuhunzi Mugihe Yitegura Kubarangiza
The Biden administration has begun expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans to Mexico under pandemic-related powers to deny migrants a chance to seek asylum, expanding use of the rule even as it publicly says it has been trying to unwind it, officials said Wednesday.	Ku wa gatatu, abayobozi bavuze ko ubuyobozi bwa Biden bwatangiye kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri Mexico kubera ububasha bujyanye n’icyorezo bwo kwima abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro, kwagura ikoreshwa ry’iryo tegeko nubwo rivuga ku mugaragaro ko ryagerageje kubireka.
The U.S. struck agreement with Mexico to expel up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans a day from three locations: San Diego; El Paso, Texas; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the effort.	Amerika yagiranye amasezerano na Mexico yo kwirukana abanya Cuba 100 na Nikaragwa 20 kumunsi ahantu hatatu: San Diego; El Paso, muri Texas; n'ikibaya cya Rio Grande, muri Texas, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wa Amerika ufite ubumenyi butaziguye bw'imbaraga.
The expulsions began April 27 and will end May 22, the official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the agreement has not been made public.	Iyirukanwa ryatangiye ku ya 27 Mata rikazarangira ku ya 22 Gicurasi, nk'uko uyu muyobozi yabitangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika kugira ngo atamenyekana kubera ko ayo masezerano atashyizwe ahagaragara.
They are carried out under Title 42 authority, a public health law that has been used to expel migrants on grounds of preventing spread of COVID-19. Title 42 is due to expire May 23, unless a judge intervenes.	Bikorerwa munsi yumutwe wa 42, itegeko ryubuzima rusange ryakoreshejwe mu kwirukana abimukira ku mpamvu zo gukumira ikwirakwizwa rya COVID-19. Umutwe wa 42 ugomba kurangira ku ya 23 Gicurasi, keretse umucamanza abigizemo uruhare.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed April 26 to a very limited number of expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans, according to a high-level Mexican official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.	Nk’uko byatangajwe n'umuyobozi wo mu rwego rwo hejuru wo muri Megizike wavuze ko atigeze atangazwa kubera ko batemerewe kugira icyo batangaza ku mugaragaro, Amerika na Mexico byumvikanye ku ya 26 Mata ku mubare muto cyane wo kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa.
It was prompted by higher numbers of migrants from those two countries coming to the U.S. border.	Byatewe numubare munini w’abimukira bava muri ibyo bihugu byombi baza kumupaka wa Amerika.
Mexico also took into account that the U.S. government had started processing visas in Cuba again, the official said. Mexico had also begun processing visas for Cubans.	Uyu muyobozi yavuze ko Mexico kandi yazirikanye ko guverinoma y'Amerika yatangiye gutunganya viza muri Cuba. Mexico nayo yari yatangiye gutunganya viza kubanya Cuba.
Another Mexican official, also not authorized to comment publicly, confirmed that up to 100 Cubans and 20 Nicaraguans were being expelled from San Diego under Title 42.	Undi muyobozi wo muri Megizike, na we utemerewe kugira icyo atangaza ku mugaragaro, yemeje ko Abanyakanani bagera kuri 100 na Nikaragwa 20 birukanwa muri San Diego ku mutwe wa 42.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	Minisiteri ishinzwe umutekano mu gihugu cya Amerika ntabwo yahise isubiza icyifuzo cyo gutanga ibisobanuro.
Until last week, Mexico only agreed to take Guatemalans, Hondurans and El Salvadorans — in addition to Mexicans — under Title 42 authority. Other nationalities are subject to Title 42 but costs, strained diplomatic ties and other considerations often make it difficult to send them back to their home countries.	Kugeza mu cyumweru gishize, Mexico yemeye gufata Guatemala, Hondurans na El Salvadorans - usibye Abanyamegizike - ku butegetsi bwa 42. Abandi benegihugu bagengwa na Umutwe wa 42 ariko ikiguzi, umubano wububanyi n’ububanyi n’ibindi bitekerezo akenshi biragoye kubasubiza mu bihugu byabo.
It's next to impossible for the U.S. to expel migrants to Cuba or Nicaragua because of poor relations with those governments. 	Bikurikira ntibishoboka ko Amerika yirukana abimukira muri Cuba cyangwa Nikaragwa kubera umubano mubi na guverinoma. 
That has posed a challenge for the Biden administration as more people from those countries seek haven in the United States.	Ibyo byateje ikibazo ubuyobozi bwa Biden mugihe abantu benshi baturuka muri ibyo bihugu bashaka ubuhungiro muri Amerika.
Cubans were stopped by U.S. authorities more than 32,000 times on the Mexican border in March, double the number in February and more than five times October's count, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Nicaragua eased travel restrictions from Cuba in November, making it easier for Cubans to continue by land to the U.S. border. Most enter the U.S. in or near Yuma, Arizona, and Del Rio, Texas.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na gasutamo ya Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, ngo abanya Cuba bahagaritswe n'abayobozi b'Abanyamerika inshuro zirenga 32.000 ku mupaka wa Mexico, bakubye kabiri muri Gashyantare ndetse bakubye inshuro zirenga eshanu Ukwakira. Nikaragwa yorohereje imbogamizi z’ingendo ziva muri Cuba mu Gushyingo, byorohereza Abanyakanada gukomeza ku butaka kugera ku mupaka wa Amerika. Benshi binjira muri Amerika cyangwa hafi ya Yuma, Arizona, na Del Rio, Texas.
Nicaraguans were stopped more than 16,000 times in March, more than double September's level. The vast majority enter in South Texas.	Muri Werurwe, Nikaragwa yahagaritswe inshuro zirenga 16.000, irenga inshuro ebyiri Nzeri. Umubare munini winjira muri Texas yepfo.
Lifting Title 42 has proved controversial as midterm elections near, even for Biden's Democratic Party, amid concerns that the U.S. is unprepared for an anticipated increase in migrants seeking asylum. Authorities stopped migrants more than 221,000 times in March, the highest mark in 22 years.	Kuzamura Umutwe wa 42 byagaragaye ko bitavugwaho rumwe nk’amatora yo hagati, ndetse no mu ishyaka rya demokarasi rya Biden, mu gihe hari impungenge z’uko Amerika ititeguye kwiyongera kw’abimukira bashaka ubuhungiro. Muri Werurwe, abategetsi bahagaritse abimukira inshuro zirenga 221.000, kikaba aricyo kintu kinini mu myaka 22.
The White House and Homeland Security Department have publicly stood behind the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to end the measure because it could no longer be justified on grounds of protecting public health.	Ishami ry’umutekano n’umutekano mu gihugu ryashyigikiye ku mugaragaro icyemezo cy’ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira indwara cyo guhagarika iki cyemezo kuko kitagishoboye kuba gifite ishingiro kubera kurengera ubuzima rusange.
But the practice of expelling Cubans and Nicaraguans runs counter to the administration's public statements that it was phasing out use of the pandemic powers to prepare for May 23.	Ariko imyitozo yo kwirukana abanya Cuba na Nikaragwa irahabanye n’ubuyobozi bwatangaje ko bwagiye bukuraho imbaraga z’icyorezo kugira ngo bitegure ku ya 23 Gicurasi.
The U.S. has expelled migrants more than 1.8 million times under Title 42 authority since March 2020, effectively overriding rights to seek asylum under U.S. law and international treaty. In doing so, migrants are not subject to immigration law, which include rights to seek protection from persecution at home.	Kuva muri Werurwe 2020, Amerika yirukanye abimukira inshuro zirenga miliyoni 1.8 ku butegetsi bwa Umutwe wa 42, bivuguruza uburenganzira bwo gusaba ubuhungiro hakurikijwe amategeko ya Amerika n'amasezerano mpuzamahanga. Mu kubikora, abimukira ntibagengwa n'amategeko y’abinjira, akubiyemo uburenganzira bwo kurindwa ibitotezo mu ngo.
The administration said in court filings that it began processing more Central American adults under immigration laws after the CDC's announcement on April 1. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that it couldn't start unwinding Title 42 while it was still in effect.	Ubuyobozi bwatangaje mu rukiko ko bwatangiye gutunganya abantu benshi bakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati bakurikiza amategeko y’abinjira nyuma y’uko CDC ibitangaza ku ya 1 Mata.
U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays strongly criticized the CDC's decision, suggesting he would try to keep Title 42 in effect after May 23. A hearing is scheduled May 13 for oral arguments.	Umucamanza w'akarere ka Amerika, Robert Summerhays, yanenze cyane icyemezo cya CDC, avuga ko azagerageza gukomeza Umutwe wa 42 nyuma y'itariki ya 23 Gicurasi.
Marisa Limon, senior director of advocacy and planning at the Hope Border Institute, said advocates began learning about expulsions of Cubans and Nicaraguans from El Paso on Monday and later confirmed the new practice with U.S. officials.	Umuyobozi mukuru ushinzwe ubuvugizi n’igenamigambi mu kigo cya Hope Border, Marisa Limon, yavuze ko abunganizi batangiye kwiga ibijyanye no kwirukana Abanyakanani na Nikaragwa muri El Paso ku wa mbere nyuma baza kwemeza imikorere mishya hamwe n’abayobozi ba Amerika.
Limon said the administration is "trying to get every last bit out of Title 42" before it expires. 	Limon yavuze ko ubuyobozi "bugerageza gukuramo buri kintu cya nyuma mu mutwe wa 42" kitararangira. 
She called it "sobering" but consistent with the administration's efforts to have other countries in the Western hemisphere take more responsibility for hosting people fleeing their homes.	Yayise "gutekereza" ariko ahuza n'imbaraga z'ubuyobozi kugira ngo ibindi bihugu byo mu gice cy'iburengerazuba bigire uruhare runini mu kwakira abantu bahunga ingo zabo.
	
Mexico Relocates Migrant Camp; Haitians Appear at Border	Mexico yimuye inkambi y'abimukira; Abanyahayitiya bagaragara kumupaka
Mexican authorities said Tuesday they have relocated a migrant camp that sprung up in a park in the border city of Reynosa, moving about 2,000 people from Central America and Haiti to a shelter in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas.	Ku wa kabiri, abategetsi ba Mexico bavuze ko bimuye inkambi y’abimukira yavukiye muri parike iri mu mujyi wa Reynosa uhana imbibi, yimura abantu bagera ku 2000 bava muri Amerika yo Hagati na Haiti mu buhungiro mu mujyi, hakurya y’umupaka na McAllen, muri Texas.
The camp of migrants mainly from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti sprung up after U.S. officials, citing the pandemic, invoked a health rule that denies migrants a chance to seek asylum.	Inkambi y'abimukira ahanini baturutse muri Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras na Haiti imaze kuvuka nyuma yuko abayobozi ba Amerika, bavuga ko iki cyorezo, basabye itegeko ry’ubuzima ryanga abimukira amahirwe yo gusaba ubuhungiro.
Mexico's National Immigration Institute said the migrants were taken around midnight Monday to the shelter, which it said will have better hygiene and food services.	Ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka muri Mexico cyatangaje ko abimukira bajyanywe mu gicuku cyo ku wa mbere bakajya mu buhungiro, buvuga ko buzagira isuku na serivisi nziza.
But on Monday, people in another border city, Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of migrants, mainly Haitians, have streamed into that city, which is across the border from Laredo, Texas	Ariko ku wa mbere, abantu bo mu wundi mujyi uhana imbibi, Nuevo Laredo, bavuze ko abimukira babarirwa mu magana, cyane cyane Abanyahayiti, binjiye muri uwo mujyi, uhana imbibi na Laredo, muri Texas.
The rush apparently started after the U.S. began processing some asylum-seekers there.	Kwihuta bigaragara ko byatangiye nyuma yuko Amerika itangiye gutunganya bamwe mubasaba ubuhungiro.
The Catholic bishop of Nuevo Laredo said Monday that migrant shelters there are overcrowded, with some migrants sleeping outside in tents.	Umwepiskopi gatolika wa Nuevo Laredo yavuze ku wa mbere ko aho abimukira bahurira huzuye, aho abimukira bamwe baryama hanze mu mahema.
Bishop Enrique Sánchez Martínez said migrants started streaming into Nuevo Laredo in late April, though the city isn't usually popular among migrants, in part because it is dominated by the violent Northeast drug cartel.	Musenyeri Enrique Sánchez Martínez yavuze ko abimukira batangiye kwinjira muri Nuevo Laredo mu mpera za Mata, nubwo uyu mujyi udakunzwe cyane n'abimukira, kubera ko wiganjemo amakarito y’ibiyobyabwenge yo mu majyaruguru y'uburasirazuba.
"It is new for us because this is the last place they come, due to the conditions of our border, of our city, which are sometimes adverse for migrants," the bishop said. 	Umwepiskopi yagize ati: "Ni shyashya kuri twe kuko aha niho hantu ha nyuma baza, bitewe n'imipaka yacu, umujyi wacu, rimwe na rimwe bikaba bibi ku bimukira." 
"But since they opened the door in the United States to asylum requests, a lot of them came in large groups."	"Ariko kuva bafungura umuryango muri Amerika gusaba ubuhunzi, benshi muri bo baza mu matsinda manini."
Marvin Ajic, the director of the Casa Nazareth shelter, said that around April 16, Mexican authorities notified the shelters that the United States would resume processing asylum claims for humanitarian reasons.	Umuyobozi w'ikigo cya Casa Nazareth, Marvin Ajic, yavuze ko ahagana ku ya 16 Mata, abategetsi ba Mexico bamenyesheje ubwo buhungiro ko Amerika izakomeza gutunganya ibirego by'ubuhunzi kubera impamvu z’ubutabazi.
The U.S. had begun allowing more people in, especially Central American adults, to prepare for lifting Title 42 — a pandemic-era health rule that denies migrants a chance to enter the U.S. seek asylum — on May 23. But a federal judge in Louisiana ruled last week that the government could not unwind the rule before the end date.	Ku ya 23 Gicurasi, Amerika yari yatangiye kwemerera abantu benshi, cyane cyane abakuze bo muri Amerika yo Hagati, kwitegura gukuraho Umutwe wa 42 - itegeko ry’ubuzima bwo mu gihe cy’icyorezo kibuza abimukira amahirwe yo kwinjira muri Amerika gusaba ubuhungiro - ku ya 23 Gicurasi. Ariko umucamanza wa federasiyo muri Louisiana yemeje icyumweru gishize ko guverinoma idashobora gukuraho iryo tegeko mbere yitariki yo kurangiriraho.
"The (Mexican) immigration officials organized things with the shelters, and the plan was to send people who had been waiting a long time, without any checks, basically anyone," Ajic said.	Ajic yagize ati: "Abashinzwe abinjira n'abasohoka (Abanyamegizike) bateguye ibintu hamwe n'ubuhungiro, kandi gahunda yari iyo kohereza abantu bari bategereje igihe kirekire, nta sheki bafite, cyane cyane umuntu uwo ari we wese."
That apparently drew the attention of other migrants, including Haitians.	Ikigaragara ni uko ibyo byashimishije abandi bimukira, harimo n'Abanyahayiti.
In September, similar rumors sparked a rush by about 15,000 mostly Haitian refugees to the Texas border, where they camped under a bridge. U.S. officials began large scale deportations of Haitians while also allowing thousands to remain in the U.S.	Muri Nzeri, ibihuha nk'ibyo byatumye abantu bagera ku 15.000 bihutira cyane cyane impunzi zo muri Hayiti kugera ku mupaka wa Texas, aho bakambitse munsi y'ikiraro. Abayobozi ba Amerika batangiye kwirukana Abanyahayiti benshi mu gihe banemerera ibihumbi kuguma muri Amerika
Ajic warned migrants against coming to the border, noting the risks. On Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute said that so far this year, it has pulled the bodies of 19 immigrants from the Rio Grande, also known as the Rio Bravo.	Ajic yihanangirije abimukira kwirinda kuza ku mupaka, avuga ingaruka. Ku wa mbere, Ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe abinjira n’abasohoka muri Mexico cyavuze ko kugeza uyu mwaka, kimaze gukuramo imirambo y’abimukira 19 bava muri Rio Grande, izwi kandi ku izina rya Rio Bravo.
	
New US Rule Grants Automatic Work Permit Extensions to Noncitizens	Amategeko mashya yo muri Amerika atanga uruhushya rwo gukora rwikora kubaturage
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced Tuesday that it would automatically extend for 360 days the work permits of immigrants who applied to renew their work authorization amid the current backlog in processing times.	Serivisi ishinzwe abenegihugu n’abinjira n’abasohoka muri Amerika (USCIS) yatangaje ku wa kabiri ko izahita yongerwa iminsi 360 uruhushya rwo gukora rw’abimukira basabye kuvugurura uruhushya rw’akazi mu gihe kiri inyuma mu gihe cyo gutunganya.
The new notice expands on the 180-day extension USCIS announced in November. It is expected to prevent about 260,000 immigrants from losing their work permits in the next 18 months. It will also give the agency extra time to clear applicants waiting in line, the agency said in a statement.	Amatangazo mashya yagutse ku iyongerwa ry'iminsi 180 USCIS yatangaje mu Gushyingo. Biteganijwe ko bizabuza abimukira bagera ku 260.000 gutakaza uruhushya rwo gukora mu mezi 18 ari imbere. Bizatanga kandi ikigo cy’inyongera cyo gukuraho abasaba gutegereza umurongo, nkuko byatangajwe n’ikigo.
"This temporary rule will provide those noncitizens otherwise eligible for the automatic extension an opportunity to maintain employment and provide critical support for their families while avoiding further disruption for U.S. employers," USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou said in a statement.	Mu ijambo rye, Umuyobozi wa USCIS, Ur M. Jaddou, yagize ati: "Iri tegeko ry’agateganyo rizaha abo banyagihugu ubundi bemerewe kongererwa mu buryo bwikora amahirwe yo gukomeza akazi no gutanga inkunga ikomeye ku miryango yabo mu gihe birinda ko hajyaho ihungabana ku bakoresha ba Amerika."
	
The extension, which takes effect Wednesday, aims to stabilize operations for U.S. employers and help people with pending employment authorizations who have a job and are working in the U.S.	Iyongerekana ritangira gukurikizwa ku wa gatatu, rigamije guhuza ibikorwa ku bakoresha ba Amerika no gufasha abantu bafite uburenganzira bwo gutegereza bafite akazi kandi bakorera muri Amerika.
USCIS is the agency in charge of handling the nation's immigration paperwork. In recent years, it has struggled with backlogs, an issue made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and budget shortfalls.	USCIS nicyo kigo gishinzwe gukemura impapuro z’abinjira mu gihugu. Mu myaka yashize, yahanganye n'ibibazo bidasubirwaho, ikibazo cyarushijeho kuba icyorezo cya COVID-19 hamwe no kubura ingengo yimari.
In April, Jaddou told U.S. government officials during a congressional hearing that USCIS had 8.5 million pending immigration cases, including those seeking green cards and U.S. naturalization.	Muri Mata, Jaddou yabwiye abayobozi ba leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika mu gihe cy’iburanisha ry’inteko ishinga amategeko ko USCIS ifite miliyoni 8.5 zitegereje imanza z’abinjira n’abinjira, harimo n’abashaka amakarita y’icyatsi ndetse n’ubwenegihugu bwa Amerika.
She said more than half of those pending cases were taking longer than the agency's normal processing times.	Yavuze ko kimwe cya kabiri cy’izo manza zitarangizwa zafashe igihe kirenze igihe cy’ikigo gisanzwe.
Asylum-seekers, immigrants adjusting their status to permanent residence and other noncitizens going through the U.S. immigration process are among the noncitizens affected by the latest work authorization extension.	Abasaba ubuhungiro, abimukira bahindura status yabo gutura burundu hamwe nabandi banyagihugu banyura muri gahunda y’abinjira n’abanyamerika bari mu baturage badafite ingaruka ku iyongerwa ry’akazi riheruka.
The agency had reported that processing times for asylum applicants looking to renew work permits increased from seven months in 2017 to 11 months in 2021.	Ikigo cyari cyatangaje ko igihe cyo gutunganya abasaba ubuhunzi bashaka kuvugurura impushya zo gukora cyiyongereye kuva ku mezi arindwi muri 2017 kigera ku mezi 11 muri 2021.
In March, USCIS announced a program to reduce backlogs, including the expansion of premium processing for certain applications where applicants could pay a higher fee to expedite paperwork processing.	Muri Werurwe, USCIS yatangaje gahunda yo kugabanya ibirarane, harimo no kwagura progaramu ya progaramu ya progaramu zimwe aho abasaba bashobora kwishyura amafaranga menshi kugirango byihutishe gutunganya impapuro.
According to the USCIS, most of the announced changes simply restore options offered before the Trump administration's slowdown of USCIS processing and before the COVID-19 pandemic further slowed the agency's resources.	Nk’uko USCIS ibigaragaza, impinduka nyinshi zatangajwe gusa zigarura gusa amahitamo yatanzwe mbere y’uko ubuyobozi bwa Trump butinda gutunganya USCIS ndetse na mbere y’icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyadindije umutungo w’ikigo.
"For several years, USCIS has been in a precarious financial situation that has impaired the efficient completion of caseloads.	Hashize imyaka itari mike, USCIS ihura n'ikibazo cy'ubukungu cyabujije kurangiza neza amakarito. 
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges in 2020, in addition to a hiring freeze and furlough threat leading to workforce attrition and severely reduced capacity. 	Icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyakajije umurego muri 2020, hiyongereyeho gukonjesha akazi no gukangisha abantu bigatuma abakozi binjira kandi bikagabanya cyane ubushobozi. 
In 2021, before USCIS could recover from these fiscal and operational impacts, there was a sudden and dramatic increase in EAD (Employment Authorization Document) initial and renewal filings," according to the USCIS statement.	Mu 2021, mbere yuko USCIS isubirana izo ngaruka z’imari n’ibikorwa, habaye ubwiyongere butunguranye kandi butangaje muri EAD (Impapuro zemeza akazi) inyandiko zambere kandi zivugururwa , nk'uko byatangajwe na USCIS.
The USCIS historically has been underfunded because most of the agency's funding comes from application fees that have stalled at $5 billion a year since 2019.	Amateka ya USCIS yatewe inkunga kubera ko inkunga nyinshi z’ikigo zituruka ku mafaranga yo gusaba yahagaze kuri miliyari 5 z'amadolari ku mwaka kuva 2019.
	
What Is the US-Launched 'Uniting for Ukraine' Program?	Niki Gahunda yatangijwe na Amerika 'Guhuriza hamwe muri Ukraine'?
U.S. President Joe Biden recently announced the Uniting for Ukraine program, which aims to streamline the process for Ukrainians who have fled their country and are seeking safety in the United States.	Perezida wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, Joe Biden, aherutse gutangaza gahunda y’ubumwe bwa Ukraine, igamije koroshya inzira ku Banya Ukraine bahunze igihugu cyabo kandi bashaka umutekano muri Amerika.
The new program, which took effect Monday, will complement existing legal pathways available to those fleeing Russian aggression due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis, Biden administration officials said.	Abayobozi b'ubuyobozi bwa Biden bavuze ko iyi gahunda nshya yatangiye gukurikizwa ku wa mbere, izuzuza inzira zemewe n'amategeko zihari ku bahunga igitero cy'Uburusiya kubera ikibazo cy'Uburusiya na Ukraine gikomeje.
"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to provide relief to the Ukrainian people, while supporting our European allies who have shouldered so much as the result of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine," Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to reporters on April 21.	Umunyamabanga wa Leta ushinzwe umutekano mu gihugu, Alejandro Mayorkas, yagize ati: "Minisiteri ishinzwe umutekano mu gihugu cya Amerika (DHS) izakomeza gutanga ubutabazi ku baturage ba Ukraine, mu gihe ishyigikiye ibihugu byacu by’i Burayi bitwaje intwaro nyinshi bitewe n’uko Uburusiya bwateye muri Ukraine bunyamaswa." itangazo ku banyamakuru ku ya 21 Mata.
What is Uniting for Ukraine?	Guhuza Ukraine ni iki?
The program allows U.S. citizens and residents to sponsor Ukrainian refugees under different immigration statuses. The online portal, open to potential sponsors or organizations, is accepting applications and has received more than 4,000 requests so far, CNN reported.	Porogaramu yemerera abanyamerika n’abaturage gutera inkunga impunzi zo muri Ukraine mu bihe bitandukanye by’abinjira. CNN yatangaje ko umuyoboro wa interineti ufunguye abaterankunga cyangwa imiryango, ushobora kwakira ibyifuzo kandi umaze kwakira ibyifuzo birenga 4000 kugeza ubu.
Who qualifies under the program? Ukrainians, or an immediate family member of a Ukrainian citizen. They must have a U.S. sponsor and have been a resident of Ukraine as of February 11.

Bagomba kugira umuterankunga w’Amerika kandi bakaba batuye muri Ukraine guhera ku ya 11 Gashyantare.
What are the requirements? They must pass security checks — including a fingerprint and an FBI name check and biographic and biometric screening — and meet public health requirements, such as having the proper vaccinations, before entering the U.S.	Ni ibihe bisabwa? Bagomba gutsinda igenzura ry'umutekano - harimo igikumwe no kugenzura izina rya FBI no gusuzuma biografiya na biometrike - kandi bujuje ibyangombwa byubuzima rusange, nko kugira inkingo zikwiye, mbere yo kwinjira muri Amerika
Those approved will be allowed to travel to the U.S., be considered for humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis, stay in the country for two years, and apply for work permits.	Abemerewe bazemererwa kujya muri Amerika, bafatwe nk'agateganyo ku buntu, bagume mu gihugu imyaka ibiri, kandi basabe uruhushya rwo gukora.
"The United States strongly encourages Ukrainians seeking refuge in the United States who do not have and are not eligible for a visa to seek entry via Uniting for Ukraine from Europe. 	Amerika irashishikariza cyane Abanya Ukraine bashaka ubuhungiro muri Amerika badafite kandi batemerewe kubona viza yo kwinjira binyuze muri Uniting for Ukraine bava i Burayi. 
This will be the safest and most efficient way to pursue temporary refuge in the United States," a DHS statement said.	Ubu ni bwo buryo bwizewe kandi bunoze bwo guhungira by'agateganyo muri Amerika. Ibihugu , nk'uko byatangajwe na DHS.
Who qualifies as a sponsor?	Ninde wujuje ibisabwa nk'umuterankunga?

Sponsors will be required to prove they can financially support the refugee while they are in the U.S. They also need to pass security and background vetting "to protect against exploitation and abuse." The Ukrainian applicant will receive authorization only after everything is verified, including that the sponsor has the means to support them while they are in the U.S.	Abaterankunga bazasabwa kwerekana ko bashobora gutera inkunga impunzi mu gihe bari muri Amerika Bakeneye kandi kunyura mu mutekano no kugenzura "kurinda ihohoterwa no guhohoterwa." Usaba ukomoka muri Ukraine azahabwa uruhushya nyuma yuko byose bigenzuwe, harimo ko umuterankunga afite uburyo bwo kubatera inkunga mugihe bari muri Amerika
Who is not eligible for parole under the program?	Ninde utemerewe kurekurwa muri gahunda?

However, they can apply for Temporary Protected Status, which is another form of humanitarian relief that allows people to legally stay and work in the U.S.	Ariko, barashobora gusaba Imiterere irinzwe byigihe gito, nubundi buryo bwo gutabara imbabare butuma abantu bagumaho kandi bakorera muri Amerika.
What about those arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border?	Tuvuge iki ku bashitse ku mupaka wa Amerika na Mexico?
Citing safety issues, U.S. officials have urged Ukrainians not to travel to Mexico in hopes of entering the United States. In addition, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has no place to hold them while they go through the Uniting for Ukraine vetting process.	Abayobozi ba Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika basabye ibibazo by’umutekano, basabye abanya Ukraine kutajya muri Mexico bizeye kwinjira muri Amerika. Byongeye kandi, gasutamo yo muri Amerika no kurinda imipaka nta hantu na hamwe yabifata mu gihe banyuze muri gahunda yo gusuzuma Ukraine.

Kuva Guhuriza hamwe kwa Ukraine ku wa mbere, Abanya-Ukraine bageze ku byambu by’Amerika binjira nta viza yemewe cyangwa batabiherewe uburenganzira bwo kujya muri Amerika binyuze muri gahunda y’ubumwe bwa Ukraine bazangirwa kwinjira kandi babwirwa gusaba iyo gahunda.
Biden officials hope this will curb the number of Ukrainian migrants seeking humanitarian parole along the border.	Abayobozi ba Biden bizeye ko ibyo bizagabanya umubare w’abimukira bo muri Ukraine bashaka gufungurwa by’umupaka.
Those at the border must apply under the rules of Uniting for Ukraine, meaning they must have a qualifying sponsor or a non-government agency willing to sponsor them in the U.S. for up to two years. And they need to have all required vaccinations and pass background checks.	Abari ku mipaka bagomba gusaba hakurikijwe amategeko agenga ubumwe bwa Ukraine, bivuze ko bagomba kugira umuterankunga wujuje ibyangombwa cyangwa ikigo kitegamiye kuri leta cyifuza kubatera inkunga muri Amerika mugihe cyimyaka ibiri. Kandi bakeneye kugira inkingo zose zisabwa no gutsinda igenzura.
The Biden administration announced the private sponsorship initiative as another way the U.S. hopes to achieve President Biden's commitment to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by the Russian military invasion.	Ubuyobozi bwa Biden bwatangaje gahunda yo gutera inkunga abikorera ku giti cyabo nk'ubundi buryo Amerika yizeye kuzagera ku cyemezo cya Perezida Biden cyo kwakira abanya Ukraine bagera ku 100.000 bavanywe mu byabo n’igitero cy’ingabo z’Uburusiya.
As of Thursday, almost 5.4 million refugees have since left Ukraine, according to U.N. data.	Nk’uko amakuru ya Amerika abitangaza, kugeza ku wa kane, impunzi zigera kuri miliyoni 5.4 zimaze kuva muri Ukraine.
	
Report: Rwanda Should Ease Restrictions On 2003 National Elections - 2001-10-15	Raporo: U Rwanda rukwiye koroshya imbogamizi ku matora y’igihugu 2003 - 2001-10-15
In 2003 Rwanda will hold its first national elections since the 1994 genocide. A new report says the government of Rwanda needs to relax its control over public life if the polls are to have any credibility.	Mu 2003 u Rwanda ruzakora amatora yambere y’igihugu kuva jenoside yo mu 1994. Raporo nshya ivuga ko guverinoma y'u Rwanda ikeneye koroshya ubuzima bw’abaturage niba amatora agomba kwizerwa.
There was relief when the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized power in Rwanda in 1994, ending the genocide in which about 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.	Habayeho ihumure igihe urugamba rwo gukunda igihugu rw’u Rwanda rwafataga ubutegetsi mu Rwanda mu 1994, rukarangiza itsembabwoko ryahitanye Abatutsi bagera ku 800.000 n'Abahutu bashyira mu gaciro.
The new military government promised to restore democracy to Rwanda via elections in 2003.	Guverinoma nshya y’ingabo yasezeranije kugarura demokarasi mu Rwanda binyuze mu matora yo mu 2003.
That process began in March this year, with district elections.	Iyo nzira yatangiye muri Werurwe uyu mwaka, hamwe n’amatora y’akarere.
Senior analyst Francois Grignon, of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based policy research organization, says he was disappointed with the district poll. Mr. Grignon says the process was so tightly controlled that he maintains no genuine opposition candidates were allowed to stand.	Umusesenguzi mukuru Francois Grignon, wo mu itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo bya politiki iherereye i Buruseli, avuga ko yatengushye amatora y'akarere. Bwana Grignon avuga ko inzira yagenzuwe cyane ku buryo akomeza avuga ko nta bakandida nyabo batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi bari bemerewe guhagarara.
"There was a screening and there was a preparation of the elections, which did not allow other candidates than those who had been rubber-stamped by the government to actually contest, especially for the executive positions within the local authorities," he says. "If consensual democracy means that the political debate is actually handled before the electoral contest in such a way that it does not lead to a real competition then there is no democracy at all."	Agira ati: "Habayeho isuzuma kandi hategurwa amatora, atemerera abandi bakandida uretse abashyizweho kashe na guverinoma guhatanira koko, cyane cyane ku myanya y'ubuyobozi mu nzego z'ibanze". "Niba demokarasi yumvikanyweho bivuze ko impaka za politiki zikemurwa mbere y'amarushanwa y'amatora ku buryo bitatuma habaho amarushanwa nyayo, nta demokarasi ihari."
In a new report, titled Consensual Democracy in Post Genocide Rwanda, the International Crisis Group urges the international community to pressure Rwanda's government to liberalize political activity.	Muri raporo nshya yiswe Demokarasi ihuriweho na Jenoside nyuma y’itsembabwoko mu Rwanda, Itsinda mpuzamahanga rishinzwe ibibazo rirasaba amahanga guhatira leta y’u Rwanda kwishyira ukizana mu bikorwa bya politiki.
The report notes that the military dominates public life and there is little open criticism of the government, either in the media or by opposition figures. The Rwanda government argues that allowing a range of opinions would be dangerous in a country struggling to come to terms with its bloody past.	Raporo ivuga ko igisirikare cyiganje mu buzima rusange kandi ko nta kunegura guverinoma, haba mu bitangazamakuru cyangwa ku bantu batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi. Guverinoma y'u Rwanda ivuga ko kwemerera ibitekerezo bitandukanye byaba ari akaga mu gihugu kirwanira kumvikana na kahise kayo k'amaraso.
But Mr. Grignon says dissent is simply being driven underground or outside Rwanda's borders.	Ariko Bwana Grignon avuga ko abatavuga rumwe na leta bayoborwa mu nsi cyangwa hanze y’umupaka w’u Rwanda.
"Opponents to the regime have to flee the country or to join in rebel movements outside the country or in the Congo and no chance to express a different view," he says. "All the good policies that the government has been implementing - including the organization of the elections, national elections, presidential and parliamentary, in 2003 - will lack the credibility because they were not implemented in an environment that actually allowed a fair contest to take place," he says.	Agira ati: "Abatavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi bagomba guhunga igihugu cyangwa kujya mu myigaragambyo y'inyeshyamba hanze y'igihugu cyangwa muri Kongo kandi nta mahirwe yo kuvuga ukundi." "Politiki nziza zose guverinoma yashyize mu bikorwa - harimo gutegura amatora, amatora y’igihugu, perezida ndetse n’inteko ishinga amategeko, mu 2003 - ntizizigirirwa icyizere kuko zitashyizwe mu bikorwa byemerera amarushanwa akwiye. , ".
Mr. Grignon says greater freedom of expression would strengthen Rwanda's reconciliation process and enhance its chances of a peaceful future.	Bwana Grignon avuga ko ubwisanzure mu gutanga ibitekerezo bwashimangira inzira y'ubwiyunge y'u Rwanda kandi bikongerera amahirwe y'ejo hazaza.
He says the international community's involvement in reconstruction projects gives it the leverage to make this plain to the Rwandan government.	Avuga ko uruhare mpuzamahanga mu mishinga yo kwiyubaka rutanga imbaraga zo kugeza iki kibazo kuri guverinoma y'u Rwanda.
	
Economists Predict Bumpy Road for Malawi's Economy in 2015	Abahanga mu bukungu bavuze ku muhanda wa Bumpy mu bukungu bwa Malawi muri 2015
Economists in Malawi say the country is likely to continue facing financial challenges in 2015 unless the government can regain the confidence of donors, who are still withholding 40 percent of budgetary support due to the corruption scandal known as Cashgate. More than $30 million were looted from government coffers in the scandal, and several people, including government officials, were arrested.	Abashinzwe ubukungu muri Malawi bavuga ko iki gihugu gishobora gukomeza guhura n’ibibazo by’amafaranga mu mwaka wa 2015 keretse guverinoma ishobora kugarura ikizere cy’abaterankunga, bakaba bakomeje guhagarika 40% by’ingengo y’imari kubera ikibazo cya ruswa kizwi ku izina rya Cashgate. Amadolari arenga miliyoni 30 yasahuwe mu isanduku ya leta muri ayo mahano, maze abantu benshi barimo n'abayobozi ba leta barafatwa.
The withholding of donor aid has forced Malawi's government to pass what is known as the Zero Aid national budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year. Analysts, such as Abel Mwanyungwe, an economics lecturer at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, say the drop in spending has hurt the economy.	Guhagarika imfashanyo z'abaterankunga byatumye leta ya Malawi itora icyitwa ingengo y’imari ya Zero Aid mu mwaka w'ingengo y'imari wa 2014-2015. Abasesenguzi nka Abel Mwanyungwe, umwarimu w’ubukungu muri kaminuza ya Polytechnic ya kaminuza ya Malawi, bavuga ko igabanuka ry’amafaranga ryangije ubukungu.
"This has been a bumpy year as we are coming from the Cashgate effects that have quite a major dent on the economys performance. We have seen that in most cases the very delicate and crucial departments and service providers have been affected, in the sense that we dont have enough drugs in the hospitals. In schools, in terms of teachers payments is not in time," said Mwanyungwe.	Uyu ni umwaka utoroshye kuko tuvuye mu ngaruka za Cashgate zifite uruhare runini mu mikorere y'ubukungu. Twabonye ko akenshi usanga amashami yoroheje kandi akomeye ndetse n'abatanga serivisi byagize ingaruka, mu buryo bw'uko ntabwo dufite ibiyobyabwenge bihagije mu bitaro. Mu mashuri, mu bijyanye no kwishyura abarimu ntabwo ari igihe , Mwanyungwe.
Mwanyungwe also links Cashgate to the recent depreciation of Malawis currency, the kwacha, which has resulted in strikes by various government workers demanding higher pay.	Mwanyungwe ahuza kandi Cashgate no guta agaciro kw'ifaranga rya Malawis, kwacha, bikaba byaratumye imyigaragambyo y'abakozi ba leta basaba umushahara munini.
For example, support staff for the judiciary have been on strike for six weeks, seeking a 45 percent pay increase which the government says it cannot afford because it has no money.	Kurugero, abakozi bunganira ubucamanza bamaze ibyumweru bitandatu bigaragambyaga, basaba kongererwa umushahara 45% leta ivuga ko idashobora kwishyura kuko idafite amafaranga.
Workers at Malawi's Anti-Corruption Bureau went on strike demanding a 70 percent pay raise until the government threatened to forfeit their December salaries if they did not return.	Abakozi bo mu biro bishinzwe kurwanya ruswa muri Malawi bagiye mu myigaragambyo basaba kongererwa umushahara 70% kugeza igihe leta ibangamiye ko bazabura umushahara wabo mu Kuboza nibataha.
Mwanyungwe said the government can only avoid further strikes in 2015 if it makes efforts to restore donor confidence in the management of its public finances.	Mwanyungwe yavuze ko guverinoma ishobora kwirinda gusa imyigaragambyo mu 2015 mu gihe ishyira ingufu mu kugarura icyizere cy'abaterankunga mu micungire y’imari ya Leta.
"My fear is that if we dont have this donor confidence and donor support coming back to the economy, we may force the government to go into serious local borrowing that would lead to serious repercussions in terms of inflation, in terms of interest rates and this may have a sort of catch-catch lose situation," said Mwanyungwe.	Ubwoba bwanjye ni uko niba tudafite iki cyizere cy'abaterankunga ndetse n'inkunga y'abaterankunga igaruka mu bukungu, dushobora guhatira guverinoma kujya mu nguzanyo zikomeye zaho byavamo ingaruka zikomeye ku bijyanye n'ifaranga, ku bijyanye n'inyungu n'ibi hashobora kugira uburyo bwo gufata-gutakaza ibintu , Mwanyungwe.
The donors are, among other things, demanding that the government prosecute all those involved in the scandal and strengthen its financial management system.	Abaterankunga, mu bindi, basaba ko leta yakurikirana abantu bose bagize uruhare muri ayo mahano no gushimangira gahunda y’imicungire y’imari.
Newton Kambala, the president of the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the scandal rendered 2014 as "a very bad year for the business sector, because of huge debts that the government owes the private sector."	Newton Kambala, perezida w’ishyirahamwe ry’ubucuruzi n’inganda muri Malawi, yavuze ko aya mahano yatumye umwaka wa 2014 uba "umwaka mubi cyane ku bucuruzi, kubera imyenda nini leta ibereyemo abikorera."
He warned that if the situation persists, "2015 will be worse."	Yagabishije ko nibikomeza, "2015 bizaba bibi."
In his state of the nation address last Saturday, Malawi president Peter Mutharika said his government is doing everything possible to address the problems caused by the Cashgate scandal.	Ku wa gatandatu ushize, muri leta y’igihugu cye, Peter Mutharika, yavuze ko guverinoma ye ikora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo ikemure ibibazo byatewe n’urukozasoni rwa Cashgate.
"My government has strengthened the financial system to make sure that Cashgate never occurs again in Malawi. We have resourced fairly well the law enforcement institutions, including the Anti-Corruption Bureau, so that they do a thorough independent job, prosecute all suspects, and recover the stolen resources where possible," said Mutharika.	Guverinoma yanjye yashimangiye gahunda y’imari kugira ngo Cashgate itazongera kubaho muri Malawi. Twakiriye neza inzego zishinzwe kubahiriza amategeko, harimo na Biro ishinzwe kurwanya ruswa, kugira ngo bakore akazi kigenga, bakurikirane abakekwaho icyaha bose, kandi kugarura umutungo wibwe aho bishoboka, Mutharika.
Mutharika also said his government is implementing newly-adopted fiscal reforms that seek to grow the countrys economy by 5.5 percent in 2014, up from an estimated 5.0 percent in 2013.	Mutharika yavuze kandi ko guverinoma ye ishyira mu bikorwa ivugurura ry’imari ryashyizweho hagamijwe kuzamura ubukungu bw’igihugu ku gipimo cya 5.5 ku ijana muri 2014, kikaba kivuye ku kigereranyo cya 5.0% muri 2013.
	
Malawi to Conduct Door-to-Door HIV Testing	Malawi gukora Ikizamini cya virusi itera sida ku muryango
Malawians have mixed reactions to government plans to introduce door-to door HIV testing early next year. Supporters say the step is urgently needed because 100 Malawians get infected each day, and an average of 138 die from AIDS daily. Minister of Health Jean Kalirani announced the plans during the recent commemoration of World AIDS Day in the northern district of Karonga.	Abanya Malawiya batanze ibitekerezo kuri gahunda za leta zo kwipimisha ku nzu n'inzu mu ntangiriro z'umwaka utaha. Abashyigikiye bavuga ko iyi ntambwe ikenewe byihutirwa kubera ko Abanya Malawi 100 bandura buri munsi, kandi impuzandengo ya 138 bapfa bazize sida buri munsi. Minisitiri w’ubuzima Jean Kalirani yatangaje gahunda mu gihe cyo kwibuka umunsi mpuzamahanga wahariwe kurwanya SIDA mu karere ka Karonga gaherereye mu majyaruguru.
"We will go in the villages asking for blood samples to check whether that person is HIV positive or not. And those that will be found HIV positive will definitely be given the care they need. And those who are found negative will also be counseled so that they remain negative," said Kalirani.	Tuzajya mu midugudu dusaba amaraso kugira ngo tumenye niba uwo muntu afite virusi itera SIDA cyangwa niba atari bo. Kandi abazagaragara ko banduye virusi itera SIDA bazahabwa ubwitonzi bakeneye. Kandi abagaragaye ko ari babi na bo bazabigirwa inama. ko bakomeza kuba babi , Kalirani.
Kalirani said the campaign will start in mid-March and will aim to reach everyone in the country, including people who are far from health facilities that provide HIV testing and counseling services. She said the campaign is in line with the goal of ending HIV infection by 2030. Malawi's HIV infection rate is currently at 10 percent, a slight drop from three years ago.	Kalirani yavuze ko ubukangurambaga buzatangira hagati muri Werurwe kandi bugamije kugera kuri buri wese mu gihugu, harimo n'abantu bari kure y'ibigo nderabuzima bitanga serivisi zipimisha virusi itera SIDA. Yavuze ko ubukangurambaga bujyanye n'intego yo guhagarika ubwandu bwa virusi itera SIDA mu 2030. Muri iki gihe umubare w'ababana na virusi itera SIDA uri muri Malawi uri ku gipimo cya 10 ku ijana, ukaba wagabanutseho gato mu myaka itatu ishize.
The announcement has raised fears in some Malawians, such as Steven Jailosi, a primary school teacher in rural Blantyre, who feel the campaign will likely infringe upon peoples privacy.	Iri tangazo ryateje ubwoba bamwe mu Banya Malawi, nka Steven Jailosi, umwarimu w’ishuri ryibanze mu cyaro cya Blantyre, bumva ko ubukangurambaga bushobora guhungabanya ubuzima bwite bw’abaturage.
"I think it is not okay because they will be invading our privacy. HIV testing is supposed to be private. No one is supposed to know that I went for an HIV testing unless I make a choice to tell them," said Jailosi.	Jailosi ati: "Ntekereza ko atari byiza kuko bazinjira mu buzima bwacu. Kwipimisha virusi itera sida bigomba kuba byihariye. Nta muntu ugomba kumenya ko nagiye kwipimisha virusi itera sida keretse mpisemo kubabwira".
Ester Makonokaya, a secretary in Blantyre, said that although she has been tested already, she feels the door-to-door HIV testing will violate people's privacy.	Ester Makonokaya, umunyamabanga muri Blantyre, yavuze ko nubwo yamaze kwipimisha, yumva ko kwipimisha virusi itera sida ku nzu n'inzu bizahungabanya ubuzima bwite bw'abantu.
"Government should instead take the mobile clinics to the villages where people will be able to access them on their own rather than taking testing in their homes, because that might mean that some of the people who are not supposed to know other peoples status will know because, you know, when someone has been tested you show some reactions," said Makonokaya.	Guverinoma igomba ahubwo kujyana amavuriro agendanwa mu midugudu aho abantu bazashobora kuyageraho bonyine aho kwipimisha mu ngo zabo, kuko ibyo bivuze ko bamwe mu bantu batagomba kumenya uko abandi baturage bazabimenya. kuberako, urabizi, iyo umuntu yapimwe uba ugaragaje reaction zimwe , Makonokaya.
Macpherson Maulana, a journalist in Blantyre and a producer of radio programs on health, told VOA that government would do better to educate Malawians on the need for HIV testing so that people will go for tests on their own "without being pushed."	Macpherson Maulana, umunyamakuru muri Blantyre akaba na progaramu ya radiyo ku buzima, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko guverinoma izakora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo yigishe Abanya Malawi ko bakeneye kwipimisha virusi itera SIDA kugira ngo abantu bajye kwipimisha bonyine "badasunitswe."
"I fear it could end up into fights. You see it happened in Liberia recently where people who were coming to help people suspected to have contracted Ebola were even killed. So, civic education is the most important element for people to be encouraged to come out for testing voluntarily," said Maulana.	Ndatinya ko bishobora kurangira mu mirwano. Urabona ko byabereye muri Liberiya vuba aha aho abantu bari baje gufasha abantu bakekwaho kuba baranduye Ebola ndetse bakicwa. Rero, uburere mboneragihugu ni cyo kintu cy'ingenzi abantu bashishikarizwa kuza hanze yo kwipimisha ku bushake, Maulana.
However, HIV/AIDS counselor David Odali, whose NGO Umunthu Foundation runs HIV-related projects, insisted privacy will be protected.	Icyakora, umujyanama wa virusi itera SIDA, David Odali, umuryango utegamiye kuri Leta Umunthu Foundation ukora imishinga ijyanye na virusi itera SIDA, yashimangiye ko ubuzima bwite buzarindwa.
"Confidentiality will be upheld. Lets consider the household setup. I think the first thing would be to provide group counseling to members of that family. [Of course] people can be tested while others are watching, but when it comes to disclosing the results, a counselor is supposed to disclose that results to each and every individual separately," said Odali.	Amabanga azubahirizwa. Reka dusuzume uko urugo rumeze. Ntekereza ko ikintu cya mbere cyaba ari ugutanga inama mu matsinda ku bagize uwo muryango. [Birumvikana ko] abantu bashobora kwipimisha mu gihe abandi bareba, ariko mu gihe cyo gutangaza ibisubizo. , umujyanama agomba guhishura ibisubizo kuri buri muntu ku giti cye , Odali.
Odali said it will be up to the person who has been tested to disclose his or her status.	Odali yavuze ko umuntu uzapimwa azagaragaza uko ahagaze.
In 2006, the charity Development Aid from People to People conducted door-to-door HIV testing in the district of Thyolo and Blantyre, reaching 400,000 people. The organization says it worked well.	Mu mwaka wa 2006, imfashanyo ishinzwe iterambere ry’abantu kuva ku bantu kugeza ku bantu bakoze isuzuma ku nzu n'inzu mu karere ka Thyolo na Blantyre, bagera ku 400.000. Uyu muryango uvuga ko wakoze neza.
	
Water Crisis Raises Fears of Waterborne Disease in Malawi	Ikibazo cy’amazi gitera ubwoba bwindwara ziterwa n’amazi muri Malawi
Malawians in the country's commercial capital, Blantyre, usually rely on tap water. But for the past five months, the taps have often run dry, forcing residents to draw water from unprotected sources like rivers and wells, while work is being done at the city main pumping station.The risk of contracting water-borne diseases is rising.	Abanya Malawi mu murwa mukuru w’ubucuruzi w’igihugu, Blantyre, bashingira ku mazi meza. Ariko mu mezi atanu ashize, robine yakunze gukama, bigatuma abaturage bavoma amazi mu masoko adakingiwe nk'inzuzi n'amariba, mu gihe imirimo ikorerwa kuri sitasiyo nkuru yo mu mujyi. Ibyago byo kwandura indwara ziterwa n'amazi biriyongera.
In Blantyre and surrounding areas, residents have spent five days without tap water.	Muri Blantyre no mu turere tuyikikije, abaturage bamaranye iminsi itanu nta mazi meza.
Women, who by Malawi tradition are responsible for household tasks, complain of the risks they face when fetching water from rivers far from residential areas.	Abagore, bakurikije imigenzo ya Malawi bashinzwe imirimo yo murugo, binubira ingaruka bahura nazo mugihe bavoma amazi mumigezi kure yabatuye.
Rhoda Milanzi, a housewife and mother of three, tells VOA the journeys through bushy footpaths are risky. "We wake up every day 2 a.m., sometimes 1 a.m., to go and collect water. There are so many risks. You see, sometimes we would meet witches, snakes on the way," she says, "even hyenas have been chasing us."	Rhoda Milanzi, umugore wo murugo akaba na nyina wabana batatu, abwira IJWI ingendo zinyura mumihanda y'ibihuru ishobora guteza akaga. Agira ati: "Turabyuka buri munsi saa mbiri za mu gitondo, rimwe na rimwe mu gitondo, kugira ngo tujye gukusanya amazi. Hariho ingaruka nyinshi. Urabona, rimwe na rimwe twahuraga n'abapfumu, inzoka mu nzira", ndetse n'impyisi zagiye zidukurikirana. . "
Milanzi says to ease the burden of carrying water home for bathing, women prefer to bathe in the river. But she says they have been disturbed by youths who hide in the nearby bush.	Milanzi avuga ko koroshya umutwaro wo gutwara amazi murugo rwo kwiyuhagira, abagore bahitamo kwiyuhagira muruzi. Ariko avuga ko bahungabanijwe n’urubyiruko rwihishe mu gihuru kiri hafi.
"These youths of today would come there and hide somewhere to see us naked. This has been a major embarrassment. In fact we complained to the chiefs about it.	Uru rubyiruko rwo muri iki gihe rwazaga hariya rwihisha kugira ngo rutubone twambaye ubusa. Ibi byabaye isoni zikomeye. Mubyukuri twaritotombeye abatware. Bahannye bamwe muri bo, ariko uzi ko rimwe na rimwe bazamuka ibiti kugira ngo barebe abagore bakuze nkatwe. 
The water problem also has affected the delivery of health services.	Ikibazo cy’amazi nacyo cyagize ingaruka ku itangwa rya serivisi z'ubuzima.
Three weeks ago, authorities at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre confirmed that they had suspended surgical operations due to water scarcity.	Ibyumweru bitatu bishize, abayobozi mu bitaro bikuru by’umwamikazi Elizabeth i Blantyre bemeje ko bahagaritse ibikorwa byo kubaga kubera kubura amazi.
Health rights campaigners warn of the possible outbreak of waterborne diseases, especially in densely populated areas, if the situation is left unresolved.	Abaharanira uburenganzira bw’ubuzima baraburira ko hashobora kubaho indwara ziterwa n’amazi, cyane cyane mu turere dutuwe cyane, niba ikibazo kidakemutse.
Officials at the Blantyre Water Board attribute the problem largely to an ongoing European Union-funded project that seeks to install new pumping machines at Walkers Ferry, the main pumping station. Priscilla Mateyu, the spokesperson for the Blantyre Water Board, says the project is expected to increase water production capacity to 105,000 cubic meters per day from the current daily production of 78,000 cubic meters.	Abayobozi mu kigo cy’amazi cya Blantyre bavuga ko iki kibazo ahanini cyatewe n’umushinga uterwa inkunga n’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi ushaka gushyira imashini nshya zo kuvoma kuri Walkers Ferry, sitasiyo nkuru yo kuvoma. Priscilla Mateyu, umuvugizi w’ikigo cy’amazi cya Blantyre, avuga ko umushinga uteganijwe kongera ingufu z’amazi kugera kuri metero kibe 105.000 ku munsi uhereye ku musaruro wa buri munsi wa metero 78.000.
"January is when the project is finishing. But for the new machines and everything else to start working properly, we have to wait until March [2015]. That's when we expect the levels would increase and also production capacity improving to least what we expect it to be," Mateyu said.	Mutarama ni bwo umushinga urangiye. Ariko kugira ngo imashini nshya n'ibindi byose bitangire gukora neza, tugomba gutegereza kugeza muri Werurwe [2015]. Nibwo twizeye ko urwego rwiyongera kandi n'ubushobozi bwo kongera umusaruro bugera ku byo dutegereje bigomba kuba, Mateyu ati.
The local consumer rights watchdog, the Consumers Association of Malawi, had been planning to hold vigils at the water board until the water supply was normalized, but the board asked protesters to hold off, promising to distribute water to residents through mobile water tanks. The consumer rights group has given the water board two weeks to fulfill its commitment before proceeding with the protests.	Ishyirahamwe ry’uburenganzira bw’umuguzi ryaho, Ishyirahamwe ry’abaguzi muri Malawi, ryateganyaga gukomeza kuba maso ku kibaho cy’amazi kugeza igihe amazi azaba asanzwe, ariko inama y'ubutegetsi yasabye abigaragambyaga guhagarika, basezeranya guha abaturage amazi binyuze mu bigega by’amazi. Ihuriro ry’uburenganzira bw’umuguzi ryahaye akanama k’amazi ibyumweru bibiri kugirango ryuzuze ibyo ryiyemeje mbere yo gukomeza imyigaragambyo.
	
Malawi President Under Fire for Giving Money to Journalists	Perezida wa Malawi uri mu muriro kubera guha amafaranga abanyamakuru
Malawi President Peter Mutharika is under fire for giving envelopes containing $125 to more than 80 media people at a dinner he hosted last month in Blantyre. The editor of the privately owned Times Television said reporters were told the envelopes contained the presidents plans for the media - which has been critical of the governments economic performance.	Perezida wa Malawi, Peter Mutharika, arashinjwa gutanga amabahasha arimo amadolari 125 ku banyamakuru barenga 80 mu birori yakiriye i Blantyre. Umuyobozi w'ikinyamakuru Times Televiziyo yigenga yavuze ko abanyamakuru babwiwe ko mu ibahasha irimo gahunda za ba perezida ku itangazamakuru - ryanenze imikorere ya guverinoma.
In his column published in Malawis Sunday Times newspaper, editor Grecian Tukula said he was not sure why the money was given to journalists at the state dinner.	Mu nkingi ye yasohotse mu kinyamakuru Malawis Sunday Times, umwanditsi Grecian Tukula yavuze ko atazi neza impamvu ayo mafaranga yahawe abanyamakuru mu ifunguro rya Leta.
Tukula said he initially decided to return the money but reversed the decision to avoid "creating a scene."	Tukula yavuze ko yabanje gufata icyemezo cyo gusubiza amafaranga ariko ahindura icyemezo cyo kwirinda "gukora ibintu."
But the editor for the Weekend Nation newspaper, George Kasakula, told VOA that he returned the money right away.	Ariko umwanditsi w'ikinyamakuru Weekend Nation, George Kasakula, yabwiye VOA ko yahise asubiza amafaranga.
"I just felt it was not right for me to receive the money, so I returned it. My understanding is that if someone invites me to a workshop, its their duty to ensure that they feed me, they accommodate me and they transport me. But in this case, I didnt see why I should get that allowance because I didnt spend anything to go to Sanjika [Palace]," said Kasakula.	Gusa numvaga bidakwiriye ko nakira ayo mafaranga, nuko ndayasubiza. Ndumva ko niba umuntu antumiye mu mahugurwa, inshingano zabo zo kureba ko bampa, baranyakira kandi barantwara. Ariko muri uru rubanza, sinigeze mbona impamvu nkwiye kubona ayo mafaranga kubera ko ntacyo nakoresheje ngo njya i Sanjika [Ingoro] , Kasakula.
The issue has attracted more public attention after privately owned Capital Radio aired a story questioning the meaning of the cash handouts from the president.	Iki kibazo cyashimishije abantu benshi nyuma y’uko abikorera ku giti cyabo Radio Radio yerekanaga inkuru ibaza icyo amafaranga yatanzwe na perezida.
"As Capital FM we serve the interest of the public. This issue has been all over the social media, and even we as a media are implicated [we believe] it is paramount that we follow up and get to the bottom of the matter," said Steven Dakalira, the head of news and current affairs at Capital Radio.	Nka Capital FM dukorera inyungu za rubanda. Iki kibazo cyabaye ku mbuga nkoranyambaga, ndetse natwe nk'itangazamakuru tubigiramo uruhare [twizera ko ari ngombwa ko dukurikirana kandi tukagera ku kibazo, "ibi bikaba byavuzwe na Steven Dakalira, ukuriye amakuru n'ibikorwa muri iki gihe kuri Radiyo Nkuru.
In his column in the Nyasa Times, Malawi professor of law Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa said what President Mutharika did by giving money handouts to journalists at a news event was tantamount to bribery. He has called on Mutharika to resign or face impeachment proceedings.	Mu nkingi ye mu kinyamakuru Nyasa Times, umwarimu w’amategeko muri Malawi, Danwood Mzikenge Chirwa, yavuze ko ibyo Perezida Mutharika yakoze mu gutanga amafaranga ku banyamakuru mu birori by’amakuru byari bihwanye na ruswa. Yahamagariye Mutharika kwegura cyangwa gukurikiranwa mu nkiko.
Local civil society groups said that "by attempting to bribe the journalists" Mutharika subjected his leadership style to disrepute.	Imiryango itegamiye kuri leta yavuze ko "mu gushaka guha ruswa abanyamakuru" Mutharika yakoresheje uburyo bwe bwo kuyobora.
Meanwhile, some journalists are donating the money to charity.	Hagati aho, bamwe mu banyamakuru batanga amafaranga mu gufasha.
Brian Ligomeka, the Managing Editor for the Times Group, told Times Television that all four employees there have donated the money to an orphanage.	Umuyobozi mukuru w'ikinyamakuru Times Group, Brian Ligomeka, yatangarije Televiziyo ya Times ko abakozi bose uko ari bane batanze amafaranga mu kigo cy'imfubyi.
"At first we decided to return the money to the president but we later thought it wise to buy assorted items like sugar, salt, notebooks and donate it to needy children," said Ligomeka.	Ligomeka ati: "Twabanje gufata icyemezo cyo gusubiza amafaranga perezida ariko nyuma twatekereje ko ari byiza kugura ibintu bitandukanye nk'isukari, umunyu, amakaye maze tukabiha abana batishoboye".
In his latest Sunday Times column, Raphael Tenthani, who also writes for BBC, apologized on behalf of other journalists "for letting down the public that trust journalists unreservedly."	Mu kinyamakuru Sunday Times aheruka gusohora, Raphael Tenthani, nawe wandika kuri BBC, yasabye imbabazi mu izina ry'abandi banyamakuru "kubera ko yaretse rubanda yizera abanyamakuru bidasubirwaho."
Tenthani has since donated the money for charity work and said that although the journalists could have done better if they returned the money right away, doing so would have been perceived as disrespect to the head of state.	Kuva icyo gihe Tenthani yatanze amafaranga mu bikorwa by'urukundo avuga ko nubwo abanyamakuru bashoboraga gukora neza baramutse basubije amafaranga ako kanya, kubikora byari gufatwa nko gusuzugura umukuru w'igihugu.
Maclan Kanyangwa, who heads the Department of Journalism and Media Studies at the Polytechnic College of the University of Malawi, said a media code of ethics bars journalists from accepting payment on a story.	Maclan Kanyangwa uyobora ishami ry’itangazamakuru n’ubushakashatsi mu itangazamakuru muri kaminuza ya Polytechnic ya kaminuza ya Malawi, yavuze ko amategeko agenga imyitwarire ibuza abanyamakuru kwakira ubwishyu ku nkuru.
"Obviously the meeting at the palace was the newsworthy event. There was a possibility that something was going to be published. And in the event that this payment would have influenced journalist decision [on news judgment], then that becomes a problem," said Kanyangwa.	Ati: "Biragaragara ko inama yabereye ibwami yari igikorwa cyo gutangaza amakuru. Byashobokaga ko hari ikintu kigiye gutangazwa. Kandi mu gihe aya mafaranga yari kugira uruhare mu cyemezo cy'abanyamakuru [ku rubanza rw'amakuru], noneho biba ikibazo." Kanyangwa.
Kanyangwa said he feels many journalists failed to return the money immediately because they might have been out of their ethical senses when they got the money.	Kanyangwa yavuze ko yumva abanyamakuru benshi bananiwe gusubiza amafaranga ako kanya kuko bashobora kuba baravuye mu myitwarire yabo igihe babonye amafaranga.
Efforts to talk to Presidential Press Officer Fredrick Ndala were not successful. But some government authorities say the payment was not a bribe but meant for a fuel refund to those who attended the night event.	Imbaraga zo kuvugana n’umuyobozi ushinzwe itangazamakuru rya Perezida Fredrick Ndala ntizagenze neza. Ariko bamwe mu bayobozi ba leta bavuga ko kwishyura atari ruswa ahubwo ko byari bigamije gusubizwa lisansi abitabiriye ibirori bya nijoro.
	
Report: Manufacturing Could Free Poorest Nations From Poverty	Raporo: Inganda zishobora kuvana ibihugu bikennye mubukene
A new United Nations report urges the poorest countries in the world to shift from low- to high-productivity activities to improve their economies.	Raporo nshya y’umuryango w’abibumbye irasaba ibihugu bikennye cyane ku isi kuva mu bikorwa bito bikagera ku musaruro mwinshi kugira ngo ubukungu bwiyongere.
In its annual Least Developed Countries Report, UNCTAD — the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development — says these countries must structurally transform their economies to free themselves from the "poverty trap," which is stunting economic growth and development.	Muri raporo y’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane cyane, UNCTAD - Inama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ishinzwe ubucuruzi n’iterambere - ivuga ko ibyo bihugu bigomba guhindura imiterere y’ubukungu kugira ngo bikure mu "mutego w’ubukene," bidindiza iterambere ry’ubukungu n’iterambere.
Of the 48 nations the U.N. considers "Least Developed Countries" (LDCs), only one, Laos, is on track to achieve all seven of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) by 2015.	Mu bihugu 48 Umuryango w'abibumbye ufata "Ibihugu byateye imbere cyane" (LDCs), kimwe gusa, Laos, kiri mu nzira zo kugera ku ntego zirindwi z'ikinyagihumbi (MDG) muri 2015.
Only four African countries — Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda — are likely to meet a majority of these targets.	Ibihugu bine bya Afurika gusa - Etiyopiya, Malawi, u Rwanda na Uganda - birashoboka ko byujuje ibyinshi muri byo.
This assessment is particularly grim in light of the even greater challenges awaiting these countries in the coming years. The MDGs set a goal for nations to halve their poverty levels by 2015. The so-called Sustainable Development Goals, which carry on from where the MDGs leave off, call for eradication of poverty by 2030.	Iri suzuma rirakaze cyane bitewe n’ibibazo bikomeye bitegereje ibi bihugu mu myaka iri imbere. MDGs yihaye intego ibihugu kugabanya ubukene bw’ubukene bitarenze 2015. Icyiswe intego z’iterambere rirambye, kiva aho MDGs ziva, zirahamagarira guca ubukene mu 2030.
According to Taffere Tesfachew, an UNCTAD official who works with African nations, it would be nothing short of a miracle for the LDCs to pull this off.	Nk’uko byatangajwe na Taffere Tesfachew, umuyobozi wa UNCTAD ukorana n'ibihugu by'Afurika, nta kintu na kimwe cyaba ari igitangaza kuri LDCs kubikuramo.
In order for the least developed countries to achieve this miraculous performance, he says they will need to structurally change their economies.	Kugirango ibihugu bidateye imbere bigere kuri iyi mikorere yigitangaza, avuga ko bizakenera guhindura imiterere yubukungu.
He tells VOA this means shifting labor from activities with low productivity, such as small-scale agriculture and services to more dynamic activities with higher productivity, such as manufacturing and high-value services.	Abwira IJWI ibi bivuze guhindura imirimo mu bikorwa bifite umusaruro muke, nk'ubuhinzi buciriritse na serivisi ku bikorwa byinshi bifite umusaruro mwinshi, nko gukora na serivisi zifite agaciro kanini.
"Countries that have moved up are the ones that are creating opportunities for those that are leaving agriculture to engage in things where they add value, where they get training and as it happens, manufacturing tends to have that sort of feature, that is why this call for manufacturing," he said. "Countries that are using policies to shift and influence capital and labor to move into this activity sector tend to do better."	Ibihugu byazamutse ni byo bitanga amahirwe ku bava mu buhinzi kwishora mu bintu bongerera agaciro, aho bakura amahugurwa kandi uko bigenda, inganda zikunda kugira ibintu nk'ibyo, niyo mpamvu ibi guhamagarira gukora . "Ibihugu bikoresha politiki mu guhindura no guhindura igishoro n'umurimo kugira ngo byinjire muri uru rwego rw'ibikorwa usanga bikora neza."
Tesfachew says these high-productivity sectors tend to pay higher wages and create a demand for goods. This, he says, encourages investment.	Tesfachew avuga ko izo nzego zitanga umusaruro mwinshi zikunda kwishyura umushahara munini kandi bigatuma ibicuruzwa bikenerwa. Avuga ko ibi bitera inkunga ishoramari.
On the surface, it appears that the LDCs are not doing badly. UNCTAD economic data show growth in these poor countries between 2002 and 2008 exceeded the seven percent target set by the international community. And, even after the 2008 financial crisis, UNCTAD notes the LDCs grew faster than other developing countries, at an average of 5.7 percent per year.	Ku isura, bigaragara ko LDC idakora nabi. Amakuru y’ubukungu ya UNCTAD yerekana iterambere muri ibi bihugu bikennye hagati ya 2002 na 2008 yarenze intego irindwi ku ijana yashyizweho n’umuryango mpuzamahanga. Kandi, na nyuma y’ibibazo by’amafaranga yo mu 2008, UNCTAD ivuga ko LDC yazamutse vuba kurusha ibindi bihugu bikiri mu nzira y'amajyambere, ku kigereranyo cya 5.7 ku ijana ku mwaka.
But U.N. economists say the outlook for the least developed countries in the short and medium term remains uncertain. They say increasing peoples productivity is the best way to break the patter of human and economic underdevelopment that continues to entrap them in poverty.	Ariko abahanga mu bukungu bo muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika bavuga ko icyerekezo cy’ibihugu bitaratera imbere mu gihe gito kandi giciriritse bikomeje kutamenyekana. Bavuga ko kongera umusaruro w’abaturage aribwo buryo bwiza bwo guca intege iterambere ry’abantu n’ubukungu bikomeje kubashora mu bukene.
	
UN: Most African Nations to Miss 2015 MDG Goals	Loni: Ibihugu byinshi bya Afrika ntibizagera  ku ntego za MDG 2015
Most African countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015 because of the gap between economic and human development. That is one of the conclusions in this years annual U.N. report on the Least Developed Countries, presented Thursday.	Ibihugu byinshi bya Afrika ntibizagera ku ntego z'ikinyagihumbi zashyizweho muri 2015 kubera itandukaniro riri hagati y’ubukungu n’iterambere ry’abantu. Uyu ni umwe mu myanzuro muri iyi myaka ya buri mwaka raporo y’umuryango w’abibumbye ku bihugu byateye imbere cyane, byatanzwe ku wa kane.
Junior Davis, U.N. economic affairs officer for Africa, said African countries have not been able to translate their economic growth into structural transformation.	Junior Davis, ushinzwe ibibazo by’ubukungu muri Amerika muri Afurika, yavuze ko ibihugu bya Afurika bitashoboye guhindura ubukungu bwabyo mu guhindura imiterere.
"We think that is the case because these countries have not focused efficiently on building what we call their productive capacities," Davis said. "These are the basic human and economic development capacities that are needed to promote sustainable economic development. And the MDG, as they were constructed, largely ignored the need to develop the productive capacities."	Davis yagize ati: "Turatekereza ko aribyo kuko ibyo bihugu bitibanze cyane ku kubaka icyo twita ubushobozi bwabo bwo gutanga umusaruro". "Ubu ni bwo bushobozi bw’ibanze bw’iterambere ry’abantu n’ubukungu bukenewe kugira ngo iterambere ry’ubukungu rirambye. Kandi MDG, uko yubatswe, yirengagije ko ari ngombwa guteza imbere ubushobozi butanga umusaruro."
Slow progress	Buhoro buhoro
African countries also are not on course to halve poverty by 2015, and their overall progress on reducing hunger is relatively slow. Poverty limits human development and undermines productivity. And economic development is needed to make gains in human development.	Ibihugu bya Afurika nabyo ntabwo biri mu nzira yo kugabanya ubukene bitarenze 2015, kandi iterambere ryabo muri rusange mu kugabanya inzara biratinda. Ubukene bugabanya iterambere ryabantu kandi bigabanya umusaruro. Kandi iterambere ryubukungu rirakenewe kugirango umuntu yunguke iterambere ryabantu.
Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi are the only African countries on track to reach the majority of the development goals. They are making progress because they heavily invested in areas that create sustainable development such as infrastructure, health and education.	Etiyopiya, u Rwanda, Uganda na Malawi nicyo gihugu cyonyine cya Afurika kiri mu nzira yo kugera ku ntego nyinshi z’iterambere. Barimo gutera imbere kuko bashora imari mubice bitera iterambere rirambye nkibikorwa remezo, ubuzima nuburezi.
The post-2015 development agenda for fragile countries where governance remains an issue — such as South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo — will still largely depend on support from the international community to achieve social and economic development, Davis said.	Davis yavuze ko gahunda y’iterambere ry’inyuma ya 2015 ku bihugu byoroshye aho imiyoborere ikomeje kuba ikibazo - nka Sudani y'Amajyepfo na Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo - bizaterwa ahanini n’inkunga n’umuryango mpuzamahanga kugira ngo iterambere ry’imibereho n’ubukungu ryiyongere.
Improvements in rural development, industrial productivity, agriculture and the services sectors in these countries will require "ways in which we can have a pattern of growth which is not just sustainable but jobs-rich," Davis said. "Because we see the growth in jobs and employment is central to any development strategy that aims to reduce poverty in a sustainable way."	Davis yagize ati: "Gutezimbere mu cyaro, umusaruro w’inganda, ubuhinzi n’inzego za serivisi muri ibi bihugu bizakenera" inzira dushobora kugira uburyo bwo kuzamuka butarambye gusa ahubwo bukungahaye ku mirimo. " "Kubera ko tubona iterambere ry'imirimo n'akazi ari ingenzi mu ngamba zose z'iterambere zigamije kugabanya ubukene mu buryo burambye."
A country is placed on the Least Developed Countries list based on its per capita income, economic vulnerability, and human development indicators such as health and nutrition.	Igihugu gishyizwe ku rutonde rw’ibihugu byateye imbere cyane hashingiwe ku musaruro w’umuturage, ubukungu bwifashe nabi, hamwe n’ibipimo by’iterambere ry’abantu nk’ubuzima n’imirire.
Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 34 are in Africa. Three countries have graduated from their least developed status: Botswana, Cape Verde and Samoa.	Mu bihugu 48 bidateye imbere ku isi, 34 biri muri Afurika. Ibihugu bigaragara ko byateye imbere cyane: Botswana, Cape Verde na Samoa.
	
Strike Paralyzes Malawi's Judicial Services	Strike Paralyzes ishinzwe Serivisi z'ubutabera za Malawi
A week-long strike by the support staff of Malawi's judiciary system has paralyzed the courts, causing overcrowding in police cells and the indefinite suspension of major cases - including government corruption trials. Court marshals, clerks and messengers are demanding the 30 percent salary increases promised by the government two years ago.	Hashize icyumweru cyose abakozi bunganira inzego z'ubutabera za Malawi cyahagaritse inkiko, bituma ubucucike bw’abapolisi bwiyongera ndetse n’ihagarikwa ry’agateganyo mu manza zikomeye - harimo n’imanza za ruswa. Abashinzwe inkiko, abanditsi n’intumwa barasaba kongererwa umushahara 30% byasezeranijwe na guverinoma mu myaka ibiri ishize.
Chanting and singing around the court premises has become a pastime activity for the striking court workers since the onset of a sit-in last week. Linley Hebert, a spokesperson for the striking workers, told VOA the strike is a result of the governments failure to honor a 2012 agreement.	kuririmba hirya no hino mu rukiko byahindutse igikorwa cyo kwidagadura ku bakozi bigaragambyaga kuva icyumweru cyatangira. Linley Hebert, umuvugizi w’abakozi bigaragambyaga, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko iyi myigaragambyo ari ukubera ko guverinoma itubahirije amasezerano ya 2012.
"In October [this year], the government reviewed the salaries of the civil servants, but we were not included in that revision," Hebert said.	Hebert yagize ati: "Mu Kwakira [uyu mwaka], guverinoma yasuzumye imishahara y'abakozi ba Leta, ariko ntitwashyizwe muri iryo vugurura."
"Yet in 2012, we had an agreement that each time they are revising the salaries of the civil servants, [they will be increasing our salaries as well].	Nyamara muri 2012, twagiranye amasezerano ko igihe cyose barimo kuvugurura imishahara y'abakozi ba Leta, [bazongera umushahara]. Rero, [nyuma yo kubahiriza ayo masezerano mu 2013], twatunguwe no kubona ko iki gihe dusigaye. Abayobozi ba leta bavuga ko kutongera umushahara w'abakozi bo mu bucamanza muri uyu mwaka ahanini biterwa n'ubukungu buke, nyuma yo guhagarika inkunga y'abaterankunga. kurwanya leta ya Malawi.
The freeze is a result of a government financial scandal in which more than $30 million was looted from government coffers. Ministry of Finance spokesperson Nations Msowoya told a local radio station it is hard for the government to meet the workers' demand.	Ihagarikwa ni igisubizo cy’amafaranga ya leta aho yasahuye miliyoni zisaga 30 z’amadolari mu isanduku ya leta. Umuvugizi wa Minisiteri y’Imari, Msowoya, yatangarije radiyo yaho ko bigoye guverinoma isaba abakozi.
"It is difficult to promise what the treasury will do. But suffice to say that the prevailing economic circumstances and budgetary constraints will make a little bit difficult for the treasury to bow down to the demands," "Msowoya said.	Msowoya ati: "Biragoye gusezeranya icyo ikigega kizakora. Ariko birahagije kuvuga ko ubukungu bwiganje ndetse n'imbogamizi z’ingengo y’imari bizagora gato ko ikigega cyunama ku byifuzo."
But according to Hebert, the strikers will not resume work until their demands are met. "Since I was born [there has been] no time the government said it had some money.	Ariko nk'uko Hebert abitangaza ngo ba rutahizamu ntibazongera imirimo kugeza igihe ibyo basabye bituzuye. "Kuva navuka [nta gihe] guverinoma yavuze ko ifite amafaranga.
It has its own means [of finding the money] and it will find the same means to give us the money," Hebert insisted. The ongoing strike is hampering progress of trials, as court operations remain suspended.	Ifite uburyo bwayo [bwo gushaka amafaranga] kandi izabona uburyo bumwe bwo kuduha ayo mafaranga ", Hebert yashimangiye.
Several trials, including that of former justice minister Ralph Kasambara, who is answering charges in connection with the financial scandal, were indefinitely suspended last week.	Mu cyumweru gishize, imanza nyinshi, harimo n'uwahoze ari minisitiri w’ubutabera, Ralph Kasambara, usubiza ibirego bijyanye n’ikibazo cy’amafaranga, yahagaritswe burundu mu cyumweru gishize.
Police are complaining of congestion in jail cells, as no suspects are being taken to court.	Polisi yinubira ubwinshi bw’imfungwa za gereza, kubera ko nta bakekwa bajyanwa mu rukiko.
Malawi police spokesperson Rhoda Manjolo told VOA the only option they have is "giving police bail to those with minor offenses." Human rights campaigners and legal experts say the strike is contributing to human rights violations.	Umuvugizi wa polisi muri Malawi, Rhoda Manjolo, yatangarije Ijwi rya Amerika ko inzira imwe bafite ari "guha ingwate abapolisi bafite ibyaha byoroheje." Abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu n'inzobere mu by'amategeko bavuga ko iyi myigaragambyo igira uruhare mu ihohoterwa ry'uburenganzira bwa muntu.
"There are those people who have to be taken to court within 48 hours," noted Lawyer George Kadzipatike who works in a private practice in the northern city of Mzuzu. "We cannot make application for them to be granted bail.	Umunyamategeko George Kadzipatike ukora mu mwiherero mu mujyi wa Mzuzu uherereye mu majyaruguru yagize ati: "Hariho abo bantu bagomba kujyanwa mu rukiko mu masaha 48". "Ntidushobora gusaba ko bahabwa ingwate.
There are those people who do not want to live with their partners, they would like the court to decree that they be divorced, we cannot file any petition through the courts."	Hariho abo bantu badashaka kubana na bagenzi babo, bifuza ko urukiko rwemeza ko batana, ntidushobora gutanga ikirego binyuze mu nkiko. "
Government authorities say closed door negotiations to resolve the matter continue in the capital, Lilongwe. But the striking workers told VOA whatever the case, they will accept nothing short of a 30 percent increase in their salaries.	Abayobozi ba leta bavuga ko imishyikirano ihagaze kugira ngo iki kibazo ikemuke mu murwa mukuru, Lilongwe. Ariko abakozi bigaragambyaga babwiye VOA uko byagenda kose, nta kintu na kimwe bazemera ko umushahara wabo wiyongera 30%.
A similar strike lasted three months in 2012 after the magistrates and judges joined the labor action.	Imyigaragambyo nk'iyi yamaze amezi atatu muri 2012 nyuma yuko abacamanza bitabiriye umurimo.
	
Famine in Southern Africa Worse Than Predicted - 2002-07-24	Inzara muri Afrika yepfo Ikibi Kurenza Ibyahanuwe - 2002-07-24
The United Nations World Food Program says the famine in southern Africa is even worse than predicted. WFP officials are warning that 13 million people in six countries: Malawi, Zambia, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique are in danger of starvation if they do not get food aid.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku biribwa rivuga ko inzara muri Afurika y'Epfo ikabije kuruta uko byari byavuzwe. Abayobozi ba WFP baraburira ko abantu miliyoni 13 mu bihugu bitandatu: Malawi, Zambiya, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Swaziland na Mozambique bafite ibyago byo kwicwa n'inzara nibatabona ubufasha bw'ibiribwa.
World Food Program officials say they need one million tons of food to alleviate hunger in southern Africa, but they are not confident they will get it. In an appeal to the international community at the beginning of July, WFP officials asked for more than $0.5 billion to buy food. So far they have received only 20 percent of that. WFP's director for the southern Africa region, Judith Lewis, says the situation is getting desperate. "The window of opportunity to avert what could be a major humanitarian crisis is closing," she said. "We need more assistance now. We need food on the high seas now, or we need cash to buy commodities that are still available in southern Africa, so we can avert this major, major crisis."	Abayobozi ba gahunda y’ibiribwa ku isi bavuga ko bakeneye toni miliyoni y’ibiribwa kugira ngo bagabanye inzara muri Afurika yepfo, ariko ntibizeye ko bazayibona. Mu cyifuzo cy’umuryango mpuzamahanga mu ntangiriro za Nyakanga, abayobozi ba WFP basabye amadolari arenga 0.5 yo kugura ibiryo. Kugeza ubu bakiriye 20 ku ijana gusa. Umuyobozi wa WFP mu karere ka Afurika y'Epfo, Judith Lewis, avuga ko ibintu bimeze nabi. Ati: "Idirishya ry'amahirwe yo gukumira icyaba ikibazo gikomeye cy’ubutabazi kirarangiye". "Ubu dukeneye ubufasha bwinshi. Dukeneye ibiryo ku nyanja ndende ubu, cyangwa dukeneye amafaranga yo kugura ibicuruzwa bikiboneka muri Afurika y'Epfo, bityo dushobora gukumira iki kibazo gikomeye kandi gikomeye."
Currently, the WFP is assisting six million of the most vulnerable people in the six most severely affected countries. About half of these people are in Zimbabwe. The agency says it is sure the number of people needing its help will rise.	Kugeza ubu, WFP ifasha miliyoni esheshatu z’abatishoboye kurusha abandi mu bihugu bitandatu byibasiwe cyane. Hafi ya kimwe cya kabiri cyaba bantu bari muri Zimbabwe. Ikigo kivuga ko cyizeye neza ko umubare w'abantu bakeneye ubufasha bwacyo uziyongera.
The World Health Organization notes southern Africa, in addition to having the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, also has the world's highest chronic malnutrition rates. It predicts about 300,000 people could die over the next six months from diseases related to malnutrition.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima rivuga ko Afurika y'Epfo, usibye kuba yanduye virusi itera SIDA ku isi, ifite kandi imirire mibi idakira ku isi. Ivuga ko abantu bagera ku 300.000 bashobora gupfa mu mezi atandatu ari imbere bazize indwara ziterwa n'imirire mibi.
Ms. Lewis says the dying has already begun. "We are seeing people moving from their villages," she said. "If they know there is going to be a food distribution, they immediately go there. The problem is we do not even have enough food to feed the people who are on the rolls, let alone add food for other people in the areas. Is there a potential to become chaotic? Yes. "	Madamu Lewis avuga ko gupfa byatangiye. Ati: "Turimo kubona abantu bimuka mu midugudu yabo." "Niba bazi ko hazabaho kugabura ibiryo, bahita bajyayo. Ikibazo nuko tutagira n'ibiryo bihagije byo kugaburira abantu bari kuri lisiti, tutibagiwe no kongeramo ibiryo kubandi bantu bo muri utwo turere. hari amahirwe yo kuba akajagari? Yego.
WFP'S Judith Lewis says at this time of year the agency is usually planning how to get food supplies into the region before the rainy season hits in October. But she says since the WFP is already having difficulty meeting its present targets, it can't even begin to plan for future food deliveries.	WFP'S Judith Lewis avuga ko muri iki gihe cy'umwaka ubusanzwe iki kigo giteganya uburyo bwo kwinjiza ibiribwa mu karere mbere yuko ibihe by'imvura bitangira mu Kwakira. Ariko avuga ko kubera ko WFP isanzwe ifite ikibazo cyo kugera ku ntego zayo ubu, ntishobora no gutangira gutegura ibiribwa bizaza.

The organization, Eye of the Child, is expressing concern about what is says is a large number of children who are being forced to work due to poverty.	Uyu muryango, Ijisho ry'umwana, urimo kwerekana ko uhangayikishijwe n'ibivugwa ko ari umubare munini w'abana bahatirwa gukora kubera ubukene.
It says these children risk being abused.	Ivuga ko aba bana bashobora guhohoterwa.
Some under aged children work as mini – bus call boys in the busy business district of Limbe in the commercial capital, Blantyre. They are some of the many children who have been forced into employment because of poverty.	Bamwe bari munsi yabana bakuze bakora nka mini - bisi ihamagarira abahungu mukarere gafite ubucuruzi bwa Limbe mumurwa mukuru wubucuruzi, Blantyre. Ni bamwe mu bana benshi bahatiwe akazi kubera ubukene.
Maxwell Matewere is the executive director of Eye of the Child. He says many of the children come from rural areas. He says, "Currently we havent done a data analysis but the Ministry of Labor intends to do that as soon as possible with financial resources from the International Labor Organization.	Maxwell Matewere ni umuyobozi mukuru w'ijisho ry'umwana. Avuga ko benshi mu bana baturuka mu cyaro. Agira ati: "Kugeza ubu ntabwo twakoze isesengura ry'amakuru ariko Minisiteri y'umurimo irateganya kubikora vuba bishoboka hamwe n'amafaranga aturuka mu Muryango mpuzamahanga.
But basing on our own assessment and through our works, we feel child labor is a serious problem particularly in the rural areas and you can tell that from trafficking of children from rural areas to urban areas where most of the young people are working in peoples houses.	Ariko dushingiye ku isuzuma ryacu bwite kandi binyuze mu mirimo yacu, twumva imirimo mibi ikoreshwa abana ari ikibazo gikomeye cyane cyane mu cyaro kandi urashobora kubabwira ko kuva kugurisha abana kuva mucyaro kugera mu mijyi aho usanga urubyiruko rwinshi rukorera mumazu yabantu. .
" Mr. Matewere says poor children often find work on large farm estates.	Bwana Matewere avuga ko abana bakennye bakunze kubona akazi mu mirima minini. 
He said, "We have noticed that there are some indications that there are children who are working in tea estates and tobacco estates.	Ati: Twabonye ko hari ibimenyetso byerekana ko hari abana bakora mu cyayi ndetse n’itabi.
There also are children who are working in brick making mostly their parents will facilitate for them to work in those kinds of employment. "	Hariho kandi abana bakora mumatafari cyane cyane ababyeyi babo bazaborohereza gukora murubwo bwoko bwakazi. "
Mr. Matewere says the Eye of the Child has established that there are gross violations of children rights in the country. These include, rape, defilement and being overworked.	Bwana Matewere avuga ko Ijisho ry'umwana ryagaragaje ko mu gihugu hari ihohoterwa rikabije ry'uburenganzira bw'abana. Ibi birimo, gufata kungufu, guhumana no gukora cyane.
He says this violates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.	Avuga ko ibyo binyuranyije n’amasezerano y’umuryango w’abibumbye y’uburenganzira bw’umwana.
"If you look at the Convention of the Rights of a Child," he said, "you will see that it provides for the protection for children from any kind of exploitation from any kind of harmful activities or act which threatens their health, their development which is a threat to education.	Ati: "Iyo urebye Amasezerano y’uburenganzira bw’umwana, uzabona ko ateganya kurinda abana ibikorwa ibyo ari byo byose byangiza ibikorwa cyangwa ibikorwa bibangamira ubuzima bwabo, iterambere ryabo. bikaba bibangamiye uburezi.
So children who are found working in tea estates, who are found in brick making, obvious, their rights as it is provided for in the Convention for the Rights of the Children as well as in the constitution are violated. "	Abana rero usanga bakorera mu cyayi usanga mu kubumba amatafari, bigaragara, uburenganzira bwabo nk'uko biteganywa n’amasezerano y’uburenganzira bw’abana kimwe n’itegeko nshinga. "
The Eye of the Child executive director says his organization is looking at ways of protecting the rights of a child.	Umuyobozi mukuru w'ijisho ry'umwana avuga ko umuryango we urimo gushaka uburyo bwo kurengera uburenganzira bw'umwana.
He says to achieve this, the group has started a number of programs. "We have recently started a new program and what we are trying to do is to inform the general public on the best interests of the child and to inform them on the rights of a child.	Avuga ko kubigeraho, itsinda ryatangiye gahunda nyinshi. "Duherutse gutangiza gahunda nshya kandi icyo tugerageza gukora ni ukumenyesha abaturage muri rusange inyungu z'umwana no kubamenyesha uburenganzira bw'umwana.
At the same we want also to build up the capacity of the children themselves so that may be they can be use their authentic voice out their concerns. "	Mugihe kimwe, turashaka kandi kongera ubushobozi bwabana ubwabo kugirango bibe aribyo bashobora gukoresha ijwi ryabo ryukuri kubibazo byabo. "
According to the Ministry of Labor authorities, many children are forced to leave school and find work because parents cannot afford school fees.	Nk’uko bitangazwa n’ubuyobozi bwa Minisiteri y’umurimo, abana benshi bahatiwe kuva mu ishuri bakabona akazi kubera ko ababyeyi badashobora kwishyura amafaranga y’ishuri.
Although primary school is free in Malawi, most children do not attend due to lack of necessities like clothes.	Nubwo amashuri abanza ari ubuntu muri Malawi, abana benshi ntibitabira kubera kubura ibikenewe nkimyenda.
Over 60 per cent of Malawis nearly 11 million people live below the poverty line.	Abarenga 60 ku ijana by'abaturage ba Malawi hafi miliyoni 11 baba munsi y'umurongo w'ubukene.

Niba ubonye, ​​byose bizenguruka ku cyizere - ko umuntu nka nyakwigendera Macdonald Masambuka yizeraga cyane, ni bo barangije kumuhemukira , Kayuni.
If you notice, it all revolves around the position of trust — that somebody like the late Macdonald Masambuka trusted so much, they are the ones who ended up betraying him," Kayuni said.	Ku ya 9 Werurwe 2018, Masambuka yaburiwe irengero mu mudugudu we, umurambo we utagira ubumuga bamusanga mu busitani ku ya 2 Mata 2018, mu karere avukamo ka Machinga mu majyepfo ya Malawi.

Zimbabwe Official Defends Crackdown on Protests, Urges Patience with Economy	Umukozi wa Zimbabwe arengera guhashya imyigaragambyo, arasaba kwihangana mu bukungu
Zimbabwe's minister of foreign affairs and international trade on Monday defended crackdowns on anti-government demonstrations and urged patience in turning around the country's foundering economy.	Kuri uyu wa mbere, minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga w’ubucuruzi n’ubucuruzi mpuzamahanga wa Zimbabwe, yamaganye ihohoterwa ry’imyigaragambyo irwanya guverinoma anasaba kwihangana mu guhindura ubukungu bw’igihugu.
Though "everybody's got the right to demonstrate," there have "been a lot of insinuations and campaigns of violence," Sibusiso B. Moyo told VOA in an interview. Citing public safety, he endorsed a Zimbabwe court's ruling hours earlier to uphold a police ban on a protest organized by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) alliance.	Mu kiganiro "Sibusiso B. Moyo" yabwiye VOA mu kiganiro na Sibusiso B. Moyo ati: "N'ubwo" abantu bose bafite uburenganzira bwo kwerekana, "habaye" insinations nyinshi n’ubukangurambaga bw’ihohoterwa. " Avuga ku mutekano rusange, yemeje icyemezo cyafashwe n’urukiko rwa Zimbabwe mbere y’uko icyemezo cy’abapolisi kibuza imyigaragambyo yateguwe n’umuryango utavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi uharanira demokarasi (MDC).
Alliance leaders are pressing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party for a role in a transitional government. They had organized a demonstration Monday in Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, but police authorities banned it hours before its intended start. Two other opposition demonstrations still are planned this week: for the central city of Gweru on Tuesday and the southeastern city of Masvingo on Wednesday.	Abayobozi b’ubumwe barimo guhatira Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa n’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi rya ZANU-PF kugira uruhare muri guverinoma y’inzibacyuho. Ku wa mbere, bari barateguye imyigaragambyo i Bulawayo, umujyi wa kabiri mu gihugu, ariko abayobozi ba polisi barabuhagaritse amasaha make mbere yuko gitangira. Muri iki cyumweru harateganijwe indi myigaragambyo ibiri itavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi: ku mujyi wa Gweru rwagati ku wa kabiri n’umujyi wa Masvingo uherereye mu majyepfo y’iburasirazuba.
Police also had pre-emptively banned a demonstration in Harare last Friday, a decision upheld by a Zimbabwe court. Hundreds of MDC supporters ignored the ban, leading to clashes between civilians and police. Video and photographs showed police hitting and kicking some demonstrators among actions that drew complaints of excessive force from civil and human rights groups, including the United Nations human rights office.	Ku wa gatanu ushize, abapolisi bari barabujije mbere na mbere imyigaragambyo yabereye i Harare, icyemezo cyemejwe n'urukiko rwa Zimbabwe. Amajana y'abashyigikiye MDC birengagije iryo tegeko, bituma habaho imirwano hagati y'abasivili n'abapolisi. Amashusho n'amafoto byerekanaga abapolisi gukubita no gukubita bamwe mu bigaragambyaga mu bikorwa byagaragazaga ibirego by’ingufu zikabije z’imiryango iharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu n’uburenganzira bwa muntu, harimo n’ibiro by’umuryango w’abibumbye bishinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu.
Police, not demonstrators, showed up in force on Bulawayo streets Monday, with foot patrols wielding shields, batons and, in some cases, pistols. The Associated Press reported police trucks and water cannons positioned in the downtown area.	Ku wa mbere, abapolisi, ntabwo ari abigaragambyaga, berekanye imbaraga mu mihanda ya Bulawayo, bafite amarondo y'ibirenge akoresheje ingabo, inkoni ndetse rimwe na rimwe, pistolet. Ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika Associated Press byatangaje ko amakamyo ya polisi hamwe n’ibisasu by’amazi biri mu mujyi rwagati.
A young man in Bulawayo, identifying himself only as James, told VOA that negotiations between the government and opposition leaders were even more important than demonstrations.	Umusore wo muri Bulawayo, wiyita James gusa, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko imishyikirano hagati ya guverinoma n’abayobozi batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ari ngombwa kuruta imyigaragambyo.
"Honestly, to demonstrate, we can end up being hurt by being beaten, being chased around. There's really nothing that we see coming out of it," James said. "But these men should sit down and see what they can do for us, especially us, the youth. … We have been affected a lot, and we are getting old just running."	James yagize ati: "Mvugishije ukuri, kwerekana, dushobora kurangiza kubabazwa no gukubitwa, kwirukanwa hirya no hino. Mubyukuri ntakintu tubona kivamo." "Ariko aba bagabo bagomba kwicara bakareba icyo badukorera, cyane cyane twe, urubyiruko.… Twagize ingaruka nyinshi, kandi turasaza twiruka."
Moyo, the foreign minister, told VOA the administration is "undertaking economic reforms [that] are fundamental and they are key to ensuring that even the youth would finally have jobs created for them, so that we can create an environment where investors and the capital will find it easy to come into this country, where jobs will be created, and the youth will be part and parcel of economic activity."	Minisitiri w’ububanyi n’amahanga w’ububanyi n’amahanga, Moyo, yabwiye VOA ko ubuyobozi "bukora ivugurura ry’ubukungu [ko] ari ngombwa kandi ko ari urufunguzo rwo kwemeza ko n’urubyiruko amaherezo rwabashakira imirimo, kugira ngo dushobore gushyiraho ibidukikije aho abashoramari n’umurwa mukuru bizoroha kwinjira muri iki gihugu, ahazabera imirimo, kandi urubyiruko ruzagira uruhare mu bikorwa by'ubukungu. "
Moyo said Zimbabwe is midway into a two-year "transition stabilization program" to revive the country's devastated economy: "We have got one year to go and we are saying we should by then be out of the doldrums."	Moyo yavuze ko Zimbabwe iri hagati y’imyaka ibiri "gahunda yo guhagarika inzibacyuho" kugira ngo ubukungu bwifashe nabi mu gihugu: "Dufite umwaka umwe kandi tuvuga ko icyo gihe tugomba kuva mu gihirahiro."
The southern African country of nearly 16 million is experiencing its worst financial crisis since 2008, beset by hyperinflation and the fallout of decades of corruption. Many struggle to buy basics such as food and medicine. With the poor economy and crops devastated by drought and a spring cyclone, the UN World Food Program anticipates that 5.5 million people will need emergency food aid by next April.	Igihugu cya Afurika yepfo kigera kuri miliyoni 16 gifite ikibazo cy’amafaranga kuva mu 2008, cyugarijwe na hyperinflation hamwe na ruswa imaze imyaka ibarirwa muri za mirongo. Benshi barwana no kugura ibyingenzi nkibiryo nubuvuzi. Kubera ko ubukungu bwifashe nabi n’ibihingwa byangijwe n’amapfa n’umuyaga w’impeshyi, Ishami ry’umuryango w’abibumbye ryita ku biribwa riteganya ko abantu miliyoni 5.5 bazakenera ubufasha bw’ibiribwa byihutirwa bitarenze Mata.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, who had predicted 3.1% growth for 2019, offered a sobering update to Zimbabwe's parliament in early August. "The revised 2019 GDP growth is expected to be negative," Reuters news service reported him as saying.	Minisitiri w’imari, Mthuli Ncube, wari wahanuye ko izamuka rya 3.1% muri 2019, yatanze inteko ishinga amategeko ya Zimbabwe mu ntangiriro za Kanama. Serivisi ishinzwe amakuru ya Reuters yagize ati: "Biteganijwe ko izamuka rya GDP ryavuguruwe riteganijwe kuba ribi."
Ncube did not provide any updated figure.	Ncube ntabwo yatanze ishusho igezweho.
	
African civil society campaigners attending a conference in Tanzania were questioned and warned over the weekend, in what human rights activists say is part of a continuing clampdown on free speech in the East African nation.	Mu mpera z'icyumweru gishize, abakangurambaga ba sosiyete sivile nyafurika bitabiriye inama yabereye muri Tanzaniya barabajijwe kandi baraburirwa, mu byo abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu bavuga ko biri mu rwego rwo gukomeza gukumira ijambo mu gihugu cya Afurika y'Iburasirazuba.
Details are still emerging over what exactly happened to at least 40 civil society workers who ran afoul of security officials at this year's summit of the Southern African Development Community in Dar es Salaam.	Haracyagaragara ibisobanuro birambuye ku bakozi nibura 40 ba sosiyete sivile bayoboye abashinzwe umutekano mu nama y'uyu mwaka y'umuryango w'iterambere rya Afurika y'epfo i Dar es Saalam.
But rights experts said Monday that the episode is another worrying sign of heightened paranoia and harassment from the government.	Ariko impuguke mu bijyanye n'uburenganzira bwa muntu zavuze ko ku wa mbere iki gice ari ikindi kimenyetso gihangayikishije Paranoia ikabije ndetse no gutotezwa na guverinoma.
Catherine Eden, a lawyer for the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition, says the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding. South African delegates to the 15-nation conference, she said, wanted to hold a short commemoration of the seventh anniversary of South Africa's deadly Marikana mine massacre on Aug. 16. 	Catherine Eden, umunyamategeko mu ihuriro ry'abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu muri Tanzaniya, avuga ko ibyabaye byaturutse ku kutumvikana. Yavuze ko intumwa za Afurika y'Epfo mu nama y'ibihugu 15, yashakaga gukora mu gihe gito cyo kwibuka ku nshuro ya karindwi ubwicanyi bwibasiye ikirombe cya Marikana muri Afurika y'Epfo ku ya 16 Kanama.
So delegates at a side event sang the South African anthem, held a moment of silence and availed on their government to better protect its people. 	Intumwa rero mu birori byo kuririmba zaririmbye indirimbo yubahiriza Afurika y'Epfo, bacecekesha akanya kandi basaba guverinoma yabo kurinda abaturage bayo neza.
"They wrote some messages on the flip charts, of which the little content that was captured in the flip charts read, 'Stop killing our people."	Ati:" Banditse ubutumwa bumwe ku mbonerahamwe ya flip, muri yo ibintu bike byafashwe ku mbonerahamwe ya flip byanditseho ngo: "Reka kwica abantu bacu".
It's not clear if anyone was actually arrested. Other rights groups say that some foreign campaigners were arrested, but not interrogated.	Ntibiramenyekana niba koko hari umuntu wafashwe. Indi miryango iharanira uburenganzira bw'ikiremwamuntu ivuga ko bamwe mu bakangurambaga b'abanyamahanga batawe muri yombi, ariko ntibabazwe.
Afraid, insecure'	Ubwoba , umutekano muke
Eden says she was summoned by authorities as she went to the police station Friday night to meet with a local coordinator and then was let go with a warning. Police later went to delegates' hotel rooms looking for materials that they thought were a security threat. They found nothing, she said.	Eden avuga ko yahamagawe n'abayobozi ubwo yajyaga kuri polisi ku wa gatanu nijoro kugira ngo abonane n'umuhuzabikorwa waho hanyuma arekurwa aburiwe. Nyuma abapolisi bagiye mu byumba bya hoteri by'intumwa bashaka ibikoresho bibwiraga ko bibangamiye umutekano. yavuze ko nta cyo babonye.
Janet Zhou, director of the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development, was one of the campaigners questioned by security forces at her hotel.	Janet Zhou, umuyobozi w'umuryango uhuriweho n'inguzanyo n'iterambere rya Zimbabwe, yari umwe mu bakangurambaga babajijwe n'inzego zishinzwe umutekano muri hoteri ye.
"I was afraid, I was insecure, I was traumatized to say the least," she told VOA.	Yatangarije VOA ati: " Natinyaga ko nta mutekano mfite, nari nahahamutse, mvuga make." 
She said police then told her — and her 40-person delegation — to remain in their hotel all day Saturday. She asked them if they were under arrest, to which they did not reply.	Yavuze ko abapolisi bamubwiye  - hamwe n'intumwa z'abantu 40 - kuguma muri hoteri yabo umunsi wose ku wa Gatandatu. Yababajije niba bafashwe, ariko ntibasubiza.
Perfectly valid'	Byemewe rwose '
Oryem Nyeko, a Kampala-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that Tanzanian police didn't do anything technically illegal. But, he said, that doesn't make it right, either.	Oryem Nyeko, umushakashatsi ukomoka mu mujyi wa Kampala muri Human trend Watch, yavuze ko abapolisi ba Tanzaniya ntacyo bakoze mu buryo bwa tekiniki. Ariko, yavuze ko ibyo bidakora neza.
"I think it's a perfectly valid thing for police to do," he said. "However, the challenge with that is that it speaks to a wider problem in Tanzania as far as a closing civic space and the opportunities that people in civic society have to freely express themselves. This is part of a wider pattern of civic repression in the country."	Ati: "Ntekereza ko ari ikintu cyemewe rwose n'abapolisi gukora". "Icyakora, imbogamizi kuri ibyo ni uko ivuga ku kibazo kinini muri Tanzaniya kugeza aho abaturage bafunga ndetse n'amahirwe abantu bo muri sosiyete sivile bagomba kwigaragaza mu bwisanzure. Ibi ni bimwe mu buryo bwagutse bwo gukandamiza abaturage muri igihugu. "
International groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have also warned of increased repression. Ahead of the SADC summit, the watchdog group noted its concerns about a "deeply troubling erosion of press freedom," and of "attacks on individual journalists, media suspensions, internet shutdowns, and restrictive legislation."

Few Demonstrators Turn Up for Zimbabwe Protest in Bulawayo	Abigaragambyaga ni bake bitabira imyigaragambyo ya Zimbabwe i Bulawayo
Few people have turned up for an opposition protest in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, on Monday as armed police maintained heavy presence on the streets and at a courthouse where the opposition is pressing to be allowed to hold the demonstration.	Ku wa mbere, abantu bake bitabiriye imyigaragambyo y’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi i Bulawayo, umujyi wa kabiri wa Zimbabwe, mu gihe abapolisi bitwaje intwaro bakomeje kuba benshi mu mihanda no mu rukiko aho abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi basaba ko bemererwa gukora iyo myigaragambyo.

Ubucuruzi mu mujyi wa Bulawayo ubusanzwe bwuzuyemo umujyi rwagabanijwe n’imodoka nyinshi ziva mu gikamyo cya polisi, ibisasu by’amazi hamwe n’abapolisi benshi bakora irondo n'amaguru.
The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had called the protest as part of a planned series of demonstrations to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa to agree to a transitional government amid a rapidly deteriorating economy and rising political tensions.	Ishyaka ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi, Umuryango uharanira demokarasi riharanira demokarasi, ryari ryise imyigaragambyo mu rwego rwo gutegura imyigaragambyo yo guhatira perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa kwemeranya na guverinoma y’inzibacyuho mu gihe ubukungu bwifashe nabi ndetse n’ubushyamirane bukabije bwa politiki.

Ariko abapolisi babujije imyigaragambyo mu mujyi wo mu majyepfo, kubera impungenge z'umutekano. Umucamanza wa Bulawayo arimo kumva ikibazo cy’ishyaka ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.
The protest was planned as a follow up to demonstrations held in the capital, Harare, on Friday when several hundred demonstrators marched in defiance of a police ban that was upheld by the High Court. Police used tear gas and beatings with batons to quell the Harare protest.	Kuri uyu wa gatanu, imyigaragambyo yari yateguwe mu rwego rwo gukurikirana imyigaragambyo yabereye mu murwa mukuru, Harare, ubwo abigaragambyaga magana bakoze urugendo banga kubuza abapolisi kubahiriza icyemezo cy’urukiko rukuru.

"They beat us up," she said of the police. "What have we done? All these security forces are supposed to protect us all — not just one person. Where will we go and survive? Shall we kill our kids since we are struggling to take care of them?"	Yavuze ku bapolisi ati: "Badukubise." "Twakoze iki? Izi nzego zose z'umutekano zigomba kuturinda twese - atari umuntu umwe. Tuzajya he kandi turokoke? Tuzica abana bacu kuva duharanira kubitaho?"
Make Nyashanu, 27, said he would continue protesting because he is miserable about being unemployed.	Kora Nyashanu w'imyaka 27, yavuze ko azakomeza kwigaragambya kuko ababajwe no kuba umushomeri.
He said police were indiscriminately beating demonstrators — even elderly ones and people not protesting. "Is this democracy?" he asked, adding that it was a peaceful demonstration but police were causing chaos.	Yavuze ko abapolisi bakubitaga mu buryo butavangura abigaragambyaga - ndetse n'abasaza ndetse n'abantu ntibigaragambya. "Iyi demokarasi ni yo?" yabajije, yongeraho ko ari imyigaragambyo y'amahoro ariko abapolisi bateza akaduruvayo.
The opposition said it will hold another protest Monday in Zimbabwe's second largest city, Bulawayo, and will go to other cities and places until the government addresses the economy.

Government response	Igisubizo cya Guverinoma
Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa called the protests counterproductive, saying January's demonstrations against fuel price increases resulted in $20 million to $30 million in losses for businesses from looting and non-productive days.	Minisitiri w’itangazamakuru, Monica Mutsvangwa, yavuze ko imyigaragambyo idatanga umusaruro, avuga ko imyigaragambyo yo muri Mutarama yamagana izamuka ry’ibiciro bya peteroli byatumye miliyoni 20 zigera kuri miliyoni 30 z’igihombo ku bucuruzi kuva mu busahuzi no mu minsi idatanga umusaruro.
"Government calls on all progressive Zimbabweans to desist from being used by negative forces to destabilize their own country, as this will only prolong the hardships which the government is tirelessly trying to address in a more sustainable manner," she said. "I wish to reiterate the call by His Excellency Comrade ED Mnangagwa for all patriotic Zimbabweans to resort to dialogue as a means to solve the challenges we face as a nation."	Ati: "Guverinoma irahamagarira abanya Zimbabwe bose bateye imbere kureka gukoreshwa n’ingufu zitari nziza kugira ngo bahungabanye igihugu cyabo, kuko ibyo bizongerera gusa ingorane guverinoma igerageza gukemura mu buryo burambye". "Ndashaka kongera guhamagarwa na Nyakubahwa Mugenzi we ED Mnangagwa kugira ngo abanyagihugu bose bakunda igihugu cya Zimbabwe bakoreshe ibiganiro mu rwego rwo gukemura ibibazo duhura nabyo nk'igihugu."
Daniel Molokhele, the spokesman for the opposition, said his party was against Mnangagwa leading talks and accused him of stealing Zimbabwe's last election in 2018. He said the protests would continue until Zimbabwe's economy gets back on track.

Yavuze ko imyigaragambyo izakomeza kugeza igihe ubukungu bwa Zimbabwe buzasubira mu nzira.
	
UN Condemns Government Crackdown on Peaceful Protests in Zimbabwe	Umuryango w'abibumbye wamaganye igitero cya guverinoma ku myigaragambyo y'amahoro muri Zimbabwe
The U.N. human rights office is condemning a crackdown Friday in Zimbabwe by riot police on peaceful protesters in the capital, Harare. The agency is calling for an investigation into excessive use of force by security forces.	Ibiro bishinzwe uburenganzira bwa muntu muri Amerika biramagana igitero cyo ku wa gatanu muri Zimbabwe n’abapolisi bigaragambyaga ku bigaragambyaga mu mahoro mu murwa mukuru, Harare. Ikigo kirasaba ko hakorwa iperereza ku mikoreshereze ikabije y’inzego z’umutekano.
U.N. Human Rights spokesman Rupert Colville says there are better ways to deal with the populations legitimate grievances on the economic situation in the country than by cracking down on peaceful protestors.	Umuvugizi w’umuryango w’abibumbye uharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu, Rupert Colville, avuga ko hari inzira nziza zo guhangana n’abaturage bafite ibibazo byemewe ku bijyanye n’ubukungu bw’igihugu kuruta guhashya abigaragambyaga mu mahoro.
"We are deeply concerned by the socio-economic crisis that continues to unfold in Zimbabwe. While acknowledging efforts made by the government, the international community and the U.N. in Zimbabwe to mitigate the effects of the crisis and reform process, the dire economic situation is now impacting negatively on the realization of economic and social rights of millions of Zimbabweans," Colville said.	Duhangayikishijwe cyane n'ikibazo cy'imibereho n'ubukungu gikomeje kugaragara muri Zimbabwe. Mu gihe dushimira imbaraga guverinoma yashyizeho, umuryango mpuzamahanga ndetse na Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika muri Zimbabwe mu rwego rwo kugabanya ingaruka z'ikibazo ndetse n'ivugurura, ubukungu bwifashe nabi. ubu bigira ingaruka mbi ku ishyirwa mu bikorwa ry'uburenganzira bw'ubukungu n'imibereho myiza y'abaturage ba miliyoni Zimbabwe , Colville.
Zimbabwes citizens are struggling with hyperinflation, which has sent prices soaring for essential commodities such as fuel, food, transportation and health care. Compounding the problems is the ongoing impact of cyclone Idai that hit Zimbabwe in March and a severe drought.	Abaturage ba Zimbabwes barwana na hyperinflation, yohereje ibiciro kuzamuka kubicuruzwa nkenerwa nka lisansi, ibiryo, ubwikorezi nubuvuzi. Kwiyongera ku bibazo ni ingaruka zikomeje kwibasirwa na serwakira Idai yibasiye Zimbabwe muri Werurwe n’amapfa akomeye.
The United Nations says one third of Zimbabwes population of 16 million people is in need of humanitarian aid.	Umuryango w'abibumbye uvuga ko kimwe cya gatatu cy'abaturage ba Zimbabwes batuye miliyoni 16 bakeneye ubufasha bw'ikiremwamuntu.
The fallout in terms of casualties and possible arrests from Fridays protests is not yet clear. But Colville tells VOA his office has received disturbing reports of human rights violations over the past few months.	Ikibazo cyo guhitanwa n’abahitanwa n’ifatwa ry’imyigaragambyo yo ku wa gatanu ntikiramenyekana. Ariko Colville abwira IJWI ibiro bye byakiriye raporo zibangamira ihohoterwa ry'uburenganzira bwa muntu mu mezi ashize.
"There are, as I said, reports coming through right now of very recent abductions, beatings and so on of activists or human rights defenders. We have not had a chance to verify those and look in detail apart from the two that occurred a few days ago," Colville said. "So, it is clearly a very tense situation."	Hariho nk'uko nabivuze, hari amakuru avugwa muri iki gihe ku ishimutwa rya vuba aha, gukubitwa n'ibindi nk'abarwanashyaka cyangwa abaharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu. Ntabwo twagize amahirwe yo kugenzura ibyo no kureba mu buryo burambuye usibye bibiri byabaye bike. hashize iminsi, Colville ati. "Rero, biragaragara ko ari ibintu bitoroshye."
Colville says state authorities have a duty to ensure peoples rights to freedom of expression and to protect the right to peaceful assembly.	Colville avuga ko abayobozi ba Leta bafite inshingano zo guharanira uburenganzira bw'abaturage bwo gutanga ibitekerezo no kurengera uburenganzira bwo guterana mu mahoro.
The U.N. human rights office is urging the government to engage in a national dialogue to ensure that civil society in all its guises can carry out its activities without fear of intimidation or reprisals for its work.	Ibiro by’uburenganzira bwa muntu by’umuryango w’abibumbye birasaba guverinoma kugirana ibiganiro by’igihugu kugira ngo sosiyete sivile mu buryo bwayo bwose ishobore gukora ibikorwa byayo nta gutinya iterabwoba cyangwa guhanwa kubera ibikorwa byayo.
	
Despite Oil and Gas Reserves, Africa Feels Pressure of Rising Energy Costs	Nubwo ibigega bya peteroli na gaze, Afurika irumva igitutu cyizamuka ryibiciro byingufu
Africans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring global energy prices, say analysts, even in countries like Nigeria and Angola that are major exporters of crude oil.	Abasesenguzi bavuga ko Abanyafurika bumva buke biterwa no kuzamuka kw'ibiciro by'ingufu ku isi, ndetse no mu bihugu nka Nijeriya na Angola byohereza peteroli nyinshi.
While that handful of oil producers is seeing an increase in revenue – especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24 – much of the continent lacks refining capability, forcing countries to pay high prices to import gasoline and other petroleum products from Asia and Europe.	Mu gihe ibyo bicuruzwa bikomoka kuri peteroli bigenda byiyongera - cyane cyane ko Uburusiya bwateye muri Ukraine ku ya 24 Gashyantare - igice kinini cy’umugabane kikaba kidafite ubushobozi bwo gutunganya, bigatuma ibihugu byishyura ibicuruzwa biva mu mahanga biva muri peteroli n’ibindi bicuruzwa biva muri Aziya no mu Burayi.
The continent is further affected by increasing costs for natural gas, a key component of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in food production.	Umugabane wongeye kwibasirwa no kongera ibiciro bya gaze naturel, igice cyingenzi cyamafumbire ashingiye kuri azote akoreshwa mugutanga ibiribwa.
With salaries largely stagnant, more than two-thirds of Africans feel pressured by the rising prices, said Franklin Cudjoe, founding president of the Ghana-based Imani Center for Policy and Education.	Kubera ko umushahara ahanini uhagaze, abarenga bibiri bya gatatu by'Abanyafurika bumva bahangayikishijwe n'izamuka ry'ibiciro nk'uko byatangajwe na Franklin Cudjoe, washinze ikigo cya Imani gishinzwe politiki n'uburezi muri Gana.
"The continent is affected simply because we depend largely on global oil suppliers, since not many African countries have [their own] oil products," Cudjoe told VOA.	Cudjoe yatangarije Ijwi rya Amerika ati: "Umugabane ugira ingaruka gusa kubera ko ahanini dushingiye ku batanga peteroli ku isi, kubera ko mu bihugu byinshi bya Afurika bidafite ibikomoka kuri peteroli."
Prices spiked on the global oil market after the invasion of Ukraine triggered a wave of international sanctions against Russia, one of the worlds leading exporters of crude. The price briefly climbed to over $120 per barrel this month before settling down to $103 per barrel on Friday.	Ibiciro byazamutse ku isoko rya peteroli ku isi nyuma y’igitero cya Ukraine byateje ibihano mpuzamahanga ku Burusiya, kimwe mu bihugu biza kohereza ibicuruzwa hanze mu mahanga. Muri uku kwezi igiciro cyazamutse kigera ku madolari arenga 120 kuri buri barrale mbere yo kugabanuka kugeza ku madolari 103 kuri buri wa gatanu.
The surge in energy prices is helping to fuel inflation across Africa. In Ghana, for example, overall consumer price inflation was pegged at 15.7% year-on-year in February compared with 13.9% in January, the countrys Statistical Service said last week.	Kuzamuka kw'ibiciro by'ingufu bifasha kuzamura ifaranga muri Afurika. Urugero, muri Gana, muri rusange igiciro cy’ibiciro by’umuguzi cyashyizwe ku gipimo cya 15.7% umwaka ushize ugereranije na 13.9% muri Mutarama, nk'uko byatangajwe n’ikigo cy’ibarurishamibare mu gihugu mu cyumweru gishize.
In Zimbabwe, prices are climbing sharply – even overnight. At a TM supermarket in the capital of Harare, a crate of 30 eggs cost the $6.70 on Tuesday and about $7.81 on Wednesday. The price of a loaf of bread went from $1.49 to $1.84; for a kilo of beef, the price jumped from $3.35 to $5.22.	Muri Zimbabwe, ibiciro bizamuka cyane - ndetse nijoro. Ku wa kabiri, muri supermarket ya TM mu murwa mukuru wa Harare, isanduku y’amagi 30 yaguze amadolari 6.70 ku wa kabiri n’amadorari 7.81 ku wa gatatu. Igiciro cy'umugati cyavuye kuri $ 1.49 kigera ku $ 1.84; ku kilo cy'inka, igiciro cyavuye ku $ 3.35 kigera ku $ 5.22.
Gasoline costs climbed, too. In Harare, the per-liter price climbed from $1.41 to $1.69 from Tuesday to Wednesday.	Ibiciro bya lisansi byarazamutse, nabyo. I Harare, igiciro cya litiro cyazamutse kiva ku $ 1.41 kigera ku $ 1.69 kuva ku wa kabiri kugeza ku wa gatatu.
The surge in food prices was the biggest driver behind consumer inflation in Egypt, it rose by 8.8% in February – the sharpest increase in nearly three years, according to the state statistics agency, CAPMAS.	Izamuka ry’ibiciro by’ibiribwa niryo ryagize uruhare runini mu guta agaciro kw’abaguzi muri Egiputa, ryazamutseho 8.8% muri Gashyantare - kwiyongera gukabije mu myaka hafi itatu, nkuko bitangazwa n’ikigo cya Leta gishinzwe ibarurishamibare, CAPMAS.
Cudjoe said it was crucial for governments and regional bodies such as the African Union to build defenses to cushion consumers in times of economic uncertainty.	Cudjoe yavuze ko ari ngombwa ko guverinoma n’inzego z’akarere nk’Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika byubaka uburyo bwo guhashya abaguzi mu gihe ubukungu bwifashe nabi.
"Even if it means building defenses in terms of the provision of food," said Cudjoe, adding, "I could imagine Nigeria, if it had had its way, it could be selling foodstuff to most countries at reduced rates by now."	Cudjoe yagize ati: "Nubwo byaba bisobanura kubaka ibirindiro mu bijyanye no gutanga ibiribwa", yongeyeho ati: "Nashoboraga gutekereza Nigeriya, iyaba ifite inzira, yashoboraga kugurisha ibiribwa mu bihugu byinshi ku giciro gito kugeza ubu."
"There must be that urgency of building for themselves defenses, funds that would make us sustain ourselves -- at least to prevent us from being completely annihilated by these uncertainties in the world."	Hagomba kubaho ubwihutirwa bwo kwirwanaho, amafaranga yatuma dukomeza kwibeshaho - byibuze bikatubuza kurimburwa burundu n'ibi bidashidikanywaho ku isi.
Chibamba Kanyama, an economist in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, said suspending fuel taxes would be "the most ideal thing to do now under the circumstances" to cushion consumers and industries.	Chibamba Kanyama, impuguke mu by'ubukungu mu murwa mukuru wa Zambiya wa Lusaka, yavuze ko guhagarika imisoro ya peteroli ari "ikintu cyiza cyane gukora ubu mu bihe" kugira ngo abakoresha inganda n’inganda.
"African governments must find a way of responding," he said. 'It is a choice of whether to reduce taxes to lower the prices or to maintain the price levels and use the revenues to subsidize the most vulnerable in society."	Ati: "Guverinoma za Afurika zigomba gushaka uburyo bwo gusubiza." 'Ni uguhitamo kugabanya imisoro kugira ngo ibiciro bigabanuke cyangwa kugumana urwego rw'ibiciro no gukoresha amafaranga yinjira mu gutera inkunga abatishoboye muri sosiyete. "
But Kanyama also suggested that the geopolitical crisis involving Russia and Ukraine – both big grain exporters to Africa – may create opportunities for African producers.	Ariko Kanyama yavuze kandi ko ikibazo cya geopolitiki kirimo Uburusiya na Ukraine - byombi byohereza ibicuruzwa muri Afurika - bishobora guha amahirwe abahinzi bo muri Afurika.
"Supply countries like South Africa, with robust and highly mechanized systems, may find a window of exporting [commodities] like wheat and other products to fill the gaps left by Russia and Ukraine," Kanyama said.	Kanyama ati: "Gutanga ibihugu nka Afurika y'Epfo, hamwe na sisitemu zikomeye kandi zikoresha imashini zikoresha imashini nyinshi, birashobora kubona idirishya ryo kohereza ibicuruzwa mu mahanga nk'ingano n'ibindi bicuruzwa kugira ngo icyuho cyasizwe n'Uburusiya na Ukraine."
Kanyama also said support by the international community – for instance, in the form of debt relief for some African nations – is welcome.	Kanyama yavuze kandi ko inkunga n’umuryango mpuzamahanga - urugero, mu rwego rwo kugabanya imyenda ku bihugu bimwe na bimwe bya Afurika - byemewe.
He noted that the Group of 20 – which encompasses seven industrialized nations, some countries with strong or fast-growing economies, and the European Union – "is trying to offer some debt relief."	Yagaragaje ko Itsinda rya 20 - rikubiyemo ibihugu birindwi byateye imbere mu nganda, ibihugu bimwe na bimwe bifite ubukungu bukomeye cyangwa byihuta cyane, ndetse n’umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi - "bigerageza gutanga inguzanyo."
"Some other countries, such as Zambia, [are] undergoing debt restructuring processes and an IMF program, and to me, this is the only way out of the crisis," Kanyama added.	Kanyama yongeyeho ati: "Ibindi bihugu bimwe na bimwe nka Zambiya, birimo guhindura imyenda na gahunda ya IMF, kandi kuri njye, iyi ni yo nzira yonyine yo kwikuramo ibibazo."

WHO Says Africa's COVID Vaccinations Rose by 15% in February	Umuryango w'Abibumbye wita ku buzima uvuga ko inkingo za COVID zo muri Afrika zanduye 15% muri Gashyantare
The World Health Organization says Africas COVID-19 vaccinations rose by 15% between January and February, as several countries embarked on mass inoculation drives to expand coverage and protect populations from the pandemic.	Ishami ry'Umuryango w'Abibumbye ryita ku Buzima rivuga ko inkingo za Africas COVID-19 zazamutseho 15% hagati ya Mutarama na Gashyantare, mu gihe ibihugu byinshi byatangiye gahunda yo gukingira abantu benshi mu rwego rwo kwagura no kurinda abaturage icyorezo.
Zimbabwes government says it is launching a "national vaccination blitz" targeting those who have not yet been vaccinated in a country where resistance to the shots has been an issue since the program started last year. The drive come amid government concern over rising COVID-19 cases. Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement that the increase in COVID-19 vaccinations on the continent was driven mainly by campaigns in populous countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria.	Guverinoma ya Zimbabwes ivuga ko igiye gutangiza "gukingira igihugu" kwibasira abatarakingirwa mu gihugu aho ikibazo cyo kurwanya amasasu cyabaye ikibazo kuva gahunda yatangira umwaka ushize. Iyi gahunda ije mu gihe leta ihangayikishijwe no kwiyongera kwa COVID-19. Umuyobozi wa OMS mu karere ka Afurika, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, mu ijambo rye yavuze ko kwiyongera kw'inkingo za COVID-19 ku mugabane wa Afurika byatewe ahanini n'ubukangurambaga mu bihugu bituwe cyane, harimo Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, Etiyopiya, Kenya, na Nijeriya.
Dr. Thierno Balde, the WHO Africa regional COVID-19 incident manager, he says the continent must remain vigilant.	Dr. Thierno Balde, umuyobozi wa OMS mu karere ka COVID-19 ushinzwe ibikorwa, avuga ko umugabane ugomba gukomeza kuba maso.
"We have seen what is happening around, in China, and the risk of also having new imitations, new variants still possible. We really need to continue to safeguard our population by taking the vaccine by not relaxing totally. The situation might change. So we really need to continue adapting some of these social measures and also to get vaccination," Balde said.	Twabonye ibibera hirya no hino, mu Bushinwa, ndetse n'akaga ko no kwigana ibintu bishya, ubundi buryo bushya buracyashoboka. Tugomba rwose gukomeza kurinda abaturage bacu dufata urukingo tutaruhuka rwose. Ibintu birashobora guhinduka. Rero Tugomba rwose gukomeza guhuza zimwe muri izo ngamba ndetse no gukingirwa , Balde.
The WHO said to boost African COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, it and other organizations were supporting mass vaccination drives in at least 10 priority countries to reach 100 million people by the end of next month.	Umuryango w'Abibumbye wita ku buzima yavuze ko bizamura urukingo rwa Afurika COVID-19, we n'indi miryango bashyigikiye gahunda yo gukingira imbaga byibuze mu bihugu 10 byihutirwa kugira ngo bigere ku bantu miliyoni 100 mu mpera z'ukwezi gutaha.
Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, Zimbabwes acting information minister, said his country would not be left behind.	Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu, minisitiri w’agateganyo wa Zimbabwes, yavuze ko igihugu cye kitazasigara inyuma.
"Regarding the vaccination program, as of 15 March, 2022, a total of 159,628 third doses have been administered to date. The national vaccination blitz campaign will kick off on Monday, 21 March, 2022, and [the] government is urging those that have not yet been vaccinated to take advantage of this exercise to do so," Ndlovu said.	Ku bijyanye na gahunda yo gukingira, guhera ku ya 15 Werurwe 2022, kugeza ubu hamaze gutangwa inshuro 159,628 zose za gatatu. Igikorwa cyo gukingira igihugu kizatangira ku wa mbere, 21 Werurwe 2022, kandi [guverinoma] irahamagarira abo ntibarakingirwa kugira ngo bakoreshe iyi myitozo kugira ngo babikore , Ndlovu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused vaccination, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines. The country has lately recorded a rise in new infections – now cumulatively at 244,012 with 5,418 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak.	Abatari bake bo muri Zimbabwe banze gukingirwa, bavuga ko batizeye inkingo za Sinopharm zakozwe mu Bushinwa na Sinovac. Nk’uko byatangajwe na kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins ikurikirana iki cyorezo ku isi, ngo iki gihugu kimaze iminsi cyiyongera ku banduye - ubu bakaba bagera kuri 244.012 bapfa 5.418.
Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, president of Zimbabwe College of Public Health Physicians, attributes that to the recent lifting of restrictive measures, such as lockdowns. He says, however, it is not time to panic, just to enforce WHO protocols, such masking and social distancing.	Dr. Cleophas Chimbetete, perezida w’ishuri rikuru ry’abaganga b’ubuzima rusange rya Zimbabwe, avuga ko ibyo biterwa no gukuraho ingamba zihamye nko gufunga. Avuga ko ariko, atari igihe cyo guhagarika umutima, gusa ngo dushyire mu bikorwa protocole ya OMS, nko guhisha no gutandukanya imibereho.
"After relaxing measures, it is expected that cases will slightly go up. But I also think that it is too early to make any meaningful conclusions, I think it is just an opportunity for us to strengthen our preventative measures and continue highlighting to the rest of the population that COVID is still with us. The good news, though, is that severe cases have not gone up. What we need to do is to continue to get vaccinated and what is important is that the government should – as it is doing – is monitor these numbers. There is no cause for alarm or cause for us to introduce new measures," Chimbetete said.	Nyuma yo gufata ingamba zo kuruhuka, biteganijwe ko imanza zizamuka ho gato. Ariko nanone ndatekereza ko hakiri kare gufata imyanzuro ifatika, ndatekereza ko ari amahirwe kuri twe gushimangira ingamba zo gukumira no gukomeza kumurikira abandi. y'abaturage ko COVID ikiri kumwe natwe.Inkuru nziza, nubwo, imanza zikomeye zitigeze ziyongera. Icyo tugomba gukora ni ugukomeza gukingirwa kandi icyangombwa nuko leta igomba - nkuko ibikora - ni ugukurikirana iyi mibare. Nta mpamvu yo gutabaza cyangwa kudutera gushyiraho ingamba nshya , Chimbetete.
Zimbabwe had a target of vaccinating at least 10 million people by the end of last year, a figure that some say was difficult to reach given the scarcity of resources and hesitance. It has yet to announce when it plans to achieve herd immunity.	Mu mpera z'umwaka ushize, Zimbabwe yari ifite intego yo gukingira byibuze miliyoni 10 z'abantu, iyo mibare bamwe bavuga ko bigoye kuyigeraho bitewe n'ubushobozi buke no gushidikanya. Kugeza ubu ntiratangaza igihe iteganya kugera ku budahangarwa bw'ubusho.
	
Finland Crowned World's Happiest Nation for Fifth Year	Finlande Yambitswe Igihugu Cyane Cyane Cyane Cyumwaka wa gatanu
Finland has been named the world's happiest country for the fifth year running, in an annual U.N.-sponsored index that again ranked Afghanistan as the unhappiest, followed closely by Lebanon.	Finilande yagizwe igihugu cyishimye ku isi mu mwaka wa gatanu, mu cyegeranyo ngarukamwaka cyatewe inkunga na Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika cyongeye gushyira Afuganisitani nk'utishimye, gikurikirwa na Libani.
Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania recorded the biggest boosts in wellbeing. The largest falls in the World Happiness table, released on Friday, came in Lebanon, Venezuela and Afghanistan.	Seribiya, Buligariya na Rumaniya byanditseho imbaraga nyinshi mu mibereho myiza. Kugwa kwinshi kumeza yibyishimo byisi, byashyizwe ahagaragara kuwa gatanu, byaje muri Libani, Venezuwela na Afuganisitani.
Lebanon, which is facing economic meltdown, fell to second from last on the index of 146 nations, just below Zimbabwe.	Libani ihura n’ubukungu bwifashe nabi, yagabanutse ku mwanya wa kabiri kuva ku rutonde rw’ibihugu 146, munsi ya Zimbabwe.
War-traumatized Afghanistan, already bottom of the table, has seen its humanitarian crisis deepen since the Taliban took power again last August. U.N. agency UNICEF estimates one million children under five could die of hunger this winter if not aided.	Afuganisitani yahungabanye mu ntambara, imaze kuba munsi y’ameza, imaze kubona ikibazo cy’ubutabazi kuva Abatalibani bongera gufata ubutegetsi muri Kanama gushize. Ikigo cya UNICE UNICEF kivuga ko miliyoni y'abana bari munsi yimyaka itanu bashobora guhitanwa ninzara muriyi mbeho iyo idafashijwe.
"This (index) presents a stark reminder of the material and immaterial damage that war does to its many victims," co-author Jan-Emmanuel De Neve said. The World Happiness Report, now in its 10th year, is based on people's own assessment of their happiness, as well as economic and social data.	Umwanditsi umwe, Jan-Emmanuel De Neve yagize ati: "Iyi (indangagaciro) irerekana neza ibyangiritse ku bintu ndetse no ku buryo budasanzwe intambara yangiza abahohotewe." Raporo y’ibyishimo ku isi, ubu iri mu mwaka wa 10, ishingiye ku kwisuzuma ryabo ubwabo ku byishimo byabo, ndetse n’imibare y’ubukungu n’imibereho.
It assigns a happiness score on a scale of zero to 10, based on an average of data over a three-year period. This latest edition was completed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.	Igenera amanota yibyishimo ku gipimo cya zeru kugeza 10, ukurikije impuzandengo yamakuru mugihe cyimyaka itatu. Iyi nyandiko iheruka yarangiye mbere y’Uburusiya butera Ukraine.
Northern Europeans once again dominated the top spots -- with the Danes second behind the Finns, followed by the Icelandic, the Swiss and the Dutch. The United States rose three places to 16th, one ahead of Britain, while France climbed to 20th, its highest ranking yet.	Abanyaburayi bo mu majyaruguru bongeye kwiganza ku mwanya wa mbere - hamwe na Danemark inyuma ya Finns, ikurikirwa na Islande, Abasuwisi n'Abaholandi. Amerika yazamutseho imyanya itatu igera ku mwanya wa 16, imwe imbere y'Ubwongereza, mu gihe Ubufaransa bwazamutse bugera ku mwanya wa 20, bukaba buri ku mwanya wa mbere kugeza ubu.
As well as a personal sense of wellbeing, based on Gallup polls in each country, the happiness score takes account of GDP, social support, personal freedom and levels of corruption.	Kimwe no kumva ko umuntu ameze neza, ashingiye ku matora ya Gallup muri buri gihugu, amanota y'ibyishimo atekereza kuri GDP, inkunga y'abaturage, ubwisanzure bwite na ruswa.
This year the authors also used data from social media to compare people's emotions before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. They found "strong increases in anxiety and sadness" in 18 countries but a fall in feelings of anger.	Uyu mwaka abanditsi bakoresheje kandi amakuru ava ku mbuga nkoranyambaga kugira ngo bagereranye amarangamutima y'abantu mbere na nyuma y'icyorezo cya Covid-19. Basanze "kwiyongera gukomeye mumaganya numubabaro" mubihugu 18 ariko kugwa muburakari.
"The lesson of the World Happiness Report over the years is that social support, generosity to one another and honesty in government are crucial for wellbeing," report co-author Jeffrey Sachs wrote.	Umwanditsi umwe muri raporo, Jeffrey Sachs yanditse ati: "Isomo rya raporo y'ibyishimo ku isi mu myaka yashize ni uko gushyigikira imibereho, kugirana ubuntu no kuba inyangamugayo muri guverinoma ari ngombwa mu mibereho myiza."
"World leaders should take heed."	Abayobozi b'isi bagomba kwitondera.
The report raised some eyebrows when it first placed Finland at the top of its listings in 2018.	Raporo yazamuye amaso igihe yashyiraga bwa mbere Finlande ku rutonde rwayo muri 2018.
Many of the Nordic country's 5.5 million people describe themselves as taciturn and prone to melancholy, and admit to eyeing public displays of joyfulness with suspicion.	Benshi mu baturage bo mu gihugu cya Nordic miliyoni 5.5 bavuga ko ari taciturn kandi bakunda guhangayika, kandi bakemera ko bareba abantu bishimye bafite amakenga.
But the country of vast forests and lakes is also known for its well-functioning public services, ubiquitous saunas, widespread trust in authority and low levels of crime and inequality.	Ariko igihugu cy’amashyamba n’ibiyaga bigari kizwiho kandi n’imirimo ifitiye igihugu akamaro, sauna igaragara hose, kwizerana cyane ku butegetsi n’ubugizi bwa nabi buke n’ubusumbane.
	
Zimbabwe Court Orders Trial for NY Times Freelancer	Urukiko rwa Zimbabwe rwasubitse urubanza rwa NY Times Freelancer
A court in Zimbabwe dismissed a discharge application Tuesday in a case against a New York Times journalist. Freelance journalist Jeffrey Moyo is accused of flouting Zimbabwe's immigration laws when he allegedly helped two foreign reporters enter the southern African nation illegally last year.	Ku wa kabiri, urukiko rwo muri Zimbabwe rwanze icyifuzo cyo gusezerera mu rubanza umunyamakuru wa New York Times. Umunyamakuru wa Freelance, Jeffrey Moyo, arashinjwa kuba yararenze ku mategeko agenga abinjira n'abasohoka muri Zimbabwe ubwo yavugaga ko yafashije abanyamakuru babiri b'abanyamahanga kwinjira mu gihugu cya Afurika y'Epfo mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko umwaka ushize.
Kathleen Mpofu — one of Moyo's lawyers — said the journalist will go on trial April 28.	Kathleen Mpofu - umwe mu bunganira Moyo - yavuze ko umunyamakuru azaburanishwa ku ya 28 Mata.
"The magistrate dismissed the application. He basically found that the state had led enough evidence for Mr. Moyo to be put to his defense and coming to this finding," Mpofu told VOA from Bulawayo, via WhatsApp.	Mpofu yabwiye VOA avuye i Bulawayo, abinyujije kuri WhatsApp ati: "Umucamanza yanze icyifuzo. Yasanze ahanini Leta yarayoboye ibimenyetso bihagije kugira ngo Bwana Moyo ashyikirizwe kandi aze muri iki cyemezo."
"It seems the magistrate relied on the fact that the state had led the evidence of the allegedly false accreditation cards that had been obtained by the foreign journalist and based on his interpretation of the evidence led by the state, he found that it was sufficient to put the accused to his defense."	Bigaragara ko umucamanza yashingiye ku kuba leta yari iyoboye ibimenyetso by'amakarita yo kwemeza ko ari ibinyoma yari yarahawe n'umunyamakuru w’amahanga kandi ashingiye ku gusobanura ibimenyetso byayobowe na Leta, yasanze bihagije kuri shyira ushinjwa kumwunganira. 
Moyo's lawyers believed the case might be dismissed, after the same court earlier this month acquitted a Zimbabwe Media Commission official, Thabang Manhika, for allegedly processing fake accreditations for two South Africa-based New York Times journalists who entered Zimbabwe and were later deported. Moyo and Manhika were being tried separately.	Abunganira Moyo bemezaga ko uru rubanza rushobora gusibwa, nyuma yuko urukiko rumwe mu ntangiriro z'uku kwezi rugizwe umwere umukozi wa komisiyo ishinzwe itangazamakuru muri Zimbabwe, Thabang Manhika, kubera ko yatunganyaga impapuro mpimbano ku banyamakuru babiri ba New York Times bakorera muri Afurika y'Epfo binjiye muri Zimbabwe nyuma baza kwirukanwa. Moyo na Manhika baburanishwaga ukwabo.
Zimbabwe's government says both Moyo and Manhika broke immigration laws.	Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe ivuga ko Moyo na Manhika bombi barenze ku mategeko y’abinjira.
Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana commented on Tuesday's ruling.	Umunyamabanga uhoraho wa Minisiteri ishinzwe amakuru Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana yagize icyo avuga ku cyemezo cyo ku wa kabiri.
"We just want to see that there's law and order. If somebody has committed a crime or is perceived, they will have their day in court, so he is having his day in court, so his outcome is not in our hands, it's in the hands of the criminal justice system. That's our position," Mangwana said.	Turashaka gusa kubona ko hari amategeko n'amabwiriza. Niba hari umuntu wakoze icyaha cyangwa akabonwa, bazagira umunsi wabo mu rukiko, bityo akaba afite umunsi we mu rukiko, bityo ibisubizo bye bikaba bitari mu maboko yacu, birimo amaboko y'ubutabera mpanabyaha. Ngiyo umwanya dufite , Mangwana.
Tabani Moyo of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, has called for the journalist to be treated fairly.	Tabani Moyo wo mu kigo cy'itangazamakuru cyo muri Afurika y'Epfo, cyangwa MISA, yasabye ko umunyamakuru yafatwa neza.
"MISA Zimbabwe underscores the need for fair trial. That is our position throughout till the end of the case. All we are saying is that he, just like any other citizen, deserves a fair trial," Moyo said.	Moyo ati: "MISA Zimbabwe ishimangira ko hakwiye kuburanishwa mu buryo buboneye. Ngiyo umwanya dufite kugeza urubanza rurangiye. Icyo tuvuga ni uko we kimwe n'undi muturage wese, akwiye kuburanishwa mu buryo buboneye."
Moyo, a Zimbabwean national, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.	Moyo, ufite ubwenegihugu bwa Zimbabwe, aramutse ahamwe n'icyaha, ashobora gufungwa imyaka 10.
	
Zimbabwe Police Block Main Opposition Rallies	Abapolisi ba Zimbabwe bahagaritse imyigaragambyo y’abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi
Zimbabwe police Saturday blocked the country's main opposition party from holding rallies ahead of March 26 elections to fill seats that have fallen vacant since the general election in 2018. The police says the rally ban in Mavhunga, about 80 kilometers east of Harare, is meant to ensure peace and stability.	Ku wa gatandatu, abapolisi ba Zimbabwe babujije ishyaka rikomeye ry’abatavuga rumwe n’igihugu gukora imyigaragambyo mbere y’amatora yo ku ya 26 Werurwe kugira ngo yuzuze imyanya yaguye kuva amatora rusange yabaye mu 2018. Polisi ivuga ko guhagarika imyigaragambyo i Mavhunga, nko mu birometero 80 mu burasirazuba bwa Harare, bigamije guharanira amahoro n'amahoro.
Police camped overnight Friday at a venue in Marondera, where the leader of Zimbabwes main opposition, the Citizens Coalition for Change, Nelson Chamisa, was supposed to address his supporters Saturday. The 44-year-old candidate later came to disperse the crowd waiting for him.	Ku wa gatanu, abapolisi bakambitse ahitwa Marondera, aho umuyobozi w’ishyaka ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi bwa Zimbabwes, Nelson Chamisa, yagombaga kuvugana n’abamushyigikiye ku wa gatandatu. Umukandida w'imyaka 44 yaje kuza gutatanya imbaga imutegereje.
"We are a party of peace, a party of the rule of law," he said.	Ati: "Turi ishyaka ry'amahoro, ishyaka ryo kugendera ku mategeko".
Chamisa said his party does not want to fight with people. He said the government denied permission to hold a rally, so the party asked for permission to come and tell about that. He told his supporters he does not want the politics of Zimbabwe to cause any death. Then he added that what the government does not know is that here in Marondera, his arrival is good enough.	Chamisa yavuze ko ishyaka rye ridashaka kurwana n'abantu. Yavuze ko guverinoma yanze uruhushya rwo gukora imyigaragambyo, bityo ishyaka risaba uruhushya rwo kuza kubivuga. Yabwiye abamushyigikiye ko adashaka ko politiki ya Zimbabwe itera urupfu urwo ari rwo rwose. Hanyuma yongeyeho ko icyo guverinoma itazi ari uko hano i Marondera, kuhagera kwe ari byiza bihagije.
In an interview Sunday, Fadzayi Mahere, the Citizens Coalition for Change spokeswoman said her party was not happy with the bias of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and the police in favor of the ruling ZANU-PF.	Mu kiganiro, Fadzayi Mahere, umuvugizi w’ishyirahamwe ry’abaturage riharanira impinduka yavuze ko ishyaka rye ritishimiye kubogama kwa komisiyo y’amatora ya Zimbabwe na polisi bashyigikiye ZANU-PF iri ku butegetsi.
"Our rally in Marondera was purportedly banned and yet ZANU-PF was car rally and other unsanctioned in the very same area," she said. "Not once have they sought authorization or given notice to the police, yet these unlawful prohibitions are meted out against us. Ours is a struggle of non-violent resistance. However, the thousands that came out just to hear president Chamisa speak shows beyond any doubt that the citizens are prepared to do whatever it takes to reclaim their dignity. We continue to urge supporters to register to vote in their masses so that we attain our target in 2023: A landslide victory."	Ati: "Imyigaragambyo yacu i Marondera byavuzwe ko yabujijwe nyamara ZANU-PF yari igiterane cy'imodoka ndetse n'ibindi bitemewe mu gace kamwe." "Ntabwo bigeze basaba uruhushya cyangwa ngo babimenyeshe abapolisi, nyamara ibyo bibujijwe mu buryo bunyuranyije n'amategeko byadushimishije. Iwacu ni urugamba rwo kurwanya ihohoterwa. Icyakora, ibihumbi n'ibihumbi byasohotse kugira ngo twumve perezida Chamisa avuga ibitaramo birenze ibyo ari byo byose. gushidikanya ko abaturage biteguye gukora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo bagarure icyubahiro cyabo. Turakomeza gusaba abayoboke kwiyandikisha kugira ngo batore mu mbaga yabo kugira ngo tugere ku ntego yacu mu 2023: Intsinzi idasanzwe. "
Zimbabwe police Sunday refused to comment on the ban of the Citizens Coalition for Change in Marondera. It issued a letter to the opposition saying it needed time to prepare to ensure there was peace at the rally. Two weeks ago, violence instigated by suspected ruling ZANU-PF supporters at a Citizens Coalition for Change rally resulted in two deaths and dozens injured.	Ku cyumweru abapolisi ba Zimbabwe banze kugira icyo batangaza ku ihagarikwa ry’abenegihugu baharanira impinduka muri Marondera. Yasohoye ibaruwa abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi ivuga ko hakenewe igihe cyo kwitegura kugira ngo imyigaragambyo ibe amahoro. Ibyumweru bibiri bishize, urugomo rwatewe n’abakekwaho kuba bashyigikiye ZANU-PF mu myigaragambyo y’abaturage iharanira impinduka zahitanye abantu babiri abandi benshi barakomereka.
Alexander Rusero, a former senior politics lecturer at Harare Polytechnic college, says police and political parties must thwart violence at opposition rallies.	Alexander Rusero wahoze ari umwarimu mukuru muri politiki muri kaminuza ya Harare Polytechnic, avuga ko abapolisi n’imitwe ya politiki bagomba gukumira ihohoterwa mu myigaragambyo itavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.

Polisi yataye muri yombi abantu 16 bakekwaho kuba bashyigikiye ZANU-PF baregwa kuba barateje urugomo none bakaba bakurikiranyweho ubwicanyi bakekwaho kuba barapfiriye mu myigaragambyo y'abatavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.
Zimbabwes pre-election season has been marred by violence that has claimed lives and left thousands injured since 2000 after a strong opposition party emerged.	Igihembwe cy’amatora mbere ya Zimbabwes cyaranzwe n’urugomo rwahitanye abantu kandi rukomeretsa abantu ibihumbi kuva mu 2000 nyuma y’ishyaka rikomeye ritavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi.
	
A Zimbabwe Court Dismisses Suspension of Striking Teachers	Urukiko rwa Zimbabwe rwanze ihagarikwa ry’abarimu bigaragambyaga
Zimbabwe's High Court has voided the government's three-month suspension of striking teachers, ruling the ministry of education overstepped its authority. The teachers went on strike last week over poor salaries just as schools were set to reopen after a long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts say children's education has been caught in the crossfire.	Urukiko rukuru rwa Zimbabwe rwanze ko guverinoma ihagarika amezi atatu ihagarika abarimu bigaragambyaga, ivuga ko minisiteri y’uburezi yarenze ububasha bwayo. Mu cyumweru gishize abarimu bagiye mu myigaragambyo kubera umushahara muke nkuko amashuri yari yiteguye gufungura nyuma yikiruhuko kirekire kubera icyorezo cya COVID-19. Abasesenguzi bavuga ko uburezi bw'abana bwafatiwe mu muriro.
Zimbabwes High Court has ruled the suspension of striking teachers by Evelyn Ndlovu, Zimbabwes minister of primary and secondary education, was illegal.	Urukiko rukuru rwa Zimbabwes rwemeje ko ihagarikwa ry’abarimu bigaragambyaga na Evelyn Ndlovu, minisitiri w’ishuri ryibanze n’ayisumbuye rya Zimbabwes, bitemewe.
Noble Chinhanu of the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum represented the teachers in court.	Noble Chinhanu wo mu ihuriro ry’imiryango itegamiye kuri Leta iharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu muri Zimbabwe yari ahagarariye abarimu mu rukiko.
"We managed to present our arguments before the court and the judge has given us an order to the effect that the press statement that was issued by the minister of primary and secondary education is illegal and unconstitutional," said Chinhanu. "We managed to prove that our client has a right not to be suspended in such a manner which was in violation of public service regulations of the nation."	Chinhanu yagize ati: "Twashoboye gutanga ibitekerezo byacu imbere y'urukiko kandi umucamanza yaduhaye itegeko kugira ngo itangazo ry'abanyamakuru ryatanzwe na minisitiri w'amashuri abanza n'ayisumbuye bitemewe kandi binyuranyije n'Itegeko Nshinga." "Twashoboye kwerekana ko umukiriya wacu afite uburenganzira bwo kudahagarikwa mu buryo bunyuranyije n'amategeko agenga abakozi ba Leta."
Government officials have not commented on the court ruling.	Abayobozi ba leta ntacyo batanze ku cyemezo cy'urukiko.
Schools in Zimbabwe closed last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and had been due to reopen last week.	Amashuri yo muri Zimbabwe yarafunzwe umwaka ushize mugihe cyanduye COVID-19 kandi yagombaga gufungura icyumweru gishize.
Gibson Nyikadzino, an independent political analyst, says the government and teachers must settle the strike quickly because students continue to be the losers.	Gibson Nyikadzino, umusesenguzi wa politiki wigenga, avuga ko guverinoma n'abarimu bagomba gukemura vuba imyigaragambyo kuko abanyeshuri bakomeje gutsindwa.
"We are seeing a lot of agitation and politicization of this from the employees," said Nyikadzino. "They are not keen to listen to what the employer is saying. Their parties that are being affected as a result of this, so what has to be done is go to the tripartite negotiating forum and in the spirit find a consensus."	Nyikadzino ati: "Turimo kubona imyigaragambyo myinshi na politiki mu bakozi." "Ntabwo bashishikajwe no kumva ibyo umukoresha avuga. Amashyaka yabo agira ingaruka kuri ibyo, bityo rero ikigomba gukorwa ni ukujya mu ihuriro ry’ibiganiro bitatu kandi mu mwuka ugashaka ubwumvikane."
The tripartite he refers to is the government, the workers and private companies.	Inyabutatu avuga ni guverinoma, abakozi n'ibigo byigenga.
Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association – the countrys largest teachers union – says educators want to return to work, but need more pay to sustain themselves.	Sifiso Ndlovu wo mu ishyirahamwe ry'abarimu bo muri Zimbabwe - ibihugu by’abarimu benshi mu bihugu - avuga ko abarezi bifuza gusubira ku kazi, ariko bakeneye umushahara mwinshi kugira ngo batunge.
"There are some members who are unable to travel: those who are far distant schools. They are finding it difficult because of the resources," said Ndlovu. "And there are some who are saying while we are within the school environs, we still find it difficult to find food for subsistence. That is what is mitigating against 100 percent attendance. We hope that after pay day (next week Tuesday) things will get back to normal. But that does not mean that the teachers are happy with the remuneration that they are getting. They still want some more."	Ndlovu ati: "Hariho abanyamuryango bamwe badashobora gutembera: abari kure cyane y'amashuri. Basanga bigoye kubera amikoro." "Kandi hari bamwe bavuga mu gihe turi mu nkengero z'ishuri, turacyabona ko bigoye kubona ibiryo byo gutunga. Nicyo kigabanya kugabanya kwitabira 100%. Turizera ko nyuma yo kwishyura (icyumweru gitaha ku wa kabiri) ibintu bizagenda subira mu buzima busanzwe. Ariko ibyo ntibisobanura ko abarimu bishimiye umushahara bahabwa. Baracyashaka ibindi. "
Taungana Ndoro, is the spokesman for Zimbabwes ministry of primary and secondary education and says the situation in schools now is "encouraging."	Taungana Ndoro, ni umuvugizi wa minisiteri ya Zimbabwes ishinzwe amashuri abanza n'ayisumbuye kandi avuga ko ubu amashuri ari "bishimishije."
"We have gone round in government and non-government schools, and we are quite impressed by the teaching and learning that is going on," Ndoro said. "Of course there are a few schools here and there which still face a bit of challenges."	Ndoro ati: "Twazengurutse amashuri ya leta n'ay'imiryango itegamiye kuri Leta, kandi twashimishijwe cyane n'inyigisho n'imyigishirize ikomeje." "Nibyo koko, hano hari amashuri make na n'ubu agifite ibibazo bitoroshye."
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying civil servants in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teacher wages to about $100 a month. The teachers want the $540 a month they were getting in 2018.	Impaka z’imishahara zisubira mu Kwakira 2018, igihe guverinoma yahagaritse kwishyura abakozi ba Leta mu madorari y’Amerika, ihindura amadorari ya Zimbabwe. Ifaranga rishya ryatakaje agaciro, kugabanya umushahara wa mwarimu kugera ku madolari 100 ku kwezi. Abarimu bifuza amadorari 540 ku kwezi babonaga muri 2018.
Last week the teachers rejected the governments offer of a 20 percent pay raise along with some incentives, such as housing loans.	Mu cyumweru gishize abarimu banze ko leta itanga umushahara wa 20 ku ijana hamwe n’ingamba zimwe na zimwe, nk’inguzanyo zamazu.

Ku wa kabiri, Minica Mutsvangwa, minisitiri w’itangazamakuru mu gihugu, yavuze ko umubare w’abantu bari mu bitaro bya COVID-19 ugenda ugabanuka.
"This indicates that the national response measures instituted by government continue to pay off. …In view of the continued decline in new cases and deaths, coupled with a declining testing positivity rate that is indicating that the community transmission has gone down, all ports of entry [are to] be reopened, but ensuring that all the recommended COVID-19 prevention measures are adhered to," she said.	Ibi byerekana ko ingamba z'igihugu zashyizweho na guverinoma zikomeje gutanga umusaruro.… Urebye ko umubare w'abantu bapfa ukomeje kugabanuka ndetse n'impfu, hamwe no kugabanuka kw'ibipimo byerekana ko kwanduza abaturage byagabanutse, ibyambu byose bya kwinjira [bigomba] gufungurwa, ariko kureba niba ingamba zose zisabwa zo gukumira COVID-19 zubahirizwa .
However, the compulsory vaccination rule is not being welcomed by all civil servants.	Ariko rero, itegeko ryo gukingira ku gahato ntabwo ryakirwa n'abakozi ba Leta bose.
Obert Masaraure, the president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, says the workers will take the matter to court if the government insists.	Obert Masaraure, perezida w’ishyirahamwe ry’abarimu bo mu cyaro cya Amalgamated Zimbabwe, avuga ko abakozi bazabishyikiriza urukiko niba leta ishimangiye.
"A contract that was signed by civil servants has no provision for mandatory vaccination.	Amasezerano yashyizweho umukono n'abakozi ba Leta nta tegeko ryo gukingirwa ku gahato. Niba rero komisiyo ishinzwe abakozi ba leta ishaka kubuza abakozi ba leta badakingiwe, barenze ku masezerano kandi ntibyemewe. Icya kabiri, abakozi ba leta bafite uburenganzira bwo kubahwa, bafite uburenganzira bwo guhitamo. Nta muntu ushobora guhatirwa ibintu by'amahanga kwinjizwa mu mibiri yabo .
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, says his organization has noted that several other countries are moving towards compulsory vaccination.	Dr. Norman Matara, ukuriye ishyirahamwe rya Zimbabwe ry’abaganga baharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu, avuga ko umuryango we wagaragaje ko ibindi bihugu byinshi bigenda bikingira inkingo.
"It is something that we are strongly against. We think mandating vaccines is something that fuels vaccine hesitance.	Ni ikintu turwanya cyane. Turatekereza ko gutanga inkingo ari ikintu gitera inkeke. Hano haribintu byinshi byubugambanyi bigenda iyo abantu bavuga ko duhatiwe gukingirwa. Tugomba rwose kubona ibyo abantu bagura: gukwirakwiza ubutumwa bwiza bw'inkingo, uko bakora hanyuma dushishikarize abantu gukingirwa kandi ntibahatire gukingirwa .
But Sifiso Ndlovu from the Zimbabwe Teachers Association supports the governments position.	Ariko Sifiso Ndlovu wo mu ishyirahamwe ry'abarimu ba Zimbabwe ashyigikiye umwanya wa guverinoma.
"Definitely, all workers should take up the vaccination.	Mu byukuri, abakozi bose bagomba gufata urukingo. 
About 3.3 million people in Zimbabwe have received two shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, while about 86,000 have received a third jab.	Abantu bagera kuri miliyoni 3.3 muri Zimbabwe bakiriye amasasu abiri yinkingo za COVID-19, mugihe abagera ku 86.000 bahawe jab ya gatatu.
A number of Zimbabweans have refused to get vaccinated, saying they do not trust the mainly donated Chinese-made Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.	Abatari bake bo muri Zimbabwe banze gukingirwa, bavuga ko batizeye inkingo za Sinopharm zakozwe mu Bushinwa na Sinovac.
	
Zimbabwe Teachers, Calling Pay Insufficient, Refuse to Teach	Abarimu ba Zimbabwe, bivugwa ko bahabwa umushahara udahagije banze kwigisha
Many Zimbabwean schools that closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic remain shuttered as teachers refuse to return to the classroom, citing a need for better pay.	Amashuri menshi yo muri Zimbabwe yafunzwe kubera icyorezo cya COVID-19 akomeje gufungwa kuko abarimu banze gusubira mu kazi, bavuga ko bakeneye umushahara uhagije.
No media source currently available	Nta bitangazamakuru bya vuba aha bihari.
The teachers are paid less than $100 a month. The government has offered a 20 percent pay increase and other incentives, but the teachers have rejected that offer as insufficient.	Abarimu bahembwa amafaranga atarenga 100 ku kwezi. Guverinoma yatanze umushahara wiyongereyeho 20 ku ijana n'agahimbazamusyi, ariko abarimu babyanze bavuga ko ibyo bidahagije.
Meanwhile, some youths are studying independently. One such student, a 16-year-old, said, "My appeal [to the government] is for a salary increment for teachers so that they come to work, because we arent learning. Its like we are paying fees for nothing. Its so painful as my parents are struggling for it when I am not learning at all."	Hagati aho, hari bamwe mu rubyiruko biga mu mashuri yigenga. Umwe mu banyeshuri nk'abo, ufite imyaka 16, yagize ati: "Icyifuzo cyanjye [kuri guverinoma] ni ukongera umushahara ku barimu kugira ngo baze ku kazi, kuko twatangiye amashuri yaratangiye. Bisa nkaho twishyurira ubusa. Birababaje  cyane kubona ababyeyi banjye bakora ibishoboka byose ngo nige,  ariko nkaba ntarimo kwiga na gato. "
The pay dispute goes back to October 2018, when the government stopped paying teachers in U.S. dollars, switching to the reintroduced Zimbabwean dollar. The new currency has steadily lost value, effectively reducing teachers' wages.	Imishahara ya mbere y'ukwezi k' UKwakira 2018, igihe guverinoma yahagarikaga kwishyura abarimu mu madorari y'Abanyamerika, ahubwo ikabishyura mu madorari ya Zimbabwe. Ifaranga rishya ryatakaje agaciro, bituma umushahara wabo ugabanuka.
Obert Masaraure, president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, said the instructors want their old salaries restored and that the offer of a 20 percent raise amounted to almost nothing.	Obert Masaraure, perezida w’urugaga rw ’abarimu bo mu cyaro cya Amalgamated muri Zimbabwe, yasabye imishahara y'abarimu ya mbere  yavugururwa kandi ko inyongera  ya 20 ku ijana nta kintu na kimwe imaze.
"We asked for the restoration of salaries, which were robbed from us by the government of the day," Masaraure said. "And the message to the government is clear: We need our pre-October 2018 salaries of 540 dollars U.S. We know these shenanigans of adding an extra dollar to our salaries — that does not add up."	Masaraure ati: "Twasabye guverinoma iriho kuvugurura imishahara tugahabwa umushahara wari uriho mbere Kandi ubutumwa kuri guverinoma burasobanutse: Dukeneye imishahara ibanziriza Ukwakira 2018 y'amadorari 540 y'Abanyamerika. Turabizi iyi gahunda  yo kongera amadorari  ku mushahara - ibyo ntacyo bifasha."
Government officials see the ongoing talks in a different light and voice optimism about a successful resolution.	Abayobozi ba leta bakomeje ibiganiro mu buryo butandukanye kandi bafite icyizere cyo gukemura  iki kibazo  neza.
Paul Mavima, Zimbabwe's minister of public service, labor and social welfare, said, "In many ways we already have a breakthrough. The leaders of the workers have to a very large extent welcomed this package and they are only saying: Lets discuss how it is going to be implemented."	Minisitiri w’imirimo ifitiye igihugu akamaro, umurimo n’imibereho myiza y’abaturage muri Zimbabwe, Paul Mavima, yagize ati:  Tumaze gutera intambwe mu nzira zitandukanye zo gukemura ibibazo. Abakoresha bagomba kwishimira cyane iyi gahunda bagafata umwanya wo kuganira ku buryo igiye gushyirwa mu bikorwa. "
The teachers and government are expected to meet in coming days to resume negotiations. Meanwhile, students wait to resume their studies months after the COVID-19 pandemic forced their schools to close.	Biteganijwe ko abarimu na guverinoma bazahura mu minsi iri imbere kugira ngo bakomeze ibiganiro. Hagati aho, abanyeshuri bategereje gukomeza amasomo yabo nyuma y'amezi ashize batiga kubera icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyatumye amashuri afunga.
	
Private Military Contractors Bolster Russian Influence in Africa	Abasirikare bigenga bita Bolster bo mu burusiya bagira uruhare muri Afrika
Russia's geopolitical ambitions in Africa have in recent years been backed by private military contractors, often described as belonging to the "Wagner group" — an entity with no known legal status.	 Intego z’uburusiya muri Afurika muri iyi myaka yashize zashyigikiwe n’abasirikare bigenga, bakunze kuvuga ko bari mu itsinda rya "Wagner" - umuryango bivugwa ko udafite ubuzima gatozi.
Most recently, Western nations have condemned the alleged arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali's capital Bamako, a claim denied by the junta that seized power in 2020.	Vuba aha, ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byamaganye ibivugwa ko haje abacanshuro b’Uburusiya mu murwa mukuru wa Mali Bamako,iki kirego kikaba cyarahakanywe na Junta wafashe ubutegetsi mu 2020.
As relations with France worsen, the military rulers may be looking for ways to make up for shrinking numbers of European troops fighting Mali's years-old jihadist insurgency.	Mugihe umubano n’Ubufaransa urushijeho kuba mubi, abategetsi b’igisirikare bashobora kuba bashaka uburyo bwo kugabanya umubare w’ingabo z’i Burayi zirwanya inyeshyamba za Jihadiste zimazeyo  imyaka n' imyaka.
"Mercs [mercenaries] working in Africa is an established norm" thanks in part to decades of operations by contractors from South Africa, said Jason Blazakis of the New York-based Soufan Group think tank.	Jason Blazakis wo mu kigo gifasha mu gutekereza cya Soufan Group gikorera i New York yagize ati: "Abacanshuro  bakorera muri Afurika ni itegeko  ryashyizweho".
"The Wagner folks are walking through a door that has long been open to their ilk," he added.	Yongeyeho ati: "Umuryango umaze igihe kinini ufunguye ku bantu bashaja kwinjira muri Wagner""
No information is publicly available about the group's size or finances.	Nta makuru yashyizwe ahagaragara kubyerekeye ingano y' abagize iri tsinda cyangwa kubijyanye n'imari yaryo.
But around Africa, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington has found evidence since 2016 of Russian soldiers of fortune in Sudan, South Sudan, Libya, the Central African Republic (CAR), Madagascar and Mozambique.	Ariko hirya no hino muri Afurika, Ikigo gishinzwe ibijyanye n'ubushakashatsi mpuzamahanga (CSIS) i Washington cyabonye ibimenyetso kuva mu 2016 by’abasirikare b’Uburusiya bagiye  muri Sudani, Sudani yepfo, Libiya, Repubulika ya Centrafrique (CAR), Madagasikari na Mozambike.
Botswana, Burundi, Chad, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are also on the CSIS's list.	Botswana, Burundi, Tchad, Comoros, Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, Congo-Brazzaville, Gineya, Gineya-Bissau, Nijeriya na Zimbabwe na byo biri ku rutonde rw'ibihugu bizagibwamo na CSIS.
In Africa "there is a convergence of many states' interests, including China's," Alexey Mukhin of the Moscow-based Centre for Political Information told AFP.	Alexey Mukhin wo mu kigo gishinzwe amakuru ya politiki i Moscou yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abafaransa ati: "Muri Afurika" hari ihuriro ry' ibihugu byinshi’i z’ibihugu byinshi rigamije iterambere  harimo n’Ubushinwa. "
"Every state has the right to defend its business assets," he added.	Yongeyeho ati: "Buri gihugu gifite uburenganzira bwo kurengera umutungo wacyo mu bucuruzi ."
Wagner does not officially exist, with no company registration, tax returns or organizational chart to be found.	Wagner ntabwo izwi  kumugaragaro, si sosiyete yanditswe izwi,ntigaragaza imisoro itanga cyangwa inzego zayo z'ubuyobozi.
When the EU wanted to sanction the group in 2020, it targeted Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin who is suspected of running Wagner.	Igihe Umuryango w'ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi washakaga kwemerera uyu mutwe mu 2020, wibasiwe na  oligarch wo mu Burusiya Yevgeny Prigozhin, umufasha wa Perezida Vladimir Putin akaba akekwaho kuyobora Wagner.
It imposed further sanctions in December last year when mercenaries' arrival in Mali appeared certain — drawing accusations of "hysteria" from Moscow.	Wongeye gufatirwa ibihano mu Kuboza umwaka ushize ubwo abacanshuro byagaragaye ko bageze  muri Mali.  bashinja "hysteria" i Moscou.
Western experts say military contractors are embedded in Russia's official forces like intelligence agencies and the army, providing plausible deniability for Moscow.	Impuguke z’iburengerazuba zivuga ko ingabo za gisirikare zinjiye mu butegetsi bw’Uburusiya nk’inzego z’ubutasi n’ingabo, ibyo ariko Moscou ikabihakana.
Their deployment to African countries aims to "enable Russia to... regain this sphere of influence" that fell away with the collapse of the Soviet Union, said CSIS researcher Catrina Doxsee.	Koherezwa kwabo mu bihugu bya Afurika bigamije "gutuma Uburusiya buzahuka... kugira ngo buzahure ubukungu  bwagizweho ingaruka no gusenyuka kw'Abasoviyeti, nk'uko byatangajwe n'umushakashatsi wa CSIS, Catrina Doxsee.
The mercenaries' presence has been growing even faster since a 2019 Russia-Africa summit.	Abacanshuro bariyongereye cyane kuva  2019aho inama nyafurika n'uburusiya itangiriye..
Moscow has been active "especially in what has traditionally been France's zone of influence" in former colonies like CAR and Mali, said Djallil Lounnas, a researcher at Morocco's Al Akhawayn university.	Djallil Lounnas, umushakashatsi muri kaminuza ya Al Akhawayn ya Maroc, yatangaje ko Moscou yagize uruhare "cyane cyane mu byahoze ari akarere k’Ubufaransa".
While military contractors sometimes shepherd Russian arms sales, the revenue "really pales compared with the profit they are able to generate from mining concessions and access to natural resources," Doxsee said.	Doxsee yagize ati: "Nubwo abashoramari rimwe na rimwe bagerageza kugurisha ibirwanisho by’Uburusiya, amafaranga binjiza ni make  rwose ugereranije n’inyungu bashobora kubona mu bucukuzi bw’amabuye y'agaciro no kubona umutungo kamere ".
That makes unstable countries with mineral or hydrocarbon wealth prime customers — such as in Syria where the mercenaries first became known to the wider public.	Ibyo bituma ibihugu bifite ubutunzi kamere bihungabana kandi byari bifite abakiriya ba mbere. Twavuga muri rusange  nko muri Siriya aho abacanshuro bamenyekanye bwa mbere.
No questions asked	Nta kibazo cyabajijwe
Lounnas said that another advantage for clients is a lack of friction over human rights and democracy that might come with Western partners.	Lounnas yavuze ko indi nyungu ku bakiriya ari ukutumvikana kukijyanye n' uburenganzira bwa muntu na demokarasi bishobora kuzanwa n'abafatanyabikorwa bo mu Burengerazuba.
"Russia has its interests. It doesn't ask questions," he added.	Yongeyeho ati: "Uburusiya bufite inyungu zabwo. Ntabwo bubaza ibibazo".
Reports of violence and abuse on the ground suggest that same latitude may extend to the mercenaries themselves.	Raporo  z' ihohoterwa hanze aha zerekana ko uburinganire bushobora kugera no kubikorera ubwabo.
In the CAR, the United Nations is probing an alleged massacre during a joint operation by government forces and Wagner fighters.	Muri CAR, Umuryango w’abibumbye urimo gukora iperereza ku bwicanyi bwabaye hagati y'ingabo za leta n’abarwanyi ba Wagner.
One military source told AFP that more than 50 people died, some in "summary executions."	Hari igitabo kimwe cya gisirikare cyatangarije AFP ko abantu barenga 50 bapfuye, mucyo bise "kwicwa muri make."
On Thursday, the European Union said it would not resume military training in the CAR — suspended since mid-December — unless the country's soldiers stop working for Wagner.	Ku wa kane, Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi wavuze ko utazongera imyitozo ya gisirikare muri CAR - yahagaritswe kuva hagati mu Kuboza - keretse igihe  abasirikare b’iki gihugu bazaba bahagaritse gukorera Wagner.
Meanwhile the mercenaries' results do not always measure up to the hopes of the governments that hire them.	Hagati aho ariko, ibikorwa by'abacanshuro ntabwo buri gihe bisibiza ibyifuzo bya guverinoma iba yabahaye akazi.
In Libya, Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses in Marshal Khalifa Haftar's year-long attempt to conquer the capital Tripoli, which was ultimately unsuccessful.	Muri Libiya, abacanshuro b'Abarusiya bagize igihombo kinini muri Marshal Khalifa Haftar umwaka wose kukon bagerageje kwigarurira umurwa mukuru Tripoli, ariko ntibyashoboka.
And in Mozambique, the Russians retreated in the face of Islamic State group jihadists, ultimately losing out to South African competitors.	Kandi muri Mozambike, Abarusiya igihe bari bateganye n' abajihadiste bo mu mutwe wa kisilamu basubira inyuma, nyuma baza nabo gutsindwa n’abarwanyi ba Afurika yepfo.
Although lacking language skills and experience with the terrain, Wagner "were picked because they were the cheapest", Doxsee said.	Doxsee yavuze ko nubwo badafite ubumenyi bw’ururimi n'uburambe kuri ubu butaka, Wagner "batoranijwe kubera ko ari bo bahendutse".
"They didn't have what it took to succeed," she added, noting that "they've had a fair few failures" across Africa.	Yongeyeho ati: "Ntabwo bari bafite icyo basabwa kugira ngo batsinde." Yongeyeho ko "batsinzwe bitari bike" muri Afurika.
Succeeding completely might actually harm the mercenaries' business model, which thrives on unrest, conflict and crisis.	Intsinzi irashobora rwose kwangiza ibikorwa byubucuruzi bwabacanshuro, bitera imbere mumidugararo, amakimbirane nibibazo.
"If a country such as the CAR hires them to train forces, to help them in their military efforts, its in their interest to accomplish that just well enough to continue to be employed," Doxsee said.	Doxsee ati: "Niba igihugu nka CAR kibahaye akazi ko gutoza ingabo, no kubafasha mu bikorwa byabo bya gisirikare, ni ngombwa kubahiriza izo nshingano kugira ngo bakomeze guhabwa akazi".
"If they actually were to do it well enough to resolve the conflict, they would no longer be needed."	Baramutse babikoze neza bagakemura amakimbirane, ntibakongera gukenerwa
	
Cyclone Batsirai Weakens After Hitting Madagascar, Floods Feared	Inkubi y'umuyaga mwinshi bise cyclone Batsirai wagabanutse  Nyuma yo Guhuha muri Madagasikari ugateza umwuzure
Cyclone Batsirai weakened overnight but floods were still expected due to heavy rain after it hit eastern Madagascar with strong winds, the island's meteorological office said Sunday.	Ibiro by'iteganyagihe kuri iki kirwa byatangaje ko ku cyumweru inkubi y'umuyaga Batsirai yagabanutse ariko ko hateganijwe umwuzure kubera imvura nyinshi ivanze n'umuyaga yibasiye uburasirazuba bwa Madagasikari.
"Batsirai has weakened," Meteo Madagascar said, adding that the cyclone's average wind speed had almost halved to 80 kph, while the strongest gusts had scaled back to 110 kph from the 235 kph recorded when it made landfall on Saturday evening.	Ikigo gishinzwe iteganyagihe muri Madagascar cyagize kiti: "Batsirai yagabanutse" Yongeyeho ko umuvuduko ukabije w’umuyaga wari wikubye kabiri kugera kuri 80 kph,kuko umuyaga mwinshi wagabanutse kugera kuri 110 kph kuri 235 kph  ku mugoroba wo ku wa Gatandatu.
The cyclone, the second storm to hit the large Indian Ocean island nation in just a few weeks, was moving westwards at a rate of 19 kph, the meteorological services said.	Serivisi z’iteganyagihe zavuze ko inkubi y'umuyaga, inkubi y'umuyaga ya kabiri yibasiye igihugu kinini cyegereye  inyanja y'Abahinde mu byumweru bike gusa, yaganaga iburengerazuba ku kigero cya 19 kph.
But "localized or generalized floods are still feared following the heavy rains," it said, adding that Batsirai should emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later Sunday.	Ati: "Ariko imyuzure muri rusange iracyateye ubwoba kuko hateganijwe imvura nyinshi", ikomeza ivuga ko Batsirai izagera mu nyanja igana kuri  Mozambique nyuma yicyumweru.
Batsirai made landfall in Mananjary district, more than 530 kilometers southeast of the capital Antananarivo, around 8 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) Saturday.	Batsirai yageze mu karere ka Mananjary, mu birometero birenga 530 mu majyepfo y’umurwa mukuru Antananarivo, ahagana mu ma saa munani. Isaha yaho (1700 GMT) Kuwa Gatandatu.
It reached the island as an "intense tropical cyclone", packing winds of 165 kph, Faly Aritiana Fabien of the country's disaster management agency told AFP.	Faly Aritiana Fabien wo mu kigo gishinzwe imicungire y’ibiza yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abafaransa (AFP) agira ati:
The national meteorological office has said it fears "significant and widespread damage."	Ikigo cy’igihugu cy’iteganyagihe cyatangaje ko gifitiye ubwoba ukwangirika gukabije kugiye kuba."
Just an hour and a half after it first hit land, nearly 27,000 people had been counted as displaced from their homes, Fabien said.	Fabien yavuze ko nyuma y'isaha imwe n'igice ubutaka buri bwibasirwe,abantu bagakurwa mubyabo, asaba ko abagera ku 27.000 bagomba kuba bavanywe aho.
He said his office has accommodation sites, food and medical care ready for victims, as well as search and rescue plans already in place.	Yavuze ko ibiro bye bifite aho gucumbika, ibyo kurya ndetse n’ubuvuzi byiteguye kwakira abahohotewe, ndetse na gahunda yo gukurikirana no gutabara bimaze gutegurwa.
Very serious threat'	umutingito ukomeye'
The Meteo-France weather service had earlier predicted Batsirai would present "a very serious threat" to Madagascar, after passing Mauritius and drenching the French island of La Reunion with torrential rain for two days.	Serivisi ishinzwe ikirere cya mu bufaransa yari yavuze yuko Batsirai ikomeye izaboneka muri Madagasikari ivuye muri Maurice kandi ko hazaba umuhengeri muri La Reunion mu Bufaransa ukazamara iminsi ibiri.
In the hours before the cyclone hit, residents hunkered down in the impoverished country, still recovering from the deadly Tropical Storm Ana late last month.	Mu masaha make mbere yuko inkubi y'umuyaga yibasira abantu,  abaturage bahungiye mu gihugu gikennye, bari  kuva muri Tropical Storm kuko hari abantu yari yishe mu mpera z'ukwezi gushize.
In the eastern coastal town of Vatomandry, more than 200 people were crammed in one room in a Chinese-owned concrete building.	Mu mujyi wa Vatomandry uri mu burasirazuba bw'inyanja, abantu barenga 200 bashyizwe ahantu hamwe bita Beto mu nzu imwe y'abashinwa.
Families slept on mats or mattresses.	Imiryango yararaga ku misambi cyangwa kuri za matora.
Community leader Thierry Louison Leaby lamented the lack of clean water after the water utility company turned off supplies ahead of the cyclone.	Umuyobozi w’abaturage, Thierry Louison Leaby, yinubiye ko nta mazi meza babona nyuma y’uko ikigo gishinzwe iby' amazi cyahagaritse gukomeza kuyatanga mbere y'inkubi y' umuyaga.
"People are cooking with dirty water," he said, amid fears of a diarrhea outbreak.	Ati: "Abantu barimo gutekesha amazi mabi", Dufite ubwoba bwo kwandura 'indwara y'impiswi.
Outside plastic dishes and buckets were placed in a line to catch rainwater dripping from the corrugated roofing sheets.	Hanze hashyizweyo ibikoresho  bya pulasitike harimo indobo  kugirango amazi y'imvura agwemo avuye ku mabati.
"The government must absolutely help us. We have not been given anything," he said.	Ati: "Guverinoma igomba kudufasha rwose. " Kugeza ubu ntakintu iraduha.
Residents who chose to remain in their homes used sandbags and yellow jerrycans to buttress their roofs.	Abaturage bahisemo kuguma mu ngo zabo bagakoresha imifuka irimo umucanga n'amajerekane y'umuhondo kugirango bakomeze ibisenge by'amazu  yabo.
Cyclone still 'dangerous'	Inkubi y'umuyaga iracyateje akaga 
Other residents of Vatomandry were stockpiling supplies in preparation for the storm.	Abandi baturage ba Vatomandry bari guteganya ibikoresho kugirango bitegure umuyaga.
"We have been stocking up for a week, rice but also grains because with the electricity cuts we cannot keep meat or fish," said Odette Nirina, a 65-year-old hotelier in Vatomandry.	Odette Nirina ukora muri Hoteri muri Vatomandry, ufite imyaka 65 y'amavuko  yagize ati: "Tumaze icyumweru duhunitse umuceri n' ingano ariko kuko umuriro w' amashanyarazi wabuze ntidushobora kubika inyama cyangwa amafi".
"I have also stocked up on coal. Here we are used to cyclones," she told AFP.	Yabwiye  AFP ati: "Nanjye nabitse amakara. Hano tumenyereye inkubi y'umuyaga."
Winds of more than 50 kph pummeled Vatomandry on Saturday morning, accompanied by intermittent rain.	Umuyaga uvanze n' imvura nkeya urenga 50 kph wasunitse Vatomandry mu gitondo cyo kuwa Gatandatu.
The disaster agency said the cyclone was expected to remain "dangerous" as it swept across the large island overnight and in the morning.	Ikigo gishinzwe ibiza cyavuze ko hateganijwe  inkubi y'umuyaga izakomeza guteza akaga kuko yambukiranya ikirwa kinini amanywa n' ijoro
Flooding is expected due to excessive rainfall in the east, southeast and central regions of the country, it warned.	Biteganijwe ko hazaba umwuzure kubera imvura nyinshi yo mu burasirazuba, mu majyepfo y’iburasirazuba no hagati mu gihugu.
The United Nations was ramping up its preparedness with aid agencies, placing rescue aircraft on standby and stockpiling humanitarian supplies.	Umuryango w’abibumbye ufatanije  n’inzego z’ubutabazi, uri gutegura indege z’ubutabazi n' ibikoresho by' ubutabazi.
At least 131,000 people were affected by Ana across Madagascar in late January. Close to 60 people were killed, mostly in the capital Antananarivo.	Nibura abantu 131.000 bibasiwe na Ana hirya no hino muri Madagasikari mu mpera za Mutarama. Abantu bagera kuri 60 bitabye imana cyane cyane mu murwa mukuru Antananarivo.
That storm also hit Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, causing dozens of deaths.	Iyo nkubi y'umuyaga yibasiye kandi Malawi, Mozambique na Zimbabwe, ihitana abantu benshi.
The U.N.'s World Food Program pointed to estimates from national authorities that some 595,000 people could be directly affected by Batsirai, and 150,000 more might be displaced due to new landslides and flooding.	Umuryango w'abibumye ushinzwe inkunga y'ibiribwa ku isi yagaragaje ibigereranyo byatanzwe n’ubuyobozi bw’igihugu ko abantu 595.000 bashobora kwibasirwa na Batsirai, naho abandi 150.000 bakaba bashobora kuvanwa mubyabo kubera inkangu igiye kuza n’umwuzure.

US Catholic Clergy Shortage Eased by Recruits From Africa	Ubuke bw'abayobozi b'amadini gatolika bo muri Amerika bwatewe nuko  baza muri Afurika
The Rev. Athanasius Chidi Abanulo — using skills honed in his African homeland to minister effectively in rural Alabama— determines just how long he can stretch out his Sunday homilies based on who is sitting in the pews.	Nyiricyubahiro Athanasius Chidi Abanulo  Muri Afurika- akoresha ubuhanga cyane kugira ngo akorere neza mu cyaro cya Alabama - agena igihe ashobora gusura imiryango  ku cyumweru ahereye ku uwubabaye.
Seven minutes is the sweet spot for the mostly white and retired parishioners who attend the English-language Mass at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the small town of Wedowee. "If you go beyond that, you lose the attention of the people," he said.	Iminota irindwi ni myiza kubazungu bera kandi bari mukiruhuko k'izabukuru mu kwitabira itabira misa yo mu cyongereza kuri Kiliziya Gatolika yitwa Immaculate Conception iri mu mujyi muto wa Wedowee. Ati: "ibirenze kuri ibyo, byaba ari ukutita kubaturage ".
For the Spanish-language Mass an hour later, the Nigerian-born priest — one of numerous African clergy serving in the U.S. — knows he can quadruple his teaching time. "The more you preach, the better for them," he said.	Nyuma yisaga imwe Misa yo mu Cyesipanyoli irangiye, umupadiri wavukiye muri Nijeriya - umwe mu bapadiri benshi bo muri Afurika bakorera muri Amerika - azi ko ashobora gukuba hafi inshuro enye igihe cyo kwigisha. Ati: "Nukomeza kubwiriza, ni byiza kuri bo."
As he moves from one American post to the next, Abanulo has learned how to tailor his ministry to the culture of the communities he is serving while infusing some of the spirit of his homeland into the universal rhythms of the Mass.	Mu gihe avuye kumwanya umwe w'umunyamerika akajya kuwundi, Abanulo yashakishije uburyo ahuza akazi n'umuco w'abaturage akorera kugira ngo azane umwuka mwiza w'ubwumvikane muri Misa. 
"Nigerian people are relaxed when they come to church," Abanulo said. "They love to sing, they love to dance. The liturgy can last for two hours. They don't worry about that."	Abanulo ati: "Abanyanijeriya bararuhuka iyo baje mu rusengero." "Bakunda kuririmba, bakunda kubyina. Liturujiya ishobora kumara amasaha abiri. Ubona ko ntacyo bibatwaye."
During his 18 years in the U.S., Abanulo has filled various chaplain and pastor roles across the country, epitomizing an ongoing trend in the American Catholic church. As fewer American-born men and women enter seminaries and convents, U.S. dioceses and Catholic institutions have turned to international recruitment to fill their vacancies.	Mu myaka 18 yamaze muri Amerika, Abanulo yujuje inshingano zitandukanye z'abapadiri n'abapasitori mu gihugu hose, akomeza guteza imbere amahame ya kiliziya Gatolika y'Abanyamerika. Mu gihe abagabo n'abagore bake bavukiye muri Amerika binjira mu maseminari no mu makoraniro, diyosezi zo muri Amerika hamwe n’ibigo gatolika byahinduye abakozi mpuzamahanga kugira ngo babone imyanya yabo.
The Diocese of Birmingham, where Abanulo leads two parishes, has widened its search for clergy to places with burgeoning religious vocations like Nigeria and Cameroon, said Birmingham Bishop Steven Raica. Priests from Africa were also vital in the Michigan diocese where Raica previously served.	Diocese ya Birmingham, Steven Raica, yatangaje ko Diyosezi ya Birmingham, aho Abanulo ayoboye paruwasi ebyiri, iri gushakisha abapadiri bayobora ahantu bahuje imyizerere nko muri Nigeriya na Kameruni. Abapadiri bo muri Afurika nabo ni  ingenzi muri diyosezi ya Michigan aho Raica yakoreraga mbere.
"They have been an enormous help to us to be able to provide the breadth and scope of ministry that we have available to us," he said.	Ati: "Byadufashije cyane kugira ngo tubashe kwigisha ubutumwa bwiza.
Africa is the Catholic church's fastest-growing region. There, the seminaries are "fairly full," said the Rev. Thomas Gaunt, director of Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, which conducts research about the Catholic church.	Muri Afurika, abakirisitu ba kiliziya gatolija bari kugenda biyongera. Kuko rwose hari na za seminari zuzuye ", nk'uko byatangajwe na nyiricyubahiro Thomas Gaunt, umuyobozi w'ikigo cya kaminuza ya Georgetown gishinzwe ubushakashatsi bukoreshwa muri Apostolate, gikora ubushakashatsi kuri kiliziya gatolika.
Falling numbers	Kugabanuka
It's different in the U.S. where the Catholic church faces significant hurdles in recruiting home-grown clergy following decades of declining church attendance and the damaging effects of widespread clergy sex abuse scandals.	Bitandukanye cyane no muri Amerika aho kiliziya Gatolika ihura n'imbogamizi zikomeye zo kujyana abapadiri bashaje mu kiruhuko k'izabukuru bagejeje ku myaka  ibarirwa muri za mirongo batitaye kungaruka  mbi ziterwa n’ihohoterwa rishingiye ku gitsina ry’abapadiri baba barakorewe.
Catholic women and married men remain barred from the priesthood; arguments that lifting those bans would ease the priest shortage have not gained traction with the faith's top leadership.	Abagabo n'abagore bubatse ingo bakomeje kubuzwa kuba abapadiri; Hari ingingo zivuga ko kubuza abo bantu kuba abapadiri bitigeze bituma habaho ibura ry' ubuyobozi bukuru muri kiriziya.
"What we have is a much smaller number beginning in the 1970s entering seminaries or to convents across the country," Gaunt said. "Those who entered back in the '50s and '60s are now elderly, and so the numbers are determined much more by mortality."	Gaunt ati: "Icyo dufite ni umubare muto cyane guhera mu myaka ya za 70 winjira mu maseminari cyangwa mu makoraniro hirya no hino." "Abinjiye mu myaka ya za 50 na 60 ubu barashaje, bigaragazwa n'umubare w'abapfuye."
From 1970 to 2020, the number of priests in the U.S. dropped by 60%, according to data from the Georgetown center. This has left more than 3,500 parishes without a resident pastor.	Kuva mu 1970 kugeza 2020, umubare w'abapadiri muri Amerika wagabanutseho 60%, nk'uko amakuru ava mu kigo cya Georgetown abitangaza. Ibi byatumye paruwasi zirenga 3.500 zisigara zidafite aba padiri.
Abanulo oversees two parishes in rural Alabama. His typical Sunday starts with an English-language Mass at Holy Family Catholic Church in Lanett, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Birmingham along the Alabama-Georgia state line. After that, he is driven an hour north to Wedowee, where he celebrates one Mass in English, another in Spanish.	Abanulo yayoboraga paruwasi ebyiri zo mu cyaro cya Alabama.  Misa yo kucyumweru ayitangira mu rurimi  rwo mucyongereza kuri kiliziya gatolika ya Holy Family i Lanett, iri nko mu bilometero 200 uvuye i Birmingham   hafi ya Alabama-Jeworujiya. Nyuma yaho, ajyanwa mu majyaruguru yerekeza i Wedowee, aho ayobora Misa imwe yo mu cyongereza, indi mu cyesipanyoli.
"He just breaks out in song and a lot of his lectures, he ties in his boyhood, and I just love hearing those stories," said Amber Moosman, a first-grade teacher who has been a parishioner at Holy Family since 1988.	Amber Moosman, umwarimu wo mu cyiciro cya mbere wakoreraga muri  paruwasi mu muryango mutagatifu kuva mu 1988, yagize ati: "Yatangiye akunda  kuririmba kuva mu bwana bwe agakurirana inyigisho," nkunda kumva amateka ye
For Moosman, Abanulo's preaching style is very different from the priests she's witnessed previously. "There was no all of a sudden, the priest sings, nothing like that. … It was very quiet, very ceremonial, very strict," she said. "It's a lot different now."	Moosman ati" uburyo bwo kubwiriza bwa Abanulo butandukanye cyane nubw' abapadiri bamubanjirije. Ati: "Biratangaje cyane kubona umupadiri ukunda kuririmba, ntako bisa. "
Abanulo was ordained in Nigeria in 1990 and came to the U.S. in 2003 after a stint in Chad. His first U.S. role was as an associate pastor in the diocese of Oakland, California, where his ministry focused on the fast-growing Nigerian Catholic community. Since then, he has been a hospital chaplain and pastor in Nashville, Tennessee, and a chaplain at the University of Alabama.	Abanulo yahawe inshingano muri Nijeriya mu 1990 avuye muri Amerika mu 2003 nyuma ajya gukorera muri Tchad. Inshingano yagize bwa mbere muri Amerika ni uko yabaye umushumba wungirije muri diyosezi ya Oakland, muri Californiya, aho ibikorwa bye byibanze ku muryango w'Abagatolika bo muri Nijeriya ugatera imbere. Kuva icyo gihe, yabaye umupadiri w'umwanditsi aba n'umushumba i Nashville, muri Tennesse, akaba n'umupadiri muri kaminuza ya Alabama.
Amid the U.S. clergy shortage, religious sisters have experienced the sharpest declines, dropping 75% since 1970, according to the Georgetown center.	Nk’uko ikigo cya Georgetown kibitangaza  kivuga ko mu gihe abapadiri bo muri Amerika babuze, Aba masera nabo bagabanutse 75% kuva mu 1970.
Culture shocks	Umuco uhungabana
When Maria Sheri Rukwishuro was told she was being sent from the Sisters of the Infant Jesus order in Zimbabwe to West Virginia to work as a missionary nun, she asked her mother superior, "Where is West Virginia?"	Igihe uwitwa Maria Sheri Rukwishuro yamenyeshwaga  ko yoherejwe kuba umu masera ugiye gufasha abana bato mu gukurikira Yesu muri Zimbabwe ahitwa Virijiniya y’Uburengerazuba ,byari ukugira ngo akore nkumubikira w'umumisiyonari, nuko abaza Umubikira mukuru ati: "Virginie y'Uburengerazuba iri he?"
She was scared, worrying about the unknowns.	Yagize ubwoba, ahangayikishwa no kutamenyekana.
"What kind of people am I going to? I'm just a Black nun coming to a white country," Rukwishuro told The Associated Press from Clarksburg, West Virginia, where she has been teaching religious education to public and Catholic school students since arriving in 2004.	Rukwishuro yatangarije ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abanyamerika avuye i Clarksburg, muri Virijiniya y’Uburengerazuba, aho yigishaga inyigisho z’idini ku banyeshuri bo mu mashuri ya Leta b'aba gatolika kuva yahagera, ati: "Njya mu bantu bwoko ki? Ndi umubikira w'umwirabura nkaba najya mugihugu cy'abazungu ." muri 2004.
Rukwishuro vividly remembers that at her introduction, a little girl walked to her and "rubbed her finger on my fingers all the way, then she looked at her finger and she smiled but my heart sank. … She thought I was dirty." Despite that, Rukwishuro says most people have been very welcoming. She's now a U.S. citizen and says, "It feels like home."	Rukwishuro yibuka neza ko agitangira, umukobwa muto yaramwegereye maze amufata urutoki hanyuma abibonye aramwenyura ariko umutima we uradagadwa.… Yatekereje ko nanduye." Nubwo bimeze bityo, Rukwishuro avuga ko abantu benshi bakiriwe neza. Ubu afite ubwenegihugu bwa Amerika ati: "Numva ari murugo."
One of her first culture shocks was an overnight snowfall. "I really screamed. I thought it was the end of the world," she said. "Now I love it. I do my meditations to that."	Imwe mu mico ye ya mbere yatunguye ni ukurira kwe nijoro. Ati: "Naramwinginze rwose. Natekerezaga ko isi irangiye" "Ubu ntakibazo ariko gihari. Nkora ibyo nshaka."
During their integration into American life, it is commonplace for newly arrived clergy to face culture shocks.	Mu gihe cyo kwisanisha n'imico y' abanyamerika, birasanzwe ko abapadiri bashya bahageze bahita bisanisha nimico yabo
For Sister Christiana Onyewuche of Nigeria, a hospital chaplain in Boston administering last rites for the dying, it was cremation. She recalled thinking, "Like really? … How can they burn somebody? I can't even imagine."	Umubikira witwa Christiana Onyewuche wo muri Nijeriya, yabonye umupadiri i Boston ayoboye imihango yo gushyingura, abona bidasanzwe. Atangira kwibaza ati: ibi ni ukuri?… Nigute bashobora gutwika umuntu? ati" sindi kubyiyumvisha.
She came to the U.S. 18 years ago and previously served as the president of African Conference of Catholic Clergy and Religious, a support group for African missionaries serving in the U.S.	Hashize imyaka 18 ubwo aheruka muri Amerika,  mbere yari perezida w’inama nyafurika y’abayobozi ba kiliziya gatolika n’amadini, itsinda rishyigikira abamisiyoneri bo muri Afurika bakorera muri Amerika
Jesus necks'	Yesu nijosi '
Onyewuche said African clergy can face communication challenges with the Americans they serve. To address this, many dioceses have offered training to soften accents, she said. Abanulo, who went through the training in Oakland, says it helped him slow down his speech and improve his pronunciations.	Onyewuche yavuze ko abanyamadini bo muri Afurika bashobora guhura n'ibibazo by'itumanaho hagati yabo n' Abanyamerika bakorera. Yavuze ko kugira ngo iki kibazo gikemuke, diyosezi nyinshi zatanze amahugurwa ajyanye nuburyo bwo koroshya imvugo. Abanulo wanyuze mu mahugurwa muri Oakland, avuga ko byamufashije kuko yamenye kuvuga neza mu mvugo yoroheje.
Abanulo, who moved to Alabama in 2020, admits he was initially apprehensive about his latest posting, which meant exchanging a comfortable role as university chaplain for two rural parishes.	Abanulo, wimukiye muri Alabama mu 2020, yemera ko yabanje kugira ubwoba ku byo aheruka kohereza, bivuze ko yahinduye inshingano akabona izindi nziza kuko yabaye umuyobozi wa kaminuza kuri paruwasi ebyiri zo mu cyaro.
"People were telling me 'Father, don't go there. The people there are rednecks,'" he said.	Ati: "Abantu barambwiraga bati 'Data, ntujyeyo. Abantu baho ntago bize ni injiji
But after a year, and a warm reception, he says he now tells his friends, "There are no rednecks here. All I see are Jesus necks."	Ariko nyuma y' umwaka, bari bamaze kungirira urugwiro,abwira inshuti ze ati: "Hano nta njiji zihari. Aba Bose ureba ni intore za Yesu."
	
US to Lift Travel Ban on 8 Southern African Countries	Amerika kugirango ikureho ingendo mu bihugu 8 byo muri Afrika yepfo
The U.S. will lift travel restrictions to eight southern African countries on New Year's Eve, the White House announced Friday.	Ku wa gatanu, White House yatangaje ko Amerika izakuraho inzitizi z’ingendo mu bihugu umunani byo muri Afurika yepfo.
The restrictions, imposed last month, were meant to blunt the spread of the COVID omicron variant.	Ibibujijwe, byashyizweho mukwezi gushize, byari bigamije guhagarika ikwirakwizwa rya COVID omicron.
The Nov. 29 ban barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who had recently been in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.	Itegeko ryo ku ya 29 Ugushyingo ryarebaga abaturage bose batari Abanyamerika bari baherutse kuba muri Afurika y'Epfo, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibiya, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique na Malawi.
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said on Twitter that the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Munoz said the temporary travel bans bought scientists necessary time to study the new virus variant and conclude that the current vaccinations are effective in blunting its impact.	Umuvugizi wa White House, Kevin Munoz, kuri Twitter yavuze ko iki cyemezo cyasabwe n'ikigo gishinzwe kurwanya no gukumira ibiza,  Munoz yavuze ko guhagarika ingendo by'agateganyo byasuzumwe  n'abahanga  muburyo bwo kubona igihe gihagije cyo gusuzima ubwoko bushya bwa virusi. Maze  asoza avuga ko inkingo ziriho ubu zifite akamaro mu guhosha ingaruka zatewe n'icyorezo.
Omicron is now spreading rapidly throughout the U.S., including among the vaccinated, but a huge majority of those being hospitalized are unvaccinated.	Ubu Omicron iri gukwirakwira hose muri Amerika, harimo no mu bakingiwe, ariko umubare munini w'abari mu bitaro ni abatarakingiwe.
"The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, esp boosted," Munoz wrote on Twitter.	Munoz yanditse kuri Twitter ati: "Amabwiriza yaduhaye umwanya wo gusobanukirwa Omicron kandi tuzi ko inkingo zacu zisanzwe zirwanya Omicron,harimo nurwo gushimangira".
	
Charting the Future of China’s Infrastructure Projects in Africa After a Decade of Lending	Ishusho  y'ejo hazaza y' ibikorwa  Remezo by'Ubushinwa muri Afurika Nyuma y'Imyaka icumi bariyo.
China is financing the construction of four coal-fired power plants in southern Africa, despite its climate pledge in September to quit supporting such infrastructure overseas. But the new facilities taking shape in South Africa and Zimbabwe are just a few of Beijings massive investments in airports, railway lines and other national infrastructure on the African continent.	Ubushinwa butera inkunga iyubakwa ry’amashanyarazi ane akoreshwa  muri Afurika yepfo, nubwo muri Nzeri bwiyemeje kureka gutera inkunga ibikorwa remezo mu mahanga. Ariko hari inyubako nshyashya zigenda zubakwa muri Afrika yepfo na Zimbabwe ugereranije no muri Beijings kandi ho hariyo ishoramari ryiza, imihanda ya gari ya moshi n'ibindi bikorwa remezo byigihugu kumugabane wa Afrika.
Many countries have been eager for the investment, but mounting levels of debt over the past five years are raising doubts about the long-term prospects for more expensive infrastructure projects.	Ibihugu byinshi bishishikajwe n’ishoramari, ariko kwiyongera kwinguzanyo mu myaka itanu ishize itera gushidikanya ku cyerekezo k'ibikorwa remezo bihenze.
	
China committed to lending African countries $153 billion from 2000-2019, but that pace of lending may be slowing down. Chinese loan commitments dropped by 30% in 2019 when compared with the previous year, according to the China-Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. The research looks at loan commitments which get "disbursed to borrowers as projects are implemented."	Ubushinwa bwiyemeje kuguriza ibihugu by'Afurika miliyari 153 z'amadolari kuva 2000-2019, ariko uwo muvuduko wo gutanga inguzanyo uri kugenda gahoro. Icyemezo cyo gutanga inguzanyo cy’Abashinwa bagabanyijeho 30% muri 2019 ugereranije n’umwaka ushize, nk'uko byatangajwe n’ubushakashatsi bw’Ubushinwa-Afurika mu Ishuri Rikuru ry’Ubushakashatsi mpuzamahanga rya Johns Hopkins. Ubushakashatsi bukora ku igenamigambi ry' imishinga ishyirwa mubikorwa."
In Zambia for example, Chinese financiers committed $10.3 billion in loans from 2000-2010.Since 2000, Zambia has only repaid some $1.2 billion to Chinese lenders.	Urugero, muri Zambiya, abanyemari b'Abashinwa batanze miliyari 10.3 z'amadolari y'inguzanyo froconcern 010. Kuva mu 2000, Zambiya yishyuye gusa miliyari 1.2 z'amadolari y'abashinwa.
Uganda now owes China $200 million for its only international airport, fanning fears that China could seize it. Both countries have rejected speculation in African media outlets of a Chinese takeover.	Ubu Uganda ifitiye Ubushinwa miliyoni 200 z'amadolari kubera ikibuga cy’indege mpuzamahanga,ifite ubwoba ko Ubushinwa bushobora kuyishyuza. Ibihugu byombi byanze kugira icyo bibivugaho mu bitangazamakuru byo muri Afurika.
Loan repayment measures Neighboring Kenya had received a $4.5 billion loan to build a railway from Nairobi to the port city of Mombasa, and China indicates it will redo the terms after a committee of the African countrys parliament found that operating losses and debt to Chinese banks were straining taxpayers.	Ibyemezo byafashwe byo kwishyura inguzanyo Kenya yari yarahawe ya miliyari 4.5 z'amadolari yo kubaka umuhanda wa gari ya moshi uva Nairobi ujya mu mujyi wa Mombasa ku cyambu,Ubushinwa bugaragaza ko buzongera amasezerano nyuma yuko komite y'inteko ishinga amategeko y'ibihugu by'Afurika isanze haragaragaye igihombo cyatewe n'amadeni yafashwe mu mabanki y'Ubushinwa ibyo bikaba binaniza abasoreshwa.
Some analysts have warned that opaque lending terms means China could eventually seize infrastructure should countries struggle to meet repayments	Bamwe mu basesenguzi baburiye abantu ko amasezerano yo gutanga inguzanyo adasobanutse bivuze ko Ubushinwa bushobora gufata ibikorwa remezo mu gihe ibihugu byananirwa kwishyura
U.S. and British officials say, "debt traps," where countries cannot raise enough money to repay Chinas loans, are structured to give Beijing leverage over time. Last month, the head of Britains Secret Intelligence Service, Richard Moore, in an interview with BBC Radio 4 said Beijing can acquire "significant ports which have the potential to become naval facilities etcetera."	Abayobozi b'Abanyamerika n'Abongereza baravuga bati: Mu madeni harimo amanyanga"  aho ibihugu bidashobora gukusanya amafaranga ahagije yo kwishyura inguzanyo z'ubushinwa,ibyo byakozwe kugira ngo Beijing yongererwe igihe. Mu kwezi gushize, umuyobozi w’ishami rishinzwe iperereza ry’Ubwongereza, Richard Moore, mu kiganiro na Radiyo BBC 4 yavuze ko Beijing ishobora kubona "ibyambu bikomeye bifite ubushobozi bwo gitwara ibikoresho by’amato n'ibindi."
Sri Lanka earlier this year passed legislation that critics say will give China control over a key deep-water port that Beijing financed.	Sri Lanka mu ntangiriro z'uyu mwaka yashyizeho amategeko, ariko abayinenga bavuga ko izaha izemerera ubushinwa kugenzura icyambu cy'amazi maremare ibifashijwemo na Beijing.
But that has not happened so far in Africa, where Chinese diplomats reject seizures are a part of Beijings strategy.	Ariko ibyo ntibiragera muri Afurika, aho abadipolomate b'Abashinwa banga gufatwa,ubwo nibwo buryo  Beijings ikoresha.
"Not a single project in Africa has ever been "confiscated" by China because of failing to pay Chinese loans. On the contrary, China firmly supports and is willing to continue our efforts to improve Africa's capacity for home-driven development," stated the Chinese Embassy in Uganda.	Ati: "Nta mushinga n'umwe muri Afurika wigeze " ufashwa" n'Ubushinwa kubera ko Afurika itishyuye inguzanyo z'Abashinwa. Ahubwo, Ubushinwa buri gushyigikira byimazeyo kandi bwiteguye no gukomeza kutwongerera imbaraga kugira ngo Afurika itere imbere mu iterambere ry' umuryango. Ibyo bikaba byaratangajwe na Ambasade y'Ubushinwa muri Uganda.
Instead of seizing assets, Beijing will likely extend deadlines for loan repayment or rework payback terms such as interest rates, analysts told VOA. Those measures would avert takeovers of the infrastructure itself and in turn preserve Chinas reputation in Africa where trade and lending have bested its superpower rival in dollar terms.	Aho gufatira imitungo, Beijing irashobora kongera igihe ntarengwa cyo kwishyura inguzanyo cyangwa kongera gusubiramo bundi bushya amabwiriza yo kwishyura nk'inyungu, nkuko abasesenguzi babitangarije VOA. Iki cyemezo cyo kwanga gufatira ibikorwa remezo biratuma  izina rya Chinas muri Afrika ritangirika imbere y' ibihugu by'ibihangange bihanganye mu bucuruzi n'inguzanyo mu mikoreshereze y' idolari.
China will probably "keep kicking the can down the road" until creditors find the means to settle the loans, Bulelani Jili, an African studies Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University, told VOA.	Birashoboka ko Ubushinwa "buzakomeza gutinza ikorwa ry' imihanda" kugeza igihe abahawe inguzanyo babonye uburyo bwo kwishyura inguzanyo, ibi byatangajwe na Bulelani Jili, ufite impamyabumenyi y'ikirenga muri Afurika.Akaba n'umunyeshuri muri kaminuza ya Harvard, niko yabwiye VOA.
To confiscate any assets, including minerals, would "confirm peoples initial biases of China as a neocolonial actor," Jili said, and risk upsetting diplomatic ties with "some of the few friends that China has on the global stage."	Jili yagize ati: "Kwambura umutungo uwo ari we wese, harimo n'amabuye y'agaciro byagaragaza ko abantu bafata ubushinwa nkaho buri mu gihe cy'ubukoroni kandi ibyo bishobora guhungabanya umubano w’ibihugu n'ububanyi n’amahanga hamwe na zimwe mu nshuti nke Ubushinwa bufite ku isi yose. "
"From the China side, its about getting access to new possible markets and expanding both economic activity — also the diplomatic relation," he said.	Ati: "Kuruhande rw' ubushinwa rwitaye  ku bijyanye no kubona aho bwabona amasoko mashya ahantu hose  hashoboka no kwagura ibikorwa by’ubukungu - ndetse n’ububanyi n’amahanga."
Chinese loan concerns	Ibyerekeranye n' inguzanyo y'Ubushinwa
China encourages lending to Africa in search of high returns on investments and a global reputation as a supporter of poor countries, said Edward Miguel, Oxfam professor in Environmental Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. It is trying to "equal the U.S." as a donor country, he said.	Ubushinwa bushishikariza Afurika mu gufata inguzanyo ku nyungu nyinshi no mubijyanye n' ishoramari ndetse no ku isi hose murwego rwo gushyigikira ibihugu bikennye, nk'uko byatangajwe na Edward Miguel, umwarimu wa Oxfam mu bijyanye n'ubukungu bushingiye ku bidukikije muri kaminuza ya Californiya, Berkeley yavuze ko  Ubushinwa buri kugerageza kumera kimwe na Amerika" nk'igihugu cy'abaterankunga.
However, China differs from other international lenders and donors mainly for its relative lack of transparency that raises questions in Africa as well as in the West, Miguel believes.	Miguel yemeza ko ariko, Ubushinwa butandukanye n’abandi batanga inguzanyo n’abaterankunga kubera ahanini kuba butagaragaza umucyo mubijyanye n'inguzanyo, ibyo bitera Afurika kwibaza ibibazo ndetse no mu Burengerazuba.
Unlike loans from western governments or international lending bodies like the World Bank, which require labor and environmental safeguards on financed projects, Chinas aid and loans to Africa have been described as "no strings attached," which has been attractive for many countries. But African nations, especially with economies slipping because of the impacts of COVID-19, face increasing trouble paying back loans, said Hannah Ryder, senior associate with the Africa Program at the U.S. think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.	Bitandukanye n’inguzanyo zitangwa na guverinoma y’iburengerazuba cyangwa imiryango mpuzamahanga itanga inguzanyo nka Banki y’isi, kuko yo isaba imishinga  ijyanye no kubungabunga ibidukikije kugira ngo iterwe inkunga, inahabwe imfashanyo n’Abashinwa. Inguzanyo muri Afurika zasobanuwe  nta bufatanye bushimishije mu bihugu byinshi buhari Ariko ibihugu by'Afurika, cyane cyane ko ubukungu bwifashe nabi kubera ingaruka za COVID-19, ibyo bikiyongera ku kibazo cyo kwishyura inguzanyo nk'uko Hannah Ryder, umufatanyabikorwa mu kuru muri gahunda ya Afurika mu kigo gishinzwe iby'imitekerereze cya Amerika gishinzwe gufata ingamba n’ubushakashatsi mpuzamahanga yabitangaje.
"China and other countries are becoming more sophisticated in bargaining with one another," wrote Deborah Brautigam of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Business School's Meg Rithmire in a joint article.	Mu kiganiro bahuriyemo, Deborah Brautigam wo mu Ishuri Rikuru ry’Ubushakashatsi Mpuzamahanga muri kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins na Meg Rithmire w’ishuri ry’ubucuruzi rya Harvard, yanditse ati: "Ubushinwa n’ibindi bihugu biri kurushaho kugirana ubwumvikane"
Residents in Dakar, Senegal, where the 500-person Forum on China-Africa Cooperation meeting took place on November 29-30, want more Chinese-funded infrastructure but without debt levels like those of the 1990s, Ryder noted.	Ryder yavuze ko ubwo habaga inama yabatuye i Dakar, muri Senegali, ihuriro ry’abantu 500 ry’inama y'ubufatanye bw’Ubushinwa na Afurika yabaye ku ya 29-30 Ugushyingo, bifuzaga ko ibikorwa remezo byaterwa inkunga n’abashinwa ariko nta nguzanyo batse nkiyo mu myaka ya za 90.
Chinese creditors are expected to lend less money to Africa going forward and more carefully analyze the projects those loans support, experts say. Loans have already "sobered down" [tapered off] from a peak in 2014, Jili said.	Impuguke zivuga ko Abashoramari b'Abashinwa bateganya gutanga amafaranga make muri Afurika kandi bagasesengura neza imishinga izo nguzanyo ziza gushyigikira. Jili yavuze ko inguzanyo zimaze "kugabanuka" kuva muri 2014.
Commitments for loans and other investments made at the China-Africa Cooperation meeting came to $40 billion, one-third less than the $60 billion made at the same conference in 2018.	Ingamba zafashwe mu gutanga inguzanyo mu ishoramari, zafatiwe mu nama y’ubufatanye bw’Ubushinwa na Afurika, bemeje ko izamanuka kugeza kuri miliyari 40 z'amadolari, hanyuma miliyari 60 z'amadolari yo akaba yaratanzwe mu nama  yo mu 2018.
Lenders may calibrate loans based on predictions of a post-pandemic future when African countries have more cash, said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington. Another option, she said, is to ensure Chinese equity from future projects as repayment for older loans, she said in a VOA interview.	Yun Sun, umuyobozi wa gahunda ya Aziya y'Uburasirazuba mu kigo cya Stimson i Washington, yatangaje ko abatanga inguzanyo bashobora guhitamo inguzanyo zishingiye ku kureba uko bizagenda nyuma y'icyorezo mu gihe ibihugu by'Afurika bifite amafaranga menshi. Mu kiganiro VOA yavuze ko ubundi buryo bushoboka , ari ukureba niba Ubushinwa buzatanga amahirwe angana kubihugu mu minsi iri imbere mu kwishyura inguzanyo za kera
"Its politically risky, because although its not an equity-asset swap, it smells a lot like some sort of swap, and [that] China is exploiting Africas weak position, so I dont think it will happen in the immediate future and in fact this debt restructuring is also taking quite a while," Sun said.	sun yagize ati:''Iki ni ikibazo cya politiki gishobora guteza akaga, kubera ko kutanganya imitungo bimeze nkaho ari  byiza ariko kandi Ubushinwa buca intege Afurika , ku buryo ntekereza ko bizabaho mu gihe cya vuba kandi mu byukuri uku kuvugurura imyenda nabyo bifata igihe kitari gito.
China is becoming more confident all the while in setting up international public-private partnerships, though many African countries still worry about a repeat of the debt crisis in the 1980s and 1990s when nations could not pay off debt, Ryder says in an African Business commentary. International organizations ultimately wrote off that wave of unaffordable debt with conditions including opening "their economies to international trade, liberalize their currencies and drastically cut costs in exchange for loans," wrote Peter Fabricius in the Institute for Security Studies.	Ryder avuga ko Ubushinwa bugenda bugira icyizere mu mikoranire mpuzamahanga ya Leta n’abikorera ku giti cyabo, nubwo ibihugu byinshi bya Afurika bikomeje guhangayikishwa n' ikibazo cy’imyenda yo mu myaka ya za 1980 na 1990 igihe ibihugu bitashoboye kwishyura imyenda, nk'uko Ryder abitangaza. . Peter Fabricius mu kigo cy’ubushakashatsi mubijyanye n'umutekano yaranditse ati: "Imiryango mpuzamahanga yamaze gusonera imyenda itakibasha kwishyurwa, harimo iy'ibiribwa, ubukungu bwabo muby' ubucuruzi mpuzamahanga, kwishyira ukizana kwabo no kugabanya amafaranga menshi kugira ngo bahabwe inguzanyo ".
Fast forward to the present, with loans from China, African countries, Miguel said, often end up asking "what did we agree to do" and "how much do we owe" China.	Miguel yavuze ko kugeza ubu byihuta cyane,  inguzanyo zituruka mu Bushinwa,zijya mu bihugu bya Afurika, akenshi zikurikirwa no kubaza icyo abanyafurika bazazikoresha, ndetse no kubaza ngo ni abantu bangahe zigenewe ngo bazazikoreshe?
	
Dutch Test for New Variant After Finding 61 COVID Cases Among South Africa Passengers	Ubu Buholandi bufite ibipimo by a Covid Nyuma yo Kubona abantu  61 banduye  Covid 19 b'abagenzi  muri Afrika yepfo
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they had detected 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew Friday from South Africa and were now doing further tests to see whether any are infected with the new omicron variant.	Inzego z’ubuzima z’Ubuholandi zavuze ko ku wa gatandatu zabonye abantu 61 COVID-19 mu bantu bahagurutse ku wa gatanu bava muri Afurika yepfo none bakaba barimo gukora ibindi bizamini kugira ngo barebe niba hari abanduye icyorezo  kihinduranya gishya.
The cases were discovered among around 600 passengers who arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on two flights Friday before the Dutch government halted air traffic from southern Africa due to concerns over the variant.	Abagaragawe ho n'ubwandu ni mu bagenzi bagera kuri 600 bageze ku kibuga cy’indege cya Schiphol cya Amsterdam mu ndege ebyiri ku wa gatanu mbere yuko guverinoma y’Ubuholandi ihagarika ingendo z’indege ziva muri Afurika yepfo kubera impungenge zatewe n'icyorezo kihinduranya.
Dutch health authorities said Saturday they also would seek to contact travelers who had arrived from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe since Monday and urge them to take a test as soon as possible.	Inzego z’ubuzima z’Ubuholandi zavuze ko ku wa Gatandatu nazo zishaka kuvugana n’abagenzi bari baturutse muri Afurika yepfo, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia na Zimbabwe kuva ku wa mbere kandi bakazabasaba kwipimisha vuba bishoboka.
The passengers from Friday's flights were kept separated from other travelers and those who tested positive are being kept in isolation at a hotel near the airport.	Abagenzi bavuye mu ndege ku wa Gatanu bipimishije bashyizwe mu kato muri hoteri iri hafi y'ikibuga cy’indege.
A spokesperson for the health ministry said it would not be known until later Saturday whether any of passengers are infected with the new variant.	Umuvugizi muri minisiteri y’ubuzima yavuze ko bitaramenyekana niba  hari abagenzi banduye iyo variant nshya kugeza kuwa Gatandatu
A spokesperson for KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the airline was trying to determine what rules were in place as of Friday morning to prevent people with COVID-19 infections from boarding the flights, which departed from Cape Town and Johannesburg.	Umuvugizi wa KLM, wo mu ishami ry'abashinzwe ingendo z'indege mu buholandi, yavuze ko indege zigerageza kubahiriza amategeko yashyizweho mu gitondo cyo kuri uyu wa Gatanu kugira ngo abantu banduye COVID-19 batinjira mu ndege  zaturutse i Cape Town na Johannesburg.
Rules on the company's website said passengers had to present a negative COVID-19 "rapid antigen" test result taken 24 hours before departure but were not required to show proof of vaccination.	Kurubuga  rw'itumanaho rw’isosiye  batangaje ko abagenzi bagombaga kwerekana ibisubizo bya COVID-19 byafashwe mbere y'amasaha 24 mbere yo kugenda ariko si ngombwa kwerekana ibyangombwa byuko bakingiwe.
Really Weird' Paula Zimmerman, a Dutch photographer who returned from a family visit in South Africa on Friday morning, said the situation for the passengers on the planes was chaotic, as they were kept waiting on the tarmac and in the terminal for hours.	Mu byukuri Weird 'Paula Zimmerman, umufotozi mu buholandi ubwo yagarukaga avuye gusura umuryango we muri Afurika yepfo mu gitondo cyo kuri uyu wa Gatanu, yavuze ko ikibazo cy’abagenzi mu ndege cyari akajagari, kuko bakomeje gutegereza kuri gari ya moshi kugeza amasaha yari ateganijwe arangiye.
Zimmerman was told she had tested negative at 4 a.m., almost 18 hours after landing in Amsterdam, but said she then found out she was standing right next to a man who knew he had tested positive for an infection.	Zimmerman yavuze ko yipimishije saa yine za mugitondo agasanga atanduye icyorezo, nyuma y'amasaha 18 nyuma yo guhaguruka n'indege kuri Amsterdam, yavuzeko yahise amenya ko yicaye  iruhande rw'umugabo wari wanduye icyorezo .
"It was really weird.	Abantu bagombaga kugira amakenga
There was no coordination.	Ntagahunda ihamye  yari ihari.
There were too few people and there really wasnt anybody who took control." Having spent hours on a flight that likely had many infected passengers made Zimmerman anxious for the days to come, she said. "Ive been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days.	Hari yo abantu  bake cyane kandi mu by'ukuri ntabugenzuzi bwari buhari"Ati:" Ibaze kumara amasaha menshi mu ndege kandi bishoboka ko hari abagenzi benshi banduye ! Ibyo byatumye Zimmerman ahangayika bikomeye dore ko yari amaze kubwirwa ko  bazipimisha nyuma y'iminsi itanu.
It's a little scary the idea that you've been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive."	Byari biteye ubwoba kubona mu ndege umuntu yicaranye n'abantu benshi banduye "
The Dutch flight ban does not mean that all flights from southern Africa to the Netherlands are halted, as Dutch citizens are allowed to return home, while EU citizens are allowed entry in transit to their home countries.	Guhagarika indege y’Ubuholandi ntibisobanura ko ingendo zose ziva muri Afurika yepfo zerekeza mu Buholandi zahagaritswe, kubera ko abaturage b’Ubuholandi bemerewe gusubira mu rugo, mu gihe abanyaburayi bemerewe kujya mu bihugu byabo.
Medical staff, airline crews and people with pressing needs are also still allowed to travel. KLM will continue flights to the region, but travelers need to stay in quarantine for at least five days upon arrival in the Netherlands.	Abakozi bo mu buvuzi, abakozi b'indege hamwe n' abantu bafite ibibazo byingutu nabo baracyemerewe gukora ingendo. KLM izakomeza ingendo zerekeza mu karere, ariko abagenzi bazajya bashyirwa mu kato byibura iminsi itanu bakigera mu buholandi.
The new variant has been detected just as many European countries are grappling with a surge in coronavirus cases.	Icyorezo gishya kihinduranya cyamenyekanye nkuko ibihugu byinshi byu Burayi bigenda bihura n’ubwiyongere bwa coronavirus.
The Dutch government on Friday announced the nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores as it tries to curb a record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases that is swamping its health care system.	Ku wa Gatanu, guverinoma y’Ubuholandi yatangaje ko amasaha ya nijoro, amaresitora n’amaduka menshi  bizaba bifunze mu rwego rwo gukumira ubwandu  bwa COVID-19 kwangiza ubuzima bw'abantu.

Global alarm	Impuruza ku isi
The new coronavirus variant, first detected in South Africa, has caused global alarm as researchers seek to find out if it is vaccine-resistant.	Ubwoko bushya bwa coronavirus, bwamenyekanye bwa mbere muri Afrika yepfo, bwateje ihungabana mu isi yose, abashakashatsi bihutiye kumenya niba idashobora gukingirwa.
Marc Van Ranst, the virologist who detected the new variant in Belgium, told Reuters it was more likely the infected woman had contracted the variant in Belgium rather than while traveling outside Europe.	Marc Van Ranst, inzobere mu bijyanye na virusiyatangarije Reuters ko bishoboka cyane ko uwo mugore wanduye yanduye icyorezo kihinduranya agikuye Bubiligi,kuruta ko haba ari   mu Burayi.

Zimbabwe Environmentalists Demand More Than Rhetoric on Climate Change	Abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe Barasaba ko hagira igikorwa kuruta amagambo kubijyanye  n' Imihindagurikire y'Ibihe
Environmentalists in Zimbabwe are reacting angrily to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's address at the COP26 conference, where he pledged his government's fight against deforestation and climate change. Environmentalists say the government is busy dishing out land to companies, mainly Chinese, to mine coal for energy use, which COP26 wants phased out.	Abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe bababajwe cyane  n' ijambo rya Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa yavugiye  mu nama ya COP26, aho yemeje ko guverinoma ye izarwanya itemwa ry'amashyamba n’imihindagurikire y’ikirere. Abashinzwe ibidukikije bavuga ko guverinoma ihugiye mubyo guhinga ubutaka ku masosiyete, cyane cyane Abashinwa, gucukura amakara yifashishwa mu gucanwa,ariko  COP26 ikifuza ko  byakurwaho.
Tuesday in Scotland, President Emmerson Mnangagwa addressed the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, where he urged developed countries to pay for causing global warming by emitting gases into the atmosphere.	Ku wa kabiri, muri otcosse, Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa yagejeje ijambo ku nama y’umuryango w’abibumbye ku mihindagurikire y’ibihe mu 2021, izwi ku izina rya COP26, aho yasabye ibihugu byateye imbere gucibwa a amafaranga kubera kohereza imyuka mu kirere.
He said developing nations like Zimbabwe were paying for the consequences of those emissions.	Yavuze ko ibihugu biri mu nzira y'amajyambere nka Zimbabwe byishyura ibyangijwe n'ingaruka z’ibyo byuka.
He also pledged his countrys cooperation in the fight against climate change.	Yijeje kandi ibihugu bye ubufatanye mu kurwanya imihindagurikire y’ikirere.
"Zimbabwe has revised its nationally determined contributions, a committed conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030. Comprehensive strategies are being implemented towards mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience across all sectors of our economy," Mnangagwa said.	Mnangagwa yagize ati: "Zimbabwe yavuguruye imisanzu yagenwe ku rwego rw'igihugu, yiyemeje igabanuka ry' imyuka ihumanya ikirere ku kigero cya 40% buri mwaka.
This comes at a time when environmentalists in Zimbabwe are asking the government to revoke an exploration license recently awarded to a Chinese company to mine coal for energy use.	Ibi bibaye mu gihe abashinzwe ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe basaba guverinoma kwambura uruhushya rwo gukora ubushakashatsi ruherutse guhabwa isosiyete y'Abashinwa yo gutunganya ingufu zikomoka ku makara 
The Center for Natural Resource Governance is one of the organizations opposing the license. The group promotes green energy, and fears that exploration for coal will cause greater deforestation.	Ikigo gishinzwe imicungire y'umutungo kamere nicyo gishinzwe kwambura uruhushya iyo sosiyete. Hari itsinda rizateza imbere izo ngufu ariko rifite ubwoba ko gushakisha amakara bizatera itemwa ry'amashyamba menshi.
Henry Nyapokoto, the program manager for the group, said Mnangagwas comments run contrary to what he sees going on.	Umuyobozi wa porogaramu muri iryo tsinda, Henry Nyapokoto, yavuze ko ibitekerezo bya Mnangagwas binyuranye n'uko we abona byagenda.
"But the government has been in overdrive mode to promote mining everywhere in order to reach the $12 billion mining economy. In fact, it wont (make) ecological sense for Zimbabwe to attain a $12 billion economy based on bad models of production, bad consumption, that leaves a huge ecological footprint or a legacy of an ecological disaster. We all understand that mining comes with destruction of forests that serves as carbon sinks and habitat for wildlife," Nyapokoto said.	Ariko guverinoma iri gukora ibishoboka byose ku iterambere mu bucukuzi bw'amabuye y'agaciro ahantu hose hagamijwe ku kongera ubukungu bukagera kuri miliyari 12 z'amadolari. Nyapokoto yagize ati" Twese twumva ko ubucukuzi bw'amabuye y'agaciro bwazanwa no gutema amashyamba ngo havemo  karuboni.
Nyapokoto added that Zimbabwe was exploring oil and gas on its northeast border with Zambia, another project that could lead to deforestation.	Nyapokoto yongeyeho ko Zimbabwe irimo gushakisha peteroli na gaze ku mupaka w’amajyaruguru na Zambiya, hari nundi mushinga wo gutera andi mashyamba.
"Despite the impact of oil and gas on global warming, there will be (a) visible, immediate direct effect of this oil and gas mining on local communities or ecosystems. Land will be cleared for mining and other infrastructure that is going to support that mining. That is contrary to the greening of the economy that they are talking about in Glasgow," Nyapokoto said.	Peteroli na gaze bigira ingaruka ku bushyuhe bw’isi, harimo  (a) ingaruka zitaziguye ziva muri ubwo bucukuzi bwa peteroli na gaze ku baturage cyangwa ibidukikije. Ubutaka buzareka gukoreshwa  mubucukuzi bw'amabuye y'agaciro n'ibindi bikorwa remezo. Ibyo ariko bitandukanye nibivugwa byo  kuzamura ubukungu bavuga i Glasgow, Nyapokoto.
He said Zimbabwe was in the top 10 of countries of deforestation, with about 300,000 hectares of forests destroyed annually.	Yavuze ko Zimbabwe iri mu bihugu 10 bya mbere bifite amashyamba,ikaba ifite  hegitari 300.000 z’amashyamba zangirika buri mwaka.
But Byron Zamasiya of the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association says Mnangagwa was genuine in his COP26 address about fighting deforestation caused by need for energy.	Ariko Byron Zamasiya wo mu ishyirahamwe ryita ku bidukikije muri Zimbabwe avuga ko Mnangagwa yari umunyakuri mu buyobozi bwe muri  COP26 mu kurwanya itemwa ry' amashyamba yatewe ngo bayakoremo ibicanwa.
"So, the issue of fighting deforestation is a key ingredient for addressing greenhouse gas emissions for Zimbabwe. The trees act as a carbon sink since they absorb carbon dioxide, which is a major cause of global warming. What we may want as a country is to make available alternative sources of energy, especially for the rural communities who rely on wood fuel and account for the major part of deforestation. We may also need to promote intensive farming methods as opposed to extensive farming methods that require bigger fields and the clearing of new forests for fields," Zamasiya said.	Rero, ikibazo cy'itemwa  ry'amashyamba ni kimwe mu bintu by'ingenzi mu gukemura ikibazo cya gaze muri parike ya Zimbabwe. Ibiti bikorwamo  kigasohora dioxyde de carbone, ikaba ari yo mpamvu nyamukuru itera ubushyuhe bukabije ku isi. Icyo twifuza nk'igihugu ni kugirango haboneke ubundi buryo butanga ingufu, cyane cyane kubaturage bifashisha  amavuta y’ibiti ariko ugasanga bagira uruhare runini mu gutema amashyamba.Dushobora kandi guteza imbere uburyo bwo guhinga tudatemye amashyamba.
The Environmental Management Agency in Zimbabwe has been fining people caught cutting or burning forests. But so far, that hasnt stopped the trees from coming down.	Ikigo gishinzwe kubungabunga ibidukikije muri Zimbabwe gica amande abantu bafatwa batema cyangwa batwika amashyamba. Ariko nanubu ntibyabujije ibiti kwangizwa
	
Zimbabwe Starts Vaccinating Teens Against COVID-19	Zimbabwe Yatangiye Gukingiza Abangavu mukurwanya COVID-19
President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government has announced it is starting to vaccinate Zimbabwes teenagers over the age of 16 against COVID-19, which has claimed nearly 5,000 lives and infected 13,000 in the country. Public health experts welcome the move.	Guverinoma ya Perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa yatangaje ko itangiye gukingiza abangavu ba Zimbabwes barengeje imyaka 16 murwego rwo kwirinda COVID-19, kuko yahitanye abantu bagera ku 5.000 kandi ikananduza 13.000 mu gihugu. Inzobere mu buzima rusange zishimiye iki gikorwa.
Zimbabwes acting Health and Child Care Minister Amon Murwira told journalists late Monday that the country had so far managed to vaccinate 38% of the population.	Minisitiri w’ubuzima no kwita  ku bana ba Zimbabwes, Amon Murwira aherutse kubwira abanyamakuru ku wa mbere ko iki gihugu kugeza ubu cyashoboye gukingira abaturage 38%.
He then announced the recommendation regarding those over the age of 16.	Yahise atangaza ko hagiye gukingirwa  abarengeje imyaka 16.
"Based on the available scientific data in line with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe guide, the specialist pediatricians have recommended a vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age group with the Sinovac COVID19 vaccine," said Murwira.	Murwira yagize ati: "Hashingiwe ku mibare igaragazwa n'ubushakashatsi mu bya siyansi ibyerekana kukijyanye n’ubuyobozi bushinzwe kugenzura imiti ya Zimbabwe, inzobere mu kuvura indwara z’abana basabye ko hatangwa urukingo rw’abafite imyaka 16 kugeza kuri 17 hamwe n’urukingo rwa Sinovac COVID19".
"The protocol of the younger age groups is still under consideration. The ministry wishes to advise the public that COVID19 vaccination of the 16 to 17 years age groups has been approved. The government of Zimbabwe through the Ministry of Health and Childcare is determined that Zimbabwe achieves herd immunity by end December 2021," he added.	Haracyasuzumwa niba hakingirwa abakiri bato. Minisiteri irashaka kugira inama abaturage ko urukingo rwa COVID19 rugenewe ab’imyaka 16 kugeza kuri 17 rwemejwe. Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe ibinyujije muri Minisiteri y’ubuzima n’ubuvuzi y’abana yemeje ko Zimbabwe amatungo yaho azaba afite ubudahangarwa mu mpera z'Ukuboza 2021 .
Dr. Norman Matara, the head of Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights, is hopeful the move would increase the number of people getting vaccinated and will push the country further to achieving head immunity.	Dr. Norman Matara, ukuriye ishyirahamwe rya Zimbabwe ry’abaganga baharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu, yemeza ko iki cyemezo kizongera umubare w’abantu bakingirwa kandi bikazateza imbere igihugu
"This is a welcome move, but we just hope that the vaccine will continue to be voluntary and that these teenagers will not be mandated to get vaccines in schools and colleges. But people should just continue to voluntarily get the vaccines," he said.	Ati: "Iyi ni intambwe ishimishije, ariko turizera gusa ko urukingo ruzakomeza gufatwaku bushake kandi ko ingimbi zifite uburenganzira bwo kubona inkingo mu mashuri makuru na za kaminuza. Ariko abantu bagomba gukomeza gukingirwa kubushake bwabo".
Itai Rusike, head of nonprofit Community Working Group on Health in Zimbabwe, commended the government for the announcement as it helps the country reach its target of vaccinating at least 10 million Zimbabweans — or 60% of the population — by the end of the year.	Itai Rusike, umuyobozi w’itsinda ridaharanira inyungu n'ubuzima muri Zimbabwe, yashimye guverinoma ko yafashije igihugu kugera ku ntego yo gukingira byibuze miliyoni 10 z’Abanyazimbabwe - cyangwa 60% by’abaturage - mu mpera z’umwaka.
"This is important in order to prevent the teenagers from COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and even death, especially from the looming threat of the new delta variant. It is also important that the school health coordinators are equipped with the necessary COVID-19 vaccine literacy so that they can then assist in educating the students, the teachers and support staff on the importance of getting vaccinated.

Zimbabwe President Mnangagwa to Attend COP26 Conference	Perezida wa Zimbabwe Mnangagwa yitabiriye  Inama ya COP26
Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he will attend COP26, becoming the first Zimbabwe leader to visit the United Kingdom since Zimbabwe was accused of human rights abuses and election rigging. Mnangagwa also said a U.N. rapporteur had proved his government was right about the sanctions issue.	Perezida wa Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa, avuga ko azitabira COP26, abaye umuyobozi wa mbere wa Zimbabwe wasuye u Bwongereza kuva Zimbabwe yashinjwa guhohotera uburenganzira bwa muntu no kunyereza amatora. Mnangagwa yavuze kandi ko umunyamabanga wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika yerekanye ko guverinoma ye ivugisha ukuri ku kibazo.
Winding up an annual conference of the ruling ZANU-PF party Saturday in Bindura, 80 kilometers north of Zimbabwes capital, Mnangagwa said he was looking forward to attending the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Scotland, which begins Sunday.	Mu gusoza inama ngarukamwaka y’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi rya ZANU-PF ku wa Gatandatu i Bindura, mu birometero 80 mu majyaruguru y’umurwa mukuru wa Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa yavuze ko arindiriye ko azitabira inama y’umuryango w’abibumbye izavuga ku mihindagurikire y’ibihe 2021, izwi ku izina rya COP26, muri Scotland, ikazatangira ku cyumweru.
"I wish to inform the conference that tomorrow morning (Sunday) I travel to Glasgow, United Kingdom, after over two decades have passed without Zimbabwe leadership going to United Kingdom. I have been invited by [British Prime Minister] Boris Johnson, and [he] has indicated he might meet me; one on one, as well as other leaders like India prime minister and others, we are meeting them," he said.	Ndashaka kumenyesha iyi nama ko ejo mu gitondo (ku cyumweru) nzajya i Glasgow mu Bwongereza, nyuma y'imyaka irenga makumyabiri ishize nta buyobozi bwa Zimbabwe bujya mu Bwongereza. Natumiwe na [Minisitiri w’intebe w’Ubwongereza] Boris Johnson, na  kimwe n'abandi bayobozi nka minisitiri w’intebe w’Ubuhinde n’abandi, turahura nabo.
Mnangagwa also said he was happy about a report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Alena Douhan after a two-week visit to Zimbabwe. The Belarus national urged the U.S. and other Western governments to lift sanctions they imposed on Zimbabwe nearly two decades ago and for alleged election-rigging and human rights abuses.	Mnangagwa yavuze kandi ko yishimiye raporo yakozwe n'Umunyamabanga wihariye wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika Alena Douhan muri ibi byumweru bibiri muri Zimbabwe. Umunyagihugu witwa Biyelorusiya yasabye Leta zunze ubumwe z’Amerika n’izindi guverinoma z’iburengerazuba gukuraho ibihano bafatiye Zimbabwe mu myaka hafi makumyabiri ishize ndetse no kureka kubashinja guhonyora uburenganzira bwa muntu ibinyujije mu matora
"We as government, we as ZANU-PF, have been vindicated by the report released by the United Nations special rapporteur. We should congratulate ourselves. We have never been wrong, and we shall continue always being right. Those who have been found outside the law should reckon their position," Mnangagwa said.	Twe nka guverinoma, mu ishyaka ryacu ZANU-PF, twarengewe na raporo yashyizwe ahagaragara n'umunyamabanga wihariye w'Umuryango w'Abibumbye. Tugomba kubyishimira. Ntabwo twigeze twibeshya,Munnanganwa aravuga kandi ko azakomeza guhora turangwa n'ukuri. 
But in an audio statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Harare, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said sanctions on Zimbabwes leadership were not hurting ordinary citizens.	Ariko mu byashyizwe ahagaragara  na Ambasade y’Amerika i Harare, Ambasaderi w’Amerika mu Muryango w’abibumbye Linda Thomas-Greenfield yavuze ko ibihano byahawe abayobozi ba Zimbabwe bitababaje gusa abaturage basanzwe.
"Our sanctions target individuals and institutions that are committing human rights violations. And we make every effort to ensure those sanctions do not impact the people. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a result of bad policies in Zimbabwe. What is happening in Zimbabwe is a consequence of their leadership. It is not a consequence of our sanctions, and we will always resist any criticism that says our sanctions are impacting people unfairly. We are criticized by the government [of Zimbabwe] for these actions because they know they are responsible for these actions. I regret that the special rapporteur decided to put this in [her] report," Thomas-Greenfield said.	Ibihano byacu byibanda ku bantu no ku bigo birimo guhonyora uburenganzira bwa muntu. Kandi dukora ibishoboka byose kugira ngo ibyo bihano bitagira ingaruka ku baturage. Ibibera muri Zimbabwe ni ingaruka za politiki mbi muri Zimbabwe. Ibibera muri Zimbabwe ni ingaruka z'ubuyobozi bwabo.Ntabwo ari ingaruka z'ibihano byacu, kandi tuzahora tunenga abavuga ko ibihano byacu bigira ingaruka ku bantu. Turanengwa na guverinoma [ya Zimbabwe] kubera ibyo bikorwa kuko bazi ko ari bo babishinzwe. Ndicuza kuba umunyamakuru wihariye yahisemo kubitangaza muri raporo ye , Thomas-Greenfield.
The European Union imposed travel and financial sanctions on then-Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and his allies in 2002, in response to reports of election-rigging and human rights. The U.S. followed suit with sanctions in 2003.	Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’iburayi wahaye ibihano perezida wa Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe na bagenzi be, harimo guhagarika ingendo no gucibwa amafaranga mu 2002, hagarutswe ku makuru yavuga ko uburiganya bw’amatora n’uburenganzira bwa muntu. Amerika yabashyiriyeho ibihano mu 2003.
Earlier this week, in separate statements, the U.S., Britain and the European Union said Zimbabwes economy was suffering, not because of sanctions but because of corruption and government mismanagement of the countrys resources.	Mu ntangiriro z'iki cyumweru, mu mvugo zitandukanye, Amerika, Ubwongereza n’Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’ iburayi byavuze ko kuba ubukungu bwa Zimbabwe bwifashe nabi, bitatewe n’ibihano ahubwo biterwa na ruswa ndetse n’imicungire mibi ya leta ku mutungo w’ibihugu.
	
Zimbabwean Liberation War Vets Released After Protesting Low Pensions	Abari bafunzwe bazira imyigaragambyo itewe no guhabwa amafaranga make ya Pansiyo barekuwe.
A court in Zimbabwe Friday ordered the release of about 40 veterans of the nations 1970s independence war, four days after they tried to petition President Emmerson Mnangagwa about their low monthly pension.	Ku wa Gatanu, urukiko rwo muri Zimbabwe rwategetse irekurwa ry’abasirikare 40 bagize uruhare mukurwanira ubwigenge  mu myaka ya za 70, nyuma y'iminsi bafunguwe  bagerage kubaza perezida Emmerson Mnangagwa ibijyanye na pansiyo yabo ya buri kwezi.
Their lawyers accuse the government of infringing on citizens right to demonstrate, particularly those who opposed President Mnangagwas rule.	Abunganizi babo bashinja guverinoma kubangamira uburenganzira bw'abaturage , cyane cyane abatavuga rumwe n'ubutegetsi bwa Perezida Mnangagwa.
War veterans chatted outside the courtroom Friday after Magistrate Barbra Mateko ordered their release on about $40 bail. They were arrested Monday while trying to go to Mnangagwas office to ask for a review of their less than $100 monthly pension.	Ku wa Gatanu, abahoze mu ntambara baganiriye n'urukiko nyuma y’uko umucamanza Barbra Mateko ategeka ko barekurwa ariko bagatanga ingwate y’amadolari 40. Ku wa mbere, batawe muri yombi ubwo bageragezaga  kujya ku biro bya Mnangagwa kugira ngo bigaragambye basaba isubirwamo ry'amafaranga ya pansiyo atarenga 100 $ buri kwezi.
Paidamoyo Saurombe, from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, spoke to VOA after he secured the war veterans release on bail.	Paidamoyo Saurombe, ukomoka mu ishyaka rya Zimbabwe riharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu, yaganiriye na VOA nyuma yo kubona ko abahoze mu ntambara barekuwe by'agateganyo.
"Its not a crime to demonstrate in Zimbabwe, its not a crime to petition. Its actually provided for by the constitution," Saurombe said. "So in anything that has to be done, it has to be done in those ambits of the constitution or in those constitutional provisions. And our clients were following constitutional provisions, so to say they committed a crime it would rather be absurd."	Saurombe ati: "Ntabwo ari icyaha kwigaragambya muri Zimbabwe, ntabwo gusaba icyo ushaka ari icyaha mu by'ukuri giteganywa n'itegeko nshinga." Ibintu byose bigomba gukorwa hubahirizwa itegeko nshinga cyangwa ingingo z’itegeko nshinga. Kandi abakiriya bacu bakurikizaga ibiteganywa n'itegeko nshinga, ku buryo kuvuga ko bakoze icyaha byaba ari ubuswa."
The veterans are expected to go on trial next month. The offense of "breaching the peace," which they face, has an option of a fine if they are convicted.	Biteganijwe ko abahoze mu rugerero bazaburanishwa ukwezi gutaha. Icyaha cyo "guhungabanya amahoro," bakazacibwaihazabu  nibaramuka bahamwe n'icyaha.
Addressing senior members of the ruling ZANU-PF party Friday in Bindura, about 80 kilometers north of Harare, President Mnangagwa said the war veterans had broken protocol.	Ku wa Gatanu, Perezida Mnangagwa yagejeje ku bayobozi bakuru b’ishyaka riri ku butegetsi rya ZANU-PF i Bindura, nko mu birometero 80 mu majyaruguru ya Harare, Perezida Mnangagwa yavuze ko abahoze mu ntambara barenze ku masezerano.
"Various initiatives have been implemented to improve the dignity, welfare and economic empowerment of veterans of the liberation struggle and dependence of the heroes," Mnangagwa said. "But I urge the war veterans to use procedures in the party, not outside the party.Their rich ideological grounding should galvanize the principle of patriotism in the hearts and minds of cadres and embolden them in their efforts to ensure that ZANU-PF remains the party of choice which wholeheartedly serves the people."	Mnangagwa ati: "Hashyizweho ingamba zinyuranye zo kuzamura icyubahiro, imibereho myiza no kongerera ubushobozi ubukungu bw'abahoze ku rugamba rwo kwibohora." Ariko ndasaba abasezerewe kurugamba gukoresha ukuri mu ishyaka, atari hanze y'ishyaka. Impamvu zabo zishingiye ku bitekerezo zigomba gushimangira ihame ryo gukunda igihugu mu mitima no mu bitekerezo by'abakozi kandi bikabashyira mu bikorwa kugira ngo ZANU-PF ikomeze kuba ishyaka ryiza rikorera abaturage ribikuye ku mutima. "
At the court, one of the war veterans, who identified himself as Cde Tendai, said he was relieved his colleagues had been granted bail because some of them have chronic conditions.	Mu rukiko, umwe mu basezerewe mu ntambara wiyise Cde Tendai, yasezereye bagenzi be kubera ko bamwe muri barwaye indwara zidakira.
"We were concerned by their health," Tendai said. "We feared that some of them may have died because most war veterans are stressed by so many things. We were surprised by their arrests. We were not violent, we respect the rule of law and our government. The only issue was: we want to petition since we are getting very little money considering how life is difficult."	Tendai ati: "Twari duhangayikishijwe n'ubuzima bwabo." "Twatinyaga ko bamwe muri bo bashobora kuba bapfa kubera ko abahoze mu ntambara benshi bahangayikishijwe n'ibintu byinshi. Twatunguwe n'ifungwa ryabo. Ntabwo twari abanyarugomo, twubaha amategeko na guverinoma yacu. Ikibazo gusa cyari iki: Ni uko twasabaga  amafaranga kuko asanzwe yari make cyane ugereranyije n'uko ubuzima bumeze. "
Zimbabwes war of liberation from the white minority-led rule of Ian Smith lasted for 16 years, from 1964 to 1980.The government still pays monthly pensions to about 30,000 veterans of the war.	Intambara ya Zimbabwe yo kwibohora ku butegetsi bw’abazungu bayobowe na Ian Smith yamaze imyaka 16, kuva 1964 kugeza 1980. Guverinoma iracyishyura pansiyo ya buri kwezi ku basirikare 30.000 bahoze mu ntambara.
	
Zimbabwe Government: No COVID-19 Shot, No Work, No Pay	Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe iragira iti" Kubera COVID-19 , Nta kazi, nta n' umushahara
Union leaders have angrily reacted to the Zimbabwean governments announcement Sunday that workers who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will no longer be allowed at work and will not be paid. This is seen as part of efforts to deal with high vaccination hesitancy in the southern African nation. .	Ku cyumweru, abayobozi b’ubumwe bw’abakozi barakariye guverinoma ya Zimbabwe kubera gutangaza ko abakozi batakingiwe COVID-19 batazongera kwemererwa kujya ku kazi kandi ko batazahembwa. Ibi bifatwa ariko bifatwa nk' ingamba zo kongera umubare w'abakingirwa  mugihugu cya Afrika yepfo. .
Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana, Zimbabwes secretary for information, over the weekend told government-controlled media that all civil servants who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be allowed to work come Monday.	Ndabaningi Nick Mangwana, umunyamabanga wa Zimbabwes ushinzwe itangazamakuru, mu mpera z'icyumweru gishize yatangarije ibitangazamakuru bigenzurwa na leta ko abakozi ba Leta bose batakingiwe COVID-19 batazemererwa gukora ku wa mbere.
"There is no extension to the deadline of 15 October, when civil servants are expected to all having been vaccinated, failure of which those who are not vaccinated would not be allowed to work. And further to that is the fact that those who are not vaccinated and those who are not working will not be paid because the thrust is that if you do not work, you dont get paid," he said.	Ntago hongerewe igihe ntarengwa cyo kuba barangije gukingirwa  kuko kuwa  15 Ukwakira ni cyo gihe biteganijwe ko abakozi ba Leta bose bazaba bakingiwe, kwanga gukingirwa kwabo nibyo bizatuma batemererwa gukora. Ikindi kandi ni uko abatarakingiwe inkingo batazakora akazi kandi ntibazahembwa kuko intego ni uko niba udakora, utahembwa .
Schoolteachers, who constitute the largest proportion of Zimbabwes civil servants, say the Friday deadline the government set was unilateral.	Abarimu bigisha nibo bagize igice kinini cy’abakozi ba Leta ba Zimbabwe, bavuga ko igihe ntarengwa cyo gukingirwa ari kuwa Gatanu guverinoma yashyizeho.
"Fundamentally, there was no agreement over the issue of vaccination," said Takavafira Zhou, president of Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe. "Our position as workers has always remained that we encourage our members to be vaccinated. But by no means should our encouragement be misconstrued for mandatory vaccination. Our position is very clear: vaccination must be voluntary. Not mandatory. We must invest in the efficacy of vaccination — explaining to members how vaccination would assist them in terms of boosting their immunity but that has not been done."	Perezida w'ishyirahamwe ry'abarimu bateye imbere muri Zimbabwe, Takavafira Zhou yagize ati: "Muri rusange, nta masezerano yari afite ku kibazo cyo gukingira." "Umwanya dufite nk'abakozi ntago wahindutse, ubwo rero turashishikariza abanyamuryango bacu gukingirwa. Ariko ntago twifuza ko imikorere yacu igomba kunengwa kugeza ubwo haboneka abantu bakingirwa ku gahato. Inshingsno dufite zirasobanutse neza: gukingirwa bigomba kuba ku bushake. Ntabwo ari itegeko. Twagombaga  gushora imari mu bikorwa cyo gukingira - gusobanurira abanyamuryango uburyo inkingo zabafasha mu rwego rwo kongera ubudahangarwa bwabo. "
Zimbabwes government says it has fully vaccinated 2,472,859 people since the program started in February.	Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe ivuga ko imaze gukingiza abantu 2,472.859 kuva gahunda yatangira muri Gashyantare.
Zhou said Zimbabweans were shunning vaccinations for several reasons that the government must first understand, from religious reasons to lack of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines to lack of trust in the imported Chinese SINOVAC and SINOPHARM vaccines.	Zhou yavuze ko Abanyazimbabwe bari kwanga  inkingo kubera impamvu nyinshi guverinoma igomba kubanza gusobanukirwa harimo nk'impamvu z’amadini ubumenyi buke ku nkingo za COVID-19 ,kutizerana inkingo za SINOVAC z’Abashinwa zitumizwa mu mahanga na SINOPHARM.
He said all civil servants must continue coming to work while unions were considering going to court over purported dismissals.	Yavuze ko abakozi ba Leta bose bagomba gukomeza kuza ku kazi mu gihe ihuriro ry’amashyirahamwe y’abakozi ari gushaka uko  yajya mu rukiko kubera kwirukanwa kwabo
"The members will only stop going to work if there is a formal letter from the Public Service Commission dismissing them. But even with that formal letter, it will still be challenged because its legality must also be established. But as of now the teachers still remain at their stations, demotivated of course, shimmering in poverty and misery but they remain employees of the government," he said.	Abanyamuryango bazahagarika kujya ku kazi ari uko hari ibaruwa y'ubuyobozi ya Komisiyo ishinzwe abakozi ba Leta ibasezerera. Ariko nubwo iyo baruwa yaboneka izakomeza kutizerwa kubera ko nayo igomba kwandikwa hubahirizwa amategeko. Ariko kugeza ubu abarimu baracyari mu macumbi yabo , bari guhura n'ubukene ariko baracyari abakozi ba guverinoma .
Zimbabwe currently has 132,333 confirmed coronavirus infections and 4,657 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which tracks the global outbreak. Civil servants — especially teachers — have long complained about lack of adequate protective equipment in classrooms to curb the spread of COVID-19. Zimbabwes government, however, maintains it is providing enough resources in the fight against the pandemic.	Nk’uko bitangazwa na Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre ikurikirana icyorezo ku isi, ngo muri iki gihe Zimbabwe ifite abantu 132.333 banduye indwara ya coronavirus ndetse na 4,657 bapfuye. Abakozi ba Leta - cyane cyane abarimu - kuva kera binubira kubura ibikoresho bihagije byo gukingira mu byumba by’ishuri kugira ngo COVID-19 ireke gukwirakwizwa. Guverinoma ya Zimbabwe, ikomeza ivuga ko igiye  gutanga ibikoresho bihagije mu kurwanya iki cyorezo.
	
New Zealand Cricket Team Cancels Pakistan Tour Over Security Concerns	Ikipe ya Cricket ya Nouvelle-Zélande yasubitse urugendo rwo kujya  muri Pakisitani kubera umutekano
A New Zealand cricket team announced it was abandoning its tour of Pakistan, citing security concerns Friday, the day it was supposed to have its first match. "Following an escalation in the New Zealand Government threat levels for Pakistan, and advice from NZC security advisers on the ground, it has been decided the BLACKCAPS will not continue with the tour," a press statement from the New Zealand cricket team said.	Ikipe ya Cricket ya Nouvelle-Zélande yatangaje ko ihagaritse ingendo zayo muri Pakisitani kuri uyu wa Gatatu kubera impungenge z'umutekano , hari hateganijwe umukino Wa mbere. Itangazo rigenewe abanyamakuru ry’ikipe ya Cricket ya Nouvelle-Zélande ryagize riti: "Nyuma y’uko muri Leta ya Nouvelle-Zélande Pakisitani, hagaragaye umutekano muke,abajyanama b’umutekano ba NZC , bemeje ko BLACKCAPS isubitse  urugendo."
Pakistani officials reacted strongly, calling the decision "unilateral" and a conspiracy against Pakistans image. "None of our various intelligence agencies had received any indication of a security threat," said Pakistans Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed. He added that Pakistan had offered to hold the matches without spectators, but the offer was rejected. Pakistani Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi said he was "appalled" at the decision. "Sadly, global politics has won over the great game of cricket! There were no security threats! @jacindaardern," he said, tagging the New Zealand prime minister in his tweet.	Abayobozi ba Pakisitani babyakiriye neza, bavuga ko iki cyemezo "ari ntamakemwa" kandi ko ari uburyo bwiza bugaragaza isura nziza y'Abanyapakistani. Minisitiri w’ubutegetsi bw’igihugu cya Pakisitani, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed yagize ati: "Nta nzego z’ubutasi zigeze zigaragaza ko hari ikintu gihungabanya umutekano." Yongeyeho ko Pakisitani yemeye gukina imikino ntabafana bahari ariko bakayangira. Minisitiri w’ibikorwa by’amazi muri Pakisitani, Ali Haider Zaidi, yatangaje ko yatangajwe n’iki cyemezo. Ati: "Ikibabaje ni uko hari  abanyapolitike ku isi batsinze umukino ukomeye wa Cricket! Nta kibazo cy'umutekano cyari gihari! @Jacindaardern".
Prime Minister Imran Khan personally called Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to guarantee the teams safety, but she stood by her teams decision, according to Ahmed and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). The PCB said it had arranged "fool proof security" for the visiting team and New Zealand security officials had been satisfied with their arrangements. "[C]ricket lovers in Pakistan and around the world will be disappointed by this last-minute withdrawal," the board said. The chief executive of the Black Caps, David White, said he could not ignore the advice he was receiving. "I understand this will be a blow for the PCB, who have been wonderful hosts, but player safety is paramount, and we believe this is the only responsible option," he said. The two sides were to play three one-day matches in Rawalpindi, known as the twin city of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, followed by a series of five limited over matches or T-20s in Pakistans second-largest city, Lahore.	Minisitiri w’intebe Imran Khan yahamagaye Minisitiri w’intebe Jacinda Ardern kugira ngo amwizeze umutekano w’amakipe, ahagarara kucyemezo cyafashwe kubijyanye n' amakipe ye, nkuko byatangajwe na Ahmed hamwe n’ikigo gishinzwe imikino cya Pakisitani (PCB). PCB yavuze ko yacunze umutekano  bitari ngombwa kuruhande rw' itsinda ryabasuye kandi abashinzwe umutekano muri Nouvelle-Zélande uburyo  gahunda zabo ziteguye zirahagije. Ubuyobozi bwagize buti: "Abakunzi ba rike muri Pakisitani ndetse no ku isi yose bazababazwa nuko umukino uzarangira." Umuyobozi mukuru wa Black Caps, David White, yavuze ko adashobora kwirengagiza inama yahawe. Ati: "Numva ko ibi kuri PCB bizaba ari byiza, ariko umutekano w'abakinnyi nicyo cya mbere, kandi twizera ko iyi ari yo nzira yonyine ikwiye". Impande zombi zagombaga gukina imikino itatu umunsi umwe i Rawalpindi, ahazwi  nk'umujyi umeze kimwe nk' umurwa mukuru wa Pakisitani, Islamabad, hagakurikiraho indi mikino itatu ikurikiranye T-20s mu mujyi wa kabiri munini wa Pakisitani, Lahore.
The chief executive of the PCB, Wasim Khan, told VOA the New Zealand team would head home Saturday on a chartered plane. An English cricket team was scheduled to visit Pakistan in October, but Interior Minister Ahmed said that tour also was now in doubt. "Ministry of Interior has informed me that the English team is also thinking along the same lines. On our part, we are ready to welcome them. There is no security threat in our country to either New Zealand or England," he said. International cricket teams stopped visiting Pakistan after an attack on a Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009 in Lahore that wounded seven members of the team. Pakistan went through several years of violence starting approximately in 2007 as extremist groups blaming Pakistan for siding with the United States in its war on terror started attacking both its security forces and civilians. Pakistani officials claim up to 80,000 of their citizens died in these attacks, and the country suffered up to $150 billion worth of damage to its economy. In 2016, Pakistani cricket authorities formed the Pakistan Super League, six cricket teams representing six cities. The teams included international players in an effort to revive international cricket in Pakistan. The first two seasons of the league were played outside Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. The first international team to return to Pakistan was Zimbabwe in 2015.	Umuyobozi mukuru wa PCB, Wasim Khan, yabwiye VOA ko ikipe ya Nouvelle-Zélande izerekeza izasubira iwabo ku wa Gatandatu ikodesheje indege.  Biteganijwe ko ikipe y’umukino wa Cricket mu Bwongereza izasura Pakisitani mu Kwakira, ariko Minisitiri w’imbere mu gihugu Ahmed yavuze ko uruzinduko narwo ruteye amakenga. Ati: "Minisiteri y'Ubutegetsi bw'igihugu yamenyesheje ko ikipe y'Ubwongereza nayo ishaka kuza. Twebwe twiteguye kubakira. Nta kibazo cy'umutekano muke  kiri mu gihugu cyacu haba muri Nouvelle-Zélande cyangwa mu Bwongereza". Amakipe mpuzamahanga ya Cricket yahagaritse gusura Pakisitani nyuma y’igitero cyagabwe ku ikipe ya Cricket ya Sri Lankan mu 2009 i Lahore hagakomereka abantu barindwi bagize iyi kipe. Pakisitani yakorewe urugomo guhera muntangiro zo mu 2007 ubwo imitwe y’intagondwa yashinjaga Pakisitani kuba yarashyigikiye Amerika mu ntambara yo kurwanya iterabwoba yatangiye kwibasira abashinzwe umutekano ndetse n’abasivili. Abayobozi ba Pakisitani bavuga ko abaturage babo bagera ku 80.000 bapfiriye muri ibyo bitero, kandi igihugu cyahuye ningaruka mbi kubukungu bugabanuka kugera kuri miliyari 150 z'amadolari. Muri 2016, abategetsi ba Cricket muri Pakisitani bashinze Pakistan Super League, amakipe atandatu ya Cricket ahagarariye imigi itandatu. Amakipe yarimo abakinnyi mpuzamahanga mu rwego rwo kubyutsa umupira w'amaguru mpuzamahanga muri Pakisitani. ibyiciro bibiri byambere bya shampiyona byakiniwe hanze ya Pakisitani muri United Arab Emirates. Ikipe mpuzamahanga ya mbere yaje gukinira muri Pakisitani ni Zimbabwe muri 2015.
	
African Leaders Discuss Ways to Minimize Impact of Climate Change	Abayobozi b'Abanyafurika baganira ku buryo bwo kugabanya ingaruka z’imihindagurikire y’ibihe
High-level African officials met virtually this week to discuss the challenges Africa faces in trying to manage a growing population amid climate change. The conference was aimed at identifying ways African governments can manage these pressures to minimize or avoid conflict.	Muri iki cyumweru abayobozi bo muri Afurika bahuye hafi ya bose kugira ngo baganire ku mbogamizi Afurika ihura nazo mu kugerageza guhangana n’imihindagurikire y’ikirere. Iyi nama yari igamije kumenya uburyo guverinoma z’Afurika zishobora gukemura ibyo bibazo kugira ngo hagabanuke cyangwa birinde amakimbirane.
Africa generates about 3% percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the lowest of any continent. But its more vulnerable than any other region in the world, since Africans depend so heavily on their natural environment for food, water and medicine.	Afurika yohereza mukirere hafi 3% by'ibyuka bihumanya ikirere ku isi, biri hasi cyane ku mugabane ugereranyije nindi migabane. Ariko irashobora kwibasirwa n’utundi turere twose ku isi, kubera ko Abanyafurika bo bibanda cyane ku bidukikije, ku biribwa, amazi n’imiti.
Speaking at a virtual conference Tuesday on climate, conflict and demographics in Africa, Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said African governments need to keep the climate in mind as they try to boost their economies.	Ku wa kabiri, Visi Perezida wa Nijeriya, Yemi Osinbajo, mu nama isanzwe ivuga ku bijyanye n’ikirere, amakimbirane n’imibare muri Afurika, yavuze ko guverinoma z’Afurika zigomba kubungabunga ikirere muburyo bwo kuzamura ubukungu bwazo.
"Our first obligation for us and for African countries must always be to ensure the well-being of our people through access to development services, including electricity, health care, education, safe jobs and a safe environment, including access to clean cooking fuels. We must prioritize solutions that align the development and climate agenda, and that is absolutely important," said Osinbajo.	Inshingano yacu ya mbere kuri twe no ku bihugu bya Afurika igomba guhora ari ukurinda imibereho myiza y'abaturage binyuze muri serivisi z'iterambere, harimo amashanyarazi, ubuvuzi, uburezi, akazi keza ndetse n'ibidukikije, harimo no kubona ibicanwa byiza. Tugomba gushyira imbere gushaka ibisubizo by'ibibazo ku iterambere na no kubungabunga ikirere, kandi ni ngombwa rwose , Osinbajo.
The Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, based in Brussels, says that in 2019, Africa recorded 56 extreme weather events compared to 45 in the previous year.	Ikigo cy’ubushakashatsi kuri Epidemiologiya y’ibiza, gifite icyicaro i Buruseli, kivuga ko muri 2019, Afurika yagize  ibihe bibi 56 by’imihindagurikire y'kirere gikabije ugereranije na 45 mu mwaka ushize.
The extreme weather patterns affected the lives of 16.6 million people in 29 countries. At least 13 million of them were from five countries: Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.	Imiterere y'ikirere mibi ikabije yagize ingaruka mbi ku mibereho igera kuri miliyoni 16,6 mu bihugu 29. Nibura miliyoni 13 muri ni izo mu bihugu bitanu: Kenya, Mozambique, Somaliya, Tanzaniya na Zimbabwe.
West Africa had fewer weather-related catastrophes but is feeling the effects of global warming just the same.	Afurika y'Iburengerazuba yagize ingaruka nkeya ku mihindagurikire y' ikirere ariko isigarana ingaruka z'ubushyuhe bw'isi.
Ghana environment minister Kwaku Afriyie explains how climate change has impacted agricultural lands in the country.	Minisitiri w’ibidukikije muri Gana Kwaku Afriyie yasobanuye uburyo imihindagurikire y’ikirere yagize ingaruka ku butaka buhingwa mu gihugu.
"The harsh and deteriorating climate conditions in northern Ghana undoubtedly energized region-growing food insecurity and seasonal north-to-south migration. And besides, increasing of floods and protracted drought lead to displacement of people. Statistics show that over the last few years, there has been a new internal displacement which has occurred in Ghana due to climate-induced disasters and even beyond our borders," he said.	Ikirere kigenda kiba kibi kandi kigenda gihindagurika mu majyaruguru ya Gana nta gushidikanya ko byafashe indi ntera mu turere hagaragara ihenda ry' ibiribwa ndetse no kwimuka bava mu majyaruguru no mu majyepfo. Kandi usibye ko kwiyongera kw’imyuzure n’amapfa byatumye abantu bimurwa. Imibare irerekana ko mu myaka mike ishize, habaye kwimurwa kw'imbere mu gihugu kwabereye muri Gana kubera ibiza biterwa n'ikirere ndetse no hakurya y'umupaka wacu .
The U.N. special representative to the African Union, Hannah Tetteh, said the continent needs to improve cross-border information-sharing and cooperation to handle climate-related crises.	Uhagarariye Umuryango w’abibumbye mu muryango w’ubumwe bw’Afurika, Hannah Tetteh, yavuze ko uyu mugabane ugomba kunoza uburyo bwo guhanahana amakuru ku mipaka n’ubufatanye mu guhangana n’ibibazo biterwa n’ihindagurika ry'ikirere.
"The challenge has not been that we havent developed yet these structures. The challenge has been we have not utilized them yet effectively, and that goes to issues of national sovereignty and the unwillingness of member states to have others, as it were, take an active interest and maybe recommend the things that need to be done in order to respond to a particular crisis. And if we recognize we are all in this together, then that certainly has to change," she said.	Ikibazo gihari si uko  tutaratera imbere mu kubaka izo nzego. Ikibazo ni uko tutigeze tuyikoresha neza, kandi ibyo bikaba bifitanye isano n'ubusugire bw'igihugu ndetse no kudashaka ko ibihugu bigize uyu muryango bigira abandi binjiramo, nk'uko byari bimeze, tugafata Inyungu nyinshi  kandi birashoboka ko dushimangira ibintu bigomba gukorwa kugirango duhangane n’ibibazo ibyo ari byo byose.  Kandi niba tuzi ko twese dufatanyije, ibyo rwose bigomba guhinduka. 
As for specific suggestions, Osinbajo suggested governments encourage greater use of natural gas and plant more trees to maintain forests that can soak up carbon dioxide and prevent it from warming the atmosphere.	Ku bijyanye n’ibitekerezo byihariye, Osinbajo yasabye leta gushishikariza abantu gukoresha gaze no gutera ibiti byinshi kugirango habungabungwe amashyamba ashobora kwangizwa na dioxyde de carbone kandi tukirinda ubushyuhe bwinshi mu kirere.
	
Young Africans Struggle With Jobs, Education Amid Pandemic	Urubyiruko rw'abanyafurika ruhanganye nibura ry'akazi, mu burezi harimo ibibazo muri iki gihe cy'icyorezo
The future looked promising for Tinashe Mapuranga, an intern at a leading bank in Zimbabwe who appeared set to get a staff position as soon as he completed his college degree. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.	Kazoza gasa nkicyizere kuri Tinashe Mapuranga, wimenyereza umwuga muri banki ikomeye muri Zimbabwe wagaragaye ko yiteguye kubona abakozi akimara kurangiza kaminuza. Noneho icyorezo cya COVID-19 cyibasiye.
Amid the lockdowns, the 24-year-old was one of the first to be laid off and has no idea when he'll be able to get his degree because of frequent school closures.	Mu gihe cyo guguhagarika amashuri, uyu musore w'imyaka 24 y'amavuko yari umwe mu ba mbere batashye kandi akaba ari kwibaza igihe impamyabumenyi kubera guhagarika amashuri inshuro nyinshi
"It has really affected me a lot in my studies. I have no money to buy data and I don't have a personal laptop to study online and keep up like what others are doing," said Mapuranga, who lives with his mother in Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class area southeast of Harare, the capital.	Mapuranga ubana na nyina ati: "Mu by'ukuri byangizeho ingaruka cyane mu masomo yanjye. Nta mafaranga mfite yo gukurikirana amakuru kuko nta mudasobwa igendanwa mfite ngo mbashe kwiga nkoresheje interineti kandi ngo mbashe kugendana n'abandi.  Chitungwiza, ni agace kagizwe n'abakozi-bakorera mu majyepfo y'uburasirazuba bwa Harare mu murwa mukuru.
"I was supposed to finish in November or December 2021, but as of now, we haven't completed much of the work," he said. "Truly speaking, I am not sure when I will finish the degree. I can't wait to graduate and find a job and do something tangible in life."	Ati: "Nagombaga kurangiza mu Gushyingo cyangwa Ukuboza 2021, ariko kugeza ubu, ntabwo twarangije kwiga". "Mvugishije ukuri, sinzi neza igihe nzarangiriza amashuri ngo mbone impamyabumenyi. Sinzi igihe nzarangiza amashuri ngo mbone akazi kandi nkore ikintu gifatika mu buzima."
Mapuranga spends most of his time at home, tending a tiny vegetable garden that is the family's main source of food. His mother ekes out a living traveling to South Africa to sell things like stone carvings and brooms on the streets, a trade also badly hit by the pandemic.	Mapuranga amara umwanya munini mu rugo, yita ku busitani buto bw'imboga aribwo kuko ariho akura ibyo kurya  by'umuryango. Nyina yagiye gushakisha imibereho yerekeza muri Afrika yepfo gucuruza ibintu harimo imitako hamwe na sima, ubucuruzi nabwo bwibasiwe n'icyorezo.
"We've been trying to hustle to get some money," he said. "I tried to do a small business selling cooking gas but the authorities chased us away from the streets. My father passed away. My mother is into informal business, but it's also down with these lockdowns. Things are not well right now. It's tough."	Ati: "Twagerageje kwihutira gushakisha amafaranga." "Nagerageje gukora ubucuruzi buciriritse bwo kugurisha gaze yo guteka ariko abayobozi batwirukana mu mihanda. Data yarapfuye. Mama ari mu bucuruzi butemewe, ariko nanone si kimwe no kubireka. Ibintu ntabwo bimeze neza muri iki gihe. Birakomeye . "
Mapuranga's situation might look dire, but he says he's concerned about some of his unemployed peers who have fallen into alcohol, drugs and prostitution.	Ikibazo cya Mapuranga gishobora kuba giteye ubwoba, ariko akavuga ko ahangayikishijwe na bamwe mu rungano rwe badafite akazi bishoye mu nzoga, ibiyobyabwenge n'uburaya.
"Many youths have lost hope," he said.	Ati: "Urubyiruko rwinshi rwitakarije icyizere."
Across Africa, many others like Mapuranga are battling the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, losing jobs and seeing their education disrupted, a survey of people aged 18-24 in 15 countries has found.	Hirya no hino muri Afurika, abandi benshi nka Mapuranga bafite ibibazo byatewe n'ihungabana ry'ubukungu ryatewe na COVID-19, Habayeho kubura akazi no kubona amashuri yabo ahungabanye, ibyo bigaragazwa n'ubushakashatsi bwakozwe ku bantu bafite imyaka 18-24 mu bihugu 15 bwerekanye.
The pandemic increased the already-high level of unemployment among the group, according to preliminary findings of the second annual Africa Youth Survey.	Icyorezo hiyongereyeho n'ubushomeri bukabije mu rubyiruko nk'uko byagaragajwe mbere mu bushakashatsi bwakozwe bwa kabiri muri Afurika.

Abandi 8% bahagarikiwe umushahara , 18% bagombaga kuguma mu rugo naho 10% bakavuga ko bagomba kwita ku bagize umuryango, nk'uko ubushakashatsi bwashyizwe ahagaragara na Fondasiyo ya Ichikowitz ikorera mu mujyi wa Johannesburg, washinze Ivor Ichikowitz i Paramount Group ibigaragaza, habayeho ihindagurika ry'ikirere, umutekano muke  hamwe no kubura ba rwiyemezamirimo.

Uganda has had two lockdowns since April 2020, the second of which was relaxed in July. But businesses involving close human interaction — bars, gyms and nightclubs — remain closed by presidential order, leaving many young people without work.	Uganda imaze gushyiraho ingamba zo guhagarika ibikorwa, kuva muri Mata 2020, icya kabiri cy'abaturage cyahagaritse akazi muri Nyakanga.

I am not waiting for the government to help me."	Ati: "Ubucuruzi bwanjye buracyari hasi. Ariko mfite inzozi". "Iyaba nashobora kubona umuntu wantera inkunga, akampa inguzanyo yo kwagura ubucuruzi bwanjye, icyo ni cyo nshaka. Ntabwo ntegereje ko leta imfasha."
	
Red Cross: 48,000 People Confirmed Missing Across Africa	Croix-Rouge: Yemeje ko abantu 48.000  baburiwe irengero muri Afurika
The International Committee of the Red Cross says more than 48,000 people are missing across Africa, and at least 21,600 are minors. Most of the registered disappearances — widely believed to be a fraction of the continents wider, undocumented humanitarian tragedy — are linked to armed conflict, violence, disasters and migration across the continent.	Komite mpuzamahanga ya Croix-Rouge ivuga ko abantu barenga 48.000 baburiwe irengero muri Afurika, kandi abagera kuri 21,600 ni abana. Benshi mu baburiwe irengero - abantu benshi bemeza ko ababuriwe irengero ari abatuye ku migabane minini, aho ubutabazi budafite ubushobozi bwo kubafasha - kandi izo mfu hari izifitanye isano n’intambara zitwaje intwaro, urugomo, ibiza no kuva ku mugabane  wa Afurika.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says the number of people coming forward to report missing persons is on the rise in Africa.	Komite mpuzamahanga ya Croix-Rouge ivuga ko muri Afurika hari 'abantu baza kurangisha abantu  baburiwe irengero.
Amaya Fernandez, the humanitarian organizations adviser on the missing and their families for Western Africa, says the cause of the increasing numbers is two-fold.	Amaya Fernandez, umujyanama w’imiryango itabara imbabare ku baburiwe irengero hamwe n'imiryango yabo muri Afurika y'Iburengerazuba, avuga ko iburirwa irengero ry'abantu ryiyongereye rikikuba kabiri.
"On one hand, [it's] due to the fact we are trying to register more systematically cases of missing persons throughout the region. But also, certainly, [it's] due to the increased violence and conflict experienced on the continent, which increases at the same time the likelihood of people going missing. Looking at our figures, almost half of the missing persons have been recorded underage and most of them are men. Among the women ... we can see that the majority are minors," she said.	Ku ruhande rumwe, ni ukubera ko tugerageza kubarura baburiwe irengero mu buryo bunonosoye  muri buri karere . Ariko nanone, ni ukubera ko ihohoterwa n'amakimbirane byiyongereye ku mugabane wa Afurika, Ibyo byombi birushaho  kwiyongerera icyarimwe kandi birashoboka ko abantu bazimira. Urebye imibare yacu, hafi kimwe cya kabiri cyabaruwe ko cyabuze ni abatarageza ku myaka y'ubukure kandi benshi muri bo ni abagabo. Mu bagore ... dusanga abenshi ari abana bato . .
The ICRC finding shows that 39,360 of the 48,000 missing people are from seven countries with armed conflicts.	Ubushakashatsi bwa CICR bwerekana ko 39.360 mu bantu 48.000 baburiwe irengero bakomoka mu bihugu birindwi bifite umutekano muke utewe n'imitwe yitwaje intwaro.
According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, 20 countries in Africa have armed conflict. Out of the 20, 10 are witnessing high-intensity armed conflicts.	Nk’uko ikigo mpuzamahanga cy’amahoro n’ubushakashatsi cya Stockholm kibitangaza ngo ibihugu 20 byo muri Afurika bifite imitwe yitwaje intwaro. Muri 20, 10 barimo guhura ningorane zitejwe n'imitwr yitwaje intwaro.
Fernandez says the ongoing conflict in some African countries has created more pain and suffering for families of missing persons.	Fernandez avuga ko umutekano ukomeje kubura kubera ibihugu bimwe na bimwe bya Afurika byateje agahinda n'imibabaro imiryango yabuze ababo.
"Humanitarian consequences... caused by protracted armed conflicts are often... reflected in most of the interviews. For instance, half of the families interviewed in Nigeria reported that their relatives had gone missing in 2014-2015. [In] South Sudan, [the] majority of the families were looking for people that went missing between 2013 and 2016. In Libya, families reported that they were looking for missing relatives from the late '70s until the present day, and the same goes for families in Ethiopia and Uganda," she said.	Ibikorwa by'ubutabazi ku mpamvu zatewe n’intambara bimaze igihe kinini bigaragara ... bigaragarira mu biganiro byinshi. Urugero, kimwe cya kabiri cy’imiryango yakoreweho ubushakashatsi muri Nijeriya bavuze ko bene wabo baburiwe irengero muri 2014-2015. Muri Sudani y'Amajyepfo. , [imiryango myinshi] yashakishaga abantu baburiwe irengero hagati ya 2013 na 2016. Muri Libiya, imiryango yatangaje ko barimo gushaka abavandimwe babuze kuva mu myaka ya za 70 kugeza uyu munsi, kandi ni nako bigenda ku miryango yo muri Etiyopiya na Uganda .
Some experts see the need to train community workers and security agencies on the importance of information sharing to help locate missing persons.	Abahanga bamwe babona ko ari ngombwa guhugura abakozi b’abaturage n’inzego zishinzwe umutekano ku kamaro ko guhanahana amakuru kugira ngo bafashe kumenya ababuriwe irengero.
Zimbabwes assistant police commissioner Crispen Lifa says his country and the region need a data management system to follow up on the missing person cases.	Komiseri wungirije wa polisi muri Zimbabwe Crispen Lifa, avuga ko igihugu cye ndetse n'akarere bikeneye uburyo bwo guhanahana amakuru kugira ngo bakurikirane ibibazo by'ababuriwe irengero.
"There is a need to have a database which should be continuously updated so that all missing persons, and even those that are deceased... is captured in a database by police stations. At the end of the day, that information has to be put in place... [so] if you want to check across the country the number of missing persons, [you] would quickly get that information from a central point," he said.	Harakenewe kugira gereza y'ababuriwe irengero igomba guhora ivugururwa kugira ngo abantu bose baburiwe irengero, ndetse n'abapfuye ... bafatiwe mu bubiko bw’ibiro bya polisi. Umunsi urangiye, ayo makuru agomba kuba shyira mu mwanya ... Murumuna wa Fauziya Hussein yaburiwe irengero muri Kamena nyuma yuko urukiko rwo muri Kenya rumaze kumurekura. Uyu mugabo w'imyaka 39 yashinjwaga ibibazo bijyanye n’iterabwoba, ariko urukiko rwasanze ari umwere maze rutegeka abapolisi kumurekura. Mushiki we, Fauziya Hussein, avuga ko batongeye kumubona. zi ko bagifite. Igihe cyose [afunzwe], murumuna wanjye yaboneyeho umwanya wo guhamagara kuri telefoni. Yahamagaye mama. Noneho, niba yarekuwe, kuki atahamagaye mama? Noneho, njye menya neza ko batamurekuye ".
According to Hussein, police told her they released her brother.	 Hussein we abapolisi bamubwiye ko barekuye musaza we.
The ICRC calls on African governments to prevent disappearances and help with search and identification, and addressing families needs.	CICR irahamagarira leta z’Afurika gukumira iburirwa irengero ry'abantu no gutanga ubufasha mu gushakisha no kumenya aho baherereye ndetse no gukemura ibibazo by’imiryango.

On Saturday, amid stifling temperatures that hovered above 30 degrees Celsius, sprinters took the track as they began their attempts to succeed world-record holder Bolt.	Ku wa Gatandatu, mu gihe ubushyuhe bwagabanutse bukagera kuri dogere selisiyusi 30, abasiganwa ku maguru batangiye gutsinda Bolt ufite rekodi ku isi.
Keletela, 22, is one of those athletes.	Keletela w'imyaka 22, ni umwe muri abo bakinnyi.
Originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he moved to Portugal in 2016 following the death of his parents due to conflict in his homeland and ran a personal best 10.33 to advance to the next round later on Saturday.	Akomoka muri Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo, yimukiye muri Porutugali mu 2016 nyuma y'urupfu rw'ababyeyi be kubera amakimbirane yabereye mu gihugu ubu yirukanka kugiti cye 10.33 kugira ngo azazamuke mu cyiciro gikurikira nyuma yo ku wa Gatandatu.

"You can do ... anything, whether you are a refugee or not."	Keletela nyuma yaya marushanwa yagize ati: "Ndabyishimiye cyane, ndabyishimiye cyane kandi ndishimye cyane, nishimiye iyi kipe. Bimpa imbaraga nyinshi zo gukomeza". "ubu umuntu ashobora gukora ... ikintu icyo ari cyo cyose, waba uri impunzi cyangwa utari yo."
Others who progressed from the preliminary heats include Zimbabwe's Ngoni Makusha, who got off the block fast to win his heat in 10.32, and Oman's Barakat Al Harthi, who posted 10.27s to win his race.	Abandi bateye imbere mu by'ubushyuhe harimo Ngoni Makusha wa Zimbabwe, wamanutse vuba kugira ngo atsinde ubushyuhe muri 10.32, na Barakat Al Harthi wa Oman, wagaragaje 10.27 kugira ngo atsinde irushanwa rye.
There were three preliminary heats overall and the first three in each heat qualify to round one, along with the athlete who posts the next fastest time.	Muri rusange habaye ubushyuhe inshuro eshatu kandi butatu bwa mbere muri buri bushyuhe bujuje ibisabwa kugirango bazenguruke, hamwe n'umukinnyi uzasimbura.
The world's top sprinters enter the equation later Saturday, with the United States, who have won more golds in the event than all other nations combined, determined to take Bolt's mantle and regain their supremacy.	Ku wa Gatandatu, abasiganwa n'amaguru ku isi batangiye ikiciro cya nyuma muri Amerika, hmAmerika ni yo yabonye igikombe cya zahabu muri ibyo birori kurusha ibindi bihugu byose byari byarushanyijwe, niyo yabaye iya mbere yambikwa ikamba i Bolt

Zimbabwe Opening Victoria Falls to Vaccinated Tourists	Zimbabwe Opening Victoria yacitse intege mu gukingira abakerarugendo.
Zimbabwe is opening popular tourism destination Victoria Falls to visitors who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, in a move welcomed by the countrys suffering tourism industry. Late Tuesday after a Cabinet meeting, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa told reporters that the government had resolved to lift a lid on Victoria Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world and the countrys top tourism destination.	Zimbabwe irimo gufungura ahantu nyaburanga h’ubukerarugendo bwa Victoria Falls ku bashyitsi bakingiwe COVID-19, mu rwego rwo kwakirwa n’ibihugu bifite inganda z’ubukerarugendo. Ku wa kabiri, nyuma y’inama y’abaminisitiri, Minisitiri w’itangazamakuru Monica Mutsvangwa yabwiye abanyamakuru ko guverinoma yiyemeje gukingura amarembo ku Isumo rya Victoria, isumo rirerire ku isi ndetse n’ibihugu biza ku isonga mu bukerarugendo.
"[The] Cabinet acceded to a request by the tourism industry to open the Victoria Falls and Kazungula Border posts to tourists who are fully vaccinated. This is in view of the realization that over 60% of the population in Victoria Falls has been vaccinated. The lockdown measures, however, are being enforced throughout the country in order to curtail a surge under the third wave of COVID-19," Mutsvangwa said. Godfrey Koti, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, says the pandemic had brought the tourism industry worldwide to its knees. He says it is time for Zimbabwe to begin the long climb back with the opening up of Victoria Falls, within the confines and guidelines of the COVID-19 pandemic. "And from a regional perspective, the tourism traffic will grow and this will send a very strong message to our source markets. This is a definite way of showing, of a benefit being shown from [the] governments drive of vaccinating the entire city of Victoria Falls and subsequently Victoria Falls reaching herd immunity. So, we are very excited to see this happening and it can only show that we are definitely moving in the right direction," Koti said. About 1.5 million Zimbabweans out of a population of 14 million have received their first vaccination shot, and nearly 695,000 have received their second inoculation.	[Inama y'Abaminisitiri yemeye icyifuzo cy’inganda z’ubukerarugendo gukingura iimiryango kuri Victoria kuri buri mukerarugendo wakingiwe byuzuye. Ingamba zo gufunga ariko zirimo gukurikizwa mu gihugu hose hagamijwe kugabanya umuvuduko ukabije wa COVID-19, Mutsvangwa. Godfrey Koti, umuvugizi w’ikigo gishinzwe ubukerarugendo muri Zimbabwe, avuga ko iki cyorezo cyateye kwiyongera kw'inganda z’ubukerarugendo ku isi. Avuga ko igihe kigeze ngo Zimbabwe itangire kuzamuka mu ntera kuko  yafunguye Isumo rya Victoria, mu mabwiriza no mu cyerekezo cy’icyorezo cya COVID-19. "Kandi ukurikije akarere, urujya n'uruza rw'ubukerarugendo ruzagenda rwiyongera kandi ibyo bizohereza imihahiranire ku masoko yacu. Ubu ni inzira isobanutse tugaragaje, mu nyungu za  guverinoma irashaka gukingiza umujyi wose wa Isumo rya Victoria no munkengero za Victoria Falls.. Rero, twishimiye cyane kubona ibi bishobotse kandi birerekana rwose ko  tugana mu nzira nziza ", Abanya Zimbabwe bagera kuri miliyoni 1.5 ku baturage miliyoni 14 bafashe urukingo rwa mbere, naho abagera kuri 695.000 bakaba barakingiwe bwa kabiri.
Clement Mukwasi, a spokesman for Shearwater, one of the tourism operators in Victoria Falls, sounded an optimistic tone. "It is the industrys hope that towards the end of the pandemic – which we think we are in – there shall be some credit lines extended to the industry for the industry to recover. We applaud the government for taking our call to open the borders of Zambia and Botswana because Victoria Falls has reached its herd immunity. We are hoping that in addition to opening the borders, they are also going to set up a policy on how people should flow across all three countries," he said. Mukwasi said those who are vaccinated should be allowed to move across the country without any problem, while those who are not vaccinated should produce results showing they have tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19. Zimbabwe currently has 101,711 confirmed coronavirus infections and 3,280 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the global outbreak. The government says the vaccination program will intensify after the arrival of more doses from China in the coming days. The number of cases has been rising, as the delta variant becomes more widespread.	Clement Mukwasi, umuvugizi wa Shearwater, umwe mu bakora ubukerarugendo mu birunga bya Victoria, yagize ati  " twizera ko inganda zizadufasha kurwanya iki cyorezo -hazashyirwaho umurongo w'inguzanyo uhabwa inganda kugira ngo inganda zisubireho. Turashimira leta kuba yaraduhamagaye kugira ngo dufungure imipaka ya Zambiya na Botswana.Turizera ko usibye gufungura imipaka, bagiye no gushyiraho politiki y'uburyo abantu bagomba gutembera mu bihugu uko ari bitatu ".

Nk’uko muri kaminuza ya Johns Hopkins ikurikirana iki cyorezo kidasanzwe, muri iki gihe Zimbabwe ifite abantu 101.711 bemeje ko banduye coronavirus n'impfu 3,280.

UNHCR Voices Concern After Botswana Deports Zimbabwean Refugees	UNHCR yazamuye ijwi m Nyuma yuko  Botswana Yirukanye Impunzi muri Zimbabwe
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says it is concerned after Botswana deported 57 Zimbabwean refugees who had lived in the host country since 2008. The refugees reportedly failed to register for voluntary repatriation, which led to their forced removal late last week. The UNHCRs external relations officer, Kate Pond, says the refugees, irrespective of their status, have rights and could have been allowed to remain as permanent residents. "UNHCR remains concerned that Zimbabweans who have been in Botswana for over a decade have been removed to Zimbabwe in less than voluntary circumstances. Irrespective of their status they still have certain rights, and UNHCR had aimed for alternative solutions, like those provided to Zimbabweans who have family links in Botswana and may be able to remain in the country as permanent residents," Pond said. One of the deported refugees, speaking on condition of anonymity, says they were rounded up Thursday and told to board a bus which took them to Zimbabwes border. "We left Botswana on empty stomachs. We were deported to the border and we didnt get any assistance. We wanted to remain in Botswana; thats why we did not register [for repatriation]. We have nothing, we dont know where to start. We had children going to school. It will be difficult without documents like passports and identity cards," the refugee said. The deportees had been living at the Dukwi refugee camp. Botswanas government had warned that refugees who did not register would be deported. Last month, Botswana sent back more than 200 other Zimbabweans who had registered for voluntary repatriation. The repatriated refugees had initially refused to do so, citing fears of persecution in their homeland. Most were opposition activists whose homes were burned down during a deadly presidential election campaign in 2008. But one of the returnees, Bheki Weza, says they have surprisingly been well received in Zimbabwe despite their earlier safety concerns. "We are very happy about the situation. As we speak, I am now home still trying to settle down and adjust to the difficult economic conditions here in Zimbabwe. But I am happy because there is still peace surrounding us. I have met with the chiefs and even met with people that we fought with before I left. So far so good," Weza said. The UNHCR says it will continue to assist refugees who were repatriated. Each person received $520 and a food package. But the agency says there will be no such assistance for the deported refugees.	Ibiro bya Komiseri Mukuru w’umuryango w’abibumbye ushinzwe impunzi (UNHCR) bivuga ko biteye impungenge nyuma yuko Botswana yirukanye impunzi 57 zo muri Zimbabwe zari zituye mu gihugu cyari cyarabakiriye kuva mu 2008. Bivugwa ko izo mpunzi zanze kwibaruza ngo zisubizwe mu bihugu byabo, ibyo bikaba byarabaviriyemo kwirukanwa ku gahato mu mpera z'icyumweru gishize. Umukozi ushinzwe ububanyi n'amahanga wa UNHCRs, Kate Pond, avuga ko izo mpunzi, hatitawe ku miterere yazo, zifite uburenganzira kandi ko zemererwa gukomeza kuba abaturage bahoraho. "UNHCR ikomeje guhangayikishwa n'uko Abanyazimbabwe bamaze imyaka irenga icumi muri Botswana bimuriwe muri Zimbabwe ku ngufu. Hatitawe ku miterere yabo baracyafite uburenganzira bumwe na bumwe, kandi UNHCR yari igamije kubishakira ibisubizo nk'ibyo byahawe Zimbabwe. Kugira umuryango muri Botswana kandi ushobora kuguma mu gihugu nk'abaturage bahoraho ", Pond. Umwe mu mpunzi zirukanywe, yanze gutangaza amazina ye, avuga ko ku wa kane bakusanijwe bakababwira ko binjira muri bisi ibajyana ku mupaka wa Zimbabwes. "Twavuye muri Botswana nabi. Twirukanywe ku mupaka kandi nta mfashanyo twabonye. Twifuzaga kuguma muri Botswana; niyo mpamvu tutibaruje [kugira ngo dusubizwe mu gihugu]. Ntacyo dufite,ntaho twahera ubuzima. Twari dufite abana bajya ku ishuri. Bizagorana nta byangombwa nka pasiporo n'indangamuntu ", impunzi. Abirukanywe bari batuye mu nkambi y'impunzi ya Dukwi. Guverinoma ya Botswanas yari yaraburiye ko impunzi zitibaruje zizoherezwa. Mu kwezi gushize, Botswana yasabye abandi baturage barenga 200 bo muri Zimbabwe biyandikishije gutaha ku bushake. Impunzi zatahutse zabanje kwanga kubikora, kubera ubwoba bwukob batotezwa mu gihugu cyabo. Abenshi muri bo bari abarwanashyaka batavuga rumwe n’ubutegetsi amazu yabo yatwitse mu gihe cyo kwiyamamariza amatora y’umukuru w’igihugu murib 2008. Ariko umwe mu batahutse, Bheki Weza, avuga ko mu buryo budasanzwe  ko bakiriwe neza muri Zimbabwe nubwo mbere bari bafite impungenge z'umutekano. "Twishimiye uko twakiriwe. Nkuko tuvuga, ubu ndi mu rugo ndi kugerageza kumenyera imiterere n'ubukungu btoroshye hano muri Zimbabwe. Ariko ndishimye kuko hakiri amahoro. Nahuye n' abatware ndetse tunabonana n'abantu twarwanye mbere yuko ngenda. Kugeza ubu ni byiza ", UNHCR ivuga ko izakomeza gufasha impunzi zatahutse. Umuntu wese yahawe amadorari 520 hamwe n'ibyo kurya. Ariko iki kigo kivuga ko nta mfashanyo nk'izo zizahabwa impunzi zirukanywe.
	
Zimbabwe's Food Insecurity Escalates During COVID-19 Lockdowns	Ibiciro ku biribwa bya Zimbabwe byariyongereye mugihe yo gufunga ibikorwa kubera COVID-19 
A new report from Zimbabwes government says hunger and food insecurity have increased during the coronavirus pandemic. The World Food Program says the problem is especially acute for unemployed residents of the cities.	Raporo nshya ya guverinoma ya Zimbabwe ivuga ko inzara yiyongereye mu gihe cy'icyorezo cya coronavirus. Abashinzwe iby’ibiribwa ku isi bavuga ko iki kibazo gikomereye  cyane ku baturage badafite akazi.
The government report, called the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment, says about 2.4 million people in the countrys urban areas are struggling to meet their basic food needs because of lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19.	Raporo ya guverinoma yiswe Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment, ivuga ko abantu bagera kuri miliyoni 2.4 batuye mu migi birabakomereye cyane kubona imibereho n'  ibyo bakeneye by'ibanze  kuko ibintu byose byarafunzwe kubera kwirinda ikwirakwira rya COVID-19.

"I used to get about $30 a week," he said. "It was not enough for my needs. But when the lockdown came, it got worse, until I started growing mushrooms. Its slowly improving my life, if the market prices improve, we will survive."	Ati: "Najyaga mbona amadorari 30 mu cyumweru." "Ntabwo byari bihagije ku byo nkeneye. Ariko igihe gufunga byaje, byarushijeho kuba bibi, kugeza ubwo natangiye guhinga ibihumyo. Ubuzima bugenda buza buhoro buhoro, ibiciro ku isoko nibizamuka hari ikizere ko nzabaho neza."
He uses forage from his backyard corn and sorghum field to grow the mushrooms. He says he now gets about $5 a week from selling them and uses some for consumption with his wife and five dependents.	Akoresha ubwatsi buturuka mu gikari cye cy'inyuma n'ibigori by'amasaka kugira ngo  ahinge ibihumyo. Avuga ko ubu abona amadorari 5 mu cyumweru kuko arabigurisha kandi akanabirya we n’umugore we hamwe n’abo batunze

"Before the introduction of mushroom farming in this place, it was very tough for people in this community to survive because of the lockdowns and so forth. But when The Future of Hope [a nonprofit committed to skills empowerment] brought in mushroom growing, its changing because you can now buy something, able to go to shops and buy mielie meal [coarse flour], sugar and so forth. Even if I fall sick I can go to the hospital after selling mushrooms," he said.	Mbere yo gutangiza ubuhinzi bw'ibihumyo aho hantu, byari bigoye cyane ko abantu bo muri uyu muryango babasha gukomeza kubaho  kubera gufunga n'ibindi. Ariko haracyari ikizere cy'ejo hazaza [umuryango udaharanira inyungu wiyemeje kongerera ubumenyi] wazanye ibihingwa, hari impinduka kuko ubu ushobora kugura ikintu, ushoboye kujya mu maduka ukagura ifunguro rya mielie [ifu yuzuye], isukari n'ibindi. Nubwo narwara nshobora kujya kwivuza maze kugurisha ibihumyo .
The World Food Program says it is looking for more ideas and resources to help 550,000 people like Mushongorokwa in urban areas get basic food for survival.

Tomson Phiri, head of communications at the World Food Program, speaking from his base Geneva, said, "COVID-19 has not only wiped out lives, it has wiped out livelihoods as well. The number of people who are unable to put food on their table in Zimbabwes urban areas has increased from 30 percent during the same period in 2019 to 42 percent right now."	Tomson Phiri, ukuriye itumanaho muri gahunda y’ibiribwa ku isi,mu ijambo  yavugiye mu kigo cye i Geneve, yagize ati: "COVID-19 ntabwo yadutwaye ubuzima gusa, yanagabanije imibereho. Umubare w’abantu badashobora kubona ifunguro mu mijyi ya Zimbabwe yavuye kuri 30 ku ijana mu gihe muri 2019 bageraga  kuri 42 ku ijana. "
Zimbabwe's government says it is giving about $12 a month to families affected by lockdowns. Thats nowhere near the $500 an average family of five to seven people needs to survive each month.

South Africa's Zuma to Pursue Private Prosecution Against Prosecutor	Zuma wo muri Afrika yepfo ari gukurikirana ubushinjacyaha bwigenga.
Former South African President Jacob Zuma is pursuing private prosecution proceedings to remove the lead prosecutor in an arms deal corruption trial after failed legal challenges, his foundation said on Sunday.	Ku cyumweru, fondasiyo ye yatangaje ko uwahoze ari Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Jacob Zuma, yagiye kwikurikiranira we ubwe ubushinjacyaha kugira ngo akureho umushinjacyaha mukuru mu rubanza yagaragayemo  ruswa ahawe n'ingabo kuko yari amaze gutsindwa mu mategeko.
Last month the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) torpedoed Zuma's latest bid to have lead prosecutor Billy Downer taken off the case after accusing him of bias and leaking of confidential information to a journalist in contravention of the national prosecution act, among other complaints.	Mu kwezi gushize, Urukiko rw'Ikirenga rw'Ubujurire (SCA) rwamaganye icyifuzo cya Zuma cyo gusaba ko umushinjacyaha Billy Downer yakuraho uru rubanza nyuma yo kumushinja kubogama no guha umunyamakuru amakuru y'ibanga binyuranyije n'ibikorwa by'ubushinjacyaha, n'ibindi birego.
The SCA dismissed the application for leave to appeal on the grounds that there is no reasonable prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard.	SCA yanze gusaba uruhushya rwo kujurira kubera ko nta cyizere gifatika cyo kuba yazatsinda utubanza kandi nta yindi mpamvu ifatika yatuma ubujurire bugomba kuburanishwa.
The spokesman of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, Mzwanele Manyi told a press briefing that Zuma's instructions to his legal team to institute private prosecution "will now be put into operation in the next few days."	Umuvugizi wa Fondasiyo ya Jacob Zuma, Mzwanele Manyi yatangarije abanyamakuru ko amabwiriza ya Zuma ku itsinda yashyjzeho ryemewe n'amategeko kugira ngo rikurikirane ubushinjacyaha "ubu rizatangira imirimo yaryo mu minsi mike iri imbere."
He also said Zuma's legal team has filed a reconsideration application to the president of the SCA, a petition to hear the appeal.	Yavuze kandi ko itsinda ry’amategeko rya Zuma ryajuriye  kuri perezida wa SCA, basaba ko bakumva ubujurire bwabo.
Zuma, who was ousted from the ruling African National Congress in 2018 after nearly two decades as president, has pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in the long-running case over the $2 billion arms deal in the 1990s.	Zuma wirukanwe muri Kongere y’ibihugu Nyafurika  ari kubutegetsi kuva mu mwaka wa 2018 amaze imyaka igera kuri makumyabiri abaye perezida, yahakanye icyaha ashinjwa cya ruswa, kunyereza amafaranga n’ubujura buciye icyuho mu rubanza rumaze igihe kinini kubera amasezerano kubera  amasezerano yushe yo kwishyura miliyari 2 z'amadolari mu myaka ya za 90.
The deal case has dogged Zuma since he was sacked as deputy president of the country in 2005. He said he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.	Uru rubanza rwarakomeje kugeza ubwo  Zuma yirukanwe ku mwanya wa visi perezida w’igihugu mu 2005. Yavuze ko yahohotewe n’abacurabwenge ba politiki.
On Monday the long-delayed trail is set to get underway and Zuma will be present in court.	Ku wa mbere igihe cyo kuburana nibwo kigeze nyuma yuko Zuma yari amaze igihe kirekire ubu agiye gutangira kandi Zuma azitaba urukiko.
Manyi said Zuma, who turns 80 on Tuesday, is applying for a postponement because "it is very clear that the conditions for a fair trail are non-existent."	Manyi yavuze ko Zuma wujuje imyaka 80 ku wa kabiri, asaba ko urubanza rwasubikwa kuko "hari ibiragaragara ko ibisabwa kugira ngo ahabwe ubutabera mu rubanza"
On Monday his team will also respond to the supplementary affidavit served by the National Prosecution Authority where they seek to introduce new evidence in the trial.	Ku wa mbere, itsinda rye rizongera kwishyura igarama ry'urubanza ryatanzwe n’ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe ubushinjacyaha aho bashaka gutanga ibindi bimenyetso bishya mu rubanza.
"All His Excellency President Zuma really wants is his day in court, in a fair trial and certainly not in a forum which is being rigged by the State," Manyi said.	Manyi yagize ati: "Nyakubahwa Perezida icyo Zuma yifuza rwose ni ukwihutisha urubanza, agahabwa ubutabera kandi rwose ntabwo ari mu barwanya Leta."
	
South Africa’s Neutral Stance on Russia Risks International Ties: Analysts	Abasesenguzi bavuga ko kuba Afurika yepfo iterekana uruhande ibogamiyeho kubiri kubera mu burusiya, Bishobora guteza amakimbirane mpuzamahanga
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday defended his neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for talks — not condemnation.	Ku wa mbere, Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, yasobanuye ukutabogama kwe hagati ya Ukraine n' UBurusiya avuga ko hakwiye ibiganiro -Kurwana bikarorera..
Critics have blasted the government for failing to support Ukraine against its neighbor. Analysts say South Africa is allowing historic political and economic ties with Moscow to risk relations with the rest of the world.	Abatavugarumwe n'ubutegetsi, bamaganye guverinoma kubera ko yananiwe gushyigikira Ukraine ngo barwanye umuturanyi wayo. Abasesenguzi bavuga ko Afurika y'Epfo ishaka umubano mwiza wa politiki n'ubukungu ikaba idashaka ko Moscou yahungabanya umubano n'isi yose.
Negotiation rather than weapons or economic pressure is the mechanism Ramaphosa would like to see used to settle the Russia-Ukraine conflict.	Ashaka ko habaho Ibiganiro aho kujya mu mirwano cyangwa igitutu cy'ubukungu nibwo buryo Ramaphosa yifuza kubona bwakoreshwa mu gukemura amakimbirane y’Uburusiya na Ukraine.
Ramaphosas unwavering stance overruled an earlier call by the countrys international relations department for Russia to withdraw its forces.	Ramaphosas yamaganye yivuye inyuma icyifuzo cyari cyarashyizweho n’ishami mpuzamahanga ry’ububanyi n’amahanga mu Burusiya ryo  gukurayo ingabo.
Leaza Jernberg is a Johannesburg-based independent researcher and consultant on diplomacy.	Leaza Jernberg ni umushakashatsi wigenga ukorera i Johannesburg akaba n'umujyanama muri  diplomasi.
"The Department of International Relations and Cooperation, [which] is largely the diplomat for South Africa, their initial instinct was to say, ‘Well, this was not acceptable. And that was kind of pulled back by the president who I think has this concern about allies and Russian and what this looks like," Jernberg said. "So even within South Africa, South Africa's position is very contested, even within government."	Ishami ry’ububanyi n’amahanga n’ubutwererane, rikaba ahanini rigizwe n,aba dipolomate bo muri Afurika yepfo, icyo bashyize imbere na mbere ni uko bitari byemewe. Kandi ibyo byari byarakuweho na perezida kandi baratekereza ko byakuwe ho n'abafatanyabikorwa hamwe n'Uburusiya  ", Jernberg. ati"Ndetse no muri Afurika y'Epfo, umwanya wa Perezida  wa Afurika y'Epfo urahatanirwa cyane ndetse n'indi myanya yo muri guverinoma."
South Africas ties to Russia stretch back to the 1960s when the Soviet Union gave support to anti-apartheid freedom fighters.	Umubano w'Afurika y'Epfo n'Uburusiya watangiye mu myaka ya za 1960 igihe Leta Zunze Ubumwe z'Abasoviyeti zateraga inkunga abaharanira ubwigenge bwa apartheid.
In subsequent years, politicians, including those from the ruling party, the African National Congress, maintained close ties with Russia.	Mu myaka yakurikiyeho, abanyapolitiki, harimo n'abo mu ishyaka riri ku butegetsi, Kongere Nyafurika, bakomeje umubano wa hafi n'Uburusiya.
Which is why analysts said its no surprise that a foundation headed by former president Jacob Zuma has voiced support for Russias Vladimir Putin.	Akaba ari yo mpamvu abasesenguzi bavuze ko bidatangaje ko umusingi uyobowe n'uwahoze ari perezida Jacob Zuma wagaragaje ko ushyigikiye Russias Vladimir Putin.
Richard Calland is a public law professor at the University of Cape Town.	Richard Calland ni umwarimu wigisha amategeko muri kaminuza ya Cape Town.
"He [Putin] had a very close relationship with our former President, Jacob Zuma," Calland said. "It was a corrupt relationship. It fueled an illegal in the end, the court said, illegal procurement of Russian nuclear power, which was stopped by the courts. And I fear that that interferes at least with some political attitudes in South Africa. But I don't believe that it was the direct reason for the position that South Africa has taken."	Calland ati: "[Putin] yari afitanye umubano wa hafi n'uwahoze ari Perezida wacu, Jacob Zuma." Urukiko rwagize ruti: "Byari umubano wa ruswa. Byongereye ingufu mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko, amaherezo urukiko ruvuga ko kugura intwaro za kirimbuzi z’Uburusiya mu buryo butemewe n'amategeko, byabujijwe n’inkiko. Ati Kandi mfite ubwoba ko ibyo bibangamira imikorere ya politiki muri Afurika y'Epfo. Ati "Ariko Ntabwo nizera ko ari yo mpamvu itaziguye yatumye Afurika y'Epfo ifata. "
Instead, Calland says, South African officials are simply following the countrys standard position on foreign conflicts.	Ahubwo, Calland avuga ko abayobozi ba Afurika y'Epfo bakurikiza gusa ibihugu bisanzwe ku makimbirane yo mu mahanga.
"I'm well acquainted with and in close contact with South Africa's kind of senior diplomatic officials, and they are very steeped in this tradition of non-alignment," Calland said. "Political dialogue is their middle name, so to speak. And I think that on this one, they wanted to maintain this kind of nonpartisan position in order to promote that dialogue."	Calland ati: "Nzi neza kandi nkorana cyane n'abayobozi bakuru ba dipolomasi bo muri Afurika y'Epfo, kandi bakomereje kuri uyu muco wo kudahuza." "Ibiganiro bya politiki ni izina ryabo ryo hagati, mu buryo bw'ikigereranyo. Kandi ndatekereza ko kuri iyi, bifuzaga gukomeza imyanya nk'iyi itabogamye kugira ngo bateze imbere ibyo biganiro."
Another factor at play is the countrys position within the economic bloc, BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.	Ikindi kintu kigaragara ni umwanya w'ibihugu bigize umuryango w'ubukungu, BRICS, irimo Burezili, Uburusiya, Ubuhinde, Ubushinwa na Afrika yepfo.
Analysts said South Africa may be attempting to maintain trade relations with Russia and China.	Abasesenguzi bavuze ko Afurika y'Epfo ishobora kugerageza gukomeza umubano w'ubucuruzi n'Uburusiya n'Ubushinwa.
But international relations expert Jernberg said that stance is ultimately counterproductive.	Ariko impuguke mu mibanire mpuzamahanga Jernberg yavuze ko iyo myifatire idahwitse.
"In that case, we're actually backing the wrong horse," Jernberg said. "When you look at the EU, the European Union as a block, South Africas combined trade to the European Union is actually far larger. And so then if you're going to make an economic argument, you should surely be arguing that between the United States and between, and Europe, is actually a greater economic interest."	Jernberg ati: "Icyo gihe, mu by'ukuri twaba dushyigikiye ibintu bitari byo." "Iyo urebye Umuryango w’ubumwe bw’ibihugu by’Uburayi nk'’umudugudu, Afurika yepfo yahujije ubucuruzi n’umubano ukomeye hagati y'ibihugu by’Uburayi. Noneho rero niba ugiye kujya impaka zishingiye ku bukungu, ugomba rwose kujya impaka kubihugu bya Amerika yo hagati n'Uburayi, mu by'ukuri ifitemo inyungu nyinshi mu bukungu. "
Whatever the motives, it has left Western nations siding with Ukraine disappointed, and experts warn there could be implications for South Africa in the future.	Impamvu yaba ari yo yose, yatumye ibihugu by’iburengerazuba byshyigikiraga Ukraine biyitenguha, abahanga bavuga ko hashobora kubaho ingaruka kuri Afurika yepfo mu bihe biri imbere.

"These kinds of things down the road, become problematic," Gouws said. "If you don't display that kind of cooperation and sound thinking, and firm condemnation when a country does something like this, down the road, it bites you when you need support from the international community."	Gouws ati: "Ibintu nk'ibi mu muhanda, biba ikibazo." "Niba utagaragaje ubwo bufatanye n'ibitekerezo byumvikana, no kwamaganwa ushikamye iyo igihugu gikora ibintu nk'ibi, mu muhanda, biragorana mugihe ukeneye inkunga y'umuryango mpuzamahanga."
While the ramifications for South Africa remain uncertain, experts agree its unlikely the country will change its position any time soon.	Kubera impinduka zabaye muri Afurika y'Epfo zidashidikanywaho, abahanga bemeza ko bidashoboka ko igihugu kizahindura imibereho vuba aha.
	
Interpol Issues Red Notices for Gupta Brothers Wanted in South Africa	Interpol Itanga inzandiko zo gufata abashakishwa muri Afrika yepfo
South Africa said this week the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, has requested countries seek out and arrest Rajesh and Atul Gupta, two brothers and businessmen who allegedly bribed top officials, including former president Jacob Zuma, to gain lucrative government contracts.	Afurika y'Epfo yavuze ko kuri iki cyumweru Umuryango mpuzamahanga w'urukiko  mpanabyaha, Interpol, wasabye ibihugu gushakisha no guta muri yombi Rajesh na Atul Gupta, abavandimwe babiri n' abacuruzi bivugwa ko baha ruswa abayobozi bakuru, barimo uwahoze ari perezida Jacob Zuma, kugira ngo babone amasezerano y'inyungu kuri leta.
South African anti-corruption activists have accused the Guptas of "state capture," a term meant to describe the brothers' strong influence over former president Zuma and members of his Cabinet — influence that allegedly extended to contracts, policy and personnel choices.	Abaharanira kurwanya ruswa muri Afurika y'Epfo bashinje Guptas Gufata ibya Leta",  rikaba rigamije gusobanura uruhare rukomeye rw'abavandimwe  bahoze ari perezida Zuma ndetse n'abagize Guverinoma ye - bikaba bivugwa ko bikubiye mu masezerano, politiki no guhitamo abakozi.
While there are many allegations against the Guptas, the red notices — requests to member nations to arrest — were issued for a case involving a relatively small $1.5 million pertaining to procurement fraud.	Nubwo hari ibirego byinshi bishinja Guptas, inzandiko zo gufata abantu zisaba ibihugu bigize uyu muryango guta muri yombi abantu- byatanzwe kubera urubanza rwa miliyoni 1.5 z'amadolari yavuye mu buriganya bw'amasoko.
South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority requested the red notices last year, but Rajesh and Atul Guptas' lawyers objected. The application had to be reviewed by Interpol to make sure, among other things, that there was no political bias.	Ikigo cy’igihugu gishinzwe ubushinjacyaha muri Afurika yepfo kihanangirijwe umwaka ushize, ariko abunganizi ba Rajesh na Atul Guptas barabyanze. Gusaba byagombaga gusubirwamo na Interpol kugirango harebwe ikindi cyakorwa, ko nta kubogama mu bya  politiki kwabayeho.
Interpol's ambassador for the Turn Back Crime Campaign, Andy Mashaile, said South Africa also took time to secure an extradition treaty with the United Arab Emirates, as it's believed the brothers are in Dubai.	Ambasaderi wa Interpol mu gikorwa cyo gusubiza inyuma iperereza, Andy Mashaile, yavuze ko Afurika y'Epfo nayo yafashe igihe cyo kugirana amasezerano yo koherezwa mu mahanga na Leta zunze ubumwe z'Abarabu, kuko bizeraga ko ari abavandimwe bari i Dubai.
"You can then go to Interpol Dubai and say: 'Interpol Dubai, we know this is the place where the guys are living, this is the street name and the street number, this is how they look, these are their images. Please help us get these people in your detention center or in your cell, in jail until we are able to fetch them from Dubai,'" Mashaile said.	Ushobora noneho ubu  kujya muri Interpol Dubai ukavuga uti: 'Interpol Dubai, tuzi ko aha ariho hantu abasore batuye, iri ni izina ry'umuhanda na nimero y'umuhanda, ni uburyo basa, aya ni amashusho yabo. Nyamuneka nimumfashe dushyire abo bantu muri gereza ya hano cyangwa muri kasho ya hano  kugeza igihe tuzabasha kubavana i Dubai, 'Mashaile.
Interpol has 194 member countries and, while red notices do not compel them to execute arrests, the notices do help in tracking the whereabouts of suspects or fugitives. Their photographs are posted on all local law enforcement systems.	Interpol ifite ibihugu 194 bigize uyu muryango kandi, mugihe urwandiko rwo gufata abantu  zitabahatira guhita zibafata ,amatangazo afasha mugukurikirana aho abakekwaho icyaha cyangwa abahunze bari. Amafoto yabo ashyirwa kuri sisitemu zose zubahiriza amategeko.
Political analyst Sanusha Naidu of the Institute for Global Dialogue said the red notices could help the 2024 reelection campaign of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, because it shows he is taking action against corruption.	Umusesenguzi wa politiki Sanusha Naidu wo mu kigo gishinzwe ibiganiro ku isi yavuze ko inzandiko zo gufata abantu zushobora gufasha mu kwiyamamaza kwa 2024 kwa perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, kuko byerekana ko arimo gufata ingamba zo kurwanya ruswa.
"But I think what it also suggests is that at an international level, you know, getting the international community and, in particular, Interpol to also take a stance and align with the position that Ramaphosa has," Naidu said. "So, I think in terms of him moving forward and trying to say to the South African public, I'm doing what I have to do. I'm working around this, I'm moving the needle on this."	Naidu ati: "Ariko ntekereza ko icyo nacyo cyerekana ko ari uko ku rwego mpuzamahanga, murabizi, kubona umuryango mpuzamahanga, cyane cyane Interpol nayo igafata icyemezo igahuza n'umwanya Ramaphosa afite". "Rero, ndatekereza ko kubijyanye no gutera imbere no kugerageza kubwira abaturage ba Afrika yepfo, nkora ibyo ngomba gukora. Ndimo nkora ibishoboka byose,
However, Naidu said she's not sure it's enough to redeem the African National Congress, which has steadily been losing support at the polls because of rampant corruption and failure to deliver basic services.	Icyakora, Naidu yavuze ko atazi neza ko kuvugurura Kongere y’ibihugu Nyafurika byaba byiza, yagiye ibura ubushobozi mu matora kubera ruswa ikabije mugutanga serivisi z’ibanze.
"I think if you want to talk about what ordinary South Africans want, they want to see the judicial system take its natural course," she said. "But the question also is all the money that's been taken from the country, how does that come back? Because if you think about it, that's where part of the challenge lies."	Ati: "Ntekereza ko niba ushaka kuvuga ku byo Abanyafurika y'Epfo basanzwe bashaka, bifuza kubona inzego z'ubutabera zikurikiza uburyo busanzwe "Ariko ikibazo nacyo ni amafaranga yose yakuwe mu gihugu, ibyo bizagaruka bite? Kubera ko iyo ubitekereje, aho niho ikibazo kiri."
News of the red notices broke a day before the release of the third report from the Inquiry into State Capture. It called for the National Prosecuting Authority to investigate Zuma. The former president refused to appear before the inquiry and was jailed for 15 months after defying a court order to do so. However, he was let out on medical parole soon after.	Amakuru adasanzwe yatangajwe umunsi umwe mbere yuko hasohoka raporo ya gatatu ivuye mu iperereza ryakozwe mu gufata ibya Leta. Yasabye ikigo cy'igihugu gishinzwe ubushinjacyaha gukora iperereza kuri Zuma. Uwahoze ari perezida yanze kwitaba iperereza maze afungwa amezi 15 nyuma yo kwanga icyemezo cy'urukiko. Icyakora, yahise arekurwa by'agateganyo.
	
Analyst: Release of Corruption Report a First Step in Repairing South Africa’s Democracy	Umusesenguzi aragira ati" Gusohora Raporo ya Ruswa ni intambwe yambere yo kuzahura Demokarasi ya Afrika yepfo
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa says a scathing report by an inquiry into state graft marks "the end of an era" of corruption. But analysts say it's only the beginning of efforts needed to restore public trust in South Africa's political institutions.	Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, avuga ko raporo iteye ubwoba yakozwe n'iperereza ku nysndiko mpimbano kuri Leta "iherezo ryo kurangira kwa Ruswa. Abasesenguzi bavuga ko ari intangiriro y’ingufu zikenewe kugira ngo abaturage bagirire icyizere inzego za politiki zo muri Afurika yepfo.
For more than three years, South Africans watched the public proceedings of a national inquiry into graft under the tenure of former President Jacob Zuma.	Mu myaka irenga itatu, Abanyafurika yepfo barebeye hamwe ibikorwa by’iperereza ry’igihugu igihe cmuwahoze ari Perezida Jacob Zuma yari perezids.
Thats why its findings of systemic corruption released by Justice Raymond Zondo late Tuesday didnt come as a surprise.	Iyo ni  impamvu bitatunguranye ko Raporo yo gusubiza inyagiye muri ruswa izatunganywa ikazashyirwa ahagaragara n'ubutabera na Raymond Zondo bitarenze kuwa kabiri.
Instead, the public is waiting to see what comes next.	Ahubwo, rubanda itegereje kureba ibizakurikiraho.

"Now people want to see consequences and accountability," she said. "People are losing trust in government and in democracy, so we don't want to go to a point beyond no return. I do really think that we may be saved by a response that is going to be a proper implementation plan and action. If that doesn't happen, then I dont know, then we will not be living in a democracy."	Ati: "Ubu abantu barashaka kubona ingaruka no kubazwa ibyo bakora". "Abantu batakaza icyizere muri guverinoma no muri demokarasi, ku buryo tudashaka kujya ahantu tutazagaruka.  Ndatekereza rwose ko dushobora gukizwa n'igisubizo kigiye gutangwa mukubahiriza gahunda n'ibikorwa bikwiye. Niba ibyo bitabaye, sinzi rero, ntabwo tuzaba turi muri demokarasi. "
She says public trust in government has been on the decline since 2009 — coinciding with Zumas time in office.	Avuga ko icyizere rusange cya leta cyagabanutse kuva mu 2009 -Uhereye ku butegetsi bwa Zuma 
The new report focused on corrupt contract tenders and political kickbacks in relation to South African Airways, the state revenue agency and public procurement.	Raporo nshya yibanze ku itangwa ry'amasoko harimo  ruswa hamwe no gusubira inyuma mu bya politiki bijyanye na South African Airways, ikigo cya Leta gishinzwe itangwa ry'amasoki.
It recommended prosecution against former high-ranking lawmakers and their public and private sector affiliates.	Yasabye ko hakurikiranwa abahoze ari abadepite bo mu nzego zo hejuru ndetse n’ibigo  bya Leta n’abikorera.
But charges may not come swiftly.	Ariko ibirego ntibishobora kuza vuba.
Olwethu Majola, a lawyer and doctoral candidate in criminology at the University of Cape Town, says further investigations need to take place.	Olwethu Majola, umunyamategeko akaba n'umunyeshuri w'umu  Dogiteri muri criminology muri kaminuza ya Cape Town, avuga ko hagomba gukorwa iperereza rindi.
"We're going to see law enforcement, such as the police or special investigative unit, conducting their own investigations based on the preliminary commission. Depending on how far or how long it takes for investigations to be concluded, perhaps within, you know, two years, we can see charges being brought against individuals," she said.	Tugiye kubona abashinzwe kubahiriza amategeko, nk'abapolisi cyangwa ishami rishinzwe iperereza ryihariye, bakore iperereza ryabo bashingiye kuryo  komisiyo ibanza yakoze. Ukurikije igihe cyangwa igihe bifata kugira ngo iperereza rirangire, wenda rizafata imyaka ibiri mbere,  dushobora kubona ibirego biregwamo  abantu ku giti cyabo .
Majola says the former president will be among those to face prosecution.	Majola avuga ko uwahoze ari perezida azaba mu bazakurikiranwa.
Zuma was already found guilty of contempt of court last year for failing to appear before the inquiry. He has long denied any wrongdoing and called the inquiry biased.	Zuma yari amaze guhamwa n'icyaha cyo gusuzugura urukiko umwaka ushize kubera ko atitabye mbere iperereza. Kuva kera yahakanye amakosa yose kandi avugaga ko  iperereza ribogama
Zuma maintains a loyal following of supporters who dont want to see the former leader imprisoned.	Zuma arashimagiza abayoboke b'indahemuka badashaka kubona uwahoze ari umuyobozi afunzwe.
In addition to consequences, the inquiry has also made recommendations to prevent state graft, including the formation of an independent corruption agency.	Usibye ingaruka, iperereza ryanatanze ibyifuzo byo gukumira ruswa, harimo no gushinga ikigo cyigenga cya ruswa.

"The key question is political interference," she said. "How do you create a body that is so independent? How do you fund such a body? Which is very difficult. I think these are the struggles that a lot of the anti-corruption, that is faced globally — is how do you maintain independence? And who do they answer to?"	Ati: "Ikibazo cy'ingenzi ni ukwivanga muri politiki." "Nigute ushobora kurema umutwe wigenga? Nigute utera inkunga umutwe nk'uwo? Biragoye cyane. Ntekereza ko izo ari zo ntambara nyinshi zo kurwanya ruswa isi yose ihura nazo- ni gute ukomeza ubwigenge? Kandi ni  bande basubiza?"
The public still has months to wait for any government action. Two more reports from the inquiry will be released in the coming weeks.	Abaturage baracyafite amezi yo gutegereza ibikorwa bya leta. Andi mashya avuye mu iperereza azashyirwa ahagaragara mu byumweru biri imbere.
President Cyril Ramaphosa will then deliver the full report to parliament by the end of June before implementing its recommendations.	Perezida Cyril Ramaphosa azashyikiriza inteko ishinga amategeko raporo yuzuye mu mpera za Kamena mbere yo gushyira mu bikorwa ibyifuzo byayo.

As Tutu Turns 90, S.Africa fetes, but Misses Anti-Apartheid Icon's Voice	Tutu yujuje amaze imyaka 90, ari S.Africa aho avuka,  ariko akabura Ijwi rya Anti-Apartheid
As Desmond Tutu turns 90 on Thursday, he remains indisputably the moral voice of South Africa. But age is catching up with him.	Ku wa kane, ubwo Desmond Tutu yujuje imyaka 90, akomeza kuba ijwi rya rubanda ryamagana Aparteid muri  Afurika y'Epfo. Ariko imyaka agera aho arasaza
The jovial emeritus archbishop retired in 2010 and rarely speaks in public, in a country that sometimes feels adrift without the leadership of its anti-apartheid liberation icons.	Arkiyepiskopi wa jovial emeritus yagiye mu kiruhuko cy'izabukuru mu mwaka wa 2010 kandi ni gake avugira mu ruhame, mu gihugu rimwe na rimwe cyumvikana nta buyobozi  bugaragaragaza ko igihugu kibohoye.
Even though South Africa has eased its COVID-19 precautions, the birthday festivities will be muted and largely online.	Nubwo Afrika yepfo yoroheje ingamba zo kwirinda COVID-19, ibirori byo kwizihiza isabukuru bizimurwa .
Renowned for his radiating energy and infectious laughter, Tutu is expected to attend a special service Thursday at St George's Cathedral, where he once held the pulpit as South Africa's first black Anglican archbishop.	Azwiho kuba afite imbaraga zo gusetsa cyane, biteganijwe ko Tutu azitabira ibirori bidasanzwe kuri Katedrali ya St George, aho yigeze gufata mimbari nka musenyeri mukuru wa mbere w’abirabura bo muri Afurika yepfo.
Later that day, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation will host an online lecture by the Dalai Lama, Ireland's former president Mary Robinson, rights activist Graca Machel and South Africa's ex-ombudswoman Thuli Madonsela, respected for her courageous exposure of corruption.	Nyuma y'uwo munsi, Fondasiyo ya Desmond na Leah Tutu izumva  ikiganiro inyuze kuri interineti cyatanzwe na Dalai Lama, uwahoze ari perezida wa Irilande, Mary Robinson, uharanira uburenganzira bwa muntu Graca Machel ndetse n'uwahoze ari umuvunyi wa Afurika y'Epfo, Thuli Madonsela, bubahwa kubera ubutwari bagaragaje bwo kurwanya  ruswa.
The line-up of speakers is a reminder of Tutu's values, surrounding himself with rights advocates at a time when South Africa's current leaders are better known for lavish lifestyles and billion-dollar bank accounts.	Mu kumwibuka,  afite indangagaciro, aharanira uburenganzira mu gihe abayobozi ba Afurika y'Epfo bo bazwiho kwita ku mibereho myiza yabo ndetse na konti zabo zikaba zuzuyeho amadorari.
An online auction of his memorabilia last month raised $237,000 for the foundation named after him and Leah, his wife of 66 years.	Cyamunara yabaye  mu kwezi gushize yakusanyije $ 237,000 kumuryango wamwitiriwe na Leah, umugore we wimyaka 66.
The last time Tutu himself was seen in public was in May, when he and Leah went to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations.	Ubwo aheruka,Tutu ubwe yagaragaye kumugaragaro muri Gicurasi, ubwo we na Leah bari bagiye kwakira inkingo za COVID-19.
He smiled and waved from a wheelchair outside a hospital, but didn't speak to journalists waiting outside — a far cry from the buoyant personality who captivated the world with his strident opposition to apartheid, which won him a Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.	Yaramwenyuye kandi yizunguriza mu kagare k'abamugaye hanze inyuma y'ibitaro, ariko ntago yavugishije  abanyamakuru nubwo bari  bamutegereje hanze - Ni'umuntu wishimaga wagaruye isi kubera ko yarwanyaga ivanguramoko, ibyo byamuhesheje igihembo cyitiriwe Nobel mu 1984.
Rainbow nation'	Igihugu cyiza gifite ubudasa
Knowing him now as a towering figure on the world stage, it's hard to remember that when he returned from his studies in Britain in the 1960s, he was subjected to the same humiliations as any other black South African.	Kumenya ubu nkumuntu ukomeye cyane kurwego rw'isi, biragoye kwibuka ko ubwo yagarukaga avuye kwiga mu Bwongereza mu myaka ya za 1960, yarasuzuguwe nk’abandi Banyafrika yepfo kuko ari abirabura.
His daughter Mpho Tutu-van Furth, with whom he has authored two books, remembers driving cross-country with her family to bring her siblings to boarding school.	Umukobwa we Mpho Tutu-van Furth, akaba yaranditse ibitabo bibiri, yakundaga gutwara imodoka agatembera igihugu n'umuryango we akajya no kuzana  barumuna be ku ishuri.
"I have a memory of stopping at a place along the way, and my dad going into the store to go and buy ice cream for us, because it was just sticky hot," Tutu-van Furth told AFP.	Tutu-van Furth yabwiye ibiro ntaramakuru by'Abafaransa ati: "Ndibuka  Data yansize mpagaze ahantu, akajya mu iduka kugira ngo ajye kutugurira ice cream, icyo gihe byari bishyushye".
"And the person saying to him that they don't serve kaffirs inside the shop, that you have to go around to the window. And my dad just kind of slammed out of there.	Kandi umuntu umubwira ko badakorera kafiri mu iduka, ko ugomba kuzenguruka mu idirishya. Kandi papa yahise yikubita hasi"
Kaffir is South Africa's worst racial slur, and the utterance today can lead to criminal charges.	Kaffir ni Afurika yepfo itesha agaciro amoko, kandi imvugo uyumunsi irashobora gushinja ibyaha.
He eventually grew his leadership in the Anglican Church, creating a path towards reconciliation. He coined the term "rainbow nation", and deeply believed that the South African experiment could show the world a new way to overcome conflicts.	Amaherezo yaje gukura ubuyobozi bwe mu Itorero Anglican, ashyiraho inzira y'ubwiyunge. Yahimbye ijambo "igihugu cy'umukororombya", kandi yizera cyane ko igeragezwa rya Afurika y'Epfo rishobora kwereka isi inzira nshya yo gutsinda amakimbirane.
His ideas of forgiveness have fallen out of favor with some younger South Africans, who feel that black people surrendered too much in the transition to democracy, without holding apartheid criminals to account.	Igitekerezo cye cyo gutanga imbabazi ntikishimiwe na bamwe mu ru byiruko rwo muri Afurika y'Epfo, bumva ko abirabura bitanze cyane mu gihe cya demokarasi, bityo batagomba gukurkkiranwa kubyaha bya apartheid.
What endeared Tutu to the nation was that he didn't stop speaking out after democracy arrived.	Icyateraga Tutu impungenge ni uko  ataretse kuvuga nyuma ya demokarasi
He confronted homophobia in the Anglican Church, challenged Nelson Mandela over generous salaries for Cabinet ministers and stridently criticized the endemic corruption that mushroomed under ex-president Jacob Zuma.	Yahanganye n'abarysmana bahuje ibitsina mu Itorero ry’Abangilikani, yamagana Nelson Mandela kubera umushahara utangwa ku baminisitiri kandi anenga byimazeyo ruswa ikabije yayobowe n’uwahoze ari perezida Jacob Zuma.
"He played such a unique role," said William Gumede, of the Democracy Works Foundation. "We were fortunate during the transition that we had him and we had Mandela, these two statesmen who were moral leaders."	William Gumede wo muri Fondasiyo ya Demokarasi, yagize ati: "Yabigizemo uruhare rudasanzwe." "Twagize amahirwe mu gihe cy'inzibacyuho ko tumufite kandi dufite Mandela, aba banyapolitiki bombi bari abayobozi b'imyitwarire myiza
But that era is over.	Ariko icyo gihe cyararangiye.
"We're entering a period where we're not going to have those really big moral leaders," Gumede said. "So how do we build the society that we want?"	Gumede ati: "Twinjiye mu gihe tutazagira abo bayobozi bakomeye rwose." "None twakubaka dute umuryango dushaka?"
South Africa Floods Could Hurt China Trade	Afurika y'Epfo Umwuzure ushobora guhungabanya ubucuruzi bw'Ubushinwa
Some of the worst flooding in South Africas history has left more than 400 people dead and some 40,000 displaced, dealing a devastating blow to the eastern city of Durban, which has a seaport that has also been badly affected.	Imwe mu myuzure ikabije yabayeho mu mateka ya Afurika y'Epfo yahitanye abantu barenga 400 abandi bagera ku 40.000 bavanywe mu byabo, bikaba byibasiye umujyi wa Durban wo mu burasirazuba, ufite icyambu nacyo cyagizweho ingaruka mbi.
With the port not fully functioning, there are supply chain concerns and China — South Africas biggest trading partner — and other nations, are likely to see their imports and exports disrupted.	Kubera ko icyambu kidakora neza, hari impungenge z’ibicuruzwa kandi Ubushinwa - Afurika yepfo ni abafatanyabikorwa bakomeye mu bucuruzi - ndetse n’ibindi bihugu, birashoboka ko ibyoherezwa mu mahanga byahungabana.
Earlier this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster because of the flooding — which he blames on climate change but which some critics blame on poor infrastructure and the fact that most of the people affected were living in makeshift shacks in informal settlements.	Mu ntangiriro z'iki cyumweru, Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, yatangaje ko igihugu kirimo ibiza biterwa n’umwuzure - we avuga ko ari  imihindagurikire y’ikirere ariko bamwe mu bamunegura bavuga ko ari ibikorwa remezo bidakomeye ndetse n’uko benshi mu baturage bibasiwe ari ababaga mu nkambi mu buryo butemewe bwo gutura.
Ramaphosa stressed the importance of quickly fixing the situation at the port, saying, "The Port of Durban — which is one of the largest and busiest shipping terminals on the continent and which is vital to our countrys economy — has been severely affected."	Ramaphosa yashimangiye akamaro ko gutunganya vuba icyo cyambu, agira ati: "Icyambu cya Durban - Ni kimwe mu bintu bikomeye kandi gikoreshwa n'abantu benshi ku mugabane wa Afurika kandi kikaba ari ingenzi cyane mu bukungu bw'igihugu cyacu - cyagize ingaruka zikomeye."
The road to the port, which handles some 13,000 heavy vehicles a day, has been severely damaged, he added.	Yongeyeho ko umuhanda ujya ku cyambu utwara imodoka zigera ku 13.000 ku munsi, wangiritse cyane.
On Tuesday, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan Pravin Gordhan visited the port, which has reopened, and concluded it would take more a week to clear some backlogs. The rail network to the site had been affected by landslides and still needs to be repaired, he said, adding that 9,000 containers have accumulated at the port and would be cleared in the next nine days.	Ku wa kabiri, Minisitiri w’ibigo bya Leta, Pravin Gordhan, Pravin Gordhan, yasuye icyambu cyongeye gufungura, avuga ko bizatwara icyumweru kugira ngo bakureho igihombo cyateje. Umuyoboro wa gari ya moshi ujya aho hantu wari wibasiwe n'inkangu kandi n'ubu uracyakeneye gusanwa, akomeza avuga ko kontineri 9000 zegeranije ku cyambu kandi ko zizahakurwa mu minsi icyenda iri imbere.
Logs and debris also ended up in the harbor due to the floods, which he said had disrupted shipping.	Ibiti n'imyanda nabyo byageze ku cyambu kubera umwuzure, yavuze ko byahagaritse ubwikorezi.
One of the countries likely to be affected by problems at the port is China, said Cobus van Staden, senior China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs.	Cobus van Staden, umushakashatsi mukuru mu Bushinwa na Afurika mu kigo cy’ububanyi n’amahanga cya Afurika yepfo, yatangaje ko kimwe mu bihugu bishobora guhura n’ibibazo biri kuri icyo cyambu ari Ubushinwa.
"In relation to the situation in Durban, its very serious for the whole of China-Africa trade, rather than just for South Africa; this is because of the centrality of Durban port to Chinese exports," he told VOA.	Yatangarije VOA agira ati: "Ku bijyanye n'ibibera i Durban, birakomeye cyane ku bucuruzi bwose bw'Ubushinwa na Afurika, aho kuba Afurika y'Epfo gusa; ibi biterwa n'icyambu cya Durban cyohereza ibicuruzwa mu Bushinwa."
"About 20 percent of total China-Africa trade goes out through Durban and this includes resources like cobalt, copper and lithium coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe particularly," he added.	Yongeye ati: "Hafi 20 ku ijana by'ubucuruzi bwose bw'Ubushinwa na Afurika buva muri Durban kandi hanyura umutungo kamere nka cobalt, umuringa na lithium biva muri Repubulika Iharanira Demokarasi ya Kongo na Zimbabwe."
Maersk, the worlds biggest container line, halted operations at the port last week and told VOA by email its warehouse had been affected and was still not operational. While vessel operations had resumed, the company said problems with road access were affecting all cargo entering or leaving the terminal.	Maersk, umuyoboro munini wa kontineri ku isi, wahagaritse ibikorwa ku cyambu mu cyumweru gishize maze ubwira VOA kuri imeri ko ububiko bwawo bwagizweho ingaruka kandi ko butari bwasanwa. Mu gihe ibikorwa by'ubwato byari byongeye gusubukurwa, isosiyete yavuze ko ibibazo byo kubona umuhanda bigira akamaro kubwikorezi bw'imizigo yose yinjira cyangwa isohoka.
"We continue to assess the damages and monitor the situation as it evolves, customers are being updated daily on the progress and the contingency plans so that we may get the supply chains moving again as quickly as possible," it said.	Baragira bati: "Tuzakomeza gusuzuma ibyangiritse no gukurikirana uko ibintu bigenda byiyongera, abakiriya bagenda bavugururwa buri munsi aho bigeze ndetse na gahunda zihutirwa kugira ngo tubone uburyo bwo kongera kugemura vuba bishoboka".
Wandile Sihlobo, chief economist for the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, told VOA he thought it would take some time before activities at the port were back to normal.	Wandile Sihlobo, impuguke mu by'ubukungu mu rugaga rw’ubucuruzi rw’ubuhinzi muri Afurika yepfo, yabwiye Ijwi rya Amerika ko yatekereje ko bizatwara igihe mbere yuko ibikorwa byo ku cyambu bisubira mu buryo.
"Theres been great devastation by these excessive rains and its a major risk to commerce and all goods: automobile, agriculture and other sectors of the economy that are dependent on trade," he said.	Ati: "Theres yangijwe cyane n'iyi mvura ikabije kandi yagezweho n'ingaruka zikomeye ku bucuruzi n'ibicuruzwa byose: imodoka, ubuhinzi n'izindi nzego z'ubukungu bushingiye ku bucuruzi".
	
South Africa Declares National Disaster After Deadly Floods	Afurika y'Epfo yatangaje ibiza bizatera igihugu harimo n'umwuzure wica
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster late Monday following deadly floods in the country's eastern KwaZulu-Natal province. Record floods have left more than 440 people dead, an estimated 40,000 people homeless and damaged critical infrastructure and hundreds of schools.	Perezida wa Afurika y'Epfo, Cyril Ramaphosa, yatangaje ko habaye impanuka nyuma y’umwuzure mu ntara ya KwaZulu-Natal. Umwuzure  wahitanye abantu barenga 440, abagera ku 40.000 batagira aho baba kandi wangiza ibikorwa remezo bikomeye ndetse n’amashuri menshi
The declaration is expected to speed up much-needed aid to the flood-hit area in a crisis that comes just two weeks after South Africa lifted its disaster declaration for the coronavirus pandemic.	Biteganijwe ko iri tangazo ryihutishwa kuko hari imfashanyo zikenewe mu Karere kibasiwe n’umwuzure  nyuma y'ibyumweru bibiri gusa Afurika y'Epfo itangaje ko ivuye muri Guma murugo yatewe n' icyorezo cya coronavirus.
The national government is immediately directing $68 million to clean up what officials have called catastrophic flooding that has left people homeless and without water or electricity.	Guverinoma y'igihugu yahuse itegeka ko hatangwa miliyoni 68 z'amadolari kugira ngo itunganye icyo abayobozi bise umwuzure w’ibiza watumye abantu babura aho baba kandi nta mazi cyangwa amashanyarazi bafite.
Imtiaz Sooliman, head of the charity Gift of the Givers, described the organizations work to distribute aid since the floods hit last week.	Imtiaz Sooliman, ukuriye umuryango utabara imbabare , yasobanuye ko uwo muryango ukora  mu gutanga imfashanyo kuva umwuzure waba mu cyumweru gishize.
"Were getting the job done," Sooliman said. "We're getting delivery done. Hot meals, hygiene packs, sanitary pads, diapers, and blankets and mattresses and water."	Sooliman ati: "Bakoraga akazi." "Turimo gutanga ibyo kurya. Amafunguro ashyushye, udupfunyika tw'ibikoresho by'isuku, udukariso, isabune, ibiringiti na matelas n'amazi."
Sooliman said there was a need for water in the areas because water pipes had washed away.	Sooliman yavuze ko muri ako gace hakenewe amazi kubera ko imiyoboro y'amazi yari imaze kwangirika.
"We tried to get as much water to as many people as possible," Sooliman said.	Sooliman ati: "Twagerageje kugeza amazi menshi ku bantu benshi bashoboka."
While the city of Durban and the surrounding province of KwaZulu-Natal was the worst hit, other provinces like the Eastern Cape also saw flooding and deaths.	Mu gihe umujyi wa Durban n'intara ikikije KwaZulu-Natal wibasiwe cyane, izindi ntara nka Cape y'Iburasirazuba nazo zagezweho n'umwuzure ndetse n'abantu bapfuye.
Officials are still quantifying the damage to critical infrastructure like the Durban Port, highways and telecommunications.	Abayobozi baracyakusanya ibyangiritse ku bikorwa remezo bikomeye nka Port ya Durban, umuhanda munini n’itumanaho.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs who is leading the response, told a media briefing Tuesday the scale of the disaster requires a national response.	Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, minisitiri w’imiyoborere y’amakoperative n’ibikorwa gakondo uri kuruhembe rwo gushaka ibisubizo,, yatangarije abanyamakuru ko ku wa Kabiri ko urwego cy’igihugu ruzatanga igisubizo.
"In a way it gives hope and also is a vessel for coordination and rallying the entire nation, the entire government and also the international support," Dlamini-Zuma said.	Dlamini-Zuma ati: "Mu buryo bwo gutanga ikuzere nkinzira yo guhuriza hamwe abanyagihugu, guverinoma yose yasabye inkunga mpuzamahanga."
Climate change was highlighted as a cause of the floodings severity. But poor infrastructure and city planning — with many informal settlements located in vulnerable low-lying areas — was another factor.	Imihindagurikire y’ibihe yagaragaye nk'impamvu y’imyuzure ikabije. Ariko ibikorwa remezo bidahwitse hamwe n'igishushanyo mbonera cy'umujyi - hamwe n'abantu benshi batuye ahantu hatuwe cyane 
Dlamini-Zuma said while the disaster brought a great deal of sorrow, it also poses an opportunity.	Dlamini-Zuma yavuze ko ibiza byateje umubabaro mwinshi.
"We should be building back better," Dlamini-Zuma said. "Nobody should build back in the riverbanks and in floodplains but also in some of the areas that are geographically not right for residential areas."	Dlamini-Zuma ati: "Tugomba kubaka neza ku rushaho." "Nta muntu ukwiye kongera kubaka mu nkombe z'umugezi no mu kibaya aho umwuzure ugera ahubwo hari uturere tumwe na tumwe tutari dukwiye guturwamo"
But people living in the worst-hit communities, particularly informal settlements in low-lying areas, say they doubt promises of better housing will be kept.	Ariko abantu batuye mu gace  kibasiwe cyane, ntibemerewe gutura mu buryo butemewe, mu bibaya, bavuga ko bafite impungenge ku masezerano y’imiturire myiza ntibazi ko  izubahirizwa.
The settlement called Mega Village in south Durban had been hit by floods in 2017 and 2019. Cosmos Khanyeza, a community volunteer, helped victims in the earlier floods and last weeks.	Umudugudu witwa Mega uri mu majyepfo ya Durban wari wibasiwe n’umwuzure muri 2017 na 2019. Cosmos Khanyeza, umukorerabushake w’abaturage, yafashije abahohotewe n’umwuzure wabanje ndetse mu byumweru bishize.
"Those people are looking at the proper way to be away from that river so that they won't become victims again," he said. "Those people from 2019 floods didn't get any help. They were just in their transition camp houses. There was a budget for them but they never even seen a cent of that budget."	Ati: "Abo bantu barimo kureba inzira iboneye yo gutura kure y'uruzi kugira ngo batazongera kuba ibitambo". "Abo bantu kuva haba mwuzure muri  2019 nta mfashanyo babonye. Bari mu nkambi. Hari ingengo y’imari kuri bo ariko ntibigeze babona n'ijana ry'ingengo y'imari."
Khanyeza said most people cant afford to rebuild, let alone look for safer areas to erect a new metal shack.	Khanyeza yavuze ko abantu benshi badashobora kwiyubaka, kereka niba dushakisha ahantu hizewe kugira ngo hubakwe amazu mashya.
For now, he said, foam mattresses and blankets were delivered by the government Monday so victims can sleep more comfortably at a temporary shelter in a community hall.	Ubu, yavuze ko matelas n’ibiringiti byatanzwe na guverinoma ku wa mbere kugira ngo abavanywe mu byabo basinzire neza mu buhungiro bw’agateganyo.
Sooliman, who leads Gift of the Givers, said recovering the dead and basic humanitarian needs remain the focus before larger infrastructure can be considered.	Sooliman uyobora ibijyanye n'imfashanyo zitangwa,  yavuze ko kugarura abantu mubuzima busanzwe n'ibikorwa by'ibanze by'ubutabazi ari byo bikomeje kwibandwaho mbere y'ibikorwa remezo binini.
"People have lost everything, all their material values," Sooliman said. "So basically the funding is, right off, the simple stuff. And then of course you repair the schools and the hospitals."	Sooliman ati: "Abantu babuze byose, indangagaciro zabo zose." "Muri rusange rero. Inkunga yabo irihutirwa. Hanyuma birumvikana nyuma hazaza gusana amashuri n'ibitaro."
Officials said the port of Durban, the busiest in southern Africa, has been severely disrupted by the weather but will be cleared and operational again in the next six days. Other timelines for rebuilding roads and repairing more than 600 schools have yet to be announced.	Abayobozi bavuze ko icyambu cya Durban gikoreshwa n' abantu benshi cyane muri Afurika yepfo, cyahungabanijwe cyane n’ikirere ariko kikazasukurwa kandi kizongera gukora mu minsi itandatu iri imbere. Ikindi gihe byo kubaka imihanda no gusana amashuri arenga 600 ntibiratangazwa.
Officials said the overall disaster declaration is expected to remain in place for three months to provide enough time and resources to rebuild.	Abayobozi bavuze ko muri rusange iteganyagihe kubijyanye  n'ibiza riteganijwe mu mezi atatu kugira ngo ritange igihe gihagije abantu bitegure mu by'ubukungu .
